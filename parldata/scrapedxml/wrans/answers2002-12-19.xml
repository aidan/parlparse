For specific scenario exercising and training, such as those around chemical plants, civil nuclear power stations and major transport arrangements (by rail, sea and air), scenario-based multi-agency exercises are regularly carried out (often as a requirement under licensing regulations).

	<p pid=".894W.3/1">In 2000&ndash;01 (the latest year for which published figures are available) procurement expenditure was estimated to be #10,408 million (Table 1.7 UK Defence Statistics, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House, refers). Of this approximately #2,800 million was for the sum of associated costs, intramural research and development spending, overseas equipment expenditure and unrecoverable VAT. The balance, which represents estimated equipment expenditure with United Kingdom industry and commerce, is some #7,600 million. It is not possible to provide a regional breakdown from data available. All of these figures exclude Ministry of Defence non-equipment expenditure on items such as fuel, utilities and some support activities.</p>

This risk assessment considers the hazard to the general public if they should enter a byelawed training area or range in error or with intent.

	<p pid=".898W.0/1">The Department has now completed putting in place a fairly complex project and risk management framework to allow us to commit substantial UK funding to assist Russia in particular through our Former Soviet Union Nuclear Legacy Programme. The budget for this programme is some #32 million next year and is expected to run at least this level for the foreseeable future. The programme covers a wide range of nuclear legacy issues including supporting work on weapons plutonium disposition, closed nuclear cities, nuclear safety technical assistance, nuclear security projects, social consequences projects and contributing funding to multilateral projects on decommissioning and the Chernobyl Shelter.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.0/2">A number of important projects have already been identified and the means of delivery is now in place to assist in tackling the nuclear legacy in NW Russia an area where we expect up to a third of our funding to be focused over the next few years. UK grant-aid funding for work to provide for the safe management of spent nuclear fuel stocks and for dismantling decommissioned nuclear submarines is therefore ready to flow now. However, before this funding can commence with actual projects on the ground, a suitable legal framework must be agreed with Russia to cover important issues such as third part liability, taxation and access. Hopefully, and after some delay, we are in the final stages of concluding just such a bilateral agreement under which substantive project work will begin. A similar multilateral agreement is also, again hopefully, in its final stages and will provide the mechanism for substantial multilateral assistance. I would emphasise however that the delay in signing the bilateral agreement has not delayed the preparation of projects and a number will be ready to go as soon as the agreement is in place next year.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.0/3">The nuclear legacy in NW Russia, as represented by the 100 or so decommissioned nuclear submarines and their associated spent fuel and waste, is such that it is only by active bilateral and multilateral funding that they can be tackled quickly and safely. The UK is playing a leading role in ensuring co-operation and coordination with Russia and between the various donor countries in order that this funding is effective.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.0/4">Attending the Baltic Conference of Energy Ministers in Vilnius, Lithuania in November, I committed #700,000 to purchase and install physical protection equipment for two Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers. During this visit I also met with representatives of the UK industry actively involved in planning for the decommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power station and ameliorating the social consequences of nuclear power plant closure. UK companies have vast experience in these areas and through our social consequences work, we are supporting a number of regeneration and economic projects in Lithuania and Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.0/5">We will be publishing the first annual report about progress in establishing this programme early next year and further details of specific projects and the programme will be made available on the DTI web site.</p>

Although we are only aware of a limited number of incidents and millions of girls are going back to school, this is a worrying signal of the threat to the equal status of women and girls in Afghanistan. This must be addressed through a comprehensive effort to improve gender equality.

We discussed the factors affecting girls returning to school as well as the wider issue of women's rights.</p>

If the US Government wishes, this could include the US Millennium Challenge Account. The Government's view is that an increased share of development assistance should go to the countries in which aid is used most effectively, i.e. countries with high levels of poverty and a good policy environment, and be delivered through development agencies which share a commitment to the improved management of aid. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I and our respective Departments are working closely together on this proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".903W.6/1">My Department is focused on improving health and education services for the poor and favours policies that achieve this objective. We do, however, recognise the importance of the private sector in delivering services to the poor. For example, 50&ndash;80 per cent. of all health care expenditures in developing countries are through the private sector. In parallel to our work to strengthen public sector health systems, DFID support to private sector providers seeks to increase access to high quality health services for the poor. Examples of interventions include support to social marketing of condoms and contraceptives and bed nets to prevent malaria.</p>

	<p pid=".904W.2/1">UNDP has been active in the field of information communication technology (ICT) since 1993 in close to 90 countries through a combination of global, regional and national programmes. In the initial phases of its work, UNDP's focus was largely on creating awareness, building capacity, and supporting ICT for development at the community and national level. The focus has now widened following discussions with UNDP's Executive Board in June 2001. UNDP now includes assisting countries with ICT for development policies, the formulation and implementation of prioritised national e-development strategies. Other programme initiatives which signify further progress are that of ICT to enhance democratic governance (e-governance), economic and social development (for example, micro finance, e-business, ICT to support local development) at local and national levels.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/2"><i>Bolivia</i> We have allocated some #10 million for our total bilateral development assistance programme for 2002&ndash;03 in Bolivia. Additionally, Bolivia will benefit from DFID funds contributed to multilateral organisations such as the World bank and IADB, through grants to civil society organisations. The EC is providing #80.7 million for 2002&ndash;06, of which DFID's share is around 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/3">We have now moved away from supporting discrete bilateral projects to support for government-led policy reforms within the context of the Bolivian poverty reduction strategy, concentrating on adding value to the international community's support to Bolivia's development effort. We are focusing our support in two areas&mdash;the integration of economic and social policy, recognising the key role of the informal economy for poor people's livelihoods, and enhancing social inclusion and participation in political processes within a more accountable and transparent institutional framework.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/4"><i>India</i> DFID has allocated #230 million of development assistance to India in financial year 2002&ndash;03. The EC is providing #17.9 million in 2002&ndash;03, of which DFID's share is around 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/5">Our development programme in India, where on in three of the world's poor live, is aimed at helping Government, at both national and state level, to deliver pro-poor policies and services. We are working closely with four partner states committed to poverty reduction, including on their programmes of fiscal and public service reform.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/6">We are also working on increasing access to basic health, education, and water and sanitation services for the poor, on promoting better management of the natural and physical environment, and on promoting greater empowerment of the poor, especially women and the marginalised.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/7"><i>Pakistan</i> DFID has allocated #60 million of development assistance to Pakistan in financial year 2002&ndash;03, of which #40 million is financial aid. #105.7 million is being provided by the EC for 2002&ndash;06, again with DFID's share being around 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/8">We are committed to supporting Pakistan's economic and social development for the long haul. The ultimate aim is the reduction of poverty as set out in the Government of Pakistan's interim poverty reduction strategy paper.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/9">DFID's bilateral programme is focused on three objectives: creating the economic conditions for poverty reduction; improving health outcomes for poor people and improving education outcomes for poor people.</p>

	<p pid=".908W.6/1">My Department works with developing countries to ensure that their poverty reduction strategies reflect the need to manage environmental resources, including agricultural production, sustainably. Sustainability must be seen in its widest context. It is not just a matter of the ecology of agricultural systems themselves, but the impact of these systems on the lives and opportunities of others, particularly poor consumers and producers. Sustainability in one system cannot be at the expense of sustainability in others.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.6/2">My Department also supports a significant number of programmes and projects throughout the developing world that seek to provide direct benefits to poor people whose livelihoods are dependent on agriculture. Many of these include the provision of support to sustainable agriculture, either through training and knowledge/technology transfer, institutional capacity building and reform (e.g. strengthening co-operatives and other forms of producer groups and improving agricultural service delivery) or the funding of research, both national and international.</p>

While sustainability is a cornerstone for all our research programmes, a significant proportion of the programme is focused on developing and transferring technologies specifically for sustainable agriculture.</p>

In addition, we provide technical assistance to the Utility Reform Unit, which is leading the urban water reform programme. We have recently commissioned a review of lessons learned from private sector participation in the water sector, with the view to considering further support for assessing the social impact of new policies.</p>

	<p pid=".911W.14/1">It is now unlikely that there will be breaks in the food pipelines to either country during December, although the situation remains fragile. For Zimbabwe, against a target distribution of 50,000MT of maize for 4.5 million beneficiaries in 44 districts, the realistic distribution figure may be as low as 20,000MT. In order to allow for this shortage, WFP has introduced two ration scales: (i) 5Kg of maize will be distributed to families in districts that have been receiving food aid on a regular basis; and (ii) 10Kg of maize will be distributed to families in areas that have not received food aid thus far. All families will receive 1Kg of CSB and 1Kg of pulses. For Zambia, DFID has helped strengthen the WFP pipeline with a unique agreement between the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) and WFP. This involves distributing 23,000MT of GRZ purchased maize through the WFP pipeline with transportation costs being met by DFID. This will ensure a full maize pipeline for Zambia during December.</p>

While some of the elements of the DEFRA plan such as the compendium of standards will apply on a UK basis, the targets will not apply to Scotland. Scottish Executive Ministers have appointed an Organic Stakeholder Group to deliver an action plan with recommendations for future executive support for the organic sector in Scotland. The Group will consider a wide range of issues including future executive support for organic conversion, development of the organic food chain, research priorities and organic standards and certification. The group is due to report in January 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".916W.5/1">It has not been possible to divide Belfast into areas corresponding to parliamentary constituencies. However, for Education and Library Board controlled and voluntary youth projects an attempt has been made to define the boundaries that are currently considered North, South, East and West within the Belfast Youth Service. The position in respect of 2002&ndash;03 for youth projects in these areas is as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".921W.0/56">Estimates of the contributions to self-administered pension funds and premiums receivable by insurance companies related to pension business are given in the table below. Adjustments made to inquiry data to derive net flows to occupational schemes are made at the aggregate level and the apportionment between self-administered and insurance managed funds is approximate.

In determining pay, it is for individual employers across the public sector to take decisions on their own pay arrangements to recruit and retain the staff they need to support the delivery of public services, within the resources available to them, taking account of their own particular circumstances and requirements. Generally, settlements above inflation can only be justified where there are specific recruitment or retention problems, or where the increases will be financed by reform and modernisation changes, including efficiency and productivity savings.</p>

	<p pid=".929W.8/1">The profitability of the dairy sector in the UK has been adversely affected by low farmgate milk prices. The reasons for these low prices are complex, but include high levels of production earlier in the year combined with the effects of low world prices for dairy commodities. The average farmgate price of milk has recovered from its seasonal low in May, but it is still too low for many dairy farmers to be able to maintain the level of investment required to sustain their businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.8/2">The prices negotiated between farmers and purchasers, or indeed processors and retailers, are private commercial matters in which the Government cannot get involved. Nevertheless, I do welcome the recent price rises announced by major retailers and dairy processors and hope that these will help alleviate some of the difficulties faced by dairy farmers. The Government can influence the environment in which price negotiations take place through the mechanisms of the dairy CAP and, during the period of lowest prices, we actively supported measures taken in Brussels to support Community markets and encourage exports.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.8/3">For the longer term we believe that a sustainable future for dairy farming is best secured through taking forward the recommendations in the Report of the Policy Commission on the Future of Food and Farming, together with the Milk Task Force Report, and this is reflected in our Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy, launched on <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>. My noble Friend, the Lord Whitty, has convened a number of meetings of an informal dairy supply chain group, including representatives of dairy farmers, which has addressed issues of concern to those in the dairy supply chain that came out of these reports. This group is also likely to consider how the industry can best address any lessons that emerge from the ongoing KPMG study on the structure of the UK dairy sector and milk pricing, commissioned by the Milk Development Council.</p>

	<p pid=".932W.5/1">The Krebs Review of bovine TB in cattle found compelling evidence that badgers are a significant source of infection for cattle. However, the relative contribution that badgers and other wildlife make to the disease is unknown. The ongoing badger culling field trial was designed by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) to evaluate what role, if any, badgers play in the transmission of bovine TB to cattle, and whether badger culling is an effective or sustainable bovine TB control mechanism. It will provide epidemiological data on the occurrence and prevalence of TB in badgers, its relationship to population density and social group size and the spatial relationship between TB-infected badgers and TB breakdowns in cattle herds.</p>
	<p pid=".932W.5/2">The ISG have advised that it is too early for a full analysis of results. It is a basic rule for scientific trials that results are not published prematurely. However, it has been possible to complete a preliminary analysis of the risk factors associated with cattle TB, and this is set out in the ISG's Third Report, available in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid=".934W.0/2">There are around 90 million mobile phones in use and being stored the UK, and around 15 million of these are replaced every year. The majority of these are set to be reused or recycled through schemes such as FoneBack to which the main mobile phone companies are members. A number of phones are also being refurbished and sold to eastern Europe, Asia and Africa where there is a strong second hand market. In addition to this, the recently finalized text of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive sets a 75 per cent. target for the recovery and 65 per cent. target for the recycling of separately collected mobile phones.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/3">The average office printer uses around a dozen printer cartridges a year, while a home printer uses around five. There are currently a number of businesses and charities that will collect printer cartridges when they are disposed of and send them for re-manufacturing. The text of the WEEE Directive encourages the design of equipment for recycling in general, and prioritises the re-use, recycling and recovery of WEEE so as to reduce the disposal of waste. Under the Directive producers of electrical and electronic goods will be responsible for the recovery, treatment and environmentally sound disposal of their equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/4">The Directive does not cover consumables such as printer cartridges when they are discarded separately. Devices are sometimes inserted into such consumables to prevent their reuse. The Department is therefore looking at effective measures to reduce this.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/5">Guidance and advice will be developed and provided to Government Departments, local authorities and charitable organisations on the disposal, recycling and reuse of mobile phones and printer cartridges as part of the implementation of the WEEE Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".935W.0/1">THORP does produce technetium-99 wastes, but these account for a small fraction of the totality of technetium-99 discharges from the Sellafield site. By far the largest proportion of technetium-99 discharges from that site originate from the reprocessing of Magnox spent fuel.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.0/2">We have considered the information that has been provided by the Environment Agency in its published documents, and information that has been provided in the form of representations both to the Agency and directly to Ministers concerning technetium-99. We have concluded that as discharges of technetium-99 constitute only one small aspect of the practice of Magnox spent fuel reprocessing and the practice of spent oxide fuel reprocessing, it would be more appropriate to consider whether their justification should be reviewed when considering the other radioactive discharges that arise from those practices.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.0/3">With regard to the reprocessing of spent Magnox fuel, the Environment Agency has carried out a separate review of the remaining radioactive discharges from the Sellafield site (other than technetium-99), including those from Magnox reprocessing and, in August, published its proposed decision for Ministers to consider. We intend to come to a view on the Agency's proposals, and come to a conclusion as to whether it is necessary to review the practice of Magnox reprocessing as to justification in the spring of next year.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.0/4">With regard to the reprocessing of spent oxide fuel, the Government set out the position with respect to the continued operation of THORP in the White Paper on Managing Nuclear Energy which was published in July 2002. If and when any proposals for new contracts for THORP are received, the Government will review the range of issues involved in increasing the current volume of oxide fuel to be reprocessed. One of those issues will be the appropriateness of carrying out a review of the practice of reprocessing spent oxide fuel.</p>

	<p pid=".939W.5/3" class="indent">The Transport Minister has asked me to write to reply to your recent questions about plans for the M6 motorway between Warrington North and Preston South.</p>
	<p pid=".939W.5/4" class="indent">There are currently no proposals to make the Warrington North to Preston South section of the M6 four lanes. However as the Secretary of State said last week we do keep these matters under review. You also asked for confirmation of which council areas are affected by this route. The M6 passes through the Boroughs of Warrington, Wigan, St. Helens, Chorley and the City of Preston.</p>
	<p pid=".939W.5/5" class="indent">You may be interested to note that the Agency is currently progressing a Route Management Strategy (RMS) on the M6 between Junction 20 at Lymm to the Scottish Border as part of our 10-year plan to make best use of this route. Early investigations on the RMS have identified congestion problems during the peak periods especially between Junctions 24 and 28. However, further study work is needed before we can incorporate any local network schemes into the RMS management plan.</p>
	<p pid=".939W.5/6" class="indent">We expect to hold Public consultation on the draft RMS during spring next year. I will write to you again nearer the time with more details. In the meantime if you need any further information, please contact the Highways Agency's Regional Manager for Network Strategy in the North West, Malcolm Roberts, at Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester, M1 4BE, Tel: 0161 930 5668.</p>

	<p pid=".942W.10/1">The Attorney-General has the power to apply to the Court for an injunction to prevent threatened breaches of the criminal law. This power is to be exercised in the public interest, which is exercised in independent judgment in the role as Attorney-General rather than as a member of Government. Such an application is always exceptional and is only instituted where there is the prospect of genuine, serious and irreparable harm and is judged that it is in the public interest to make the application.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.10/2">It is the Attorney-General's duty to keep under constant review the question whether to exercise this power. In order to determine where the public interest lies he may consult as he has been doing with ministerial colleagues to ensure that he is properly informed as to the public interest consultations arising. The Attorney has been informed also of the views of fire authority representatives in relation to the potential threat to public safety. But the power to apply for an injunction is one for the Attorney-General to exercise in the public interest and the decision is for him alone.</p>

	<p pid=".947W.0/1">The Local Government Bill does not include provisions for introducing 80 per cent. mandatory rate relief for community amateur sports clubs and so no assessment has been made of the impact of introducing such a scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/2">There is also no estimate available of the proportion of community amateur sports clubs that would qualify for mandatory rate relief under the provisions in the Local Government Bill. Community amateur sports clubs would benefit from the rate relief scheme for small businesses in the Local Government Bill. The scheme would provide mandatory rate relief of up to 50 per cent. for properties with rateable values of up to #3,000. For larger properties the percentage of relief would gradually taper off, with no relief for properties with rateable values above #8,000.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/3">Local authorities may grant up to 100 per cent. relief at their discretion to community amateur sports clubs that qualify under the new mandatory relief scheme for small businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/4">The rating lists do not record the use of property by voluntary or community amateur sports clubs as distinct from other sports clubs. The rating lists for England include about 16,000 sports properties, including those used by community amateur sports clubs as well as professional and commercial sports bodies. Of the 16,000 sports properties in England, around 7,500 have rateable values of under #3,000 and a further 4,000 have rateable values above #3,000 and below #8,000.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/5">As explained in the White Paper XStrong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot;, which was published in December 2001, mandatory rate relief is already available for all premises used wholly or mainly for charitable purposes, provided that they meet the criteria for charitable status. The Charity Commission announced in November 2001 that they will recognise as charitable purposes Xthe promotion of community participation in healthy recreation by the provision of facilities for the playing of particular sports&quot;, and Xthe advancement of the physical recreation of young people not undergoing formal education&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/6">Where individual clubs do not meet the Charity Commission's criteria, or where they decide not to seek charitable status, local authorities retain discretion to grant rate relief to any non-profit making body. Local authorities have the power to grant relief where it is in the interests of local council taxpayers for them to do so. We have recently published on our website, revised guidance for local authorities and ratepayers on rate relief for charities and other non-profit making organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/7">In addition to this specific assistance, the Government has also introduced a tax package (legislated for in Finance Bill 2002), which will provide a range of tax reliefs for community amateur sports clubs on their income and on the donations which local people make to support them. The tax package follows that outlined in the XPromoting Sport in the Community&quot; consultation document&mdash;mandatory rate relief was not part of the tax package which was consulted upon. The Government believes that the tax package and the option of charitable status, together with the help available for clubs under the non-domestic rating system, represent a generous system of support sports clubs.</p>

Secondly, those voting in favour must represent a majority by rateable value of the hereditaments (rateable properties) of those voting. This Xdual-key&quot; mechanism means that a scheme cannot be forced through by large firms against the wishes of small firms, or vice versa.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.14/2">Secondly, Clause 57 of the Local Government Bill gives my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister the power to make regulations on the timing of BID ballots, the non-domestic ratepayers entitled to vote in the ballot, the question to be asked in the ballot, the form the ballot will take, the persons who are to hold ballots, and how the ballots are to be conducted. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is holding discussions with representatives of local authorities, rating professionals and members of the business community to ensure that the rules on voting are as simple as possible, while safeguarding the interests of those who will be liable to pay the BID levy.</p>

The armed forces' remit was to ensure that all incidents were dealt with where there was a confirmed threat to life (Category A) or a possible threat to life (Category B). In the event, all non-life threatening (Category C) incidents were also attended. An analysis of serious fire-related incidents (mostly Category A) in the north-west of England showed an average response time by the armed forces of 7.2 minutes. The figure for serious incidents in London was 13.8 minutes, largely reflecting traffic problems; and in the south-west, which is a largely rural area, the average response time for serious incidents was 14.2 minutes. These figures are not directly comparable with Fire Service data as fire brigades' target response times are based on four risk categories, ranging from five minutes for main shopping and business centres to 20 minutes for rural areas. Nevertheless, they do demonstrate the highly professional job performed by the armed forces.</p>

All such telephone calls were answered. Because of multiple calls per incident, this gave rise to 20,237 incidents. Around five per cent. of calls were filtered out immediately as not being emergencies, and advance police attendance turned back firefighter response in around 40 per cent. of cases. The armed forces therefore attended 10,793 incidents, and firefighters working for local authority fire brigades attended 1,367 incidents.

	<p pid=".953W.6/2">Priority is currently being given to the implementation of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, including measures affecting the leasehold valuation tribunals, which are made up of the RAPs by BME groups will be undertaken after the anticipated completion of the implementation of the Act on spring 2003.</p>

The proposed new formula grant distribution system aims to reflect the relative cost of service provision. This year, for the first time, The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will also ensure that all authorities receive a grant increase of more than inflation. Since both formula spending shares and floors and ceilings are simply parts of the system which distributes a fixed pot of grant, all authorities will receive their correct share.</p>

	<p pid=".956W.0/1">The area cost adjustment has been calculated on pre-1995 county boundaries and pre-1986 metropolitan county boundaries (though counties bordering London are divided into fringe and non-fringe areas). This means that all unitary authorities (including Herefordshire) and all metropolitan districts (including Dudley) receive the same area cost adjustment as the county or metropolitan county of which they were formerly a part. Not only does this help to reduce complexity, but it ensures that the area cost adjustment calculations are robust and stable from year to year. This is because New Earnings Survey sample sizes for individual unitary and metropolitan district authorities are relatively small.</p>

It is through the continuous assessment and improvement of local services through processes such as the comprehensive performance assessment and statutory duties such as Best Value that we can safeguard and bring the highest standards to non-statutory services such as sport and recreation. The Local Government Act 2000 also gives authorities new powers to promote or improve the economic, social or environmental well-being of their area, including the provision of sport and recreational opportunities.</p>

	<p pid=".963W.2/1">In England, housing authorities must ensure that their allocation scheme is framed so as to give reasonable preference to certain categories of persons. The categories are set out in s167 (2) of the Housing Act 1996 and include households consisting of or including someone with a particular need for settled accommodation on medical or welfare grounds, and families with dependent children. Medical grounds will include a visual impairment where it is serious enough to constitute a disability and where a settled home is required to ensure that the particular needs of the visually impaired person are met. A young person with a visual impairment is also more likely to continue to be considered as a Xdependent child&quot; for a longer period.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.2/2">In England, a family with a visually impaired child has a mandatory right to apply for a disabled facilities grant (DFG) which is intended to help with any necessary adaptations to the home. The grant system is administered through local housing authorities who are required to consult with social services to assess the particular needs of the disabled child. The mandatory grant is subject to a maximum limit of #25,000 per application and subject to a means test.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.2/3">Under the Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002, local authorities have been given additional wide ranging powers which can be used to provide additional assistance with housing adaptations outside the statutory limits of the mandatory DFG system. These new powers can be used at the discretion of the local authority, which would need to allocate resources from its own budgets for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.2/4">Home Improvement Agencies (HIAs) enable vulnerable people to maintain their independence in their own home by helping people through the process of arranging home repairs, improvements or adaptations. Also included is the direct provision of repair and maintenance services, preventative initiatives and providing advice on accessing appropriate finance.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.2/5">In recognition of the important role HIAs play in supporting independent living, Government recently announced additional funding to assist HIAs to deliver housing and health objectives. In addition to the #8.5 million currently invested, ODPM are investing an extra #5.2 million in the sector, and the Department of Health is making #9.5 million available through local authorities over the next three years.</p>

It was sent directly to 231 organisations and over 650 organisations produced responses. We received eight responses from religious organisations, including one from the Churches Main Committee. None of these were concerned with the proposal to licence public entertainment in churches and other places of religious worship. Since then, officials of my Department have had discussions with officials of the General Synod of the Church of England about a possible mechanism to exempt churches from licensing controls.</p>

	<p pid=".969W.12/1">Independent evaluation of the education maintenance allowance scheme has been carried out by a consortium led by the Centre for Research in Social Policy. They have collected a great deal of data, including information on how young people spend their EMA, and this was included in the quantitative report on the first year of the scheme. The findings so far show that recipients of EMA are as likely as non-recipients to make a contribution to housekeeping costs, and more likely to pay towards the cost of transport, books and equipment for school. They spent no more than non-recipients on entertainment and were more likely to say that transport, books and equipment were their main item of expenditure.</p>

Friend is aware, from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>, seat-belts had to be fitted on all new minibuses, coaches and buses (apart from those specifically designed for urban use with standing passengers). There are no regulations governing the use of seat belts in buses. However, my Department's current guidance does refer to RoSPA's 1991 code of practice on school transport safety, and says that</p>
	<p pid=".972W.8/2" class="indent">XLEAs should encourage contractors, drivers, parents, pupils and schools to observe the code, and especially its recommendation that seatbelts should be worn where fitted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".972W.8/3">The Department has not issued guidelines to local education authorities on overcrowding. The regulations that govern seating and standing on all buses are the Public Service Vehicles (Carrying Capacity) Regulations 1984, the Public Service Vehicles (Conditions of Fitness, Equipment, Use and Certification) Regulations 1981, as amended, and the Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations 1990. Enforcement of regulations relating to carrying capacity and safety of buses rests with the Police and the Vehicle Inspectorate. I am not aware of any prosecutions for overcrowding on services involving school transport.</p>

	<p pid=".973W.2/1">Responsibility for making suitable provision for children with special educational needs, including those with visual impairment, rests in the first instance with schools and local education authorities (LEAs). The nature and extent of provision is decided locally in the light of the circumstances and individual needs of each child. In making provision, schools and LEAs must have regard to the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, which provides practical guidance to schools and LEAs on their responsibilities and promotes consistency of approach.</p>
	<p pid=".973W.2/2">Since September 2002, LEAs and schools have had a duty to ensure that disabled pupils are not treated less favourably, without justification, than non-disabled pupils; and to make reasonable adjustments so that disabled pupils are not put at a substantial disadvantage to their non-disabled pupils. In England and Wales there is also a duty on LEAs and schools to plan strategically and make progress in increasing physical accessibility to schools' premises and to the curriculum. The DfES has issued guidance on the new duty, Accessible Schools: Planning to increase access to schools for disabled pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".973W.2/3">Substantial funding has been provided, and continues to be provided under the Schools Access initiative to improve access for disabled children&mdash;#70 million in 2002&ndash;03, increasing to #100 million for each of the next three years, 2003&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".973W.2/4">In addition, in 2002&ndash;03 a total of #91 million was made available to LEAs and schools to support the needs of pupils with SEN and disabilities and vulnerable children from the DfES Standards Fund. The same level of funding will be available in 2003&ndash;04. The fund can be used for training, including training leading to mandatory qualification for teachers of pupils with visual impairment.</p>

	<p pid=".974W.11/2">There was no Police Act for England and Wales in 1966. Over #19 million was made available for the recruitment of more than 1,000 Community Support Officers (CSOs) in England and Wales during this financial year. Twenty seven police forces and authorities made bids for a share of this fund and we were able to offer some funding to all of them.</p>
	<p pid=".974W.11/3">We continue to work with police forces and authorities to develop their implementation plans and are encouraging them to discuss with potential funding partners, such as local authorities, how further CSOs might be funded in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".974W.11/4">At present there are 215 CSOs patrolling the streets of Westminster, Newham and Tower Hamlets. Lancashire Constabulary introduced 20 CSOs to their force area on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".984W.3/3">The Crown Prosecution Service does not maintain records of the number of cases in which jury interference takes place, but in the last five years there have been instances of actual or feared jury interference that have resulted both in pre-trial arrangements whereby jury protection is put in place and trials which have been terminated before a jury has been able to reach a verdict. There have also been instances when jury interference has come to light after the jury's verdict has been returned.</p>
	<p pid=".984W.3/4">The Criminal Justice Bill now before Parliament makes provision for the trial to be conducted without a jury either, on the application of the prosecution where there is a danger of jury tampering or where the judge discharges the jury because of jury tampering. The Government take the view that these measures will be a further strong and effective disincentive to jury tampering.</p>

	<p pid=".989W.2/19">The Home Office receives a large amount of correspondence from hon. Members. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and his ministerial team attach the highest importance to the speed and quality of replies to ministerial correspondence, but we recognise that further work is needed to improve the current levels of performance. A number of important initiatives within the Department have helped drive up performance and we are committed to continuing and extending this work. A new computer-based correspondence tracking system will be introduced shortly which will radically change the way we handle letters and will help us produce more timely responses.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/20">Most of the delays occur when responding to MPs' letters in relation to immigration cases, Whilst there is no doubt that the current performance is unacceptable, in many cases when a letter is received regarding an immigration case, it is necessary to locate the relevant file and get it to the person responding to the letter. The fact that cases are dealt with in various parts of the country adds to the difficulty. However, I have instigated further measures to resolve the backlog.</p>

	<p pid=".990W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-16">16 December 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".990W.2/2">Information on the number of Metropolitan Police officers in each London Borough for May 1997 is not available. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has provided data, set out in the table, on divisional strength on <phrase class="date" code="1997-12-31">31 December 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>. The current London borough divisional structure did not exist in 1997. The figures in the table are those for the previous smaller divisions aggregated into their new borough divisions.</p>
	<p pid=".990W.2/3">The effects of the boundary changes on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> were incorporated into the police funding formula in 2000&ndash;01 and the overall transfer was in terms of financial resources, not of officers.</p>
	<p pid=".990W.2/4">I am advised by the Commissioner that around 470 MPS officers were seconded to the three boundary change forces on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> to give them time to recruit their own officers to police the former MPS areas now in these counties. These officers returned to the MPS over the next two years. There are now no MPS officers on secondment to Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey as a result of the boundary changes of <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".990W.2/5">As it is for police authorities and chief officers of police to decide how resources are utilised, it is not possible to show what the strength for each London borough would have been in 1997 had the current territorial division structure been in place. Divisional strength in 1997 would have reflected operational priorities at the time. A sensible comparison between 1997 and 2002 cannot be made.</p>
	<p pid=".990W.2/6">Information about police strength in the City of London Police's two territorial divisions has been provided by the Commissioner of the City of London Police (Mr. James Hart QPM). He is unable to provide information about divisional police strength in 1997. The City of London Police was unaffected by the boundary changes on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".990W.2/7">Police officers in the territorial divisions of both forces are, of course, supported by police officers in other operational roles, such as traffic, Serious Crime Group, Police Support Units and dogs and mounted sections. There are other officers in specialist squads such as fraud investigation and anti- terrorism duties.</p>

	<p pid=".991W.5/1">The information has been provided by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. The Metropolitan police is unable to provide establishments for each London borough in 1992, 1997 and 2000 as the current London borough divisional arrangement was only introduced after the boundary changes of <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> with Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. The figures shown are therefore the aggregate strength of the old divisions that now fall within the new London borough Divisions for <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase> in each of those years.</p>
	<p pid=".991W.5/2">The effects of the Metropolitan police boundary changes on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> were incorporated into the police funding formula and the overall transfer between the forces was in terms of financial resources, not of officers. It is for police authorities and Chief Constables to decide how resources are utilised.</p>
	<p pid=".991W.5/3">I am advised by the Commissioner that around 470 MPS officers were seconded to the three boundary change forces on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> to give them time to recruit their own officers to police the former MPS areas now in these counties. These officers returned to the MPS over the next two years. There are now no MPS officers on secondment to Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey as a result of the boundary changes of <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".991W.5/4">Since 2001 each London borough has been provided with a Budgeted Strength (establishment), which is set by the Commissioner at the start of the financial year, and which the division aims to achieve by the end of the financial year. These borough establishments can be subject to change in the light of changes in circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".991W.5/5">The total strength of the Metropolitan police at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> was 26,223 officers, 1,345 more than in March 2001. At the same date the Metropolitan police employed 10,459 civilian support staff, 419 more than in March 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".995W.5/2">The Prison Service has made available a further 164 places to the YJB for juveniles during 2002&ndash;03.

	<p pid=".995W.5/3">Work on providing an additional 64 beds at Rainsbrook and Medway Secure Training Centres (STCS) has recently been completed. The number of places in STCs has therefore increased during 2002&ndash;03 from 130 to 194. The YJB is preparing a contract for the development of a new 80-bed Secure Training Centre at Milton Keynes which it hopes may be available in 2004&ndash;05. The Board's current plans are that those additional 80 places will substitute for non-STC places. No firm decisions have been made about any further expansion of the STC estate.</p>

	<p pid=".997W.2/22">Following a number of fatal accidents at fairground rides in 2000 the Health and Safety Commission (HSC)/Executive (HSE) carried out a fundamental review of fairground safety, in consultation with the fairground industry.</p>

It is based on a sound framework of law and industry-specific guidance, receives high level of support from the leaders of industry, and has been shown to be enforceable by the Health and Safety Executive. If it is complied with fully, competently and diligently the risks of death and injury will be minimised.</p>

HSE has now established a National Fairground Inspection Team to improve consistency of approach and to use to the maximum the expertise and experience of the HSE Inspectors working in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".997W.2/25">There are therefore are no immediate plans for further reforms of fairground safety. The Health and Safety Executive has acted upon recommendations contained in the fundamental review of fairground safety that reported to the Health and Safety Commission in September 2001. Additional legislative controls remain an option should there be deterioration in compliance with the existing regime or in accidents.</p>

	<p pid=".998W.2/2">The discretionary Social Fund provides grants and loans to help some of the neediest people in our society manage a wide range of unexpected or occasional costs. Over 1.2 million budgeting loans were made last year to people with the lowest incomes, receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. We have no current plans to extend access to budgeting loans to people with higher incomes as such help would be poorly targeted and potentially very costly.</p>

	<p pid=".998W.5/1">We have made a pledge to tackle age discrimination and we are committed to introducing age legislation covering employment, vocational training and guidance by 2006. Until the legislation is introduced there is no recourse to the courts. In the meantime older people who feel they have suffered discrimination in employment because of their age can encourage the employer to look at our website <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk">www.agepositive.gov.uk</a>. This provides details about the business benefits of non-ageist employment practices, employer case studies, information about the forthcoming legislation and offers useful links to other organisations such as the Employers Forum on Age.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.5/2">We have been vigorously promoting the benefits of age diversity and the recruitment, training and retention of older workers to employers through our Age Positive campaign. The campaign focuses on raising employers' awareness of the business case for an age diverse workforce and encourages them to use the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment to inform their employment policies. The campaign features a range of initiatives including awards events, conferences, good practice publications and guidance to promote age diversity, as well as the Age Positive website.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.5/3">The Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, published in 1999, sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement. An updated version of the Code of Practice was released during Age Positive week which ran from 2 to <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>. The Code was developed with leading organisations including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment has already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent., and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers has dropped from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.</p>

In response to the report, the Department has made further improvements to the Social Fund guidance for decision makers on prioritisation and budgetary control.

Individual managers understand local problems and geography and are responsible for making suitable arrangements for the delivery of, and access to, all locally-administered benefits including the Social Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.8/2">Exceptionally, where a customer is unable to visit their local office, for example an elderly or disabled person with restricted mobility, or a person who lives a long way from the office and who has no access to suitable transport, they may contact the office by telephone to request a home visit. If the information given by the applicant indicates that a crisis loan is likely to be awarded, a visit may be made for the application to be completed and, where appropriate, the loan to be paid.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.2/1">In the 25 working weeks between <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-07">7 April 2002</phrase>&mdash;the start of the Health and Safety Executive's Field Operations Directorate's working year&mdash;and <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-28">28 September 2002</phrase>&mdash;half-year stage&mdash;each band 3 operational inspector in HSE's North West Division made, on average, two inspection contacts per week. In addition, on average, each band 3 operational inspector made one investigation contact, one complaint follow-up contact and one enforcement contact per week.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/2">These figures do not include any inspection or other contacts made by HSE's Construction Division or other operating directorates in the North West.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/3">A number of actions have been taken to increase the contact time of band 3 inspectors in HSE's Field Operations Directorate and work continues to explore further steps. These actions will allow more work involving direct contact with duty-holders to take place; this includes investigation work as well as inspections. Actions being investigated or taken include: (i) enabling administrative staff to input data relating to inspection contacts; (ii) increasing direct administrative resource to support inspectors; (iii) providing better information on the work of inspectors to allow management support to be given to those who need it most and (iv) promulgating best practice by those inspectors who achieve the highest proportion of their time inspecting.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/4">Principal Inspectors (band 2) are a management grade and are not set targets for inspection work. They carry out operational work according to need and for a number of reasons, including to remain familiar with work conditions and practices, to monitor the standards of their staff and to train new staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/5">HSE does not measure, nor have a target for, the frequency of inspections to particular workplaces except for those where risks are highest. HSE targets most inspections according to hazard and risk. The Field Operations Directorate is currently investigating ways of increasing the proportion of time inspectors spend in contact with duty holders.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/6">The role of an operational band 3 inspector is not limited to inspections: around 50 per cent. of their available time is spent dealing with reactive work, ie: incident and complaint investigation. In the first 25 weeks of 2002&ndash;03 operational band 3 inspectors in the North West Division made a total of 3,571 regulatory contacts, broken down as in the table:</p>

Details of the scheme will be contained in regulations, which will be subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid=".1014W.2/1">We have this year launched 20 StepUP pilots offering guaranteed jobs for up to 5,000 long-term unemployed people. We are investing #40 million in the first two years of the pilot programme. The StepUP pilots are testing the use of intermediate labour markets for those who have not found work through the New Deal. The evaluation of StepUP will provide reliable evidence about the cost effectiveness of this type of intervention, and will inform decisions on the wider use of transitional employment schemes in our welfare to work strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".1019W.5/2">Income Support is intended to help people whose resources are insufficient to meet their day-to-day living expenses. Any income that is available to meet those expenses is normally taken fully into account. However there is a special disregard in the income-related benefits in respect of War Disablement Pension which was increased from #5 to #10 in April 1990. In addition, payments made to war disabled pensioners for their attendance or mobility needs are also disregarded in the calculation of Income Support entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/3">We believe that the current disregard strikes the right balance between acknowledging the special reasons for these pensions and prudent use of public funds.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/4">Between April 1990 and October 2002 the percentage increase in the all items retail price index has been 42.2 per cent. Income Support allowances are generally uprated using the Rossi Index which has increased by 42.8 per cent. over the same period.</p>

	<p pid=".1021W.3/2">Between September 2001 and April 2002, we piloted a number of approaches aimed at encouraging greater take up of basic skills provision by people claiming jobseeker's allowance. These included testing different mechanisms to identify those with basic skills needs, and the use of financial incentives and/or benefit sanctions to encourage the take up of training.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.3/3">In north Nottinghamshire we piloted the use of benefit sanctions if a client refused an offer of training or left training early without good cause. In Leeds we combined the use of sanctions with financial incentives of #20 per week on top of their benefit for clients taking up training, and #100 for those achieving a basic skills qualification. In the two pilots, 1,623 clients had a possible basic skills need identified. Of these, 18 had sanctions applied, three because they failed to attend a basic skills assessment and 15 because they failed to attend training or left early without good cause.</p>

	<p pid=".1021W.6/1">We believe that work is the best route out of poverty, but recognise that parents can face difficulties moving into work due to the demands of balancing their work, life and family responsibilities. That is why we are providing extra help to reduce these problems and allow parents to successfully move into work.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.6/2">Help with child care costs for people looking for work is available across Great Britain through our welfare to work initiatives, such as the New Deal. For example, the New Deal for Lone Parents can provide assistance when participants attend training or take up part-time work. We are also enhancing the child care support available through Jobcentre Plus. From April 2003, a Childcare Partnership Manager will be established in every Jobcentre Plus district to ensure that jobseekers with children and their advisers have access to the latest information about child care in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.6/3">For lone parents who are moving into work of over 16 hours per week, the Working Families Tax Credit (and from April 2003 the Working Tax Credit) includes the Childcare Tax Credit which can pay for up to 70 per cent. of their child care costs. New Deal Personal Advisers can also use the Adviser Discretion Fund to help pay for advance child care deposits if the lone parent is unable to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.6/4">We have also recently announced an improved package of financial measures to help people make the transition into work. From October 2004 we will be introducing a new Job Grant to help people moving into a job after at least six months on benefit. Single people and couples without children will receive #100. A higher rate Grant of #250 will be paid to lone parents and to couples with children. This improved Job Grant will make a real difference in helping tide families over until their first wages are received.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.6/5">In 1998 we launched our National Childcare Strategy for England. This aims to ensure that good quality, affordable child care for children up to age 14 (and 16 for children with special educational needs and disabilities) is available in every neighbourhood.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.6/6">Since 1997, there has been a major expansion in child care provision. In England over 553,000 new child care places have been created, benefiting more than a million children. A number of Government programmes, including the Neighbourhood Childcare Initiative, are helping to extend provision in the most disadvantaged areas of the country. We are now also encouraging schools to provide and host a range of services, including child care, for the local community through our new Extended Schools programme. The 2002 Spending Review saw a doubling of child care funding to create a further 250,000 places, in new Children's Centres in disadvantaged areas and elsewhere, by 2006. This is on top of the existing target of creating new provision for 1.6 million children by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.6/7">Responsibility for policy relating to the development of child care in Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved administrations.</p>

	<p pid=".1026W.3/1">Doctors must demonstrate they have achieved a satisfactory standard before being approved by the Chief Medical Adviser to carry out assessments on behalf of the Department. Ongoing approval is dependent upon the doctor maintaining a satisfactory standard. We therefore have stringent procedures in place to assess their performance.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.3/2">A doctor's work can be audited if their work is reported to be deficient or if they are subject to significant levels of complaint and, in addition, cases are randomly selected for audit on an ongoing monthly basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.3/3">All complaints made regarding the manner or conduct of a doctor are investigated to ensure that examining doctors have followed the professional standards laid down by Medical Services, and consideration is given to any complaints made and their nature when reviewing the performance of individual doctors.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.3/4">The Department and Medical Services also undertake a number of validation exercises to ensure that these systems are sufficiently robust and that the performance of doctors acting on behalf of the Department is effectively assessed.</p>

	<p pid=".1027W.2/1">The New Deal is delivering services tailored to meet the needs of individual lone parents and giving them the skills, support and confidence they need to move into work. By the end of September 2002, the New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) had helped over 160,000 lone parents to find jobs. There has been on-going evaluation of the programme and a number of evaluation reports have been published and placed in the Library. A report of further evaluation concerning the quantitative impact of NDLP is due to be published in spring 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".1027W.2/2">NDLP is just one of many measures that we have introduced to help lone parents gain independence through moving into work. Together they have helped reduce the number of lone parents dependant on income support by over 15 per cent. since May 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".1028W.2/1">Since 1997, youth unemployment has fallen by more than a third and long-term youth unemployment has been reduced by nearly three-quarters. The new deal for young people has played an important part in this success, helping almost 400,000 young people off benefit and into jobs, and improving the work prospects of many more.</p>
	<p pid=".1028W.2/2">Independent research by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research found that the number of young people unemployed for six months or more would be twice as high without the new deal.

	<p pid=".1029W.2/1">Due to the strength of the economy and the success of the New Deal for Young People long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated. The number of young people accessing New Deal opportunities has therefore been lower than was anticipated in 1998. This has also resulted in underspends against original planning assumptions for the programme. These underspends have been used to support other welfare to work initiatives. Environment Task Force opportunities and those on the other options continue to be available for New Deal clients who need this type of help to move into work.</p>
	<p pid=".1029W.2/2">The Department's accounts for 2001&ndash;02 are currently being finalised and are expected to be published early in 2003. The Environment Task Force expenditure figure will be available then.</p>

	<p pid=".1030W.2/1">Due to the strength of the economy and the success of the new deal for young people long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated. The number of young people accessing subsidised employment opportunities in the construction industry has therefore been lower than was anticipated in 1998. However, opportunities continue to be available for new deal clients who need help through subsidised employment to move into work.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.2/2">We estimate that 6,800 people have started subsidised employment in the construction industry since 1998. Of these, around 3,000 subsequently moved into an unsubsidised job, some 2,800 of which were sustained. Information on the type of industry within which a subsidised job takes place is incomplete. It is likely, therefore, that these are underestimates of the number of people taking up work in the construction industry through the subsidised employment option of the new deal.</p>

	<p pid=".1035W.5/1">There is no target for EU unemployment among 18 to 24 year olds. The Presidency Conclusions from the European Council held in Lisbon in March 2000 set a target that the number of 18 to 24 year olds with only lower secondary level education who are not in further education and training should be halved by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.5/2">Three employment rate targets were agreed at Lisbon and Stockholm on total employment (70 per cent.), female employment (60 per cent.) and older worker employment (50 per cent.). The UK is one of the best performing member states in the EU, with one of the highest employment rates in the EU 15 (71.7 per cent. in the UK in 2001 compared with an EU average of 63.9 per cent.). The UK is one of only three member states to currently exceed all three of the 2010 employment targets.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.5/3">The UK performs well in terms of young people as well, with the second highest youth employment rate at 56.9 per cent. in 2001, well above the EU 15 average of 40.7 per cent. This reflects the effectiveness of policies such as New Deal in helping young people in the UK to move from welfare to work. Current Eurostat figures show that between October 2000 and October 2001, unemployment in the EU for 15 to 24 year olds fell from 14.9 per cent. to a low of 14.7 per cent., before rising again to 15.1 per cent. in October 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".1036W.2/2">New Deal 50 plus offers personal advice, jobsearch help, and back to work financial support through an Employment Credit for clients on taking up either full-time or part- time work. We are ensuring that New Deal 50 plus offers effective back to work help for women over 50 by making partners, as well as the main benefit recipient, eligible for help through the programme. By October 2002, New Deal 50 plus had helped 26,780 women back into work&mdash;a third of all clients moving into work through the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1036W.2/3">We are encouraging employers to realise the benefits of employing older workers through our Age Positive campaign. The campaign raises employer awareness through events, awards, initiatives, guidance and publications such as 'Good Practice in Recruiting and Retaining Older Workers' (DWP December 2001). We are also encouraging employers to adopt more flexible approaches to retirement to give individuals more choice and opportunity to stay in work longer. This can be important for those women who want to stay in work longer and also move from full-time to part-time work. The Green Paper on pensions, which we published on <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase>, includes proposals to support the development of flexible retirement. We will also reinforce our commitment to tackle age discrimination in employment by implementing age legislation covering employment and vocational training by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1036W.2/4">Earlier this month we had Age Positive Week which included a range of events to further raise awareness of the benefits of employing older men and women as part of an age diverse workforce. On <phrase class="date" code="">3 December</phrase> we also launched an updated Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, which includes a range of new good practice case studies for employers.</p>
	<p pid=".1036W.2/5">Our policies have contributed to a rise of 4.6 percentage points in the employment rate of women aged 50 to state pension age since 1997, to 65.6 per cent. This increase is greater than the increase in the overall employment rate of women, which stood at 69.7 per cent in spring 2002.</p>

On receipt of a negative test result, the carcase must be sent to a licensed cutting plant that is separately licensed to remove the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia before the meat is released for human consumption. All licensed cutting plants are free to apply to the Food Standards Agency for an additional licence to remove vertebral column. It is a simple process, no fee is charged, and all have been encouraged to apply. None has done so in the south-west peninsular.</p>

	<p pid=".1043W.0/2">The Ombudsman's report referred to has not been published. It is therefore not possible to comment on the contents.</p>
	<p pid=".1043W.0/3">However, health authorities and subsequently strategic health authorities (StHAs) have reviewed their local criteria in line with the judgement in North and East Devon Health Authority ex parte Coughlan. The chief executive wrote to national health service chief executives about NHS continuing care over the summer. In the light of an earlier Ombudsman's case where an individual had been denied funding, he reminded them of the need to ensure that previous eligibility criteria did not deny patients NHS funded care to which they were entitled. In that case, the Ombudsman recommended that the eligibility criteria that had been in operation by the authority since April 1996 should be reviewed and that reimbursement of costs should be made to any patients found to have been refused funding incorrectly. StHAs have been asked to consider whether criteria in their area were at similar fault and whether other patients were also denied NHS funding of their care. The Department will be monitoring this as part of the process of reviewing StHA's criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".1043W.0/4">The Department does not consider there is any need to amend the wording of Appendix 6 of HSC 2001/17: LAC (2001) 26.</p>
	<p pid=".1043W.0/5">The leaflet, XNHS Funded Nursing Care&mdash;What it Means for You&quot;, is a guide to people living in or going into a care home providing nursing care, their families and carers. It is not statutory guidance. Separate guidance on the single assessment process asked the NHS and councils to carry out a joint, comprehensive old age assessment when individuals enter care homes or receive other intensive packages of care as part of continuing care, intermediate care or NHS funded nursing care. Local implementation teams for the national service framework for older people, covering all primary care trusts and councils, are required to oversee implementation of this guidance by April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1045W.5/1">There is no requirement under current United Kingdom legislation for food supplements to be assessed for safety before being placed on the market.

	<p pid=".1045W.5/2">Directive 2002/46/EC on Food Supplements, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-12">12 July 2002</phrase>, will, after a transitional period, require prior assessment of vitamin and mineral sources used in these products. Member states are obliged to transpose it into national legislation by <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-31">31 July 2003</phrase>. The Food Standards Agency is currently consulting on draft implementing Regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".1045W.5/3">Implementation of the Directive will not immediately outlaw any products already on the UK market. The impact of the Directive on the future availability of products currently on the market will depend upon future developments on lists of permitted nutrients and on maximum levels of nutrients in food supplements.</p>

All consignments of poultry meat from Brazil must be analysed. The cost of the tests varies among the laboratories which carry out the testing. The cost per sample varies from #220 to #600. We have no information on how many birds have been imported each year from Brazil since 1997. Since the testing regime was introduced in October 2002, 192 consignments have been analysed and none have tested positive for furazolidone.</p>

	<p pid=".1058W.8/1">All doctors applying to join the specialist register must meet certain standards. For doctors possessing a specialist qualification awarded overseas, the qualification must be equivalent to the United Kingdom qualification, in specialties for which the UK itself awards a qualification, or, for all other specialties, give the doctor the knowledge and skill consistent with practice as a consultant in that specialty in the national health service. These requirements are set by the European Specialist Medical Qualifications Order 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.8/2">It is the job of the specialist training authority of the Medical Royal Colleges (STA) to assess whether these standards are met in individual cases.

	<p pid=".1059W.2/1">As at March 2002, there were 4,969 consultants within the surgical group, which represents an increase of 21 per cent. since September 1997. Current work force projections suggest that by March 2004, there may be sufficient trained specialists to increase numbers in the specialties by around 1,000 over a 2,000 baseline.</p>
	<p pid=".1059W.2/2">In 2002&ndash;03, the surgical specialties were allocated 34 of the total number of centrally funded national training numbers. The combined ceiling posts were 316. This gives trusts considerable opportunity to fund extra posts themselves. The first round of bidding for ceiling posts suggests that locally funded surgical posts will be popular and that the ceiling is likely to be reached.</p>
	<p pid=".1059W.2/3">We have agreed that 316 additional higher specialist surgical training opportunities, with central and local funding, should be made available to be taken up by March 2004. Additionally, we are identifying and encouraging suitable doctors on the specialist register, but not working as consultants to compete for posts, establishing more part-time and job share posts and improving retention through a flexible careers scheme and flexible retirement.</p>

	<p pid=".1060W.2/1">In order to meet the needs of the local population, clinicians and commissioners in South West London felt that a local unit was needed with outreach provision, intensive care facilities, treatment available seven days a week and an ability to take emergency admissions where clinically indicated. This would better provide accessible specialist services to adolescents with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.2/2">The new adolescent unit at Springfield hospital is estimated to cost #1.7 million, and will include the development of an outreach service to offer intensive pre and post-admission support to adolescents. Precise costs of proposed replacement services for Surrey will be available after the public consultation, depending on the outcome. However, East Surrey Primary Care Trust (PCT) is committed to maintaining the same level of funding as currently exists at #462,000. The annual cost of the Woodside unit is approximately #1.06 million, but other placements are made in both the national health service and the private sector, and costs vary according to the particular needs of the adolescent and the particular placement.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.2/3">There have been regular quarterly meetings over the past three years, chaired by East Surrey Health Authority (HA) initially, and involving Merton Sutton and Wandsworth HA, South West London region. Surrey Oaklands formally declared its intention in March 2002 to close the unit in September 2002, but in July 2002, notified the South West Strategic HA that the closure had been deferred to allow more time for the service to be reconfigured.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.2/4">All parties are fully aware of the impact that the withdrawal of South West London's funds would have on Woodside. Meetings are still held and are now chaired by East Surrey PCT, with the involvement of Wandsworth PCT and other stakeholders.</p>
