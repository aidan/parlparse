	<p pid="a.1183W.3/1">In May last year the House agreed to the proposal made in the joint Report from the Accommodation and Works and Administration Committees for a new Visitor Reception Building to be sited at the north west corner of Westminster Hall. The House of Lords endorsed this proposal in July last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.3/2">Over the past 12 months work on design has progressed. Tenders will be invited in August 2005. Construction is due to begin on site in December 2005. It is planned to complete the work by the time of return of the House in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.3/3">A model of the new Visitor Reception Building will be exhibited in the Upper Waiting Hall from <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>, in the atrium of Portcullis House from 4 to <phrase class="date" code="">8 July</phrase>, and in the Royal Gallery in the House of Lords from 11to <phrase class="date" code="">15 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.3/4">The construction of the new facility will in any event involve some disruption to Westminster Hall as well as the facilities on the west side of the Hall. To avoid such disruption being spread over a number of years, the opportunity is being taken to undertake at the same time a number of maintenance and repair projects in Westminster Hall itself, including replacement of the guttering and repairs to the south stairs and floor. As a result, Westminster Hall, the Grand Committee Room, the Jubilee Cafe, the Jubilee Room, the meeting rooms off Westminster Hall, and the IPU and CPA offices and reception rooms will be inaccessible from the end of December 2005 until October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.3/5">Mr. Speaker has decided that sittings of the House in Westminster Hall will be held in Committee Room 10, with effect from January 2006 until the return of the House in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.3/6">As a temporary measure to replace the W meeting rooms off Westminster Hall, Committee Room 21 on the Upper Committee Corridor will be divided into two separate meeting rooms. The Serjeant at Arms will shortly be circulating further details of arrangements for other meeting rooms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.3/7">As a temporary measure to alleviate the effect of the closure of the Jubilee Room, functions held in the Macmillan Room in Portcullis House will be allowed to use outside caterers, as will meetings in additional spaces to be made available by the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.3/8">The offices of the UK branch of the CPA will be moved to temporary offices in 2 The Abbey Garden. The Chess Room will be made available as a reception room.</p>

	<p pid="a.1185W.3/1">Part IV of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as amended, provides that the Attorney-General may apply to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) to refer for review by the court sentences that he regards to be unduly lenient. The Solicitor-General has the same power to refer sentences.

	<p pid="a.1185W.6/1">The decision whether to initiate a prosecution of a case in the courts may be taken either by the police or by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). How the procedure to initiate proceedings operates depends on the nature of the offence and, currently, where an offence was committed. When the roll-out of statutory charging is completed (planned for April 2006), a standard procedure will apply throughout England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185W.6/2">In an area where statutory charging applies, the Director of Public Prosecutions' (DPP) Guidance (under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as amended) allows police officers themselves to charge a range of offences but not robbery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185W.6/3">The CPS would usually deal with robbery offences. The public interest would almost always demand a prosecution in such cases. In strictly limited circumstances, a case that is cautioned may subsequently be prosecuted, though the parameters have been very tightly defined by the courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1186W.6/1">This Government are concerned about the contribution that UK aviation makes to global warming, which by 2030 could amount to about a quarter of the UK's total contribution to climate change. We are working hard domestically and in the EU to reduce the impact of aviation on climate change. Defra Ministers and officials worked closely with colleagues at the Department for Transport to ensure that this vital issue was addressed in the Government's Air Transport White Paper which was published in December 2003. As a result, the Government's long term aviation policy has repeated our commitment to taking a lead on climate change and recognises the need for aviation to take its share of responsibility for tackling the impact of air transport on global warming.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.6/2">The preferred Government option for tackling the contribution that aviation makes to global warming is through a well designed emissions trading scheme. For an international industry, an international trading regime is the best solution, and we are working with the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) to achieve this. Within the EU we will be pressing for the inclusion of aviation into the EU emissions trading scheme, and have made this a top priority for the UK presidency of the EU, with a view to aviation joining the scheme in 2008, or as soon as possible thereafter. Officials from DfT and Defra have already approached other member states on the matter and are working closely with the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.6/3">This provides a solid foundation for action in tackling aviation's global impacts. However, we recognise that this may not provide a total solution. In view of this, we will continue to explore and discuss options for the use of other economic instruments for tackling aviation's greenhouse gas emissions, building on the work in the March 2003 report Aviation and the Environment: Using Economic Instruments&quot;.</p>

These emissions are estimated using the amount of fuel provided to aircraft in the UK.

	<p pid="a.1188W.5/4" class="italic">(b) Reductions in Civil Service Posts in 2004&ndash;05</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.5/5">In Budget 2005 the Chancellor announced a headcount reduction of 12,500 posts by the end of 2004&ndash;05, towards the Government's target of a gross reduction of 84,000 civil service and administrative posts by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.5/6">DEFRA's target is to reduce its head count by 2,400 (measured as full-time equivalent posts) by the end of 2007&ndash;08. The programmes that make up DEFRA's efficiency portfolio contributed 340 posts to this target in financial year 2004&ndash;05. The majority of these post reductions were delivered through restructuring and the introduction of new working practices in the Rural Payments Agency (235 posts) and the human resources function (91 posts).</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.5/7">DEFRA's staff in post figures show a reduction of 445 posts between <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. This includes the transfer of 320 members of staff to IBM as part of the outsourcing of IT services in October 2004. However, these transfers cannot be counted as efficiencies, as the individuals continue to work on DEFRA's account. The reason that the balance does not match the reductions delivered through the efficiency programme is that DEFRA has taken on staff to meet new work areas arising from the Spending Review 2004 settlement, such as the world summit on climate change and the EU presidency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1192W.2/1">Defra recognised the problems that the withdrawal of strychnine could cause for the control of moles. The Central Science Laboratory was commissioned to undertake a review of the range of mole control methods which exist across the EU. The aim of this review was to produce guidance on the most humane and effective methods of mole control which are currently available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192W.2/2">The report A review of methods used within the European Union to control the European Mole, Talpa Europaea&quot; was published by Defra in February 2004. It concluded that the unavailability of strychnine in the future suggests that landowners and occupiers will have to assess more carefully whether moles should be controlled or left alone in order to avoid initiating measures that are unnecessary or unlikely to reduce damage levels in the long term. If control is necessary, alternative methods are available such as trapping and fumigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1193W.5/1">The Final Determination of Thames Water's price limits in 2005&ndash;10, published by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, include provision for significant treatment capacity increases at Mogden, Beckton and Crossness sewage works, and to improve the treated discharge at Riverside sewage works. The capacity increases are expected to reduce the frequency and impact of storm water discharges from these works.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.5/2">Since 2001 officials from the Department have been involved in a strategic study of the environmental impact of intermittent storm sewage discharges to the Thames Tideway. The Steering Group includes members from Thames Water, the Environment Agency, the Greater London Authority, and, with observer status, Ofwat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.5/3">My officials and the Study Group are currently carrying out further consideration of issues concerning the proposed long-term interceptor tunnel, and possible appropriate smaller-scale measures which could provide earlier improvements to the overflow discharges during wet weather. A further report is expected soon, and it will be carefully considered by Ministers and Ofwat, and a decision made on an appropriate course of action to meet our obligations to protect the environment in a cost-effective way.</p>

	<p pid="a.1194W.5/2">Land used in support of claims for payment under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme (SPS) must be at the claimants' disposal for the 10-month period nominated on their claim forms. Under recently updated guidance issued by the Department, motor sports may take place on up to 28 days during the nominated 10-month period, in addition to all of the remaining two months of the year. The updated guidance takes on board representations made by motor sports interests and, overall, we would expect the impact of the SPS on the availability of farmland used for such sports to be limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.5/3">Since the updated guidance was issued, the Department has received additional representations from the All Party Parliamentary Group for Motorcycles, the Motorsport Industry Association and a number of individuals, which are currently being considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1198W.2/2">Many countries have established or are developing reproductive health programmes and are recognising also the links between female education and reproductive health.

	<p pid="a.1198W.5/1">The Global Environment Facility (GEF) provides grants and concessional funds to help developing countries fund projects and programmes that protect the global environment. Established in 1991, the GEF is the designated financial mechanism for the international conventions on biodiversity, climate change, persistent organic pollutants and desertification. The GEF also supports projects that protect international waters and the ozone layer.

Under GEF 3 (2002&ndash;06), DFID has committed to a core contribution of &pound;103 million and provided an additional &pound;15 million as a signal of our commitment to addressing global environmental problems, making the UK the fourth largest donor to the facility.

	<p pid="a.1199W.8/1">The Government have donated over &pound;7 million directly to aid relief and recovery in Sri Lanka in the immediate aftermath of the Tsunami. DFID funded seven flights for the Disasters Emergency Committee, seconded four staff to help with relief work and made direct grants to United Nations Agencies and international non-governmental organisations to provide shelter, water sanitation equipment, food and other essential help to Tsunami victims. The secondments involved providing an air operations co-ordinator, two shelter advisers and an adviser to the United Nations Humanitarian Information Centre. DFID also provided a member of staff as part of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination team. Sri Lanka has also benefited from some of the &pound;26.5 million disbursed as regional support to the UN, and the &pound;50 million that the Treasury estimates will be given in tax relief on public contributions to the Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.8/2">During the relief and recovery phase, DFID has supported the humanitarian work of Help Age, World Vision, Save the Children Fund, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Sri Lankan Red Cross, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food Programme and the United Nations Security Co-ordinator in the areas under LTTE control in the North and East of the island. The United Nations has commented that the relief effort in Tamil areas has been impressive. Our humanitarian advisers in-country are monitoring the international response and are confident that aid is getting to those in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.8/3">In addition to providing relief assistance, DFID has agreed to meet the cost of 10 per cent. of the interest on Sri Lanka's debt repayments to the International Financial Institutions over the next 10 years. This support is expected to be worth some &pound;41 million and will be used for post-tsunami and poverty-reduction work. Further financial support for longer-term reconstruction is under consideration. DFID stands ready to assist in the establishment of a Post Tsunami Operational Management Structure and a Post Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.8/4">The initial relief operation did go well, largely in all areas. However more needs to be done to allow the numerous donors to start reconstruction and to more actively involve affected communities in the planning of that process. The sheer amount of work required to obtain land has delayed the implementation of reconstruction. On my recent visit to the east and south of Sri Lanka I met with many families affected by the tsunami disaster and numerous national and international non-governmental organisations, United Nations and government officials working to support them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1200W.2/1">According to the United Nations (UN), 360,000 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) returned to Southern Sudan during 2004. This year the UN estimates that between 500,000 and 1.2 million people will return during 2005, including both IDPs and refugees from neighbouring countries. The UN is currently drawing up a returns plan that will detail the support returnees receive both during their journey and when then arrive home. We expect this will be released within the next few weeks. DFID has provided &pound;45 million to the UN 2005 Workplan for Sudan, over half of which has been allocated by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator to support humanitarian operations and returns in the South.</p>

	<p pid="a.1200W.5/1">According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the humanitarian conditions of the Ethiopian refugees in Pibor are very poor, but are no worse than the many other residents living in the area. The refugees originate from Gambella in Ethiopia and have settled with the agreement of UNHCR and the State of Jonglei Government. There are approximately 500 refugees temporarily accommodated in an old school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.5/2">The UNHCR and the non-governmental organisation, the Swedish Free Mission (SFM) are assisting the refugees. SFM is providing shelter, water and sanitation. Food is mostly delivered via air drops by the World Food Programme. The Jonglei State Government have also provided the refugees with land to cultivate; the SFM will provide them with tools and seeds. The Department for International Development is providing &pound;1.7 million to the NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres in the region for health assistance to the general population, including the refugees.</p>

I have made clear to the authorities in Sudan that I deplore the occurrence of rape throughout the crisis in Darfur. It is clear that rape is under-reported due to fear of retribution and social stigma. During my recent visit to Sudan, I raised this in my meetings with UN representatives, and with the Sudanese Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and other Sudanese officials.</p>

	<p pid="a.1201W.5/1">According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), most Sudanese refugees in Chad (numbered at an estimated 200,000) do not intend to return home this year, largely due to their lack of confidence in security in Darfur. However, according to UNHCR, over the last three months, around 20,000 people have spontaneously returned from Chad to Sudan. These people are returning from border areas rather than refugee camps; most of them appear to be returning to Darfur for the planting season rather than to settle permanently at this stage. It is essential that repatriation only occurs on a voluntary basis.</p>

When the implementation of this Agreement is complete (expected to be during 2010), the size of the estate will have reduced to 118.9 hectares or 18.18 per cent. of Gibraltar's total land area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1206W.9/2">It is impossible to break these figures down into individual service use, because of the tri-service nature of operations in Gibraltar.</p>

I am writing to you again now to set out in the body of a letter the answers I gave you so that they can be published in the <i>Official Report</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.0/2">The British Officer embedded within the office of the Staff Judge Advocate had a very limited role in relation to detainees. In addition to providing comments on a US interrogation policy document in August 2003, he produced a summary of an ICRC Report in November 2003, which was circulated to senior personnel within CJTF-7. With regard to operational law, he provided advice on targeting and operational planning at Corps level. This involved the application of the Laws of Armed Conflict and US Rules of Engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.0/3">The British Officer recalls submitting reports, both orally and in writing, to his British superiors. We have not been able to locate copies of those reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.0/4">The British Officer did not ask Major O'Kane to investigate allegations of abuse at Abu Ghraib.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.0/5">We have established that the British Officer did not see a version of the CJTF-7 Interrogation and Counter-Resistance&quot; policy. The British Officer played no part in drafting that policy. This is contrary to my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>. I apologise for the error. In fact, the British Officer saw a separate US interrogation policy document dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-27">27 August 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.0/6">That Document was entitled ABU GHURAYB: Saddam Fedayeen Interrogation Facility (SFIF) Detainee Interrogation Policy&quot;. We understand that it was drafted to apply to one section within Abu Ghraib, and the Fay report confirms that it was quickly superseded by the September version of the Interrogation and Counter-Resistance&quot; policy, which we have not seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.0/7">It sets out a range of interrogation techniques which were considered to be lawful under the prevailing US interpretation of the Geneva Conventions. The document was written by and for US personnel to whom the US interpretation applied. The document was passed to us in confidence, and we cannot release details of its contents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1210W.2/1">The UK takes seriously its obligations to deal with unexploded ordnance in Iraq. Since the end of major combat operations, a UK Joint Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group (currently about 90 strong) has been deployed alongside other coalition forces, NGOs and contractors clearing sites containing unexploded ordnance. During the war fighting phase over 200,000 items of munitions were destroyed by coalition teams. Since then a further 860,000 items have been recovered or destroyed by UK teams. The UK has uncovered 67 formal ammunition depots in the region of Iraq where the UK has responsibility. The UK has currently cleared 64 of these depots; the final three are in the process of being cleared.</p>
	<p pid="a.1210W.2/2">The Department for International Development has provided further funding to this area through UN-related organisations and a UK-registered charity, Mines Advisory Group. &pound;30 million has been provided to the United Nations Development Group International Trust Fund to support Explosive Ordnance Disposal capacity building and clearance. Inaddition, &pound;4 million has been directed to the UnitedNations Mines Action Service to provide the UN's humanitarian agencies with a responsive and co-ordinated mine action capability to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Further funding of around &pound;2 million has been directed through the Mines Advisory Group to facilitate a number of projects.</p>

The question under consideration at that meeting was whether eligibility relied on an applicant having been British at the time of internment or at the time of making a claim under the Ex Gratia Payment Scheme. The decision taken was that the relevant date was the time of captivity and that any subsequent change of nationality did not affect eligibility.</p>

Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, will write to the hon. Member with this information and a copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.0/2">The Government's Skills Strategy, 21st Century Skills: Realising Our Potential&quot; (July 2003) and Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; (March 2005) set out our plans for increasing opportunities for adults to develop their skills. The 14&ndash;19 White Paper, 14&ndash;19 Education and Skills&quot;, published in February, set out proposals to improve vocational education and qualifications for young people through a national entitlement to specialised diplomas in 14 broad sector areas. Employers, through Sector Skills Councils, will lead in their design and higher education institutions will also have an important role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.0/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom to Mr. Charles Walker, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.0/4" class="indent">Thank you for your recent Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills where you ask what measures she will take to encourage vocational skills training in Hertfordshire. The Secretary of State has asked me to reply on her behalf as Chief Executive of the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.0/5" class="indent">In its Strategic Area Review, the LSC for Hertfordshire recognises that the depth and breadth of vocational learning in Hertfordshire is limited. It is working with partners to develop vocational provision for 14&ndash;16 year olds. For example, the Increased Flexibility Programme offers young people the opportunity to undertake vocational qualifications, usually undertaking some work at the local College. Nearly 1,500 Hertfordshire young people are currently on the programme. The LSC is also supporting collaboration between schools and colleges for 16&ndash;19 year olds, with Colleges leading on developing the vocational elements. Excellent examples of this work can be seen in Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage, with encouraging developments in Hemel Hempstead, Broxbourne and St. Albans. In Bishops Stortford, Hertford Regional College is working with Birchwood High School to develop vocational provision on the school site, with funding support from the LSC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.0/6" class="indent">In many parts of Hertfordshire the Further Education infrastructure is in an unsatisfactory condition. The LSC has supported the development of facilities for Learners with Learning Difficulties and Disabilities at Ware, and for construction at Broxbourne (which is due to open this September). Major campus redevelopments are being planned at 3 of Hertfordshire's 4 Colleges&mdash;Oaklands, West Herts and Hertford Regional. Plans for establishing a Skills Centre&quot; in Hemel Hempstead are also being developed with West Herts College, working closely with the Dacorum schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.0/7" class="indent">Working with employers, The LSC has established Sector Employer Groups in key sectors for the Hertfordshire economy. These are providing employers with a voice for expressing their needs, and a means of communicating with learning providers so that relevant provision is developed and delivered. We are also working with the University of Hertfordshire and the four Hertfordshire Further Education Colleges to increase the number and range of Foundation Degrees offered in the County through the Colleges and the University of Hertfordshire. We expect to have Foundation Degrees in nine subjects available by September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1220W.0/2">Cumbria county council's Adult Education Service currently contracts with Community Development Centres, a local term used in Cumbria, to describe sites located in primary schools which deliver adult learning courses covering a range of subjects with a significant focus on IT. How such education is organised is a matter for the county council. Its Adult Education Service is in regular dialogue with LSC Cumbria about how its provision can contribute to local, regional and national priorities. These include supporting adults to improve their literacy and numeracy skills and to engage with learning locally, so that in due course they can progress towards gaining a Level 2 qualification. Community Development Centres, as present in Cumbria, are not generally found across England.</p>

	<p pid="a.1221W.2/4" class="indent">Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and received EMA is available at Local Authority level, but not at constituency level. By the end of May 2005, 5,606 young people in the Leeds Local Authority area had received one or more EMA payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1221W.2/5" class="indent">EMA is awarded in three defined payment bands of &pound;30, &pound;20 and &pound;10, depending on household income. In Leeds Local Authority the take-up of EMA by payment band is split as follows: 78% on &pound;30 per week, 10% on &pound;20 per week and 12% on &pound;10 per week (based on an analysis of young people attending a school or college in the Leeds Local Authority area). This breakdown is very similar to the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.1221W.2/6" class="indent">We do not break down cost data to show specifically how much is spent in each Local Authority area. The total cost of EMA payments during the academic year 2004/2005 in England at <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase> was approximately &pound;206,000,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.1229W.2/1">We want to see strong links between extended schools and children's centres. Children's centres provide holistic services, including access to integrated early learning and care, health and family support for children under five and their families. They are being established across the country in every community by 2010. We also expect all schools to be offering extended services by that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.1229W.2/2">It is up to local authorities to determine where children's centres should be located in order to best serve their communities' needs. However, where possible we expect children's centres to be developed from existing services which will include nursery, primary and secondary schools. Children's centres may wish to consider co-locating with schools, especially primary schools and offering joint services, to provide a more streamlined service to parents and families, providing services for all those with children aged 0&ndash;11 in one place. This would particularly benefit those parents with pre-school children and children of primary school age.</p>

	<p pid="a.1231W.9/2">The Government's and BNFL's position on Westinghouse (and other BNFL businesses) has not changed since the 2003 BNFL Joint Strategy Review. The businesses are being managed to deliver value and in a way that limits and controls risk to the UK taxpayer. As agreed in 2003, the Westinghouse business has been operating with greater financial independence from its parent, so that possibilities for private sector participation can be opened up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1231W.9/3">Under the strategy of delivering shareholder value the BNFL board continues to discuss strategic options with its long-term adviser, N M Rothschild.</p>

	<p pid="a.1231W.15/1">The UK's Carbon Abatement Technologies strategy was launched on the <phrase class="date" code="">14 June</phrase>. This sets out the work programme needed to support the development of sustainable fossil fuel technologies mainly using coal and natural gas. It recognises that fossil fuels will continue to be a major source of energy for decades to come and that technologies need to be developed and deployed which will radically reduce CO <sub>2</sub> emissions from the use of these fuels. Improved combustion efficiency and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are seen as the key technologies for achieving this aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1231W.15/2">The Government have announced funding of some &pound;25 million towards demonstration of carbon abatement technologies as part of a &pound;40 million package of support for clean energy technologies. Also, in his Budget statement this year the Chancellor undertook to assess support for the development of CCS in the Climate Change Programme Review (CCPR), including the potential for economic incentives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1231W.15/3">In addition to this we will continue to fund research and development in this area under the DTI's Technology Programme. Under the Cleaner Coal Technology R and D Programme from 1999 up to 2008, the Government will have committed some &pound;13.5 million in supporting UK industry to develop cleaner coal technologies. In addition to this we are also committing some &pound;3.5 million for UK industry and academia to collaborate with the USA to develop these technologies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1238W.11/2">The UK has long fought for the withdrawal of subsidy for the growing of tobacco and the lack of controls highlighted by the report of the Court of Auditors serves to reinforce this view. We are concerned at the failures by member states to apply the required controls and unsatisfactory monitoring by the Commission. While the reform of the tobacco regime agreed at the Luxembourg Council in April 2004 will result in full decoupling of the tobacco subsidy by 2010 we expect every effort to be made to ensure that the controls required by existing legislation are followed and, if necessary, corrective action taken. We will continue to take every opportunity to press the Commission for updates on the progress it is making to ensure member states are applying the required controls and on how it is addressing the issue of financial corrections.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.5/1">The EU Joint Situation Centre (SitCen) monitors and assesses events and situations worldwide on a 24-hour basis with a focus on potential crisis regions, terrorism and WMD-proliferation. The SitCen also provides support to the EU High Representative, Special Representatives and other senior officials, as well as for EU crisis management operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.5/2">The SitCen is divided into three units: the Civilian intelligence Cell (CIC), comprising civilian intelligence analysts working on political and counter-terrorism assessment; the General Operations Unit (GOU), providing 24-hour operational support, research and non-intelligence analysis; and the Communications Unit, handling communications security issues and running the council's communications centre (ComCen).</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.5/3">This creation of a CT analytical capacity within the CIC, which became active on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase>, has been the major aspect of SitCen's development since the attacks of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-11">11 March</phrase> in Madrid. As set out in The Hague multi-annual work programme, the intention is that SitCen furnishes the council with strategic intelligence-based assessments on counter-terrorism matters. An initial six month work programme has been set up to reflect the priorities of Heads of State as set out in the ED Action Plan on terrorism. This cross-pillar work programme incorporates justice and home affairs priorities, as well as those issues highlighted by external policy working groups. As such, it includes for example, assessments on threats to modes of transport; threats to critical national infrastructure targets in EU member states; and an assessment of trends in terrorist financing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.5/4">SitCen's priorities had hitherto largely focused on Common Foreign and Security Policy issues and did not serve to provide the necessary JHA input. With the CT Cell's work programme now reflecting broader EU CTpriorities it is intended to add support to current policy areas. This is the principal area where the SitCen CT Cell can contribute to JHA work: strategic intelligence-based assessments on counter-terrorism matters in support of current policy discussions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1252W.2/1">None&mdash;information is not available on which to base such estimates reliably.</p>
	<p pid="a.1252W.2/2">The data collection exercise undertaken to facilitate the development of the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), which ended in December 2004, identified 26 schemes (with some 7,000 members) which started to wind up between <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December 2004</phrase>. Of those schemes, six (with some 1,400 members) appear to be sponsored by employers that had not undergone an insolvency event at that time. However, given the information provided before and during the exercise on the likely scope of the FAS, it is probable that some schemes connected to solvent employers did not provide returns.</p>

	<p pid="a.1259W.2/1">The proportion of women retiring with a full basic state pension will rise substantially over the next 20 years. Measures such as Home Responsibilities Protection, improved participation in the labour market and tax credits have all contributed to this. In addition, with the introduction of state second pension, the proportion of women who are now accruing significant second state pension rights is similar to that of men. This represents a major improvement on the old system of SERPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.2/2">Of course we want to do more. That is why one of our principles for reform is that the pensions system should produce fair outcomes for women and carers. We have embarked on a National Pensions Debate to build consensus as to the best way to achieve this. As part of this debate we will be publishing an analysis of women's pension position.</p>

As the funding available is limited we need to ensure that any assistance we provide will make a considerable impact. That is why the draft regulations on the Financial Assistance Scheme(FAS), which we issued for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-04">4 April</phrase>, provide help to those within three years of their scheme pension age, or above their scheme pension age, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase>. Members of pension schemes set up by small firms will be eligible for such help provided the schemes and members also meet the other qualifying criteria. Following the end of the consultation period, draft regulations setting up FAS will be laid in Parliament shortly. We have made a commitment to review FAS, including its funding, in the next Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1271W.2/1">The forthcoming review of ports policy will address questions around port capacity and future port development. As part of the preparatory work for the review, the Department has commissioned consultants to produce national port traffic forecasts for Great Britain through to 2030. These forecasts will be disaggregated by region and traffic type, and will be published as part of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1271W.2/2">The Department issued guidance on new port developments in April 2003. A Project Appraisal Framework for Ports&quot; aims to assist promoters of, those affected by, and others who may wish to make representations about, port developments. In arriving at decisions on these developments, the factors that have been considered will be made clear at the time those decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1271W.2/3">The review will also look at wider issues, including environmental factors, local regeneration, productivity, and the role of ports in our overall transport strategy.</p>

Therefore, while the Highways Agency will continue to assess the impact and likely safety consequences of individual roadside advertisements, I do not believe that further research is likely to be any more effective in establishing such a link.</p>

The Agency has ensured that there are sufficient staff available to process at least this number of conversions.</p>

We have pressed the Iranian authorities on many occasions to allow the Baha'is to practise their faith without interference, and will continue to do so, both bilaterally and through the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.5/1">We are not aware that the Iranian authorities have acknowledged the authenticity of the 1991 memorandum, nor commented in detail on current policy towards the Baha&quot;'-&quot;s. The Baha&quot;'-&quot;s are the largest non-Muslim religious group in Iran, yet unlike Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, are not recognised in Iran's constitution. Members of the Baha&quot;'-&quot; community have suffered intimidation and harassment, had property confiscated and been denied access to education and employment, apparently on account of their faith. A number of Baha&quot;'-&quot; sites have been demolished, organisers of Baha&quot;'-&quot; community activities have reportedly been harassed and the Baha&quot;'-&quot; faith has been denigrated in the state-owned media. Many of these acts appear to have been carried out by, or with the support or acquiescence of, the Iranian authorities.</p>

We have regularly urged the Government of North Korea to return to the Six Party Talks, and to engage constructively with a view to agreement on the verifiable dismantlement of all its nuclear weapons programmes.

	<p pid="a.1287W.3/1">Vietnam is a one-party state in which the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) decides all major policy issues. The country's current leadership was confirmed by the last major 9th Communist Party V Party Congress in 2001. Vietnam is expected to continue its successful doi moi (renovation) economic reform programme at the next CPV Party Congress in 2006. No significant changes to Vietnam's political system are expected. Vietnam's next major challenge is to join the World Trade Organisation, possibly late this year, which should further consolidate and spur its economic reforms.</p>

The Department for International Development's (DFID) support to Vietnam is one of the fastest growing UK aid programmes in the world, assisting Vietnam's social and economic development including the transition to a market-based economy.</p>

ONS are planning a substantial programme of question testing and consultation with users of census data for the next few years and it is not possible to confirm what questions are to be included in the 2011 census until this is complete.</p>

The criteria for including questions in the 2011 census are set out in the consultation paper, which can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1292W.8/4" class="indent">Death rates in England and Wales vary seasonally, being lower in summer than in the winter months. However, analyses of urban populations indicates that all-cause mortality rises during heatwaves. In most summers, temperatures do not get high enough to raise mortality from the usual seasonal low. The main exceptions in recent years were 1995 and 2003. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has carried out special analysis into excess deaths during the 1995 and 2003 heatwaves. The analysis of the 1995 heatwave, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&quot; in February 1998, found that there were an estimated 619 extra deaths in England and Wales between <phrase class="date" code="">30 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">3 August</phrase> compared to the expected number of deaths based on the 31-day moving average for that period. The analysis found that excess deaths were apparent in all age-groups. The analysis of the 2003 heatwave, published in Health Statistics Quarterly 25&quot; in February 2005, found that there were 2,091 excess deaths in England between 4 and <phrase class="date" code="">13 August</phrase> compared to the average for the same period in the previous five years. The analysis found that the elderly (aged 75 and over) were most affected by the heatwave.</p>

These occasions are normally requested and arranged by other interested parties, including other Government departments, the devolved Administrations, local authorities and the wider public sector, the legal community, suppliers and NGOs, and are separate from OGC's formal consultation process. Article 45 often features in such discussions, along with all other main provisions of the new Directive.

An initial RIA on the directive was carried out and the assessment concluded that as well as improving awareness of energy efficiency the directive would help reduce carbon emissions. A separate RIA on the energy report has not been carried out. A full RIA for the directive will be produced before regulations for its implementation are laid in Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.1309W.6/2">Although an agreement to sell a house in England and Wales is usually made subject to contract&quot; and is unenforceable until contracts are exchanged, the parties may, at the outset, enter into an enforceable contract for the payment of compensation if one of them pulls out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.6/3">In its review of the home buying and selling process in 1998, the Government concluded that it would not be appropriate to make such compensation agreements compulsory, given the wide variety of circumstances that could cause a sale to fail and the difficulty of apportioning blame.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.6/4">The Government have, instead, enacted legislation that is expected, when fully implemented, to help reduce the incidence of failed transactions and to make the process more transparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.6/5">The provision, by sellers, of home information packs should ensure that offers are made on an informed basis and buyers are not taken unawares by problems with the property at a late stage in the transaction. This should reduce the length of the period between agreeing terms and exchange of contracts, when most of the problems occur. The Government intend to introduce compulsory Home Information Packs from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.6/6">The introduction of electronic conveyancing, also from 2007, will include a chain matrix&quot; revealing the stage reached by each transaction to all the other participants in the chain. This information should enable those involved in the chain to make realistic assessments of the situation and to resolve delays more quickly.</p>

A list of the sites on the register, as at March 2005, can be found on the English Partnerships website at: <a href="http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C904340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf">http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C904340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1315W.8/1">Under the Key Worker Living programme, the responsible Government Department for the education, health, prison and probation sectors decide the eligibility criteria based on recruitment and retention evidence gathered at a local level. For the Police and Fire Services, it is the contributing force, not the Home Office or the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), which determines eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1315W.8/2">As part of the consultation on low cost home ownership HomeBuy: Expanding the Opportunity to Own&quot; we are proposing to allow Regional Housing Boards to define eligibility for our new First Time Buyer programme, which could include key workers not currently included in the definition of Key Worker Living to reflect local priorities. ODPM will shortly be reviewing those recommendations and will make a statement on future eligibility in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1316W.5/18">The data used to calculate the changes are taken from data as reported by local authorities; they are outturn figures for 1998&ndash;99 to 2003&ndash;04 and budget estimates for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.1316W.5/19">Changes between years may not be valid due to changing local authority responsibilities. For example, the decrease for fire authorities between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 is due partly to the lower levels of grant per capita received by combined fire authorities compared with other fire authorities. Before 2004&ndash;05 grants were not paid directly to combined fire authorities and so these were not included in the figures for earlier years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1317W.12/1">Under the Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002 local authorities have wide discretionary powers to provide assistance to homeowners and tenants to repair, improve and adapt their homes&mdash;including for example, equity release loans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.12/2">Since then there has been a slow switch from local authorities offering renovation grants to loans including equity release packages. The latest figures available show that authorities made available &pound;1.2 million in loans for this purpose in 2003&ndash;04 (0.5 per cent. of total assistance given) and planned to increase this to &pound;8.8 million in 2004&ndash;05 (2.7 per cent.). This compares with a total level of housing renewal assistance (grants and loans for home improvement) made available by local authorities of &pound;256 million in 2003&ndash;04, increasing to a planned level of &pound;325 million for 2004/05. Separate figures on the proportion of loans offered as equity release are not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.12/3">Local authority's use of their new powers has been monitored through a research project sponsored jointly between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and undertaken by the Centre of Urban and Regional Studies at the University of Birmingham. The final report of this study is expected to be published shortly. The preliminary conclusions of it are that the switch from grants to loans is proceeding at a relatively slow pace but that the majority of local authorities are now actively considering such a change.</p>

This includes mainstream courses, as well as a proposed strategy for e-learning, a consultation document on which will be published in the autumn.

	<p pid="a.1324W.3/1">While no assessment has been made of the compliance of public services in Northern Ireland with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), and nor is there any legislative requirement to do so, Government are fully committed to complying with all the requirements of the DDA. To this end, in relation to the access duties of the DDA, Accessibility Audits have been carried out on 168 of the 205 buildings within the Northern Ireland Civic Service Estate. Four buildings are still to be audited and the remaining 33 buildings do not require to be audited or to have adjustments made at this time because there is no public interface, no disabled member of staff or for operational reasons. All sites are kept under review and changes made if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324W.3/2">Public service providers must ensure they are meeting their duties under the Act and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland can provide detailed advice and information on meeting these requirements. In its publication Code of Practice, Rights of Access&mdash;Goods, Facilities, Services and Premises&quot; the Commission recommends, as good practice, that service providers themselves consider certain steps to ensure compliance with the DDA. These include regularly reviewing whether their services are accessible to disabled people and consulting disabled customers, disabled staff and disability organisations about the accessibility of their services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1325W.0/1">The pilot rapid transit scheme known as EWAY&quot; is included in the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan 2015, which was published in November 2004. This is a large, complex and expensive scheme and as with all such schemes, it is dependent on funding being available and is subject to a range of evaluation and statutory processes. Due to other higher priorities at present, it has not been possible to provide funding for EWAY in the Budget period to end 2008. The affordability of the scheme will however be kept under review in future budget rounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1330W.9/1">The Police Service of Northern Ireland recently conducted a review of typing services within the organisation. The review was necessary to reflect the reality in recent years of the reduction in police officer numbers overall and the significant investment in information technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330W.9/2">As a result of that review all typing manager posts were disestablished, and no typing manager posts currently exist in any District Command Unit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1336W.11/1">The Bar Council does not hold information centrally about the earnings of barristers in their first tenancy or those who have been qualified for one year. This information is difficult to collect since barristers are not salaried, they are self-employed and their earnings will depend on where they work and the work they carry out. Many junior barristers will have a varied caseload that can include civil and criminal work. The Bar is considering the possibility of collecting such data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336W.11/2">The Law Society has provided some information about the average earnings of solicitors generally. Figures for average salaries earned from criminal work are not collated separately. In 2004, the average salary of a solicitor in the first year of their training contract was &pound;20,013 and the average salary for newly qualified solicitors was &pound;32,139. The figure of &pound;32,139 is however based on a survey with small sample sizes. Solicitors' earnings are generally dependent on the grade they operate at, the size and location of the firm.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336W.11/3">There is a minimum starting salary for trainee solicitors recommended by the Council of the Law Society. The 2004 minimum figure is set at &pound;15,900 for Central London and &pound;14,200 for Outer London and the rest of England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.1339W.9/2">People who live in deprived areas are less likely to attend for screening for breast cancer. Including cultural and religious reasons, women from minority ethnic groups are less likely to accept invitations for screening than the general population as a whole. Language and access to information can be a significant barrier and can affect the coverage levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.9/3">A number of steps have been taken to improve this situation:</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.9/4" class="indent">The national informed choice leaflet, Breast Screening: The Facts&quot;, which is sent out with every invitation for screening, has now been translated into 18 languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.9/5" class="indent">In December 2003, national health service cancer screening programmes published Inequalities of Access to Cancer Screening: A Literature Review&quot;. The recommendations in the review have been sent to all local screening programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.9/6" class="indent">A number of local actions have been put in place to combat inequalities in inner-city areas. For example, in Haringey, sessions on screening have been held in community centres, with advocates from the relevant communities attending to translate and encourage women to attend their screening appointment. Many primary care trusts are conducting similar initiatives across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.9/7" class="indent">In 2004, to raise awareness about the availability of breast cancer screening, the NHS cancer screening programmes issued a regional communications pack to all local breast screening programmes to increase coverage rates. The packs include advice on raising the awareness of screening, including posters.</p>

	<p pid="a.1340W.5/1">We are committed to reducing inequality of outcomes in all cancers. We have a commitment to reduce death rates from cancer in under-75s by at least 20 per cent. by 2010, with a reduction in the inequalities gap of at least 6 per cent. between the fifth of areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators, the spearhead primary care trusts (PCTs), and the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.5/2">Statistics for women diagnosed between 1996 to 1999 showed that five year survival rates for women with breast cancer in the most affluent areas were 5.8 per cent. higher than those in the most deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.5/3">It is not clear precisely why survival rates vary. However, women in more deprived areas are more likely to have advanced breast cancer at the point of diagnosis. Work is under development to encourage people, especially in less affluent areas, to seek help from their general practitioner earlier. We will be piloting programmes in some spearhead PCTs, looking at knowledge and attitudes towards cancer, as well as working with the voluntary sector to learn from previous awareness-raising campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="a.1344W.6/1">The Government aim to build on the United Kingdom's reputation as an excellent place for clinical research. With partners, it established the UK clinical research collaboration (UKCRC) to co-ordinate major new investment in clinical research infrastructure. The UKCRC includes Government and other public funders of research, as well as industry and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1344W.6/2">It is too soon to assess the effect of the European Clinical Trials Directive. The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 1031) came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. They implemented Directive 2001/20/EC in the UK. That Directive required the Commission to publish detailed guidelines on good clinical practice The Commission published a Good Clinical Practice Directive (2005/28/EC) in April2005. Member states are required to implement it by January 2006. The Commission has yet to publish related guidelines for non-commercial trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.1344W.6/3">The Government are committed to make an assessment as soon as reliable evidence is available. The MHRA acts as the licensing authority for all clinical trials within the scope of the Directive. It has asked the UKCRC to review the evidence to date, consider how to reduce any adverse regulatory impact and agree plans for long-term monitoring. Cancer Research UK and the national clinical research network have undertaken initial assessments of opinion about the effect of the Directive on cancer clinical trials across the UK. Other assessments are being carried out at the European level with the Federation of European Cancer Societies. The UKCRC core team has agreed to bring together findings from these and other studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1344W.6/4">The Government welcome the important contributions that Cancer Research UK and other stakeholders are making in monitoring the implementation of the Clinical Trials Directive, and will consider their findings carefully.</p>

	<p pid="a.1348W.2/1">National dental health surveys are carried out every 10 years; the latest survey is for the year 2003. Results and comparisons with the results of the 1993 survey are available on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/children/dentalhealth/">www.statistics.gov.uk/children/dentalhealth/</a>. Results are not available for areas as small as counties because of the small sample size, but regional results for five-year-old children are given in tables 1.5 and 1.6 for the proportion of children with obvious decay experience and for the mean number of teeth with obvious decay experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.2/2">A separate report on this survey has been prepared on social factors and oral health in children, which analyses the United Kingdom figures. This is also available on the ONS website. The report includes analyses of tooth decay by an assessment of deprivation of the school together with analyses by socio-economic status of the household.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.2/3">The findings of these surveys confirm that there is a strong correlation between dental disease and social and economic deprivation, which we are addressing in connection with implementation of the Government's commitment to reduce health inequalities. The fluoridation of water offers the best prospect for reducing inequalities in oral health. Changes made in the Water Act 2003 to the legislative framework governing fluoridation have made it a realistic option for strategic health authorities to consider for improving the oral health of their populations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1349W.2/2">The Department has provided primary care trusts (PCTs) with guidance on the criteria they need to apply in considering proposals for pilot personal dental services (PDS). Guidance has been set out in a step-by-step guide to PDS and augmented with training sessions provided by the Department's national PDS team.</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.2/3">The key elements or criteria of this guidance are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.2/4" class="indent">Each proposal for PDS should be considered in the context of the PCTs assessment of the oral health needs of their population and the level and range of dental services necessary to serve those needs satisfactorily. The assessment of needs and the actions necessary to serve them would usually be set out in the form of a local action plan, agreed with the relevant strategic health authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.2/5" class="indent">The prime aim of each proposal should be to at least preserve the current level of commitment to the NHS and wherever possible secure additional national health service provision in line with the requirements, which have been identified locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.2/6" class="indent">The actual level of growth funding appropriate to each PDS application needs to match the NHS provision being proposed and to be affordable within the budget allocated to the PCT for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.1349W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase> the Council of the Heads of Medical Schools and the Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools published a joint survey, which shows that there remain vacancies in clinical academic posts. We are embarking upon the biggest programme of investment in dental education since the inception of the national health service. Additional recurring funding rising to &pound;29 million by 2010&ndash;11 has been allocated to provide for 170 additional undergraduate training places from October 2005. The expansion will be supported by new capital investment of &pound;20 million in each of the four years 2005&ndash;06 to 2008&ndash;09. It will be for the dental schools to decide how to use these funds, but there is no doubt that this additional investment in the dental schools will improve the working environment and career prospects of dental academics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.5/3">The joint Department of Health/Department of Education and Skills Strategic Learning and Research Advisory (StLaR) Group for Health and Social Care has overseen production of a human resources plan project for the educator and researcher workforce across all professions in health and social care. A project board has been established which includes representatives of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the university and service sector. The board's remit includes the identification and implementation of measures to improve all aspects of academic careers for medically and dentally-qualified researchers and educationalists.</p>

	<p pid="a.1355W.11/2">The main agency through which the Government support medical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). It is a long-standing and important principle, held to by successive Administrations, that the Government do not prescribe how individual research councils should distribute their resources between competing priorities. In 2003&ndash;04, the MRC spent some &pound;2.4 million on research relevant to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In March 2004, the former Secretary of State <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">my right hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, North and Bellshill (John Reid)</phrase>, announced an award of &pound;1.6 million over three years to fund gene therapy research for DMD. This is pioneering research and it is not possible to know in advance of completion of the preliminary work already funded by the Department whether this approach is likely to be successful. We look forward to receiving progress reports from the DMD research consortium in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1357W.2/1">The Department consulted with faith communities when producing the national service frameworks for coronary heart disease, diabetes and mental health. The Department and the national health service continue to engage faith communities in public health campaigns such as smoking cessation and organ donation. The Department also maintains close contact with a multi-faith group, which was independently formed by and comprises of representatives of a wide range of faith communities, as part of our commitment to a multi-faith approach to NHS chaplaincy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1357W.2/3" class="indent">The development of the departmental guidance, NHS Chaplaincy: Meeting the Religious and Spiritual Needs of Patients and Staff&quot;, published in November 2003 and the Department's subsequent review of the central funding arrangements in the summer of 2004. The review was conducted with the participation of the multi-faith group, Hospital Chaplaincies Council, College of Health Care Chaplains, Free Churches Council, South Yorkshire Workforce Development Confederation, Jewish Visitation Committee, Muslim Council of Britain and representatives from the other main world faiths. This report was followed by a further consultation period to allow the faith groups to comment on the recommendations made in the report. The Department and its representatives met regularly with the above groups during this time, culminating with the Department's response, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.2/4" class="indent">In November 2003, the Department organised a stakeholder event including representatives of faith communities as part of the national consultation on Fair for All Personal to You: Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS&quot;. Stakeholders had the opportunity to contribute ideas to choice, responsiveness and equity in the provision of health and social services that are more patient-centred and fair to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.2/5" class="indent">In the field of mental health, the National Institute for Mental Health in England is collaborating with the Mental Health Foundation on a project exploring the links between spirituality and mental health. The aim of the project is to collate current thinking on the importance of spirituality in mental health, to evaluate the role of faith communities, and to develop and promote good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.2/6" class="indent">Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care&quot;, the Government's action plan for tackling inequalities in services for black and minority ethnic communities, was published in January 2005 and was based on wide consultation including representatives of faith groups. It states clearly that everyone who experiences mental ill health is entitled to a safe and clinically effective environment that respects their beliefs, culture, faith, spiritual needs, background and values. Local health agencies are expected to form partnerships with diverse faith communities, providing a forum for discussion about mental health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1361W.12/2">There are currently no plans to re-organise primary care trusts (PCTs) in Gloucestershire. PCTs are central to improving the health of their populations by commissioning high quality care. As we implement the next stage of the national health service reforms, including practice based commissioning and streamlining NHS management, PCTs will need to change and develop. These changes need to reflect local circumstances and form part of a structured programme for the NHS as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.1366W.2/2">Government policy is to move to a position of full cost recovery, where the fee income received by inspectorates, such as the Healthcare Commission, matches the costs incurred in carrying out regulatory work. Our intention is that the Healthcare Commission should achieve a position of full cost recovery by 2008 at the latest. The regulatory fee increase for 2005&ndash;06, announced in February 2005, was a step in that direction. No decisions have been taken about the level of fees in future years, though the costs of registration and inspection are still higher than the sum collected by the Healthcare Commission in fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.2/3">When the fee levels for 2005&ndash;06 were announced in February, my noble Friend Lord Warner, the then Under Secretary wrote to private and voluntary health care providers telling them of the new fees; he also confirmed that the Department would be working with the Healthcare Commission to develop a timetable for the Commission to take on responsibility for fee setting and that we anticipated that the Commission would assume responsibility from April 2006. I understand that in preparation for taking on that responsibility, the Commission has established a programme to look at costs and the different types of providers it regulates so that when it is given the power to set fees, it will have comprehensive information on which to base its approach. The Commission would also consult publicly on any new fee structure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1367W.8/1">No central records are kept of laptops provided specifically to previous Ministers and special advisers. However, current Ministers and special advisers have been assigned a laptop each, where they have a requirement for one. In the last financial year, there were six Ministers, three of whom had a requirement and in this financial year, six Ministers, of whom four have laptops. Three special advisers had laptops last year. Two of the three special advisers this year have been allocated a laptop, with potential for a third adviser also to have one. This reflects the situation since 1995 where laptops have been assigned as required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367W.8/2">At present, there are 2,310 laptops within the Department, which are either stand-alone models or configured to access the Department's computer network remotely. This number encompasses the laptops issued to Ministers, special advisers and officials of the Department. The officials include contractors working on behalf of the Department. Records do not show any differentiation between officials and contractors so cannot be identified separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367W.8/3">The number of laptops is taken from an asset register, which is updated constantly and provides a snapshot figure. Figures from previous years are therefore not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367W.8/4">The cost of usage in this context is taken to mean the cost of support and maintenance of the laptops by the information technology service provider (ISP). The structure of the ISP charging model means that it is not possible to demonstrate the costs of usage of individual laptops. Their overall charge includes elements covering several services: help desk, incident and problem resolution (including hardware maintenance), second and third line support, and service management charges. It is not simply a case of aggregating the charge and dividing by the number of laptops to produce a yearly cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367W.8/5">The numbers of laptops lost or stolen and the cost and usage of laptops within the last 10 years are shown in the table.</p>

We will also continue to encourage service providers to widen the skills mix by supplementing the existing professional roles with new ones such as support, time and recovery workers. The Department will continue to support initiatives to improve the quality of patient care and performance by investing in national health service staff and setting common standards of quality and governance; and achieve better value for money and control over temporary staffing costs through the use of NHS professionals and agency framework agreements. The ongoing review of mental health nursing is also considering the use of agency nursing staff and a report is expected to be published next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1372W.8/2">The national service framework for mental health (1999) and the mental health policy implementation guide on adult acute inpatient care (2002) require a flexible range of appropriate therapeutic and recreational resources and activities to be available in mental health inpatient settings. The latter requires the creation and maintenance of a therapeutic activity milieu to include evening and weekend activities and opportunities both on and off the ward which may include educational, social, daily living, artistic, recreational and leisure activities. The national minimum standards for general adult services in psychiatric intensive care units and low secure environments (2002) requires all patients to have access to fresh air and secure external space and space for regular exercise with appropriate supervision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1377W.5/1">There are no plans for the standardisation of orthopaedic prosthesis. However, the National Joint Registry (NJS) was established in April 2003 to collect information on total hip and knee replacement operations from hospitals in England and Wales. Both the national health service and independent health care sector are included. The NJR will enable surgeons, in discussion with patients, to agree which is the most appropriate prosthetic for individual patients needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.5/2">NJR participation is not mandatory although trusts are exhorted to comply. The level of compliance is improving and currently stands at 98.7 per cent. in both the NHS and independent hospitals. The NJR steering group became an advisory non-departmental public body (ANDPB) in January 2005. The NJR steering group is reviewing the data collected to ensure the NJR can become a powerful clinical audit tool.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.5/3">We are committed to giving patients more choice and control over their health care and services wherever possible. However, it is important to ensure that patients are only offered clinically appropriate choices. The NJR will enable surgeons to use the most appropriate orthopaedic prosthetic for specific patients needs, thus improving the quality of life for the patient post operatively.</p>

From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, 18 national health service primary care trusts (PCTs) assumed commissioning responsibility for the primary health care services in 34 publicly run prison establishments in England.

Contractors continue to have responsibility for the provision of primary care services in their establishments under terms specified in their contracts with the Home Office. However, a full strategic review is being conducted of the health care elements of the contracts to run privately managed prisons to ensure that they bind contractors robustly into the principle of equivalence with the NHS. Work is also under way with the Healthcare Commission to seek to develop a system of inspection of health services in privately managed prisons that is equivalent to that in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.1382W.2/2">Raising the age of sale for tobacco from 16 years to 18 years is opposed by the health lobby and anti-smoking groups like ASH. There is also a lack of good evidence that increasing the age at which tobacco is legally sold has any impact on smoking rates among young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1382W.2/3">For that reason, we have concentrated our effort on ensuring that the existing age limits are effectively enforced. The Choosing Health White Paper set out proposals as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1382W.2/4" class="indent">we propose that legislation be brought forward to create new powers to ban retailers from selling tobacco products, on a temporary basis, if they repeatedly flout the law. This complements the work already under way to improve proof of age schemes. We intend to support this measure by looking at higher fines and updated guidance for magistrates, along with education for retailers on better compliance with underage sales law. Before introducing these measures, we will consult with local authorities, the retail industry and other key stakeholders&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1384W.8/1">The Government are concerned about the possible health effects, in particular on coronary health, from consuming certain fats. As part of delivering commitments in the Choosing Health White Paper of last November, the Government are developing a strategy with stakeholders for tackling intakes of certain fats. There are currently no plans to commission research on the health effects of consuming trans fats as it is known that at high levels, like saturated fats, they raise the type of cholesterol in the blood that increases the risk of coronary heart disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.8/2">The Food Standards Agency has provided information and advice, on its Eatwell website, to consumers about the role of fat in the diet and the possible health effects from consuming high levels of trans fats.</p>
