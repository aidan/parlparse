	<p pid="a.671W.5/2">The Government's approach to broadband is to drive the rollout of superfast broadband to as much of the country as possible and to deliver at least a decent level of broadband access to virtually everybody as part of that commitment. That approach is underpinned by the work that BDUK conducted over summer 2010 examining the choice of cost effective solutions available to provide a minimum level of coverage to all premises without access to at least 2 MBps. Among the conclusions of that exercise was that a universal service commitment should not be seen as separate from the superfast broadband objective, but rather an integral part of pushing next generation networks deep into rural Britain. The &#163;530 million allocated to support broadband rollout up to 2015 will help the UK achieve its aim of having the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015.</p>

The Government are committed to getting as many people as possible online by the end of the Olympic year, 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.673W.11/2">Data from the ODA's eTendering system, covering procurements with an estimated value in excess of &#163;25,000, shows that a total of 46 bids (or Pre Qualification Questionnaire applications) have been submitted by companies based in the North East.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.11/3">The ODA was established in April 2006 and set up its eTendering system in February 2007. Tenders under &#163;25,000 are not tracked through the ODA's central procurement system. To establish where firms are based for tenders before February 2007 or under &#163;25,000 would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.11/4">The ODA Information on businesses that have directly supplied the ODA is available in the business section of the London 2012 website under the heading ODA suppliers, where you will be able to find suppliers listed by venue and sector:</p>

	<p pid="a.673W.11/6">These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. For example, steelworks for the Olympic Stadium was provided by Geoffrey Maskell Engineering in Durham, and Newcastle based International Paint have supplied paint to the Aquatics Centre. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into hundreds of millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.0/1">In the current fiscal climate, we have not considered making additional public funds available, but some listed piers may be eligible to apply to English Heritage for funding, who also contribute advice as part of their planning responsibilities, and from the Heritage Lottery Fund, where a strong case can be made for public benefit. In addition, some pier restoration projects in private ownership have been successful without public funding, for example Weston Grand Pier. The new 'community right to buy' provisions in the Localism Bill will give local groups a legal right to bid for and take over the running of threatened community assets which includes piers.</p>

In October 2010 I published HS2 Ltd's comparative economic case of two initial high speed rail network options, again, each with links to Leeds. The work on the Government's preferred initial network will be updated as part of the forthcoming consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.685W.2/2">The Home Office provides funding to voluntary, community group, charity and social enterprise (VCSE) organisations through the Positive Futures programme, a community based prevention programme targeting vulnerable 10 to 19-year-olds at risk of drug and alcohol misuse or crime in 91 areas. While the programme has a wider agenda, work delivered locally may include elements of drug prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.685W.2/3">The Department has funded 53 VCSE projects in 2010-11 to deliver Positive Futures in their local communities. The organisations and their grant allocations for 2010-11 are set out in the following table. The remaining 38 projects are local authority run but some do involve the VCSE in delivery of some aspects of their work such as the provision of activities or accredited training or learning programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.685W.2/4">In addition, Drug Interventions Programme funding to local partnerships to manage drug misusing offenders is used by some partnerships to fund VCSE organisations. This may include some elements of prevention but the Home Office does not monitor which organisations are contracted locally to deliver services nor the services that they provide.</p>

	<p pid="a.686W.2/2">The Home Office has undertaken a number of research and analytical projects in recent years into the harms caused by drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.686W.2/3">The Department developed the drug harm index (DHI) in 2005 to measure the harms generated by illegal drug use in order to measure progress against a previous public service agreement target. This combined national indicators of various drug-related harms including those related to drug-related crime, community perceptions of drug problems, drug nuisance, and the various health consequences that arise from drug abuse (e.g. HIV, overdoses, deaths etc.) into a single figure time-series index. Results from the DHI were published for the period 2002 (the baseline year) to 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.686W.2/4">The Home Office has produced an estimate of the social and economic costs of Class A drug use for the reference year 2003-04 taking into account a range of quantifiable harms. This was published in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.686W.2/5">More recently the Home Office undertook a national evaluation of drug treatment in England which found that drug treatment is effective in reducing the harms associated with problem drug use. This was published in 2009. Additionally, in 2010, the Home Office published research on the perceptions of the social harms associated with use of khat.</p>

	<p pid="a.688W.5/1">The evidential value and integrity of forensic exhibits is tested under the intense scrutiny of the courts from the point of collection, through analysis and to interpretation and reporting. Each step in the process must be able to withstand these critical reviews. The Forensic Science Regulator is working closely with the police, the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), the private and public sector (Scottish and Irish laboratories) suppliers of forensic science services to produce a single quality standards framework that applies to all those organisations involved in varying stages of the forensic processes. The NPIA provide up to date advice and guidance through their own forensic experts and the ACPO-led Forensics 21 Programme, which has a performance and standards group chaired by DCC John Fletcher, Bedfordshire police.</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.5/2">Police forces have their own forensic practitioners who support each other through 'expert panels' facilitated by the NPIA, and on many occasions take advice from the private sector suppliers. The police have ready access to different sources of reliable advice, as well as their own in-house knowledge and expertise.</p>

	<p pid="a.689W.2/1">The Forensic Science Regulator was appointed to set and monitor quality standards in forensic science across the board; he is working closely with the police, the National Policing Improvement Agency and the private sector laboratories to develop a single quality standards framework. The regulator is a member of the Forensic Science Service Transition Board and will monitor the movement of forensic science services to ensure that quality standards are maintained. All the private sector forensic science laboratories across the UK work to demanding quality standards and are accredited against BS/EN ISO 17025 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories) by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service. This is the standard adopted by the Forensic Science Regulator for forensic science laboratory functions and is a requirement of the police contracts with the laboratories. ISO 17025 is also the standard being adopted by the police in-house fingerprint enhancement laboratories with an NPIA-led project to co-ordinate the adoption of the standard by all police forces, in line with the European Union framework decision which mandates it, by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.691W.9/1">The alcohol provisions in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill are designed to ensure that local communities have more of a say in the decisions taken in their local area. The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill introduces a late night levy where 70% of the net revenue raised will be passed to the police by licensing authorities who choose to implement it. The police could use this revenue to pay for late night policing linked to alcohol related crime and disorder. In addition, the amendments to early morning restriction orders will assist the police and local authorities to take action that reflects the needs of their local communities in policing the night time economy.</p>

However, an independent evaluation of the ALSF programme of work for the years 2008-11 was recently carried out by the In House Policy Resource unit, and the results are available on the ALSF pages on the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.696W.2/1">The UK seeks to comply with EU law and the Government made a commitment in the coalition agreement to work towards EU air quality standards. We are making great efforts to ensure that we do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.2/2">The Commission is able to request the European Court to impose a daily fine, a lump sum fine, or both. As a guide to the levels which have been set by the Commission, a daily fine is calculated by multiplying a uniform flat rate (currently &#8364;640) by coefficients for seriousness and duration, and then multiplying this figure by a special factor for each member state, which for the UK has been set at 18.31. The minimum lump sum fine (for the UK) is set at &#8364;9.666 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.2/3">Current European Commission guidance (Commission Communication SEC (2005) 1658 as updated by Commission Communication SEC(2010) 923/3) sets out three criteria which are taken into account when calculating the level of fines. These are: the seriousness of the breach (which affects the lump sum only and can be a multiple of between 1 and 20), the duration of the breach (a multiple of between 1 and 3) and a deterrent factor designed to ensure the breach is rectified and the offence is not repeated. Each case is treated on its own merits, so it is extremely difficult to estimate the level of any fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.2/4">Any litigation costs would depend on how far the case goes, and the scope of the issues involved. It is very difficult to estimate these in advance.</p>

	<p pid="a.696W.5/1">There are no proposals to regulate advertising the sale of pets on the internet or in newspapers specifically. To regulate and police internet adverts would, even if it were feasible, require a considerable investment of resources. I am not satisfied that the net welfare benefits could justify Government giving further consideration to intervention in this area. With regard to newspaper adverts, welfare organisations have worked constructively with the newspaper industry to encourage self-policing and to raise customer awareness of what they should do when responding to small adverts. I am very grateful to those newspapers that have now decided to take positive steps to promote animal welfare and protect the interests of their readers. I do not consider that further action by Government is either feasible or necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.697W.2/1">The Pet Animals Act 1951 (as amended in 1983) controls the sale of all animals as pets from licensed premises. The 1951 Act requires any person selling pet animals to be licensed by the local authority. Before granting a licence, the authority must satisfy itself that the animals are kept in accommodation that is suitable and clean, that they are supplied with the appropriate food and drink, and are protected from disease and fire.</p>
	<p pid="a.697W.2/2">The maximum penalty under the 1951 Act is a fine of &#163;500 and/or three months' imprisonment. If a person is convicted under the Act or for any offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, a court may cancel any pet shop licence or disqualify a person from keeping a pet shop for any period as the court thinks fit. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 is the principal piece of legislation protecting all domestic and captive animals, in England and Wales. Under the 2006 Act, it is an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to-or fail to provide for the welfare needs of-any domestic or captive animal.</p>
	<p pid="a.697W.2/3">I am satisfied that the legislation currently in place relating to the selling of pet animals provides local authorities with the necessary powers to ensure that the welfare of animals is maintained.</p>

	<p pid="a.697W.8/1">The target to halt biodiversity loss by 2010 was an EU-wide one. The Commission reported in October last year that the EU had missed it. The UK provided details to the Commission on progress towards the target in early 2010. This showed that the decline in biodiversity had slowed and in some cases had been halted or reversed but that there remained a lot more to do. The EU has agreed a successor target to halt biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020. A strategy to deliver this new target is currently in preparation.</p>

	<p pid="a.699W.5/1">The Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999, which amended and extended the provisions of the Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 and the Breeding of Dogs Act 1991, provides protection for dogs used in breeding establishments. Under this legislation, any person who keeps a breeding establishment for dogs at any premises and carries on a business of breeding dogs for sale at those premises must obtain a licence from the local authority. Those people who are not in the business of breeding dogs for sale and produce less than five litters in any period of 12 months-so called &quot;hobby breeders&quot;-do not need to obtain a licence. Local authorities have powers to grant or withhold a licence as well as to inspect a pet shop for standards of welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.699W.5/2">The sale of dogs may also be regulated under the Pet Animals Act 1951 which regulates anyone who is in the business of selling pet animals. Similar powers for local authorities are provided here as under the dog breeding legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.699W.5/3">In addition to the specific law on the breeding and selling of dogs, there is also the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which places a duty on those who own or are responsible for animals to ensure their animals' welfare. This includes owners and keepers of dog breeding establishments. Failure to provide for the welfare of an animal could lead to a fine of up &#163;5,000 and/or six months imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.2/1">The Government are committed to combating violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people as an integral part of its international human rights work. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministers and officials regularly raise human rights issues, including the situation of LGBT people, during meetings with international counterparts. Earlier this month I visited Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago, and raised LGBT equality during discussions with government officials and non-government organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.2/2">The UK will continue to play a leading global role in ending inequality and discrimination against LGBT people. In July 2010, the Government published &quot;Working for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Equality&quot; to guide the UK's future work in promoting LGBT rights. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office contributed to the international section of the strategy which includes a commitment to pushing for unequivocal support for LGBT rights internationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.5/1">I have made the point to members of both the governing and Opposition parties, including President Museveni and the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, that it is crucial for both sides to engage constructively in the election process if it is to be deemed credible.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.5/2">Ugandan electoral law contains provisions for appeals on the results to be lodged with the Supreme Court within 10 days of election results being announced. The court then has a further 30 days to declare its findings. This process was followed effectively in 2001 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.5/3">Earlier in the process we lobbied for the adoption of a Code of Conduct Bill which would have enabled the Electoral Commission to convene electoral liaison and peace committees across the country to resolve disputes. However the Bill was not adopted. The UK, and other donors, have funded the Electoral Commission to introduce alternative mechanisms to resolve inter-party disputes (for example, the Inter-Party Dialogue (IPOD)) and a new system for handling complaints.</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.2/1">Uganda has a lively media, and their coverage inspires active public debate on current issues and criticism of government policies. But we are concerned about administrative and legal curbs on freedom of expression. We are aware of reports that some Opposition candidates have faced difficulty in accessing local media in some areas, although this is difficult to monitor in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.2/2">The UK has supported, via the Deepening Democracy Programme, projects to support a free media to promote accountability (including providing assistance to radio networks, media training and promotion of accurate messaging). We have also discussed the draft Press and Journalist Bill with the Ugandan Minister for Information and National Guidance. We have urged that any new regulation strikes an appropriate and legitimate balance between regulation and protection of the rights to freedom of expression and assembly.</p>

	<p pid="a.711W.0/1">The best information the Department holds in relation to examination fees in the secondary sector comes through the section 251 of the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 (ASCL) outturn data for local authorities. The response I gave my hon. Friend on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-10">10 January 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-01-10.83"><i> Official Report</i>, column 83W</phrase>, provides this information for 2002-03 and 2008-09. Further to that answer, the outturn data for 2009-10 has now been published and is available on the Department's website at the following web address:</p>
	<p pid="a.711W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/strategy/financeandfunding/section251/b0071584/s251-workbooks-outturn-2009-10">http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/strategy/financeandfunding/section251/b0071584/s251-workbooks-outturn-2009-10</a></p>
	<p pid="a.711W.0/3">The 2009-10 figures for public examination spend by maintained secondary schools is set out as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.711W.0/6"> <td></td> <td><i> 2009-10 (&#163;)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.711W.0/7"> <td>Spent by maintained secondary schools</td> <td>302,635,000</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.711W.0/9"> <td>Per pupil</td> <td>98</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.711W.0/12">This information is available because data is collected on how schools spend their funding. However, owing to the way in which the information in relation to school examination costs is collected, it is not certain whether all school sixth form examination costs (school years 12/13) are included in these figures. For the same reason, it is also not possible to split out the school sixth form examination costs from those for pre-16 (school years 10/11).</p>
	<p pid="a.711W.0/13">Similar information for the further education (FE) sector was collected by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) up to the 2006-07 financial year, but has not been collected since and is no longer collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.711W.0/14">Data supplied by the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) shows that public examinations cost sixth form colleges (SFCs) a total of &#163;25,810,000 in 2006-07, inclusive of any adult examination costs. This means an average cost of &#163;266,082 per SFC and &#163;177 per SFC student (all ages). It is not possible to provide comparable SFC examination cost data for the years preceding 2006-07 because the earlier records are substantially incomplete.</p>

	<p pid="a.712W.5/2">Local authorities have a statutory duty to secure sufficient suitable education and training opportunities to meet the reasonable needs of all 16 to 19-year-olds in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.5/3">In July 2010, the Secretary of State for Education announced a series of steps to simplify the funding system for 16 to 19-year-olds, including giving local authorities a key strategic leadership role to champion the interests of young people in their area. They may shape provision in their area by identifying gaps, enabling new provision and developing the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.5/4">The needs of young people are much more likely to be met where local authorities have strong partnerships with those who provide education and training. There is no prescription about how this should be done but, in developing their overview, local authorities will want to work with their key partners, including schools, colleges and other providers, to identify the education needs of young people in their area, the needs of employers and the extent to which those demands and needs are being met overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.5/5">From 2011/12 core 16 to 19 allocation budgets for school sixth forms and colleges will be based on the equivalent of lagged pupil numbers thus ensuring that funding more explicitly follows the young person. We are also devolving responsibility to institutions to decide on their curriculum offer and mix of provision so that they can respond to the needs of individual students.</p>

Governing bodies of both primary and secondary schools have a statutory responsibility to ensure that they have a sex education policy in place and this must be available to parents on request.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/3">It is important, therefore, that schools consult parents about the content of their SRE programmes and give them the opportunity to comment on content and the manner in which that content will be presented. Schools may decide to amend their SRE programmes if a majority of parents disagree with the content. Parents have the right to withdraw their children from SRE lessons.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/4">In the Schools White Paper, The Importance of Teaching, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-24">24 November</phrase>, we announced our intention to conduct an independent review to determine how we can support schools to improve the quality of all PSHE teaching, including SRE, and retain the flexibility of teachers to use their judgment about how best to deliver PSHE education.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.9/1">The Department for Work and Pensions has been working since May 2010 with its businesses, staff and suppliers to reduce carbon emissions from its offices, adopting a broad range of practical measures. These measures are designed to build on previous successes which have delivered a 23% (53,000 tonnes of CO2) reduction across the entire estate in the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.9/2">In June the Department and its estates partner Telereal Trillium jointly launched the 'AWaRE' (Avoiding Waste and Reducing Energy) campaign, an ongoing engagement plan designed to harness the enthusiasm of staff to deliver real improvements at a local level. This began by recruiting site-based volunteer 'Energy Wardens'-providing them with a range of resources to help them foster and maintain good, energy conscious behaviours with their colleagues, with ongoing support including targeted messages and stories using the Department's intranet. To complement this, automatic meter reading facilities have been installed at 600 DWP sites to provide half-hourly data to assist in identifying and resolving excessive energy usage.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.9/3">To incentivise performance, specific energy reduction targets have been set for the Department's businesses. To provide local ownership where issues arise, the Environment brief is being added to the remit of site Health and Safety (or House) Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.9/4">A range of 'carbon challenges' were agreed by the Department's executive team in September 2010 for immediate implementation. These included identifying and decommissioning unnecessary electrical equipment, improving alignment of heating and occupancy times, disabling cooling at weekends and also between November and April, and switching off unnecessary external lighting. Following consultation with Estates and IT partners, minimum cooling temperatures in server rooms are being increased to 28&#176;C, significantly reducing the cooling burden during the warmer months.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.9/5">The Department's HQ building (Caxton House) took part in, and won, the Greening Government competition to reduce energy consumption in October. Focusing attention on, and active participation by, those running and using the building delivered a saving of 22%. Best practice from this competition is being used to develop specific engagement activities, as part of AWaRE, for other large campus sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.9/6">In December 2010 a state of the art combined heat and power plant was switched on at Quarry House in Leeds. This is the largest installation of its kind on the civil estate and will save annually at least 428 tonnes of CO2 and &#163;93,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.9/7">All these measures, together with technical investment in new technology by estates partners, means that the Department is on track to deliver the 10% target. A longer term plan is being prepared with the Carbon Trust, building on the Department's accreditation to the Carbon Trust Standard last year (the largest public sector organisation to hold the Standard).</p>

	<p pid="a.722W.2/1">Entitlement to disability living allowance is not normally linked to particular disabling conditions, but on the extent to which a severely disabled person has personal care needs and/or walking difficulties as a result of their disability. People with a visual or hearing impairment can claim disability living allowance in the same way as anyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/2">There are two exceptions to this general rule which specifically affect people with sensory impairments. People who are both deaf and blind are taken to automatically qualify for the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance where they have a 100% per cent disability due to blindness and an 80% disability due to deafness and, by reason of the combined effects of their blindness and deafness, are unable, without the assistance of another person, to walk to any intended or required destination out of doors.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/3">From April this year we are also extending automatic entitlement to the higher rate mobility component to people with prescribed categories of severe visual impairment. The Pension Disability and Carers Service, which is responsible for the administration of disability living allowance, is in the process of contacting all existing recipients of the benefit who have a visual impairment and are in receipt of the lower rate mobility component to ensure that those eligible can be reassessed for entitlement to the higher rate mobility component. We expect this measure to assist over 22,000 people from its introduction.</p>

	<p pid="a.723W.2/4" class="indent">There are many routes into employment and throughout the customer's journey they may have access to a range of services and help provided by Jobcentre Plus or our Private and Voluntary Sector partners to find work. Therefore the type of help required or provided will vary from customer to customer. As this help is not limited solely to Jobcentre Plus and not every customer informs Jobcentre Plus of the reason why they are leaving benefit we are unable to state the total number of benefit claimants Jobcentre Plus have assisted into employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/5" class="indent">We can provide information for Jobseeker's Allowance customers only and the table below, which is taken from data available from the NOMIS website gives the number of Jobseeker's Allowance customers that have moved into work either with our assistance or through other channels. The numbers only show those Jobseeker's Allowance customers who notified us that they have started work. It does not include those people who flowed off benefit into other destinations, for example claimed other benefits or went into Government supported training.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.2/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/3">The Government launched the Independent Public Service Pension Commission chaired by Lord Hutton last June to conduct a fundamental structural review of public service pension provision which will report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer before Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/4">Ahead of the spending review Lord Hutton produced an interim report which found that the value of public service pensions had been increasing following dramatic increase in life expectancy at retirement. Current pensioners are expected to spend over 40% of their adult lives in retirement, compared to 30% for pensioners in the 1950s. Most of these extra costs have fallen to employers and taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/5">At the spending review, based on the clear rationale set out in Lord Hutton's interim report, the Government announced that they would implement progressive changes to the level of employee contributions to public service pensions that lead to an additional saving of &#163;1.8 billion a year from 2014-1 5, to be phased in from 2012-13. This is equivalent to three percentage point increase on average. In taking this decision, the Government considered a range of factors including the impact on gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/6">In addition, the Government announced their intention to launch consultations on the discount rate used to set contributions in unfunded public service pension schemes and the Fair Deal policy. Any assessment of the impact on gender equality will be undertaken in due course should there be any proposals to change policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.733W.0/1">We are refining the estimated costs of redundancy and early release as we go through the Department's annual Planning Round. Compensation payments depend on a number of factors including salary, rank/grade and length of service. The precise drawdown of military and civilian staff is still being considered. Estimates are therefore subject to change. The Planning Round is expected to conclude in the spring at which point we will be prepared to set out the estimates for early release under the expected terms of the civilian and service schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.735W.6/22">The total level of work in hand cannot be described as a backlog. As the volumes of SSCS receipts increased significantly and rapidly beyond forecast, the capacity of the Tribunals Service to deal with them has also increased in response; the number of employment support allowance and incapacity benefit cases disposed of in the second quarter of 2010-11 were more than double those cleared in the equivalent period the preceding year.</p>
	<p pid="a.735W.6/23">In September 2010, in respect of employment support allowance and incapacity benefit appeals, capacity increases meant that around a third of the work in hand was in excess of normal levels. As the Tribunals Service capacity continues to increase, it expects to return to normal levels of work in hand for employment support allowance and incapacity benefit cases by summer 2011.</p>

This decision was taken in the context of the current economic circumstances, and the need for Government to make substantial savings to deal with the budget deficit. Given, for example, the legal aid reforms and the programme of court closures that we have proposed as part of our efficiency savings, we do not believe that the new additional funding that the office of chief coroner would require is justifiable. I am confident that we can address the key requirements of coroner reform without the office of chief coroner.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.3/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has implemented a range of measures in working towards the 10% reduction target.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.3/2">DCLG's strategy has centred on maximising low and no cost measures, including adopting lean building management techniques such as reducing operating hours of equipment, and switching off non-essential lighting. This approach allows for rapid implementation and immediate benefit in accruing emissions reductions without the need for capital investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.3/3">The Department has also developed changes in behaviour to help encourage staff to reduce their direct energy use, such as by using stairs rather than lifts, reducing printing further, and reminding staff to switch of computers and monitors whenever not in use. Board-level commitment has also ensured that carbon reduction is suitably prioritised at all levels across the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.3/4">A number of modest capital projects, with short returns on investment, have also been undertaken, including installation of voltage reduction equipment, boiler optimisers, fan and motor controls, and automated meter readers.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.3/5">DCLG will continue to monitor its progress towards the 10% target.</p>

We are clear that consortiums should define their own governance processes within a broad framework set out in legislation. The constitution of a consortium will have to outline the process for making decisions, dealing with conflict of interest, and ensuring effective participation by all constituent practices. The Health and Social Care Bill will provide for the NHS Commissioning Board to issue guidance to consortiums on the form and content of their proposed constitution, drawing for example on the principles of good governance in public life.</p>

	<p pid="a.758W.5/1">Following extensive consultation with experts and key stakeholders, the Department is developing a new secondary uses dataset covering child health, maternity and child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) as a key driver to achieving better outcomes of care for mothers, babies and children. The dataset will provide comparative, linked data that can be used to plan and commission services. The dataset will cover such things as referrals to CAMHS, encounters, care planning, interventions, in-patient stays and outcome measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.5/2">The Department is consulting on its proposals to establish a new framework for developing the health care work force, including the CAMHS work force and seeking views on the systems and processes that will be needed to support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.5/3">Until now, data on the number of people accessing CAMHS, and the use of such services, have been collected as part of the Children's Services Mapping Project (CSM). The Department's contract with Durham University for this project expires on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. While the CSM project has done valuable work to develop new approaches to the gathering of information on child health and well-being, it no longer meets stakeholders' needs for robust and reliable benchmarking information that would inform service quality and value for money decisions in the current economic climate. The board of the Child and Maternal Health Observatory has concluded that the best course is to discontinue the service from the end of the current contract.</p>

However, there is considerable evidence on the different rates of mental health problems in men and women, particularly on how differently men and women express their problems and their willingness to seek help from services.

	<p pid="a.766W.3/2"><i> </i>The Government have not made a detailed assessment of the cost of funding the all-postal primaries, and no decisions have yet been taken on how funds would be allocated to political parties or administered.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.3/3">I have not held discussions with representatives of political parties on this issue and have not undertaken any formal consultation on the proposal. To date, no expressions of interest have been received in holding all-postal primaries, although I have received correspondence and parliamentary questions requesting further information on the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.3/4">The Government have embarked on a major programme of constitutional reform, including the introduction of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies (PVSC) Bill which provides for a referendum to be held on the voting system for the House of Commons and for a review of constituency boundaries in order to create fewer and more equally sized constituencies. The Government's proposals for a boundary review under the PVSC Bill-where the number of MPs will be reduced from 650 to 600-will have particular implications for all-postal primaries which we will need to consider. I would highlight the point made by the Boundary Commissions Secretaries when they appeared before the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee that all seats (with the exception of the constituencies of Orkney and Shetland and Na h-Eileanan an Iar) are likely to be affected by the boundary review. As a consequence, far fewer will meet the criteria set out in the coalition programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.3/5">We will consider how best to take forward the proposal concerning all-postal primaries in light of these other significant changes impacting upon our electoral process.</p>

	<p pid="a.768W.8/1">The Government recognises the impact that high fuel costs in rural areas can have on the local economy and community, and is committed to investigating ways of ameliorating these effects. The Government are exploring the relationship between energy consumers in fuel poverty and those who are off the gas grid and opportunities for consumers in rural areas to benefit from carbon reduction and renewable energy initiatives. The Government have also announced its intention to introduce a pilot scheme that will deliver a maximum of 5p per litre duty discount on petrol and diesel in the most remote rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.8/2">The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has launched a market study into the supply of off-grid energy which is anticipated to cover competition and consumer issues for heating oil, liquid petroleum gas and renewables. The study will provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.3/1">The Government are committed to supporting an expansion in renewable energy deployment through cost-effective incentive mechanisms to help achieve delivery of the UK's renewable energy targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.3/2">The renewables obligation (RO) is the Government's main financial incentive for renewable electricity. We commenced a scheduled review of the support bands in the RO in October 2010. This will determine the levels of support for large-scale electricity generation from 2013-17. In line with my announcement of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-08">8 December 2010</phrase>, we are accelerating the banding review so that generators and investors have certainty on support levels by autumn 2011, a year earlier than planned. We confirmed in the spending review that the level of support provided by the feed-in tariffs (FITs) will be reviewed with a view to reducing the scheme's projected costs in 2014-15 by at least &#163;40 million (in nominal prices). Changes would be implemented at the first comprehensive review of FITs, which is expected to take effect from April 2012 unless higher than expected deployment triggers an early review. We expect to be in a position to announce the details of the renewable heat incentive (RHI) scheme, including RHI tariffs and technologies supported, shortly and to open the scheme for business in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-16">16 December</phrase>, DECC launched a consultation on electricity market reform (EMR). One of the key aims of the reform is to develop and deliver a new market framework that will enable the cost-effective delivery of secure supplies of low carbon energy into the future. The EMR is intended to provide further certainty, and reduce risk, to investors and generators over revenue, and deliver better value for money for consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.773W.3/1">The Government are taking steps to reform the financial sector and address short-termism in a number of areas. First robust capital and liquidity standards, a binding constraint on leverage, as agreed internationally at the November G20 in Seoul, will fundamentally improve the resilience of banks, place banks on a more sustainable footing and focus less on short-term gains.</p>
	<p pid="a.773W.3/2">The Government are also establishing a Financial Policy Committee (FPC) in the Bank of England to undertake macro-prudential regulation, and a new Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to carry out micro-prudential regulation. These more specialised and focused regulatory authorities will help to tackle excessive lending and short-termism. In addition from <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> the Government have introduced a bank levy that is likely to raise &#163;2.5 billion. The levy is intended to encourage banks to move to less risky and longer-term funding profiles.</p>
	<p pid="a.773W.3/3">Finally the Government have also taken significant steps to improve corporate governance arrangements and strengthen the link between remuneration and performance. These measures improve the quality of internal oversight and strengthen the alignment of remuneration with risk taking, as well as improving transparency and facilitating better shareholder oversight, all of which will reduce the potential for short-termism.</p>
	<p pid="a.773W.3/4">The FSA have revised their Remuneration Code and new rules came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> that ensure bonuses are deferred over a number of years and are linked to the performance of the employee and their firm. In addition, significant portions of any bonus will be paid in shares or other securities. In addition, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-25">25 October 2010</phrase> the Government issued a paper calling for evidence on governance and short-termism. The paper considered whether there are failures in corporate governance and the markets. The aim was to investigate issues including; the problems of short-termism, investor engagement, directors' remuneration and the economic case for takeovers. The consultation period ended <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-14">14 January 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.775W.8/2">The Government launched the Independent Public Service Pension Commission chaired by Lord Hutton last June to conduct a fundamental structural review of public service pension provision which will report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer before Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.8/3">Ahead of the spending review Lord Hutton produced an interim report which found that the value of public service pensions had been increasing following dramatic increase in life expectancy at retirement. Current pensioners are expected to spend over 40% of their adult lives in retirement, compared to 30% for pensioners in the 1950s. Most of these extra costs have fallen to employers and taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.8/4">At the spending review, based on the clear rationale set out in Lord Hutton's interim report, the Government announced that they would implement progressive changes to the level of employee contributions to public service pensions that lead to an additional saving of &#163;1.8 billion a year from 2014-15, to be phased in from 2012-13. This is equivalent to three percentage point increase on average. In taking this decision, the Government considered a range of factors including the impact on gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.8/5">In addition, the Government announced their intention to launch consultations on the discount rate used to set contributions in unfunded public service pension schemes and the Fair Deal policy. Any assessment of the impact on gender equality will be undertaken in due course should there be any proposals to change policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.8/2">The Government continue to look at ways of ensuring that VAT does not act as a barrier to the reform of public services where such options are open to us and affordable within agreed funding arrangements. For example, we are continuing to work closely with charities and other sectors to explore options for implementing the EU VAT exemption for cost sharing, and the recent announcement of a new VAT refund scheme for academy schools demonstrates the Government's willingness to create a level playing field for VAT where this can be done in a fair, targeted and affordable way.</p>
