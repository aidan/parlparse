	<p pid=".361W.9/1">We published the Green Paper XSimplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement&quot; (Cm 5677) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase>. It provides a framework to help individuals save more in partnership with employers by providing a regulatory framework that supports employers in providing and contributing to good quality pension schemes. The Government's strategy is based on three linked proposals: major simplification of private pensions regulation and tax rules to ease burdens on employers and promote private provision; greater protection for scheme members to increase confidence and help to ensure that people get the pensions they expect; helping employers to provide better information for employees to help employees to understand the value of their pension scheme and to facilitate informed choice. The Green Paper makes clear that different types of scheme suit employees with different characteristics and that overall no particular scheme type is invariably better than the others. Defined contribution schemes tend to be better for employees who move jobs more frequently. The focus, therefore, should be on building on employer commitment and emphasising the advantages to both employer and employee of workplace pension provision. The Green Paper proposals to radically simplify the regulatory regime for pensions could, in total, save employers #150-#200 million a year in administration.</p>

	<p pid=".362W.8/1">The Green Paper, XSimplicity, security and choice, working and saving for retirement&quot; (Cm 5677), set out our proposals to simplify occupational and private pensions saving and make flexible retirement easier, following our earlier reforms to state provision and to financial services. Our proposals will enable people to make informed choices about their retirement provision, building on the foundation of state pension support. As the Green Paper explained, we have already taken action to reform the system of state support for pensioners, focussing in particular on tackling pensioner poverty. Specifically, we introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) which is currently worth #98.15 a week for single pensioners and #149.80 for couples. Around 2.1 million people in the UK are benefiting from the MIG now.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.8/2">From October this year the MIG is being subsumed by the more generous Pension Credit which will reward pensioners with savings, second pensions or earnings, yielding incomes up to #139 a week for single pensioners and nearly #204 a week for couples. In addition we brought in the State Second Pension from April 2002 to boost the pension rights of low and moderate earners and bring in groups of non-workers for the first time. Around 4.5 million low earners will build up an additional State Pension worth at least twice what SERPS would have provided. Two million carers and two million disabled people also build up pension rights for the first time. Also, from this April the basic State Pension will be worth #77.45 a week for single pensioners which is a 7 per cent. real terms increase since 1997. And in future years we are committed to increasing the basic State Pension by at least 2.5 per cent., even if the Retail Price Index (RPI) is below this.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.8/3">Other measures we introduced include free TV licences for those aged over 75, which benefits four million households and Winter Fuel payments now worth #200 each year for eligible households. Around 11 million people benefited from Winter Fuel payments for winter 2001&ndash;02. We considered that this state support for pensioners we have put in place provides the right foundation for retirement. We were not persuaded by calls to increase State Pension age for a number of reasons, including that such a change would have a disproportionate effect on the poorest pensioners. We are currently consulting on the proposals in the Green Paper.</p>

	<p pid=".367W.6/1">I assume that the hon. Member is referring to payments for cattle that are slaughtered voluntarily under the Over Thirty Month Scheme (OTMS). The Scheme is open to cattle that are prevented from entering the food chain because of the Over Thirty Month rule, but which are otherwise fit for human consumption.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.6/2">During the life of the scheme up to the 2002&ndash;03 year the published timeliness target in respect of OTMS has been to make 98 per cent. of compensation payments to collection centres within 21 days of receipt of all correctly completed documentation establishing the claim.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.6/3">The target has been changed to making 85 per cent. of compensation payments within 28 days and is consistent with the new targets for all non Integrated Administration and Control Schemes (IACS) payments. The RPA's 2002&ndash;03 Business Plan includes its new performance targets. There is no change to the requirement for collection centres to pass on compensation payments to producers within 14 days of receipt.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.6/4">The new timeliness target reflects the RPA's budget allocation for 2002&ndash;03. RPA has been given more headroom in its targets to allow it to respond flexibly to the situation and to deploy its resources by means of a risk based approach which seeks to maintain vital scheme controls.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.6/5">To help offset the impact of the tighter budget allocation RPA has introduced an initiative to import data electronically from collection centres. Most abattoirs are already submitting kill data electronically and work has started on introducing mechanisms by which data can be submitted electronically from both liveweight markets and casualty centres. This initiative will greatly reduce the manual inputting of data currently undertaken when claim paperwork reaches Reading and will, depending upon take-up, realise staff savings which will to some extent reduce the full impact of the budget cuts.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.6/6">RPA will continue to make payments as quickly as possible within its resource allocation. In the 2002&ndash;03 year to date 98 per cent. of payments have been made within 28 days.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.6/7">Regarding the unavailability of abattoirs to slaughter under the Beef Assurance Scheme, all licensed abattoirs are permitted to slaughter Beef Assurance Scheme over thirty month cattle, provided they are willing to facilitate their testing for BSE. On receipt of a negative test result, the carcase must be sent to a licensed cutting plant that is separately licensed to remove the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia before the meat is released for human consumption. All licensed cutting plants are free to apply to the Food Standards Agency for an additional licence to remove vertebral column. It is a simple process, no fee is charged, and all have been encouraged to apply. None have done so in the south west peninsular.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.6/1">The assessments were a matter for the Audit Commission. The methodology was widely consulted on with local government, the Local Government Association and other stakeholders. The judgments made for individual authorities drew a great deal of information from varied sources to form an overall view of authorities' services and their capacity to improve. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister considers the assessments provide a robust basis for our programme of improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.6/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made no assessment of the reasons for differences in average scores in different types of authority. The advice of the Audit Commission is that there is no strong evidence of systematic differences between classes of authority and the key message is that it is possible for authorities of all types and with widely varying circumstances to be excellent.</p>

	<p pid=".386W.2/4" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your question concerning the latest estimate of <i>(a)</i> the population and <i>(b)</i> the electorate for each shire and metropolitan county of the GLA area in England. I am also including responses to your two related questions requesting the population and the electorate for each metropolitan district in England and each London borough, and for each region in England. I am replying in the National Statisticians' absence. (90010, 90012, 90011).</p>
	<p pid=".386W.2/5" class="indent">Attached are three tables which relate specifically to your three requests. These show the total population and the 18+ population estimated for mid-2001, and the 18+ population registered to vote as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-01">1 December 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".386W.2/6" class="indent">Even though figures are shown in the tables for comparable age-ranges, it is still not easy to make direct comparisons between the population and the electorate data. For one thing, there is a difference in timing: the mid-year estimates relate to <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase> whereas electorate data are as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-01">1 December 2001</phrase>. In addition, there are differences in population coverage. The mid-year estimates include foreign citizens resident here who are not eligible to vote and people who choose not to register. On the other hand, there are a number of reasons why the electorate data may be higher than the mid-year estimates. Students are entitled to register both at their home and their term-time addresses, and second homeowners may also register in two places. Citizens who are not resident due to working abroad may be registered as overseas voters. In addition, electoral registers may be inflated if it is some years before non-respondents to the annual electoral canvass are deleted from electoral registers.</p>

	<p pid=".391W.8/1">The possibility of introducing a mandatory requirement on all households to install smoke alarms was considered by the Community Fire Safety Task Force whose 1997 report, XSafe as Houses&quot;, outlined a strategy on reducing fire deaths. The Government accepted their finding that, although such a proposal does have attractions, the enforcement difficulties were likely to be excessive. Instead, it advocated a far greater level of publicity and education to build upon the significant improvement on ownership levels which have already been achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.8/2">The fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations in Approved Document B were amended in 1992, to include provision for mains wired, interconnected smoke alarms to be provided in all new dwellings, resulting in new homes being provided with smoke alarms since 1992. This provision was extended in 2000 when, following a regulatory impact assessment, it was considered to be good regulation for smoke alarms to also be provided where a loft conversion is undertaken in an existing dwelling. This move, together with our wider publicity and educational efforts, has helped to raise smoke alarm ownership levels in all households to 82 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.8/3">Premises that require a fire certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 and premises that are subject to the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 can be required to have fire detection equipment where this is reasonable and necessary in relation to the risks to persons who use the premises. This was reflected when the Building Regulations and Approved Document B were further amended in 2000 to require new and materially altered premises to be fitted with appropriate provisions for the early warning of fire.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.8/4">The Government have also recently consulted on proposals to reform general fire safety law by means of a Regulatory Reform Order. These proposals would extend the risk based requirements of the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations to most places, other than private dwellings, and would include provision of fire detection equipment where this is reasonable and necessary. The proposals will be subject to a full Regulatory Impact Assessment and this is currently being prepared.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.5/1">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explained when giving evidence to the Transport Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-18">18 December 2002</phrase>, the estimated cost to London Transport and to the Department of preparing for the PPP, including the costs being repaid to all bidders, is likely to total around #500 million.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.5/2">The PPP amounts to an unprecedented modernisation of the entire underground network over the next 30-years. The level of bid development costs reflects this and also the lengthy duration of the bidding process, which commenced in October 1999. Nonetheless, the level of bid costs represents only an extremely small proportion of the value of investment that will be delivered over the life of the contracts.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.5/3">It is normal practice for eligible bid costs to be recoverable under PFI contracts. In this instance, the amounts to be recovered have been verified through an independent review to ensure that the costs have been reasonably and properly occurred and were appropriate for a transaction of this nature.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.5/4">The Department has sought to keep its costs to a minimum by making joint use of London Transport's advisers, expenditure on which is regularly reported to Parliament, mostly recently on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-11-25.63W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 63W</phrase>. As this made clear, London Transport's expenditure on external consultants, including legal advice, from <phrase class="date" code="1998-03-20">20 March 1998</phrase> (the date of the Government's announcement) to <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>, for work on the PPP and restructuring of London Underground, was #96.3 million. As a result of the delayed implementation of the PPP, London Transport currently estimate that the final amount should be between #103-#105 million, an increase of between #5&ndash;#7 million over its December 2001 forecast. Around #1.6 million of this increase arises from the Mayor's second unsuccessful legal challenge in July 2002. The court granted that these costs should be fully recovered from Transport for London.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.5/5">The Department has separately spent around #1.5 million on independent external advice where this has been appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.0/1">Post-retirement widow and widower pensions (PRWP) were introduced as a requirement of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. Provision was made in the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) for the payment of pensions to widow(er)s of service pensioners who married (or remarried) after retirement, but this change benefited only the widows of those giving service on or after <phrase class="date" code="1978-04-06">6 April 1978</phrase>, and the widowers of those giving service on or after <phrase class="date" code="1989-04-06">6 April 1989</phrase>. Only service on or after those dates was taken into account when calculating the level of pension. Against this background, it would cost in the order of #50 million to extend PRWP's to all current and deferred AFPS pensioners. This would be a one-off cost.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.0/2">It has been the long-standing policy of successive Governments that discretionary changes to improve the benefits from public service pensions schemes should be implemented from a current date for future service only. There is no distinction between servicemen and public sector employees with regard to the fact that the PRWP only applies to those with service on or after <phrase class="date" code="1978-04-06">6 April 1978</phrase>, or <phrase class="date" code="1989-04-06">6 April 1989</phrase>. To extend the post-retirement marriage concession to survivors of members of all public service occupational schemes would cost between #300 million and #500 million.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.0/3">There is no requirement for the Ministry of Defence to hold data on the number of representations it has received on this issue and the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The assessment of the costs of making the 1978 and 1989 changes retrospective was a broad actuarial estimate, carried out by the Government Actuary's Department. The assumptions used in making this assessment were derived from general UK population mortality statistics, supplemented by mortality experience analysis within the AFPS and other pension schemes. Detailed calculations have not been carried out due to the lack of readily available data. Full calculations could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.2/1">There have been cases in the past when, on grounds of commercial confidentiality, the Ministry of Defence has withheld information relating to the disposal sale price. Since 1999 it has been departmental policy to require all purchasers of surplus MOD land and property to be told, in writing, that the final sale price will be made known to any party who, in the future, requests that information. However, bidders/purchasers may still refuse consent to the sale price being made public on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.</p>

Boards are convened to discover whether there were any procedural or other Service-related irregularities, or difficulties which could be identified and overcome. The main purpose is to establish the facts concerning an incident as quickly as possible and to make recommendations aimed at preventing a recurrence. The principle of confidentiality applied to BOI proceedings is designed to encourage witnesses to provide forthright evidence.</p>

Because a number of sites have already been scheduled for disposal, the value of the individual sites is commercially sensitive, and therefore specific details of the information requested are being withheld in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information which relates to commercial confidences.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.5/3">The majority of properties were transferred to QinetiQ on the basis of their value as part of the on-going business and in most cases the value of the property as part of the business was higher than would be achieved through a sale of the land on the open market. These values were assessed by external valuers immediately before the properties were transferred to QinetiQ at vesting. The total value of the land and buildings transferred from the Ministry of Defence to QinetiQ in use in the continuing business was #342 million. Due to the specialist nature of QinetiQ's business the valuation is based on depreciated replacement cost, and this amount was #114 million greater than the open market value. This amount does not include surplus properties held for disposal which on transfer to QinetiQ in July 2001 had an open market value of #98 million, that was subsequently reduced by impairment of #20 million, as stated in the company's annual report 2002.</p>

However, as stated in our new defence industrial policy published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-14">14 October 2002</phrase>, the benefit to the UK economy from Ministry of Defence contracts is taken into account when selecting contractors. A copy of the Government's defence industrial policy is in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.8/1">Use of a decoding card in conjunction with a suitable set-top box would not in itself enable reception of British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) television and radio services as it is necessary to have an appropriately sized and correctly aligned satellite receiver dish in addition. The size and alignment of these dishes would not be the same as for those used by other broadcasters in the United Kingdom, e.g. BSkyB.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/2">Until recently all BFBS transmissions utilised low power satellites requiring large receiver dishes (of up to 4 metres diameter) not suitable for Direct-to-Home (DTK) down linking. This has meant that local transmission and reception has been via conventional terrestrial broadcasts requiring approval by the host nation and allocation of suitable frequencies.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/3">However, since December 2001 BFBS has used satellite capacity on Eutelsat W3 which enables radio and television broadcasts to be received on dishes no larger than 1.2 metres. As a result, it will become possible to dispense with local terrestrial transmission systems and move to DTH. Plans to do this in Germany are being finalised as part of the requirement to switch to digital broadcasting in that country and it is probable that other locations will follow in due course, dependent upon affordability.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/4">To protect programme rights holders, BFBS is introducing fully encrypted television services throughout the area covered by the Eutelsat W3. To date the Balkans and the Middle East are fully encrypted and proposals are being prepared to extend this to all other locations. The encryption service is delivered either via set top boxes (to single televisions) or via secure cable installations (again via decoders). Access at each set or cable head-end is controlled by digital cards.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/5">The BFBS radio channels can also be received via the set top boxes but in order to provide a Ml service e.g. in workshops, cars etc., radio is normally delivered via local terrestrial transmitters in the overseas Commands and operational theatres.</p>

	<p pid=".407W.0/1">All Service personnel receive basic information about the benefits offered by the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) when they join the armed forces and further information, notably a statement of benefits accrued, when they leave. We also provide advice on the AFPS and the financial aspects of resettlement through briefings by specially mandated independent financial advisers. These presentations are not restricted to Service leavers; they are available to any member of the armed forces at any stage in his or her career. They are normally delivered at Regional Resettlement Centres, nine of which are in the United Kingdom, while the other is in Germany. Pensioners also receive an annual newsletter from Paymaster, the contractor responsible for paying their pensions, updating them on any changes that might affect them.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.0/2">The basic information material on the scheme had become out-dated and was not simply written. We have therefore been revising it and, in late autumn 2002, we issued to all serving members of the armed forces a pack containing a straightforward, easy-to-read new guide to the current AFPS and a short, pocket-sized summary which also gives the current pension code rates, details of additional booklets in the series and useful contacts. The general guide was tested with key ex-Service organisations and with representative Service personnel, and is now available on the MOD web and the internet. It will be issued to all new recruits when they commence their initial training. The pocket-sized brief will be updated and reissued annually, again on an individual basis, to incorporate each year's new pension code rates.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.0/3">Five supplementary booklets covering specialised pension topics were published at the same time; these are available to serving military personnel on request and can also be found on the internet and MOD intranet. Copies of the pack and the five booklets will shortly be placed in the Library of the House. A further three booklets are currently being written to complete the series; these are due to be published in late spring this year and will also be available electronically. This series of booklets has been publicised to ex-Service organisations, notably the Forces Pensions Society. However, they may not be relevant to all veterans, given the changes to pension benefits over time, and do not replace the information that will have been communicated to ex-Service personnel during their time in service and at the point when they left the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.0/4">In addition to this general information on the Services' occupational pension schemes and the benefits they offer, specific information exercises are undertaken where changes take place affecting the entitlement of Service or ex-Service personnel. Examples of this include information on changes with respect to transfer rights between pension schemes, and on the introduction of Stakeholder pensions and pension-sharing on divorce.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.0/5">The War Pension Scheme is administered separately and, in addition to the AFPS, provides Service personnel with compensation for injury or illness attributable to service. We inform serving armed forces personnel of the provisions of the War Pension Scheme through their leaving-packs and, since the transfer of the Veterans Agency (VA) to the Ministry of Defence, the War Pensioners Welfare Service (WPWS) have attended resettlement events to give advice. In order to raise veterans' awareness of the War Pensions Scheme, we issue a range of information leaflets and posters to a variety of outlets such as post offices, regimental museums and GP surgeries. The VA works closely with ex-Service organisations and the War Pension Committees. In addition, the VA website contains comprehensive information and the WPWS holds advice days and surgeries using a mobile advice unit to reach more remote areas.</p>

	<p pid=".414W.5/4" class="indent">Current estimates of Regional GVA were published in February 2001 for the period 1989 to 1999. A revised series was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-21">21 November 2002</phrase>, but was withdrawn on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-10">10 December 2002</phrase>, when errors were identified by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and issues raised as to the quality of the underlying data. The ONS plans to publish estimates for regional, sub-regional and local area GVA in the spring of 2003. This will follow an investigation and detailed analysis of the compilation systems and component data to ensure their quality.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.5/5" class="indent">Under the European System of Accounts 95 (ESA95) the economic estimates that are defined as Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices are broadly equivalent to what has been historically known as GDP at factor cost. ONS has effected the change from GDP at factor cost to GVA at basic prices as part of implementation of ESA95, along with all other EU countries. GVA at basic prices includes the effects of taxes less subsidies on production, but excludes taxes and subsidies on products, which are included in GDP at market prices under ESA95.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.5/6" class="indent">The GVA for extra-regio comprises that part of compensation of employees and of gross trading surplus which cannot be assigned to any particular region. This mainly relateds to (1) the extraction of oil and gas and (2) public administration and defence (armed forces overseas and embassies). 1998 is the latest year for which industry estimates showing this breakdown are available.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.5/7" class="indent">For that year the total estimate for extra-regio was just under #12 billion, of which 92 per cent. related to the extraction of oil and gas and 8 per cent. to public administration and defence.</p>

The ONS work, however, is not intended to give a complete picture of Government finances and certain aspects of revenue and expenditure are excluded from the analyses and hence the estimates are not directly comparable with GERS.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/8" class="indent">Finally, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has commissioned a project to identify the flow of Public expenditure (UK and European) into the English regions (NUTS1) and the allocative mechanisms that underpin those flows. The project has close links with the PESA estimates and with the ONS Government accounts work, but is not looking at Government revenue. The project is expected to be completed by the middle of 2003.</p>

NES is an electronic- based system, which enables exporters and agents to send their export declarations to Customs electronically. It replaces the current paper-based system, facilitates legitimate trade and helps combat VAT and Excise fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.6/2">NES provides a number of tailored models and procedures to meet the needs of different trade sectors. It allows Customs to target their controls more effectively, minimise disruption to legitimate trade and reduce the time it takes to process an export declaration.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.6/3">In order to utilise NES simplified procedures exporters must apply to Customs for specific authorisation. This involves completion of a form, possibly a visit from a Customs Officer and, depending on the electronic transmission route chosen, registering to use the Government Gateway. Each application is considered on its merits; there is no specific time frame for completion of individual applications. Customs make every effort to complete their part of the procedure as swiftly as possible. Exporters who need to obtain a digital certificate from the Office of the e-Envoy (to enable Government Gateway access) may wait approximately 7 days for delivery of access data.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.6/4">The Paymaster General received one representation on NES from the British International Freight Association (BIFA) on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-20">20 December 2001</phrase>, to which the Financial Secretary replied on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-24">24 January 2002</phrase>.

	<p pid=".423W.0/3">Officials are also in discussion with Northern Ireland meat processors to facilitate exports through the DBES. Four NI plants have declared an interest. However none have as yet provided sufficient detail of their ability to meet the scheme conditions to justify approval. Until the registration process is completed, exports cannot commence. New markets have to be found, but at present market conditions do not favour exports and, moreover, the GB market provides the best return. There is optimism however that limited exports to premium outlets will commence later in the year.</p>

	<p pid=".428W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-04">4 December 2002</phrase>, I announced the requirement for massive investment in Northern Ireland's water and sewerage services and the need to find a long-term and reliable funding source to meet this investment need. In December 2002, I undertook a study visit of the water industry in Scotland and in Wales, to learn more about how water and sewerage services are financed and delivered elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Water and sewerage services are delivered by a public corporation in Scotland, whereas these services are the responsibility of a not for profit trust in Wales. These services are funded by water charges in both regions.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-11">11 December 2002</phrase>, my colleague Ian Pearson MP announced our intention to introduce self-financing arrangements for water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland. This will mean that in the future Northern Ireland households will have to make a direct contribution for the water and sewerage services they receive. I want to ensure that these services are delivered as effectively and efficiently as possible, so that the charges paid by Northern Ireland consumers offer value for money. Consequently, I wish to reflect on the best features of the financial and structural arrangements adopted by the water industry in Scotland and Wales when developing proposals for the introduction of self-financing arrangements for water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.5/1">The criteria for the allocation of capital funding for the development of new schools in Northern Ireland are based on educational need, prioritised as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/2" class="indent">the need to address substantial unmet demand for school places;</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/3" class="indent">replacement of sub-standard accommodation which is essential to effect rationalisation; and</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/4" class="indent">replacement of schools that suffer significantly from several serious accommodation inadequacies.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/5">An economic appraisal has to be completed for each school and an appropriate stage of planning needs to have been undertaken. Where relevant, a scheme must have an approved Development Proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.8/1">Officials from the Department will be meeting with farming union representatives this month to discuss documentation and procedures relating to cattle identification and subsidy claims. The Department is also working towards simplifying application forms used for the programme for building sustainable prosperity and the PEACE II programme.

	<p pid=".429W.8/2">Forms produced by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development are broadly consistent with those used in other agriculture departments throughout the UK. One of the Department's main aims is to ensure that farmers are only being asked to provide information which is essential to meet statutory or other obligations and to facilitate processing. Forms normally contain contact details for anyone requiring assistance and are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they are as user friendly as possible.</p>

We are also supporting an accreditation awareness campaign, being run by UKAS, aimed at raising the awareness in business and Government of the benefits of using UKAS accredited services.</p>

	<p pid=".436W.2/2">The monkeys will be used to help scientists continue vital research into serious diseases and conditions including HIV, malaria, stroke, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease. They will not be used for chemical and biological defence testing.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/3">The facility under construction at Porton Down is part of a continuing effort to improve further the care and welfare of laboratory animals across the academic sector. The project, a partnership involving the MRC, The Wellcome Trust, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, has been in the planning for almost three years.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/4">The new facility will replace an existing UK academic breeding facility for Rhesus Macaque monkeys. The colony is being relocated because the new facility at Porton Down will offer state of the art accommodation, care, and welfare in a secure setting. The aims of the facility are broadly two-fold:</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/5" class="indent">(i) to establish a centre of excellence and to provide an example of best contemporary practice for the care and welfare of monkeys; and</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/6" class="indent">(ii) to provide a supply of monkeys for justified medical research purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/7">The facility is designed to house about 250 macaques. It is expected that this will be sufficient to supply approximately 100 animals for use in academic medical research each year. This does not represent an increase in the use of such monkeys in the UK university sector.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/8">Primates from the new breeding centre will only be used in scientific procedures licensed by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. This means that the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) will be fully applied. Under the 1986 Act no animals can be used in scientific procedures if alternatives are available, and primates can only be used if no other species are suitable and readily obtainable. The number used and the suffering experienced must be minimised.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/9">The establishment of this new facility further promotes policy on the 3Rs in that:</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/10" class="indent">it will operate to the best contemporary practice for the care and welfare of monkeys and disseminate best practice accordingly. The facility will work closely with the MRC's Centre for Best Practice for Animals in Research to develop, promote and disseminate best practice in all aspects of primate care and welfare;</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/11" class="indent">careful planning to predict the numbers of animals required for academic medical research will ensure that potential for Xover-breeding&quot; is avoided;</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/12" class="indent">co-operative dialogue between the research funders and the facility will ensure that only scientific projects of the highest quality that can fully justify the use of monkeys will be supplied from the facility.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.2/2">Because trade is a matter of Community competence, the UK has been working with other EU member states to progress this issue for a number of years. Animal welfare issues have been included in the EU's WTO negotiating priorities for some years. At Doha, the EU successfully negotiated the Doha mandate so that the issue of farm animal welfare would be taken into account as part of the current Agreement on Agriculture negotiations, which are due to be concluded by the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.2/3">It remains extremely difficult to reach agreement on changes to WTO rules to allow countries explicitly to limit imports of goods based only on the way in which a product was made (under which would fall consideration of whether a production method took account of animal welfare standards). Many WTO member states are highly suspicious of the EU's motives and fear that animal welfare production standards will be used as a disguised form of protectionism. This is a concern for developing country governments in particular. This issue is not on the agenda for the current Doha trade round, but the EU continues to discuss this issue in all relevant WTO fora and is working hard to try to build trust and understanding for the EU's</p>

	<p pid=".444W.3/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has received a number of recent representations about the concerns of rural newsagents over newspaper carriage charges.</p>
	<p pid=".444W.3/3">The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has recently carried out a review of the 1994 Code of Practice on newspaper distribution. This also addressed the issue of carriage and service charges. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-12">12 December 2002</phrase>, the OFT published it provisional recommendations. The main provisional recommendation is that selling-on within exclusive territories should be fully liberalised. The provisional recommendations are now open for public consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-14">14 March 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".447W.5/1">There are no plans to re-introduce an employment concession for asylum seekers. The concession was established when widespread delays were occurring in the asylum system. By the time the concession was abolished in July last year it had become largely irrelevant and only applicable to a minority of applicants. The vast majority&mdash;around 80 per cent.&mdash; of asylum seekers currently receive an initial decision within six months of their application being submitted and could not therefore benefit from the terms of the concession.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.5/2">We also believe that allowing new asylum applicants to work could act as a pull factor. We are determined to maintain a robust asylum process which helps those fleeing persecution and not those who wish to come to the UK to work. Those who wish to come here for the purpose of employment have a range of schemes open to them and we continue to open up more routes to allow people to come here and work legally in ways which boost our economy.</p>

	<p pid=".449W.6/1">There has been much work on crime reduction during 2002&ndash;03 within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames which has been funded through Government initiatives: Communities Against Drugs (#169,000), Safer Communities Initiative (#54,000), and the Partnership Development Fund (#20,000). This has helped Richmond Crime Reduction Partnership, which covers Twickenham, to implement local schemes such as the development of a youth project targeting those at risk of committing street crime, pro-active policing of suppliers of class 'A' drugs, and supporting a closed circuit television (CCTV) control room.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.6/2">Across London, Government funding has been provided for several crime reduction initiatives including over #16 million through Communities Against Drugs; #21 million for CCTV equipment since 1999; #1.5 million on Reducing Burglary Initiative; #7.3 million for the neighbourhood wardens and street wardens initiative; #7.2 million for Targeted Policing Initiative, and #9.1 million for the Robbery Reduction Initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".450W.0/1">The core inter-agency child protection guidance is XWorking Together to Safeguard Children&quot;. It was published jointly by the Department of Health, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills in 1991, and revised and updated in 1999. The guidance is addressed to all those whose work brings them into contact with children and families, including the police. Chapter 6 of the document provides guidance on 'Child Protection in Specific Circumstances', and includes a section on domestic violence. It highlights the need for professionals to be alert to the frequent inter-relationship between domestic violence and the abuse and neglect of children. It specifically states that when there is evidence of domestic violence, the implication for any children in the household should be considered, including the possibility that the children themselves may be subject to violence or other harm. Conversely, where it is believed that a child is being abused, those involved with the child and family should be alert to the possibility of domestic violence within the family.</p>
	<p pid=".450W.0/2">In addition to this, 'Policing Domestic Violence&mdash;a Modular Training Programme', was developed by Centrex in 2002. It is a national training product, intended to provide a structured, but flexible approach to the delivery of domestic violence training within the Police Service. Module 4 is dedicated to 'Domestic Violence and Children', and aims to explain the relationship between domestic violence and child abuse and give detailed information to operational staff on this subject. The material has been developed with the assistance of the Women's Aid Federation of England and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and has been widely circulated both within and outside the Police Service for comment and enhancement.</p>

The two female prisons include both adults and women aged 16&ndash;21 years. An evaluation of the pilot project supported implementation of the new reception screening arrangements across the estate, and a rolling programme is planned to start in April 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".455W.6/1">Regulation of motor vehicle clamping by private security firms on private land will be introduced by the Security Industry Authority, a non-departmental public body (NDPB) being set up by the Home Office under the Private Security Industry Act 2001. The authority is currently preparing for regulation, which will take the form of licensing all individuals carrying out activities covered by the Act. The suitability of individuals applying for a licence will be assessed in accordance with published criteria relating to criminality and competency. The Security Industry Authority will be established as an NDPB on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> and it is expected that it will start licensing clamping operatives by the end of this year/early 2004. It will be a criminal offence to engage in licensable conduct without a licence.</p>

	<p pid=".456W.0/1">We aim normally to screen all postal applications within three weeks and decide those that are straightforward at that point. However, because of the high number of applications in the latter part of 2002, this is currently taking around 10 weeks on average. Some that are not straightforward because they need further inquiries or more detailed consideration can take around 12 months to decide, subject to how easy it is to obtain the information and how quickly applicants respond to such requests. We are taking measures to improve this situation and expect to make significant progress towards our three-week target for initial screening over the next two to three months, and to reduce the turnaround time for deciding more complex cases.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/2">Postal applications received at the very end of December 2002 are currently being opened and details entered on to the General Casework Information Database. Those received in early January 2003 will be opened and entered very shortly and it is anticipated that the time-lag will be reduced to a week or less by the end of January.</p>

This compares to 13 per cent. in 1999. This indicates a significant level of chronic or 'background' malnutrition. Under current circumstances it is reasonable to predict that levels of severe malnutrition will be increasing.

The tables show the budgets and expenditure incurred for the current projects across the whole cycle of their development. For the three academies already open, the first table also shows their operating budget and expenditure incurred to date.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.0/2">Academy projects receive modest funding to develop proposals to a point where the Secretary of State is satisfied that an academy is viable and a formal funding agreement can be signed. From this point, projects receive additional funding to implement their proposals and prepare for the opening of the academy. Once open, academies receive an annual operational budget to cover their day-to-day running costs, which is comparable to similar maintained schools within their local authority. Similarly, the level of capital funding is intended to ensure that academies are built and equipped to a standard comparable with the best in the maintained sector.</p>

Schools have always been required to have an admission number for each relevant age group, including sixth form admissions if they recruit from outside the school.

Where the average formula spending share per pupil is higher, that reflects a higher number of deprived pupils, and higher area costs. The average Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS) per three to 15 pupil for Leicestershire is #2,939 and for Slough (the authority with the highest average EFSS per pupil outside London) it is #3,828. The difference is just over 30 per cent. or #890 per pupil. The estimated proportion of deprived pupils in Slough is: 36 per cent. in primary schools and 33 per cent. in secondary schools. The proportions for Leicestershire are: 13 per cent. in primary and secondary schools. In addition Slough attracts an Area Cost Adjustment of 13.5 per cent. whereas Leicestershire does not.</p>

Neither the Secretary of State nor the LSC has the power to replace the management team of a college. However, the Secretary of State can issue directions to a college corporation or replace members of the corporation, if he feels that a college is being mismanaged. In the past 12 months, 96 out of a total of 400 FE colleges were inspected. Of these, 17 colleges were judged to be inadequate and will require a full re-inspection. A further 35 colleges will require a partial re-inspection, where some areas were found to be less than satisfactory.

The consultation document was produced with input from the Department for Education and Skills and the Devolved Administrations. Close liaison over the education services sector within the GATS will continue throughout the negotiations.

	<p pid=".476W.6/1">The locations of the individual offices of the Legal Services Commission are for the commission to determine. Offices are, in general, located in either the major town or city in each region as detailed in the table. The number, location and size of the regional offices have been reviewed on several occasions, most recently in August 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.6/2">With the exception of the head office buildings in London, each of the commission's offices is sited within a region (locations denoted in brackets next to the regions in the table). In England, the commission's regional boundaries match those of the Government Offices for the English Regions, with the exception of Merseyside for which there is no separate Government Office. The commission also has an office covering Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".482W.8/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology, is the main agency through which the Government supports research on the causes and treatments of disease, including all types of cancer. The Department of Health contributes to the strategies and priorities of the MRC by meeting the national health service costs of the MRC's research (and of charity funded research). The Department also directly funds research to support policy development in health and social care, and to support effective practice in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".482W.8/2">In terms of directly funded research, the Department's main focus is on interventions to promote healthy living, including diet and physical exercise, and on research on breast cancer screening. For example, the Department is funding research projects with the following titles:</p>
	<p pid=".482W.8/3" class="indent">A health impact assessment of agricultural policy, using the impact on fruit and vegetable consumption as a case study;</p>
	<p pid=".482W.8/4" class="indent">Reducing inequalities in health and diet: the impact of a food retail development&mdash;a pilot study;</p>
	<p pid=".482W.8/5" class="indent">Field co-ordination in health promotion linked to the Cochrane Collaboration.</p>
	<p pid=".482W.8/6">The Department also funds a programme of work at the cancer screening evaluation unit, which evaluates the effectiveness of screening. Part of this programme includes work on breast cancer screening. There are plans for an observational individual-based study of the efficacy of the breast screening programme. The Department provides joint funding for the age trial, on the effect on breast cancer mortality of annual screening from age 40.</p>
	<p pid=".482W.8/7">Over 75 per cent. of the Department's total expenditure on all health research, including on cancer, is devolved to NHS organisations and details are not routinely collected centrally. Summary information about this research is available on the national research register, which is on the web at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/research">www.doh.gov.uk/research</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".482W.8/8">The Department is a member of the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI). The recent NCRI report XStrategic Analysis 2002&quot; analysed most of the directly funded research of Government and charity funders. The analyses revealed relatively low sums spent on cancer prevention, which has prompted the NCRI to set up a strategic planning group to look at this area to see what further research may be possible and what extra resources might be needed to bring this about. The Department will be working in partnership with its Government and charity cancer research funding partners to take this work forward.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.0/1">Many cases of visual defect are detected by parents or family members, others by health professionals in the course of a physical examination. We value and support both approaches. The personal child health record and the XBirth to Five&quot; manual of child health, given to parents around the time of birth, promote the former approach. Programmes of health and development screening checks undertaken by local primary health care teams promote the latter. The purpose of the screening programme is to maximise every child's opportunity to realise their full potential for health, well being and development, and to ensure that remediable disorders are identified and acted upon as early as possible. Local programmes are a matter for primary care trusts to determine and monitor, in accordance with professional advice. This will include the content of and optimal timing for vision screening checks undertaken in childhood and the relative benefits of eye checks between infancy and primary school. I have not received recent representations on this subject but expect there to be active debate during preparation of the national service framework for children, which will set standards aimed at raising the quality of the health and social care services that children receive.</p>

In addition, analysis on the sample numbers has shown that there is a wide variation in the figures between local authorities-suggesting inconsistency in recording practices which may in turn suggest under-reporting.

For example, 1,000 new primary care mental health workers and 500 more community mental health staff ('Gateway' workers) will be appointed by 2004 to help GPs manage care for people with mental health problems of all ages, including those in a crisis.</p>

	<p pid=".502W.5/1">For the year 2001&ndash;02 Leicestershire Health Authority allocated #26,000 to the Rainbows Children's Hospice. This funding was provided under Section 64, of Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, providing a grant to a voluntary group for respite, palliative and terminal care for children.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.5/2">The Department's view on funding in support of children's hospices is that this should be through negotiation between the hospices, primary care trusts and social services departments, which are responsible for delivering services locally and are best placed to work in partnership with organisations like hospices and to agree an appropriate level of funding.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.5/3">There is, however, a case for pump priming these negotiations. We expect this to be facilitated through the New Opportunities Fund, which has a budget of #48 million to support projects for children with life threatening illness, including children's hospice respite services. #15.3 million has been earmarked specifically for hospice care. Awards will be available next year.</p>

	<p pid=".504W.2/1">Currently eight of the 31 ambulance services are providing paramedic thrombolysis according to protocols agreed by local health economies. These protocols are based on a clear guideline from the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee (JRCALC) published on the Royal College of Physicians' and Ambulance Services Association websites. They are available from the individual ambulance services on request. Paramedic training is essential for safe and effective thrombolysis. Central funding of #14 million from 2002 to 2004 is being invested in ambulance trusts to support paramedic training and provide 12 lead ECG monitors/defibrillators and linked to accident and emergency departments. All front-line 999 ambulances will be equipped by December 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".504W.5/1">The national health service provides ophthalmic services to visually impaired children, making use of a multi-disciplinary approach to meet their needs. The hospital eye service (HES) works closely with each child's general practitioner, education, social and rehabilitation services, exchanging reports and information.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.5/2">Ophthalmologists aim to identify the underlying cause of the problem and offer treatment if indicated. They also co-ordinate the response from the HES.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.5/3">Orthoptists work closely with ophthalmologists and assess visual function, visual acuity and binocular vision; under the direction of an ophthalmologist, they provide treatment aimed at improving visual acuity and oculo-motor control.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.5/4">Optometrists test the sight of visually impaired children and prescribe glasses and/or low vision aids. Children under the age of 16, and under the age of 19 in full-time education, are entitled to help with the cost of their glasses through the NHS voucher scheme. Optical low vision aids are supplied on loan through the HES.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.5/5">The Government's cross government programmes for children give priority to children in disadvantaged areas and to disabled children. Sure start partnerships aim to work with parents and children up to four years old to provide appropriate early intervention and support. The #450 million children's fund is being targeted on preventive work with children, primarily in the five to 13 age group and their families, helping them before they hit crisis.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.5/6">Under the Children Act 1989, local authority social services departments in England, working with other local authority departments and health authorities, have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area who are in need and to promote the upbringing of such children, wherever possible by their families, through providing an appropriate range of services. Under the definitions in the Children Act, all disabled children are included as children in need. A wide range of family support services is provided by the public and voluntary sectors. Services can include short-term breaks, guidance and counselling, day care, family centres and home help.</p>
