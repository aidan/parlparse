	<p pid=".864W.5/1">The reforms of the 1990s which dismantled pervasive government controls of Zambia's economy to establish a market based system have generated a vigorous and on-going debate in Zambia. The World Development Movement recently produced a report&mdash;&quot;Zambia: Condemned to Debt&quot;&mdash;adopting a largely critical view of these reforms. The evidence suggests a more positive view is justified.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/2">Zambia's long run of economic decline is showing signs of reversal. Economic growth, which had been near zero from the mid 1970s to mid 1990s, has averaged 3.4 per cent. per annum since 1995. Zambia has experienced its longest period of sustained growth for three decades with the fifth successive year of positive growth in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/3">The pace of liberalisation and deregulation in the early 1990s was rapid. The impact of reform has varied across sectors. People working in urban manufacturing suffered from the removal of protection before alternative employment opportunities were available. The improved growth since 1995 has been insufficient to boost overall employment, although there have been new jobs in service sectors. A new and significant commercial agriculture sector has also emerged. This has provided most of the impressive growth in non-copper exports, which have expanded from US$100 million in the early 1990s to US$405 million in 2003. It has also improved livelihoods. Since the privatisation of the cotton sector the number of small farmers in out-grower schemes has risen from 50,000 to 250,000. However, people who lack commercial opportunities and those hardest hit by food insecurity and HIV/AIDS remain very vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/4">The impact of privatisation has also been mixed. The reforms led to job losses during the 1990s, although this often reflected the struggling position of state enterprises before privatisation. The economic performance of these enterprises has improved, with 239 of 254 entities privatised still operating, but growth has been insufficient to provide significant new employment. Privatisation has also ended a major drain on government resources. For example Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines ran losses of US$15&ndash;20 million per month in the two years prior to privatisation. This was equivalent to 69 per cent. of the entire health and education budgets during those years. Privatisation in this case has freed up significant resources for poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/5">The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) believe that stronger diversification and private sector development, rather than continued dependence on copper and state industries, must be the basis for Zambia's long run growth and poverty reduction. The Department for International Development continues to provide significant support to Zambia as the Government seek to improve macroeconomic stability and the business environment in its efforts to achieve the 6&ndash;8 per cent. growth required to reach the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

	<p pid=".865W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) maintains a regular dialogue with non-governmental organisations in Zambia.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.2/2">DFID works closely with Civil Society for Poverty Reduction (CSPR), whose members include major non-governmental organisations such as the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace and Oxfam. CSPR plays a significant role in contributing to the Government of the Republic of Zambia's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and in arguing for debt cancellation. The effectiveness of development assistance in the implementation of the PRS, and the need to look beyond the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Completion Point are regular themes of discussions with CSPR representatives. DFID agrees with CSPR that a new approach to aid delivery combined with sound budget and domestic debt management is required to ensure government is effective in delivering services for long term poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.2/3">DFID has drawn on its dialogue with CSPR members and other non-governmental organisations to help identify key areas of vulnerability for the poor. This helped inform DFID's new Country Assistance Plan in highlighting food insecurity and HIV/AIDS as the most critical risks facing poor people in Zambia. DFID has recently agreed a Programme Partnership Agreement with CARE Zambia to enable the poorest to better manage social risk associated with food security, destitution and HIV/AIDS.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.3/1">Zambia's external debt poses severe problems both in terms of the stock of debt and the particularly high level of debt service in the 2001&ndash;05 period. Zambia's scheduled external debt service averages US$570 million per year during 2001&ndash;05. This is equivalent to approximately 80 per cent. of total government domestic revenues. However, under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, Zambia's actual external debt service has averaged US$122 million per year in the three years since Decision Point in December 2000. This has been essential in enabling the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) to maintain and improve vital public services.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.3/2">During this period GRZ's expenditure on health has averaged US$161 million per year, an increase of 63 per cent. on the three previous years. Expenditure on education has averaged US$182 million per year, an increase of 53 per cent. on the three previous years.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.3/3">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports GRZ in its objective of reaching HIPC Completion Point at the earliest opportunity. The recent approval of a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the International Monetary Fund is a major milestone towards this. DFID is also engaging in dialogue with GRZ and other donors to ensure that development assistance is effectively delivered in support of GRZ's Poverty Reduction Strategy after Completion Point.</p>

	<p pid=".867W.2/1">The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) embarked on a comprehensive programme of economic reforms during the 1990s, with the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and other development agencies, including the Department for International Development (DFID).</p>
	<p pid=".867W.2/2">There is evidence that the reforms have started to reverse Zambia's long run of economic decline. Economic growth, which had been near zero from the mid 1970s to mid 1990s, has averaged 3.4 per cent. per annum since 1995. 2003 marked the fifth successive year of positive growth for Zambia under an IMF macro-economic programme.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.2/3">While this improved economic performance is welcome. Other aspects of reform have had mixed results. Closure of urban manufacturing and state owned enterprises before alternative employment opportunities were available, affected people working in those sectors. The emergence of commercial agriculture and stemming the drain on the budget from nationalised industry losses, have not fully offset the negative impact on urban poverty or benefited remote rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.2/4">The Zambian Government's public sector reform programme, largely implemented with World Bank assistance, has made very slow progress since its launch in 1993. The current reform agenda, with a focus on public financial management and financial sector reforms is making better progress. It has been developed with a clear sense of leadership by GRZ and support from a wider group of development agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".873W.5/2">The mobile network operators and local planning authorities are well aware of the importance the Government attaches to the observance of the best practice guidance set out in the Code. Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister meet regularly with the Mobile Operators Association to discuss a range of issues including the operators' progress in meeting their commitments to improved local consultation. We have asked the mobile network operators that in commissioning the second independent review of their Ten Commitments they extend the scope of that review to include their observance of the Code. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is commissioning a study to assess the impact that the Code has had more widely since its introduction and how it is perceived by local authorities and the public.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.2/1">Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should only be used where it represents the best possible procurement route based on a rigorous assessment of value for money&mdash;risks involved in the procurement are placed with the best party able to manage them, therefore, ensuring value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.2/2">By integrating the design, build and operational aspects into a single financial package, PFI helps to encourage greater efficiency, including energy efficiency, over the whole life of the contract.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.2/3">The long term and integrated nature of PFI contracts incentivises the contractors to consider the synergies between the design of an asset and its ultimate operating costs. This can result in the delivery of public services in a more environmentally sensitive way and without an additional price tag.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.2/4">In addition, the viability of a PFI project is assessed against a number of criteria, including sustainable development where projects must 'demonstrate an integrated approach to the social, environmental and economic well-being of the area, now and for future generations'. This is a key component in deciding whether or not a PFI scheme should be pursued.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.2/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published detailed guidance &quot;Green Public Private Partnerships&quot; in 2002 in conjunction with the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) and other Government Departments for anyone developing or managing a Public Private Partnerships/Private Finance Initiative (PPP/PFI) scheme. This explained the need to take seriously environmental issues and how best to reflect environmental considerations in the objectives of PPP/PFI schemes, and provided practical help and advice.</p>

	<p pid=".878W.12/1">The figure of 8.1 GWe is the central projection within a range of 7.7&ndash;9.4 GWe, which mainly allows for uncertainties over gas and electricity price movements. This does not take account of either the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme or the CHP measures in the Energy White Paper, which are at too early a stage of development to quantify fully. The support measures set out in &quot;The Government's Strategy for CHP to 2010&quot;, which we published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">26 April</phrase> of this year, are expected to contribute around 1.9 GWe to achievement of the 10 GWe target and we are confident that by working in close partnership with industry we can help CHP realize its full potential in the low carbon economy of the future.</p>

	<p pid=".880W.2/1">The Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government estate covers central Government Departments and their Executive Agencies (see following table). It does not cover non-departmental public bodies and other associated bodies, the devolved Administrations, or local authorities. Departments are responsible for the promotion of sustainable development to their associate bodies and many public bodies are already taking a lead on sustainable development issues. It is anticipated that Departments will promote the framework to their non-departmental public bodies and other associate bodies and further encourage development of strategies for target setting, performance improvement and reporting along the lines set out in the framework. For further information, please see <a href="http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/sdig/index.htm">http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/sdig/index.htm</a>.</p>

Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered since 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".885W.5/1">The current strategy for controlling bovine TB in Great Britain consists of five points, based upon the recommendations of the Krebs Report (1997):</p>
	<p pid=".885W.5/2" class="indent">1. Protecting Public Health</p>
	<p pid=".885W.5/3" class="indent">2. Developing an effective vaccine</p>
	<p pid=".885W.5/4" class="indent">3. Research into how the disease is spread</p>
	<p pid=".885W.5/5" class="indent">4. Cattle Testing and Controls</p>

	<p pid=".885W.5/7">This policy is successful in that the risk to human health remains low. However, the long term trend has been an increase in the incidence and the geographical spread of TB in cattle. The costs to industry and the taxpayer are also increasing. We need to apply to bovine TB the principles agreed in the Animal Health and Welfare Strategy&mdash;establishing targets against which we can measure our performance and formal agreements for working in partnership with the farming industry.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.5/8">Evidence from other countries shows that, in the apparent absence of a significant wildlife reservoir, cattle controls along the lines of those used in Great Britain can be effective at controlling and eventually eradicating the disease according to the criteria defined in Council Directive 64/432/EEC.</p>

These include the immediate imposition of movement controls on all susceptible livestock, strict biosecurity requirements and enhanced options for controlling the disease. Vaccination would be considered from the outset of an outbreak in addition to the culling of all susceptible animals on infected premises and those that have been exposed to infection, as required by EU law. We are engaging with operational partners and with stakeholders to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities and the measures that would be taken in an outbreak. Plans are also in place in the event of an outbreak to enable a rapid increase in staff resources and the implementation of contingency contracts including that for vaccination. We have revised the instructions for staff and are ensuring that they are trained and equipped to deal with an outbreak of disease.</p>

In the event, that review contributed to Lord Haskins' review of the arrangements for delivering the Government's rural policies in England, the detailed follow up to which we are working on. We do not intend to respond separately to &quot;An Economic Analysis of Forestry Policy in England&quot;, although the report itself remains available as a valuable source of information to those interested in forestry policy inside and outside government.</p>

	<p pid=".891W.0/1">Defra has provided flood and coastal defence operating authorities with guidance on the circumstances in which land purchase and financial compensation for managed realignment of river or coastal flood defences can be funded from the Defra flood management budget under current legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".891W.0/2">Except in limited circumstances outlined as follows, no compensation is payable to those affected by flooding or erosion, including cases where it is decided not to defend a particular area, or to undertake managed realignment. This approach, adopted by successive governments, is justified by current legislation which provides operating authorities with permissive powers to undertake flood and coastal defence works. Save for the specific requirements of the Habitats Directive there is no general obligation to build or maintain defences at all or to a particular standard. Consonant with this approach, the legislation also makes no provision for compensation from public funds to persons whose property or land is affected by erosion or flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".891W.0/3">Payment is possible where quantifiable beneficial use arises. Thus land may be acquired for the construction or maintenance of defences and compensation paid for damage arising expressly from such operations. Also, in some circumstances, where land seaward of justifiable new defences can be shown to contribute to effective defence, landowners may be eligible for payment for depreciation or loss of land. Finally, if a defence is realigned landward, land currently in agricultural use may be considered for payments under agri-environment schemes if a long-term return to inter- tidal habitat fulfils the relevant objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".893W.2/1">Any requirement for compensatory habitat arising from the maintenance or improvement of sea walls will depend on whether there would be an adverse effect on a site designated under the European Birds or Habitats Directives. Detailed guidance on the appraisal of plans and projects which are likely to have a significant effect on such European sites and guidance under which compensatory measures are required, is provided in &quot;Managing Natura 2000 sites&quot;: the provisions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC&quot; published by the European Communities in 2000. Where the maintenance or improvement of sea walls would not have an adverse effect on a European site, there would be no requirement for compensatory measures.</p>
	<p pid=".893W.2/2">There is a more general requirement on Member States under the Birds Directive to &quot;take requisite measures to preserve, maintain or re-establish a sufficient diversity and area of habitats for all the species of birds referred to in Article 1&quot; of the Directive. Defra is currently considering what measures the Government should take in this respect as a result of coastal squeeze (i.e. loss of inter-tidal habitat through sea level rise against sea walls).</p>

	<p pid=".895W.3/2">Grey squirrels are very difficult animals to control particularly on a wide scale and it is not practical to eradicate them totally. The Forestry Commission is engaged in the preparation of a policy statement on grey squirrels. This is one of the commitments made in the response to the recommendations contained in the &quot;Sustaining England's Woodlands&quot; review. It will recommend appropriate strategies for managing grey squirrels in England.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/3">The UK red squirrel Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group (UKRSG) has identified those areas of the UK where action to maintain red squirrels is most likely to be effective in the long-term. In northern England, these priorities are being translated into management plans for key forest areas, where it is believed a combination of large-scale habitat management in forests and buffer areas allied to surveillance and targeted grey squirrel control gives the red squirrel the best chance of survival.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/4">The Forestry Commission provides current Best Practice guidance on the control of grey squirrel populations. The methods currently available are the use of Warfarin poison for protection against bark stripping damage to woodlands, where there are no red squirrels or pine martens. This is regulated under 'The Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986'. The use of Warfarin for plant protection is currently under review by the Plant Protection Directorate of the EU, and there is a risk that it may not be available for use in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/5">Cage trapping is as effective as poisoning at removing squirrels but more costly in terms of labour. Failing to check traps regularly may be an offence under the 'Protection of Animals Act 1911', and the 'Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996' .</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/6">Spring traps (tunnel traps) may be used to take squirrels, but there is an increased risk to non-target species. The use of Spring traps is regulated under the Pests Act 1954, and only traps approved under the 'Spring Traps (Approval) Order may be used.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/7">Shooting is generally ineffective at reducing numbers sufficiently to prevent bark-stripping damage, but can be effective for removal of nuisance squirrels, for example in amenity areas.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/8">The regulations on the permitted methods of dispatch include the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which lists prohibited methods. Under Schedule 9, Section 14 of the Act it is an offence to release grey squirrels into the wild.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/9">Options for non-lethal control are not currently practicable for squirrels, however the Forestry Commission is keeping them under review.</p>

	<p pid=".896W.2/1">The Department does not routinely collate data on the levels of urban fox populations, but commissions research into the subject from time to time. There have been a number of fox population estimates, the most generally accepted being that produced by Harris &quot;et al&quot; (1995), who estimated that in Britain there are 240,000 adult foxes at the start of the breeding season, and that these produce around 425,000 cubs each spring. Of these, 33,000 adult foxes (14 per cent.) live in urban areas. The total pre-breeding population in England is 195,000 adults, 22,000 in Wales and 23,000 in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.2/2">The paucity of population data for this species in rural habitats makes it particularly difficult to produce a population estimate. The fox population estimate for urban areas, in contrast, is based on more extensive data, and Harris &quot;et al&quot; (1995) considered it to be more reliable than that for rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".903W.10/2">The DTI and Defra have collaborated in work on Carbon Sequestration.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.10/3">The Cleaner Fossil Fuel Unit of the DTI has undertaken a number of studies to assess the feasibility of Carbon Capture and Storage in the UK. The accumulation of this work was a report published in September 2003 that provides estimates of the costs of carbon sequestration and discusses the issues around its implementation. The report and its supporting documentation are available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/coal/cfft/co2capture">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/coal/cfft/co2capture</a>. The work has been completed using effort from a combination of DTI officials and contractors (the estimated cost of the latter is &pound;600,000).</p>
	<p pid=".903W.10/4">The Marine and Waterways Division of Defra is concerned to protect the marine environment by ensuring that carbon sequestration in the maritime area is properly regulated. In 2003 Defra commissioned a literature review of research findings relevant to understanding the environmental impacts of release of sequestered CO <sub>2</sub> into the marine environment. Gaps in knowledge were identified and further research is planned. (Value &pound;24,611.) A joint Defra/DTI seminar was held in October 2003 to help develop the UK's policy on the regulation of this activity and to enable OSPAR to decide what work, if any, it needed to do on this subject. (Cost to Defra &pound;2,100). A summary of the report and information about the seminar can be found on Defra's website.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.10/5">Work in the form of continuing discussions at OSPAR, The London Convention and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.10/6">The use of carbon capture and storage would count towards the United Kingdom's Kyoto target provided the methods used had been subjected to international review and accepted by the UNFCCC review process. Methods are currently under consideration by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>

	<p pid=".904W.2/2">In line with wider Government policy to maximise the commercial application of technology from all sources, the Ministry of Defence continues to support defence diversification, including by investment in developing new technology in its supplier base and the establishment of new collaborative partnerships with industry and academia through such initiatives as Defence Technology Centres and Towers of Excellence. There are also links in place with other Departments to share good practice including in the context of the cross Government science initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".904W.2/3">One of the prime objectives of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) Public Private Partnership, announced in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, was to enhance the opportunity for the exploitation of technology generated by the Agency's laboratories. The creation of QinetiQ in 2001, and its progressive transfer to the private sector with the specific role of maximising the commercial return from its intellectual capital, was the single biggest encouragement of defence technology diversification. The other successor organisation to DERA, Dstl which was retained within the MOD, also has a role in exploiting defence technology. Dstl has achieved this through the establishment of Joint Ventures and licensing. In addition, the Defence Diversification Agency (DDA), set up initially within DERA in 1999, has promoted interchange between the defence and civil sectors to create jobs and wealth for the UK economy. The DDA has been active across many technologies and sectors particularly with Small and Medium Enterprises.</p>

	<p pid=".906W.2/1">Maintaining reliable energy supplies is one of the four objectives of the Energy White Paper (February 2003), which set the strategy for energy policy to 2050. Ministers were closely involved in discussions during its preparation. Delivery of the White Paper's commitments is carried out through the Sustainable Energy Policy Network (SEPN), a network of policy units from across government departments, the devolved administrations, regulators and other organisations which have a direct role to play. Its work is overseen by a Ministerial Committee which meets quarterly and regularly discusses issues relating to security of supply.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of unemployment from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/6" class="indent">The attached Table 1 gives the estimates of the number of people unemployed by gender and age in Scotland covering the twelve months ending February in 1997 and each year from 2000 to 2003. Figures for 1998 and 1999 are not yet available on a consistent basis. However, the LFS sample size is too small to give reliable estimates of unemployment in the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale Parliamentary Constituency and the Scottish Borders Unitary Authority. As with any statistical sample survey, estimates for the LFS are subject to sampling variability.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/7" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics of those claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for local areas including Parliamentary Constituencies. The attached Table 2 gives the annual average number of JSA claimants by gender and age for the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale Parliamentary Constituency, the Scottish Borders Unitary Authority and the Scotland Government office region for each year from 1997 to 2003.</p>

These data are drawn from the International Passenger Survey (IPS), the principal data source for measuring international migration to and from the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/6" class="indent">The following should be noted:</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/7" class="indent">'British nationals' have been interpreted as those travelling with a British passport.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/8" class="indent">An international migrant is defined as someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for a period of at least a year.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/9" class="indent">The IPS measures people's intentions at the time of arrival or departure. These intentions may or may not be realised.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/10" class="indent">The IPS asks the respondent their main reason for travel. The data includes those who said that their main reason for travel was business or work (where they had a definite job to go to), and that they intended to remain abroad for a period of at least a year. The estimates do not include people travelling for holiday work, business meetings or short- term contracts; they also do not include those stating they are travelling abroad to look for work. The IPS does not record whether a person is taking up permanent employment abroad.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/11" class="indent">The estimates do not include migration from the UK to the Irish Republic. The definition of the EU used for all years is that prior to expansion on the 1st May 2004 excluding the Irish Republic, i.e. the destination countries covered are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/12" class="indent">The attached table shows estimates for the above countries as a group for successive two-year periods from 1991&ndash;2 through to 2001&ndash;2. The IPS samples approximately 0.2 per cent. of all travellers using the principal air, sea and Channel Tunnel routes from the UK. This sample size is not large enough to allow reliable estimates to be made of the number of British nationals emigrating for work-related reasons by either destination country or by single year.</p>

Testing of job profiles in early implementer sites is helping to ensure the profiles available for national roll-out are as useful as possible, but it was always intended that the national profiles would extend and evolve over time and therefore no additional contingency planning is necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.5/1">Information on waiting times for fitting hearing aids is not collected locally or centrally. Waiting times in audiology, including those for digital hearing aids, are likely to have increased in some areas because of the modernising hearing aid services (MHAS) project. The Modernisation Agency's action on audiology team is working to help national health service organisations improve their own procedures locally in order to reduce waiting times. Information on national average waiting times for audiology is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/2">MHAS has improved the quality of life of those people who have received digital hearing aids. It has modernised services to make sure that deaf people receive the most advanced hearing aids available, rather than rely on outdated technology from the 1970s.</p>

	<p pid=".927W.2/1">The Government is committed to improving the position of disabled people in society and believes that public bodies should take the lead in promoting equal opportunities. That is why the draft Disability Discrimination Bill extends the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) to the functions of public bodies and introduces a duty on public bodies to promote equality for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".927W.2/2">Accordingly, the Department keeps the efficacy and efficiency of services provided to disabled people under constant review. The Department does not directly provide services for disabled people. Health service provision is the responsibility of the national health service; its quality and effectiveness of service is monitored by the Healthcare Commission. Social service provision is provided by local authorities, with their performance assessed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI).</p>
	<p pid=".927W.2/3">Themed inspections are carried out by the CSCI (formerly the Social Services Inspectorate), such as a series of inspection reports of services for people with learning disabilities produced in 2003. It also carries out more general inspections, such as on adult services, which also cover disability. The Healthcare Commission has produced a number of reports covering disability and mental health. It will be collecting data on disability status in future national patient surveys; this will enable the analysis of data on patient satisfaction levels by disability status and will further enhance our ability to compare variations in patient experience of different groups in the population.</p>
	<p pid=".927W.2/4">The Department is committed to building equality into its work and will be taking forward a project to improve the evidence base on equality to support improved policy making.</p>
	<p pid=".927W.2/5">The Department for Work and Pensions is responsible for monitoring statistics concerning the number of disabled people and it currently estimates that there are around 10 million adults in Great Britain who are covered by the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) (source, FRS 2002/3).</p>
	<p pid=".927W.2/6">The Department does not collect data on numbers of disabled people, but on users of social services. The referrals, assessments and packages of care (RAP) return collects annual information on the number of adults aged 18 and over receiving a community care assessment and the outcome of the assessment by client group. It also collects information on the number of adults receiving social services during the year and the type of services they receive. The client groups include people with physical and/or sensory disabilities, people with learning disabilities and those with mental health needs.</p>
	<p pid=".927W.2/7">In 2002&ndash;03, 1.7 million adults aged 18 and over received social services in England, of whom 1.4 million received community based services. Community based services include day care, meals, direct payments, equipment and transport, as well as home care.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.8/2">For nurses and midwives, it is for local employers to determine their employers training needs linked to local service plans.

	<p pid=".930W.0/1">Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority (SHA) reports that its capital review group (CRG) is responsible for the initial assessment of all full business cases presented to the SHA. If appropriate, the CRG will present the business case to the SHA executive board for formal approval. Final sign off is by the chief executive of the SHA, as the nominated representative of the executive board.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.0/2">Linear accelerators are used in external beam radiotherapy; one of the principal weapons used to combat cancer. Demand for radiotherapy in Shropshire continues to rise. Without a replacement linear accelerator, the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital will not be able to meet the demands for radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is a key element in the treatment of cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.0/3">The new linear accelerator will be a replacement for the current SL75/5 linear accelerator. Linear accelerators have a recognised 10 year life span. The SL75/5 linear accelerator at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital was installed in 1995 and is therefore due for replacement in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.0/4">Breaks in radiotherapy are to be avoided and can be detrimental to clinical outcome. The replacement will also ensure that continuity of clinical service can be maintained at all times with the existing linear accelerator.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.0/5">The cost of a linear accelerator is between &pound;750,000 to &pound;1.25 million, depending on machine specification and options required.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.0/6">The SHA reports that the cost of a bunker on the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital site has currently been estimated at &pound;1,012,000.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.0/7">The SHA also reports that the business case for the new linear accelerator is being appropriately processed and has not experienced any significant delay.</p>

The operations count of episode represent a count of finished admission episodes where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002&ndash;03) operation fields in a Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.2/85">4. Strategic health authority (SHA) data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&ndash;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on SHA of treatment is poor in 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.</p>

	<p pid=".937W.2/2">The number of paramedics employed in the national health service is increasing. As at September 2003, there were 7,094 paramedics employed in the NHS, an increase of 730 or 11 per cent., since 1997. The March 2003 national vacancy rate for ambulance staff was 0.7 per cent., indicating that local and national recruitment and retention initiatives are working. These include improving pay and conditions, encouraging the NHS to become a better, more flexible and diverse employer, increasing training, investing in child care and continuing professional development and running national and local recruitment campaigns. NHS Careers, in association with the Ambulance Service Association, has published a new brochure specifically to showcase careers in the ambulance services. Copies are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.2/3">In addition to the traditional paramedic training routes for ambulance technicians, the development of degree courses in paramedic science and foundation degrees with flexible entry and exit points, combined with career development in supervisory skills, team leadership and management, will help to encourage further new entrants into the profession. Other developments within ambulance services, such as expanding the role of paramedics to provide more out of hospital care, thus enabling faster treatment, and the development of new ways of working such as the first responder schemes, will continue to ensure there are attractive and rewarding careers for all ambulance staff, including paramedics.</p>

	<p pid=".946W.3/1">The latest year for which figures are available show that, in 2003&ndash;04, the national average cost of tuition to train a nurse over the three years of their course was &pound;19,370. Diploma students would also be entitled to a non-means tested bursary, which in 2003&ndash;04 averaged &pound;6,772 per annum.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.3/2">In the period between entry to medical school and full registration, it is estimated that training a doctor costs between &pound;200,000 and &pound;250,000. Doctors generally continue training after full registration. As the duration and nature of post-registration training varies greatly and as service and training costs are closely related, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost of training.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.8/1">The Government are committed to improving the position of disabled people in society and believe that public bodies should take the lead in promoting equal opportunities. That is why the draft Disability Discrimination Bill extends the DDA to the functions of public bodies and introduces a duty on public bodies to promote equality for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.8/2">Accordingly, the Department keeps the efficacy and efficiency of services provided to disabled people under constant review. For example, in the past year we have improved the provision of online Government information for disabled people and unpaid carers with the launch of Directgov in April 2004 (<a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/disability">www. direct.gov.uk/disability</a>). This covers a range of areas including rights, employment, independent living and health.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.8/3">We are in the process of modernising all benefits, including by making it possible to claim them online. Customers can already claim carer's allowance online and by the end of 2005, disabled customers will also be able to claim DLA and AA on-line. We also introduced a new substantially shortened claim forms for attendance allowance last October, which has simplified the claims process for disability benefits for those aged 65 or over.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.8/4">We are committed to helping disabled people into employment. For example, between April 2003 to March 2004 over 20,000 jobs were gained by participants on the New Deal for Disabled People programme. In addition, the Pathways to Work Program, a new way of giving early and continuing support to people on incapacity benefit is being piloted in several areas and is already generating good feedback and positive results.</p>

	<p pid=".957W.3/1">The Department is committed to ensuring that national insurance numbers (NINOs) are issued, used and controlled correctly. We will continue to develop and implement strategies and processes to enable us to achieve this commitment.</p>
	<p pid=".957W.3/2">In April 2001, we introduced the Enhanced NINO allocation Process (ENP). This process ensures a consistent robust approach to NINO allocation for benefit applications and for those starting work, or in employment. The ENP includes face to face interviews, the provision of more tools for verifying that documents are genuine, and comprehensive training for staff who are interviewing customers regarding applications for NINOs. We have continued to refine this process to achieve a balance between security and customer service.</p>
	<p pid=".957W.3/3">Before entitlement to benefit can be considered an individual and their partner need to satisfy section 19 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997 regarding NINO provision. This requires the customer to provide enough information and evidence to confirm that the NINO quoted on the claim is their own. Where a customer does not know their NINO, they are required to provide enough information and evidence in order that the correct NINO can be traced. If the customer does not have a NINO, they are required to verify their identity and provide enough information in order that a NINO can be issued.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.2/1">The New Deal has helped to achieve record levels of employment and has been an important boost to the economy, helping over a million people into work. Up to the end of March 2004, there were a total of 697,970 starts on New Deal 25-plus. In the same period, 178,000 people were helped into work through this programme, 117,250 of these into sustained, unsubsidised employment. Therefore almost 17 per cent. of starts have resulted so far in sustained, unsubsidised jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/2">A total of 141,580 people (over 20 per cent.) have found sustained employment through New Deal 25-plus. However, some of these are still in receipt of a job subsidy so are not recorded as having left New Deal.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/3">There are currently 54,840 people participating in New Deal 25-plus and a number of these will subsequently leave the programme to a sustained unsubsidised job. The proportion of leavers from the enhanced New Deal 25-plus programme (which started in April 2001) who have left to a sustained, unsubsidised job is 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/4">New Deal 25-plus has to be considered in the context of the people it sets out to help. Most have been out of work for 18 months or more in a healthy market and are considered among our hardest to help customers, frequently with multiple barriers to employment. Helping these customers into work is a substantial achievement. Not only does the programme help people into jobs as quickly as possible, it provides those facing greater difficulties with extra help to improve their job prospects and confidence. This help can include: work experience with an employer, training to develop the skills that employers want, and practical help with applying for jobs.</p>

	<p pid=".962W.9/1">Security remains fragile throughout Afghanistan. The north is subject to long-standing tensions between regional factions but is generally stable, with UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Mazar-e Sharif and Meymana helping to defuse tension. The New Zealand-led PRT in Bamian and the coalition PRT in Oruzgan are helping to maintain stability in central areas. There tend to be fewer security incidents in the west but units of the Afghan National Army (ANA) have deployed to Herat and Ghowr in recent months in response to violent incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".962W.9/2">Security in the south and east is more worrying, with attacks resulting in the murder of international and Afghan aid workers and officials. Seven PRTs have been established in southern and eastern provinces to help improve the security environment. Coalition forces and units of the ANA continue to pursue terrorists in these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".962W.9/3">Attempts by remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda to disrupt and undermine the democratic process are likely to increase as the elections approach. The UN, ISAF and the Coalition are working closely with the Afghan Government on providing a stable and secure environment for the elections. The expansion of ISAF, announced at the recent Istanbul Summit and including the UK PRTs, will help to achieve that.</p>

	<p pid=".970W.2/2">The United Kingdom has signed the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, and is committed to its ratification. The protocol requires us to criminalise trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour, slavery and the removal of organs.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.2/3">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 includes offences covering trafficking into, within and out of the United Kingdom. These offences were brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. New offences covering trafficking for exploitation, including trafficking for the purposes of slavery, forced labour and the removal of organs, are included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Bill, which is currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.2/4">We consider that, taken together with existing United Kingdom law, the commencement of the trafficking offences in clause 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill will mean we are in compliance with our legislative obligations under the protocol.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.2/5">To enable us to ratify the protocol we must first ratify the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime. We intend to ratify the convention as soon as all legislative requirements to bring our law into compliance with the convention are met.</p>

	<p pid=".975W.5/1">In my statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, I set out the Government's intentions with respect to inquiries following the publication of the reports compiled by Justice Peter Cory. As I said then, Justice Cory's reports raise serious questions which it is right to address further.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.5/2">I fully acknowledge the sacrifice that members of the security forces have made in the pursuit of peace in Northern Ireland. I am acutely aware of the pain and suffering endured by their families and the families of all the victims of terrorism.</p>

	<p pid=".980W.5/2">The Criminal Justice System Race Unit (CJS Race Unit) was announced in November 2002 to get beneath the surface of the Race and the Criminal Justice System figures (S.95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991) and understand the process through which discrimination may be occurring in the CJS. After consultation with stakeholders the Unit's priorities were identified as:</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/3" class="indent">Stop and Search;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/4" class="indent">Developing Statistics which Drive Change;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/5" class="indent">Victim and Witness Satisfaction; and</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/6" class="indent">Sentencing.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/7">In recognition of the importance of working with local services, the Unit's work is underpinned by work with Local Criminal Justice Boards providing advice, guidance and support on race, confidence and community engagement issues.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/8">Detailed are the Unit's achievements to date. The CJS Race Unit has:</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/9">Commissioned an overview report from the Institute for Criminal Policy research, King's College London, to be published with the next set of S.95 statistics, aimed at providing existing statistics to a broader audience and putting them into greater context;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/10">Commenced a fundamental review of the Race and CJS statistics, which is being undertaken by consultants from Portsmouth university. The aim is to establish what statistics should be collected, how they should be collected and how to produce statistics which can effectively inform policy development and evaluation and provide a tool for local management. The review will be reporting later this year;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/11">Worked closely with the Deputy Lord Chief Justice and Senior Presiding Judge to arrive at a specification for research into Courts to assess whether there is any quantitative evidence of different sentencing between people in different BME and white populations;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/12">Run a series of community workshops with young people on the impact of stop and search and Recommendation 61 of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, on relationships with the police;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/13">Set up the Stop and Search Action Team which brings together key officials concerned with stop and search to ensure that there is no duplication of effort, resources are used to their best effect and, that a single message is communicated to police forces, and others;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/14">Together with the Police Leadership and Powers Unit, developed interim guidance on the use of stop and search for forces with final guidance planned for December 2004;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/15">Facilitated stop and search arrest rates featuring in the Police Performance and Assessment Framework;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/16">Started practical work with selected police forces to reduce disproportionality;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/17">Working with Association of Chief Police Officers and the Police Federation to develop a toolkit for supervisors to ensure the effective management in the use of stop and search;</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/18">Worked to ensure that BME issues are integral to delivering CJS customer initiatives including walkthroughs and local communications; and</p>
	<p pid=".980W.5/19">Commissioned joint research into the needs of young Black men as victims of crime.</p>

	<p pid=".985W.3/1">The reform of the jury service provisions was a recommendation contained in Lord Justice Auld's Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales. Jury service is an extremely important civic duty. For too long a large number of people have been excused from serving on a jury because of their profession or position in society. The changes contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 send a clear message that serving the community as a juror is the responsibility of everyone. Expanding the pool of potential jurors will ensure that juries better reflect the communities from which they are drawn and this in turn should improve public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.3/2">No formal assessment has been conducted of the effect of these measures on police efficiency. However, we expect that the guidance issued to the Jury Central Summoning Bureau staff will allow individual officers who are summoned to defer jury service where there are good operational or personal reasons for doing so.</p>

	<p pid=".986W.2/1">The reduction of Stage 2 of police probationer training has taken place within the context of discussions with Centrex over their budget for 2004&ndash;05. Representatives of Centrex, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and force training managers considered the length of Stage 2 in detail and concluded that 12 weeks would be sufficient to impart a fully comprehensive probationer training programme. I am satisfied that the reduction in length of Stage 2 will in no way affect the quality of the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.2/2">The 12 week programme will embrace the principles of practice-based learning and community involvement, and focus on the role and context of policing. In response to force feedback, there will be intakes every six weeks. There will be no general increase of class size and no change in the probationer-to-trainer ratio.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.2/3">The content of the law aspects of the course has been thoroughly reviewed in consultation with force training managers to remove any duplication of teaching. Some material has been changed from traditional classroom training to self-study.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.2/4">The relatively small amount of basic public order training delivered to new recruits will be removed, but forces will continue to deliver public order training during Stage 3. Extensive training is available for those officers who choose to specialise in public order. This change is fully supported by force training managers.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.2/5">Case file preparation will be removed as forces agree that probationers should focus their initial training on the basic principles of evidence gathering, leaving the technical aspects of case file preparation to Stage 3. However, training on statements will be retained.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.2/6">Passing out parades will be withdrawn, as the philosophy of the modernised, restructured programme is to encourage probationers to take greater personal responsibility for their development, and in particular their fitness.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.2/7">All of these changes have been made in consultation with key stakeholders, who are content that the approach taken will not impact negatively on the provision of Stage 2 probationer training. The programme will still impart all the essential components of the 15 week course.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.2/8">A new probationer training programme which is under development, will see a shift away from residential training to learning in the workplace and focus on delivery in the community. These new methods of delivering recruit training have been successfully piloted in five forces.</p>

As part of our normal support for defence exports, we have had discussions with a number of countries regarding Typhoon. The details of these discussions are sensitive and I am withholding the information under Section 1b of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

Many local authorities have reviewed or are reviewing school support staff pay in the light of the Single Status Agreement introduced by the National Joint Council for Local Government Services from <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> to harmonise the pay and conditions of all local authority staff.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.0/3">In October 2003, the Secretary of State announced a package of measures that will restore stability to the school funding system, including the introduction of a 4 per cent. minimum per pupil guarantee for schools. In addition to increases in general funding, for 2004&ndash;05 &pound;279 million for support staff salaries is included in the new School Development Grant, worth &pound;647 million in total. Schools are free to spend their School Development Grant on any purpose that supports improvements in teaching and learning.</p>

As academies are not directly funded by the Learning and Skills Council a protocol has been developed between the Department and the LSC for working together and for ensuring that information is shared effectively. The protocol encourages new academy partnerships to share information with the relevant local LSC in the early stages of the project. Expressions of interest for new academy projects are circulated to the national and relevant local LSC for comment before being submitted to Ministers for approval. And the national and local LSC is notified when Ministers approve funding for a new academy.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.8/16">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.8/17">1. The data are taken from Lancashire LEA's Section 52 Budget Statements submitted to the DfES. S52 is collected at local authority level not district level and consequently the figures provided are for Lancashire LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.8/18">2. The layout of Table 1 of the budget statement in 2003&ndash;04 was different to the layout used in previous years and consequently for financial years 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 the spend by LEAs on SEN was not separated out into the schools budget and LEA budget. For 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 the total central spend by LEAs on SEN is recorded on lines 1.4.1 to 1.4.4, 1.4.7 to 1.4.9 and 1.9 from table 1 of the S52 budget statement.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.8/19">3. The funding delegated to primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot; is as recorded on Table 2 of the budget statement. Figures are only indicative of the amount that might be spent by schools on SEN. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds. Figures may not sum due to rounding.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.8/20">4. The SEN element of the schools budget includes the provision for pupils with statements, specialist report for statemented and non-statemented pupils, collaboration and integration, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad and inter-authority recoupment. This is recorded in lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.6 in Table 1 of the 2003&ndash;04 budget statement.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.8/21">5. The SEN element of the LEA budget includes educational psychology service/assessments and statementing, LEA functions in relation to child protection, health service partnerships/special medical attention, parent partnership, guidance and information and promoting good practice and collaboration. This is recorded in line 2.2.6 of Table 1 of the 2003&ndash;04 budget statement.</p>

	<p pid=".1008W.2/1">The Secretary of State has not had any discussions on the effect of excluding families in receipt of working tax credits (WTC) from remission of charges for board and lodging on residential educational visits. If families who receive WTC received free board and lodging on residential trips, it is unlikely that LEAs and schools would have sufficient funds to run most residential trips. For this reason remission of these charges is targeted at non-working families in receipt of specific means tested benefits, as we consider that they are the families most in need of additional help.</p>
