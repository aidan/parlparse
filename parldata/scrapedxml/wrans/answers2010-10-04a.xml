	<p pid="a.1271W.0/1">DEFRA has not met with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) recently to discuss reform of its fishery certification programme and eco-label scheme. Officials meet with MSC representatives routinely as one of many partners aiming to achieve sustainable fisheries, in recognition that third-party certification programmes, such as the MSC scheme, have a role to play in supporting efforts by governments to improve the management of our fisheries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1271W.0/2">In recent years, staff from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), an executive agency of DEFRA, have provided advice to the MSC on technical matters about the certification of specific fisheries and have participated in stakeholder workshops to address the quality and consistency of the MSC's certification process. However, the MSC is an independent non-profit making organisation and, while DEFRA and CEFAS officials will provide appropriate policy and technical support as requested, management of their scheme is ultimately a matter for the MSC.</p>

Two recent examples are the data toolkit used by Fire and Rescue Services for recording resources and station end equipment in local fire stations. The toolkit cannot capture all the data needed to accurately and reliably route the nearest and most appropriate fire appliance to an incident.

	<p pid="a.1279W.0/2">In April 2006, Children and Learners Teams were established in Government Offices to provide advice, support and challenge to local areas across all children's services, as well as co-ordinating and managing the Department's other regional activity. At that time, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) was responsible for in-year monitoring of local authority children's social care services as set out in the statutory guidance, Working Together to Safeguard Children, 2006 (&quot;Working Together&quot;). From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> these monitoring functions also became part of the responsibilities of the Children and Learners Teams based in Government Offices as set out in Local Authority Circular (2007) 25.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.0/3">&quot;Working Together&quot; was updated in March 2010. It sets out the responsibilities of Government Offices in relation to safeguarding as including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;giving support and challenge to LSCBs and to Children's Trust Boards in relation to SCR (Serious Case Review) and CDOP (Child Death Overview Panel) activity and implementation. This includes seeking assurance that LSCB and Children's Trust plans are in place and action is being taken to effectively address recommendations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.0/5">Both &quot;Working Together&quot; and the Local Authority Circular (2007) 25 have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.0/6">In practice, Children and Learner Teams have discharged their responsibilities in safeguarding by, for example, working with local areas to understand their specific challenges, advising on programmes of available support and good practice, as well as facilitating local networks. These Teams have also sought assurance that statutory action plans are in place and being implemented to address recommendations identified through inspection reports. Where serious case reviews are concerned, these Teams have been responsible for providing support and challenge such as commenting on the quality of the reviews' analysis and recommendations. These Teams have also used local knowledge to alert the Department so as to influence national policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.0/7">&quot;The Coalition: our programme for government&quot; announced the decision to close the Government Office for London and to review the position of the other eight Government Offices. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced the Government's intention in principle to abolish the remaining eight Government Offices. A final decision will be made at the end of the Spending Review in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.0/8">Closing the Government Offices network is in line with the Government's policy on removing administrative layers and simplifying accountability across national and local government, and reducing public expenditure. It will also contribute to delivering the Government's commitment to empower local authorities by removing top down monitoring, support and challenge, freeing them up to focus on their own plans for improvement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.8/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your Parliamentary Questions that asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.8/4" class="indent">&quot;How many young people received education maintenance allowance in Stretford and Urmston constituency in each of the last three years; and of those how many (a) were lone parents, (b) had previously been in custody and (c) were living away from home.&quot; (PQ 13436)</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.8/6" class="indent">Information on the number of young people who have received Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is available at local authority level, but not at constituency level. EMA take-up is defined as young people who have received one or more EMA payments in the academic year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.8/7" class="indent">EMA take-up for Trafford Local Authority area in the last three academic years is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.8/8" class="indent">2007/08: 2,256</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.8/9" class="indent">2008/09: 2,344</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.8/11" class="indent">The EMA application process does not routinely ask for information of the type requested. In certain circumstances, however, the categories of learner you are interested in can be identified from other supporting information provided, although there might be other learners in the totals above who also fall into these categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.8/12" class="indent">Within the figures above it is possible to identify:</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.8/13" class="indent">2007/08: Independent Learners - 19; Parents - less than 5*; Young Offenders - less than 5*</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.8/20" class="indent">Young Offenders are those who applied for EMA whilst in custody under the special arrangements that apply for this group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.8/21" class="indent">Data for the 2008/09 year should be treated with caution due to service delivery issues faced during that year which affected the management information available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1299W.2/2">A number of colleges and employers are concerned that changes proposed to the content and funding arrangements for sector-endorsed plumbing qualifications risk excluding full-time students and, that in many cases the full-time offer for 16 to 18-year-olds does not properly prepare them for employment. The Government take these concerns seriously. The regulator, Ofqual, the funding agencies and the Sector Skills Council 'Summit Skills' have agreed to defer the date of the proposed changes from September 2010 to spring 2011. Officials from the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will use the autumn term to work with all key partners, including colleges, to look more closely at the issues and I will be happy to make a statement once this work has concluded.</p>

	<p pid="a.1301W.0/2">The Department does not currently gather the support staff pay data that would be needed to estimate accurately the average cost of employing a classroom assistant in the maintained sector. There is no central mechanism for deciding the pay of school support staff, with employers having responsibility for determining the salaries of school support staff at local level. However, some research data exist, for example, the Deployment and Impact of Support Staff in Schools (Blatchford et al., 2009) reported that the hourly wage of teaching assistant equivalent staff as at 2008 was &#163;10.28, based on sample survey data collated over several years. This does not include superannuation or employers' national insurance contributions. This figure includes the salaries of teaching assistants, higher level teaching assistants, nursery nurses, therapists and learning support assistants for pupils with special educational needs. The figure includes staff in primary and secondary schools and schools for pupils with special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1303W.5/2">The average annual cost per regular full-time qualified classroom teacher in local authority maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools, schools for pupils with special educational needs and pupil referral units in England and Wales as at March 2009 was &#163;41,000. This data is provisional and is the most recent available. The average cost for financial year 2009-10 is forecast to be &#163;41,600; for 2010-11 it is forecast to be &#163;42,600 and for 2011-12 and 2012-13 it is forecast to be &#163;43,100. The forecasts are based on the headline pay awards that have been previously announced of 2.3% in September 2009 and September 2010 followed by a two year pay freeze. Further years will depend on recommendations made by the independent school teachers' review body. These figures include employers' superannuation and employers' national insurance contributions. With regards to national insurance contributions, the secondary threshold and upper accruals point in 2011-12 are increased based on the announcements and forecast indexation rate in the June 2010 budget. These are assumed to remain the same for 2012-13. The average is for all regular full-time qualified teachers in England and Wales except head, deputy and assistant head teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303W.5/3">The Department does not currently gather the support staff pay data that would be needed to estimate accurately the average cost of employing a classroom assistant in the maintained sector. There is no central mechanism for deciding the pay of school support staff, with employers having responsibility for determining the salaries of school support staff at local level. As such it is not possible to make accurate forecasts of the future costs of support staff. However, some research data exist, for example, the Deployment and Impact of Support Staff in Schools (Blatchford et al., 2009) reported that the hourly wage of teaching assistant equivalent staff as at 2008 was &#163;10.28, based on sample survey data collated over several years. This does not include superannuation or employers' national Insurance contributions. This figure includes the salaries of teaching assistants, higher level teaching assistants, nursery nurses, therapists and learning support assistants for pupils with special educational needs. The figure includes staff in primary and secondary schools and schools for pupils with special educational needs.</p>

The project delivery schedule has been subjected to routine review and assessment, taking into account results from tests and trials, to ensure that the project delivers the operational requirement as quickly as possible, without compromising essential safety, reliability and protection standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1315W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) encourages its serving personnel to prepare for their return to civilian life during their careers by purchasing their own homes. Measures include the Long Service Advance of Pay, an interest-free loan of up to &#163;8,500, and the Armed Forces Home Ownership Scheme, a shared equity initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1315W.0/2">Further information on civilian housing is available for all Service personnel, in particular those about to return to civilian life, through the MOD Joint Service Housing Advice Office (JSHAO). JSHAO provide briefings to Service families on their housing options ranging from home ownership through to applying for social housing. Service personnel are also given information on Key Worker Living status, which has been extended to enable Service Leavers to access sponsored affordable housing schemes 12 months after discharge, as well as exploring interim solutions such as occupying empty Service Families Accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1315W.0/3">For those who have already discharged, housing is a devolved matter and local authorities are responsible for framing their own social housing allocations schemes. A number of measures have been introduced that seek to make it easier for Service personnel leaving the armed forces to obtain social housing including changes to the legislation in England and Wales to ensure that Service personnel are recognised as having a local connection, through residency or employment, when applying for social housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1315W.0/4">Single former Service personnel are able to access the SPACES (Single Personnel Accommodation for Ex Services) project. This aims to assist single Service leavers to secure appropriate accommodation as they leave the armed forces and reduce the likelihood of becoming homelessness. Mike Jackson House in Aldershot has been built on land gifted by the MOD and provides fully furnished sing room accommodation for up to 35 individuals. The latest development is The Beacon on the outskirts of Catterick Garrison, also being built on MOD gifted land, that will provide a further 31 accommodation flats from March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1318W.3/2">No direct testing has been performed on the T102 Radar but it is of a sufficiently similar system design to the T101 that it is determined that the radar will be affected by the presence of turbines but not to the same degree as the T101.</p>

It also makes clear that local policies should include fair concessions for all patients whose healthcare needs require extended or frequent access to hospital. This will include, but is not restricted to, disabled patients or those undergoing cancer treatment. Hospitals must also comply with their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to meet the needs of disabled visitors.</p>

			<tr pid="a.1326W.6/34"> <td colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i>  The data are not a count of people, as the same person may have been admitted on more than one occasion.  <i> 1. Finished consultant episode (FCE)</i> A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.  <i> 2. Primary diagnosis</i> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. The ICD-10 code what used to define obesity is E66-Obesity.<i>   3. Number of episodes with a (named) main procedure</i> The number of episodes where the procedure was recorded in the main procedure field in a HES record. Note that more procedures are carried out than the number of episodes with a main procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode. The number of episodes with any main procedure include '&amp;' (not known), and for OPCS 4.3/4.4/4.5 (from 2006-07) codes A01-X97, or for OPCS 4.2 (prior to 2006-07) codes A01-X59.  <i> 4. Ethnicity</i> Ethnicity data may not be good enough to allow accurate analysis, including analysis of ethnic differences. Ethnic group was collected from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 2002 and ethnic category, using the definitions in the 2001 census, from 1 April 2002. Patients are asked to select their category from a standard list, and some decline to do this. Data may therefore be incomplete and of poor quality.  <i> 5. Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i> Data quality</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies.

	<p pid="a.1331W.2/1">The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains fragile. In terms of levels of malnutrition, disease and access to primary healthcare, the humanitarian situation is stable but remains a constant cause of concern. Food insecurity is particular serious, with 75% of Gazans (approximately 1,045,000 people) dependent on food aid. We estimate that the erosion of skills, infrastructure and institutions in the health and water sectors is likely to lead to further deterioration in the humanitarian situation over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1332W.3/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether there are plans to reorganise the work of the Child Support Agency to transfer legacy cases to new child support systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.3/5" class="indent">The problems encountered by the Child Support Agency following the launch of the Reforms in 2003 resulted in a decision to defer the bulk transfer of cases from the old (launched in 1993) scheme, to the current (launched in 2003) child support scheme. In the meantime, cases were only migrated from the old computer system to the new computer system where they had a link with a case on the new system that made this necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.3/6" class="indent">This decision was kept under review and in February 2006 the previous Government asked Sir David Henshaw to review the entire system of child maintenance. His subsequent report led to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008, which makes provision for a new system of child maintenance known as the &quot;future scheme&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.3/7" class="indent">The Commission continues to develop plans for a future scheme that is intended to replace both the existing schemes. As with all government departments, the Commission is undertaking a review of its plans as part of the current spending review and in line the new government's priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1339W.3/1">The package of measures announced in the June Budget and being introduced for the Local Housing Allowance in 2011-12, including the removal of the &#163;15 excess planned by the previous administration, will achieve savings of around &#163;1 billion by 2015-16. The other changes to Housing Benefit announced in the June Budget are estimated to save a further &#163;1.1 billion in 2015-16. Overall, this represents a reduction of 9% in the total 2015-16 expenditure on Housing Benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.3/2">The reduction in Housing Benefit expenditure will reduce the amount customers receive from the Government towards their rent. However, the purpose of reform is to influence rent levels and housing choices, which is likely at least in part to mitigate the impact of these measures on poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.3/3">The impact of the Housing Benefit measures should also not be considered in isolation of the wider package of measures that have been announced; importantly the extra money distributed to families with children through the tax credit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.3/4">Most Housing Benefit customers will be affected by the changes announced to Housing Benefit in the June Budget so there is no disproportionate impact on any particular working age family type within Housing Benefit. However, the changes have a larger impact on very large families and also on households of all sizes in inner London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.3/5">Discretionary Housing Payments are currently &#163;20 million a year, and will increase to &#163;30 million in 2011-12 and then to &#163;60 million a year from 2012-13. In discussion with local authorities, these resources will give extra support to areas where the impacts are greatest. It will give authorities more flexibility to provide additional support where it is most needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1348W.2/1">Winter Fuel Payments are annual lump-sum payments with the majority paid in November and December each year. European Community law means that some benefits acquired in one member of state must be paid to people when they move to another country within the European economic area. Winter Fuel Payments are only paid to former UK residents living in the European economic area if they qualified for payment before leaving the UK. The number of Winter Fuel Payments made to former UK residents living abroad is in the following table.</p>
