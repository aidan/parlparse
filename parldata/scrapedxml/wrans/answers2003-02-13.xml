	<p pid=".855W.3/1">The Civil Service is committed to ensuring that it has the right skills and experience at all levels. The service does this both by developing its own staff and by bringing in talent from outside the service including the private and voluntary sectors. In 2001&ndash;02 there were 200 posts at SCS level filled by open competition, up from 107 in 1998. Of these 77 (39 per cent.) were filled by civil servants, 86 (43 per cent.) from the broader public sector and 37 (18 per cent.) from the private sector. In addition, the service makes use of expertise from the private and voluntary sector through a programme of interchange, including at SCS level.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.3/2">The service does not target graduates specifically for recruitment into the senior civil service since we are looking for those who have demonstrated the relevant skills and experience for the particular job. However, graduate recruitment exercises are run at lower levels of the service, both through individual Departments' schemes and the centrally-run fast stream graduate trainee scheme.</p>

They find that the conditional exemption scheme is able to secure greater and/or better quality opportunities for access than those afforded by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, and they will continue to seek such added benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".863W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence takes the issues of diversification very seriously and encourages the widest possible exploitation of defence technology by the civil sector. In order to facilitate this we established the Defence Diversification Agency (DDA) in 1999 and it continues with its original aims:</p>
	<p pid=".863W.2/2" class="indent">To encourage the wider use of defence science and technology in the civil sector.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.2/3" class="indent">To encourage the transfer to suitable civil technology into military programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.2/4" class="indent">To assist the defence industry with their own diversification planning.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.2/5">To deliver these objectives the DDA has established a network of technology brokers across the United Kingdom. Thus far 18 offices have been opened with further ones planned.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.2/6">Each office is staffed with a Technology Diversification Manager whose role is to seek business opportunities working in partnership with local business support and enterprise groups.</p>

	<p pid=".865W.0/1">Reservists are not usually required to provide details of any civilian employment to the Ministry of Defence until such time as they are called-out. Historically, therefore, no central records have been maintained by the MOD of the numbers of reservists working in the NHS as doctors, nurses, paramedics and other professionals allied to medicine. Although the MOD encourages reservists to declare their reserve status to civilian employers, there is no legal requirement to do so unless specified in individual contracts of employment. The call-out papers sent to reservists require them to advise the MOD of their civilian employer, and to pass to their employer documents relating to their call-out, including a form for the employer to return to the MOD acknowledging the call-out.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.0/2">Information is not available centrally on the civilian employment of medical reservists called-out for service in the event of military action against Iraq. However, some medical reservists who have been issued with call-out papers had previously declared their civilian employment. As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-06">6 February</phrase>, 345 medical reservists in the Volunteer Reserve Forces had been sent call-out papers, and of these, 194 are understood to be working in the NHS. In addition, 182 medical ex-regular Royal Air Force personnel with a reserve liability have been sent call-out papers but information on their civilian employment is not currently available.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.0/3">NHS hospital trusts would be informed by reservists of their call-out when they receive their call-out papers. The MOD will work with the Department of Health to minimise disruption to the NHS as far as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".875W.8/1">Dairy farmers in the north-west, in common with the rest of the country, benefit indirectly from the Dairy CAP, which involves expenditure of nearly two billion euros across the Community. Despite this considerable expenditure, the farmgate price of milk remains below the level at which many dairy farmers can make the investment required to sustain their businesses. This clearly shows the current Dairy CAP is failing farmers and is in need of reform. The UK Government do not regard the Commission proposals for dairy reform in the context of the Mid Term Review to go far enough to address those concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.8/2">The prices negotiated between farmers and purchases, or processors and retailers, are private commercial matters in which the Government cannot get involved. We have not therefore met with representatives of the dairy industry specifically to discuss this issue. However, Ministers frequently meet with representatives from all parts of the dairy sector in the course of their duties, to discuss the overall market situation, and we are well aware of concerns about prices.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.8/3">We believe that a sustainable future for dairy farming is best secured through the action we have already announced in response to the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the Future of Food and Farming and our Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food, which we published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-12">12 December 2002</phrase>. My noble Friend, Lord Whitty has convened a number of meetings of an informal dairy supply chain group, which has addressed some of these issues. In addition, at its next meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February 2003</phrase> this group will discuss how the industry might address any lessons that emerge from the on-going study by KPMG on the structure of the UK dairy sector and milk pricing, which was commissioned by the Milk Development Council, as well as the Commission's proposals for reform of the Dairy CAP.</p>

Additionally the agency, in co-operation with Herefordshire county council, has put into place an emergency response procedure for Hampton Bishop.

	<p pid=".880W.2/2">Janet Hughes was ordered by the Court to pay Defra's legal costs following an unsuccessful judicial review claim. The Department has a responsibility to protect public expenditure. The possibility of having to pay costs for unsuccessful litigation is something of which Ms Hughes should have been made fully aware by her legal advisers at the time. My Department gave her a number of opportunities to put forward payment proposals, which she has refused to do until now. I am considering the proposal she has now made.</p>

	<p pid=".881W.3/2">We are currently investigating deposit systems used in other European countries. Some of these countries have reported very high administrative costs, which could make these schemes a more expensive way of recycling products than other collection methods. Some countries have reported benefits from such systems, particularly in terms of higher recycling rates, but sometimes these occur in the countries which have high packaging waste recycling targets and it is not clear that deposit systems on their own would deliver high recycling rates in a cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.3/3">We would therefore need to consider both the costs and benefits of a deposit scheme. We would also have to examine how deposit systems could complement and add to other means of encouraging waste minimization and recycling, such as the packaging regulations.</p>

Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-03">3 February 2003</phrase> is now open for applications from those projects that consider they meet the criteria set out in the statement. Funding is available to meet all eligible applications. The regulator of LTCS, Entrust, will also administer this scheme and further information is available on the Entrust website at <a href="http://www.entrust.org.uk">www.entrust.org.uk</a> In implementing this transitional funding arrangement, the Government are putting in place a straightforward process for making decisions on funding to ensure minimum delay and uncertainty for on-going projects. Also, by establishing this transitional funding period the Government are providing a reasonable period for projects to manage the consequences of the decision announced in the Pre-Budget Report.</p>

	<p pid=".883W.8/2">A significant area of the land to be planted in the 2003&ndash;04 season has already been approved for grant aid, and the Forestry Commission is not expecting a substantial reduction in applications in 2003. In addition, planting under Challenge and other schemes is not affected by the closing dates. Overall, the Commission has assessed that the changes to the closing dates would have minimal impact on the rural economy, rural employment, skills retention and the forest nursery trade.</p>

	<p pid=".884W.3/1">The UK National Aviation Security Programme does not specifically require airlines to ask passengers to prove their identity, and while all measures are kept under review, there is no present intention that it should do so. The primary measures which underpin security in this area is that all passengers, all items of hand baggage and all items of hold baggage must be screened, and that airlines must ensure that the person who checks in hold baggage is the same person who subsequently boards the aircraft. We do not specify how airlines should achieve this, instead allowing them flexibility. On international flights where passports are carried, airlines usually use these to confirm identity. On domestic flights, and those to the Republic of Ireland where there is no need to carry a passport, airlines adopt a variety of methods to ensure that those who check hold baggage then travel with it.</p>

	<p pid=".884W.6/1">The Air Travel Reserve Fund was wound up in 1986 and its functions were transferred to the Air Travel Trust Fund (ATTF). The ATTF provides a back-up facility to the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme, should a bond held by an ATOL holder be insufficient to meet customer claims in the event of that company's financial failure. Taken together, the ATOL scheme and the ATTF cover air tickets sold by an ATOL holder, either as part of a package or on a seat-only basis. Air tickets sold directly by airlines or their ticketing agents are not covered, but some purchasers may be protected when a credit card is used. In the event of failure of an ATOL holder, the Civil Aviation Authority will ensure that those abroad at the time will be able to continue their holidays and return home, and will reimburse those who have paid for their holiday but have yet to travel.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.2/1">Advanced stop lines are dealt with in rules 55 and 154 of the Highway Code. The Traffic Signs Regulations 2002 and DfT Circular 02/2003 clarify that all vehicles are required to stop at the first stop line unless they have already proceeded beyond it or are a pedal cycle proceeding in the cycle lane. This information is already available on the Department's Traffic Signs website and will be included in a leaflet we are publishing about new signs and changes in the meaning of existing signs. Enforcement is the responsibility of the police.</p>

The original programme resolution for the Committee's proceedings was agreed by the Programming Sub-Committee at its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-09">9 December 2002</phrase>.

	<p pid=".895W.3/2">On two occasions during the Bill's passage through Committee, Programming Sub-Committee resolutions to move knives were agreed. This enabled hon. Members to focus on clauses of the Bill that they felt merited more detailed discussion. As a result of the agreed programme, the knives led to 101 clauses and five Schedules being moved forthwith by the Chair. It is worth noting, however, that, just because a clause was not reached by the Committee, it does not mean that substantive points on that clause were not raised and debated in full during earlier debates.</p>

The returns from local authorities have shown year on year increases in the numbers of day nurseries, out of school clubs and holiday schemes. However, the numbers of playgroups and child minders have been declining. Many playgroups are converting to full day care and this means that they are re-classified as day nurseries rather than playgroups. The Department is encouraging this conversion by offering assistance to playgroups to extend their services to full day care in order to meet more parents' needs.</p>

	<p pid=".903W.3/1">In addition to the stringent requirements in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 regarding the use of non-human primates, the use of wild-caught non-human primates in scientific experiments is subject to supplementary additional considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.3/2">We announced in 1997 that we cannot foresee any circumstances under which we would be prepared to issue licences under the 1986 Act for programmes of work involving the use of Great Apes (chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans), and that exceptional justification would be required for the licensed use of other types of non-human primates taken from the wild.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.3/3">The 1986 Act provides that non-human primates, whether captive bred or wild-caught, can only be used when no other species are suitable for the purposes of the programme to be specified in the licence, or that it is not practicable to obtain animals of any other species that are suitable for those purposes. For the use of wild-caught primates to be exceptionally authorised, there must be no appropriate alternative, no suitable captive-bred animals available and the likely benefits of the programme of work would have to fully justify their use.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.3/4">In respect of applications to use wild-caught non-human primates, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate and the Animal Procedures Committee provide advice on a case by case basis on whether and on what terms such use should be licensed. Application of these stringent criteria has meant that first time use of wild-caught non-human primates in scientific procedures has not been licensed in the UK for some years.</p>

	<p pid=".907W.2/3">Their organised paedophilia targets include paedophile rings operating within the internet who display a hierarchical structure, a high level of technical ability, the use of strong encryption, a knowledge of law enforcement techniques and international in nature. It also includes those persons profiting from the commercial exploitation of on line child abuse, through the provision of pay for view child pornography.</p>

	<p pid=".907W.2/7"><i>(c)</i> NHTCU investigators have received training from clinical psychologists in relation to the investigation of offences of child abuse on line.

	<p pid=".909W.5/2">Under the regime of resource accounting introduced by the Government in April 2001, Departments now account for their expenditure in terms of when resources are consumed, rather than when cash is paid. Thus, the Department now budgets for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme in terms of the amount of compensation committed in any particular year rather than simply the amount of cash expended in that year.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/3">In 2002&ndash;03 the resource budget for compensation payable under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was &pound;183.264 million. An additional budget for scheme administration costs was &pound;29.82 million.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/4">The amount of money paid in compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority in each month of 2002&ndash;03 to date is:</p>

	<p pid=".912W.2/18">The general prison population contains a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide and self-harm.Good care and support from staff saves many lives but such instances go largely unreported. The Prison Service's approach, in close partnership with other agencies such as the Youth Justice Board, and outside organisations such as Samaritans, is to better identify and support those who seem at greatest risk, with an approach that focuses on staff/prisoner relationships and the physical environment.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/19">The Prison Service is currently developing a new suicide prevention and self-harm reduction policy through a programme of projects that aim to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; the exchange of information; the care of prisoners; detoxification; prisoners supporting each other, and learning from investigations into deaths in custody.</p>

The EA has identified this length as having a potential weakness in extreme flood conditions. Additionally the Agency, in co-operation with Herefordshire county council, has put into place an Emergency Response Procedure for Hampton Bishop.

	<p pid=".922W.2/1">The Government are committed to addressing the problems caused by bullying in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.2/2">We believe that the best place for bullying to be tackled is where it happens&mdash;in the workplace itself. This means changing the culture in the workplace to one where bullying is unacceptable. The DTI is promoting best practice and workplace initiatives to tackle bullying through developing partnership between employers and employees.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.2/3">The Government have established the Partnership Fund, which has launched a number of projects specifically focused on bullying and others that include its eradication as part of an overall culture change. We are also working with the HSE to develop a Relationship Management Standard which will provide a benchmark for employers to evaluate and improve workplace practices.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.2/4">A net of legislation is already in place to protect workers from the most serious kinds of bullying, for instance in cases of discrimination or harassment. The Government publish guidance booklets on how this legislation can be used, and ACAS provide a nationwide telephone advice line offering assistance to employers and employees on bullying and other employment issues.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.2/5">The Employment Act 2002 will take the safety net of legislation further by providing improved employment conditions for an additional six million employees who currently do not have access to adequate internal procedures to deal with discipline and grievance cases.</p>

	<p pid=".924W.2/2">The Government continues to work with the EU and all other WTO members to try and reach agreement on the important issue of TRIPS and Public Health. We see the recently declared EU moratorium (on taking to Dispute Settlement any country exporting copies of patented medicines to other developing countries in need) as purely a stop-gap solution.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.2/3">Access to medicines goes much wider than this aspect of intellectual property. The Government is committed to working holistically to solve issues of delivery, research and funding as well. For example, the Government has since 1997 committed &pound;1.5 billion to strengthening healthcare systems in developing countries. The Government has also committed $200 million over five years to the Global Trust Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. In addition the 2002 budget set up a new tax credit available to companies who set up health-related research and development to fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.2/4">In addition a UK working group set up by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development produced a report last November on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World (<a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>). The Government continues to work with all members of this group to implement the recommendations as widely as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.11/1">Firms generally cease trading as the result of a combination of factors, including increases in costs. It is therefore very hard to estimate the effect of insurance premium increases on the number of businesses that have ceased trading. The Government's current review of employers' liability insurance aims to examine the impact of the current system on employers, and make recommendations accordingly.

	<p pid=".929W.0/1">District councils in Northern Ireland came under a statutory duty to undertake air quality assessment and management only with the recent enactment of the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2002. The Order requires district councils to identify areas where air quality standards are not likely to be achieved within specified timescales and to draw up action plans setting out the proposals they, and other relevant authorities, have for the reduction of air pollution levels in those areas.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.0/2">However, in anticipation of the new legislation, all 26 district councils had voluntarily completed an initial screening of pollution sources having a significant impact within the district council area in order to identify pollutants of concern locally. As a consequence, all 26 district councils are now engaged in a more detailed assessment of the pollutants identified in the initial screening. No district council has yet reached the stage of drawing up air quality action plans.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.0/3">To assist with the review and assessment process, the Department of the Environment has provided grant-aid of some &pound;l million to district councils in the 2001&ndash;02 and current financial years. Similar provision has been made for continuation of the grant scheme in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.0/4">The Department proposes to issue shortly technical guidance on the review and assessment process and on the preparation of action plans. This guidance has been drawn up by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in conjunction with the devolved Administrations. The Department also proposes in the near future to issue for consultation a policy guidance paper designed to assist district councils, and other relevant authorities, to meet their air quality management obligations.</p>

	<p pid=".929W.3/1">There are no measures aimed specifically at introducing low emission vehicles specifically into airport operations within Northern Ireland. In broader terms, there are national polices in place to reduce emissions from vehicles generally, such as the Powershift programme, administered by the Energy Saving Trust. This programme was established in order to stimulate the market for clean fuel vehicles in the UK. Financial support is available under the programme to help with the purchase of vehicles which are proven to offer emissions benefits and which have shown to be technically viable.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.3/2">In addition, the European Auto-Oil programme has introduced tighter European vehicle emission and fuel quality standards. These are reflected in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The key elements of the programme are:</p>
	<p pid=".929W.3/3" class="indent">stringent emission standards for cars and light vans, which applied to all new vehicles sold from <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase> (known as Euro 111 standards);</p>
	<p pid=".929W.3/4" class="indent">more stringent standards applying from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase> (Euro 1V standards);</p>
	<p pid=".929W.3/5" class="indent">tighter fuel quality specifications which applied to all petrol and diesel sold from <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase>, with a further tightening of the specification to apply from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>; and</p>
	<p pid=".929W.3/6" class="indent">a ban on general marketing of leaded petrol since <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.3/7">A further element of the Auto-Oil programme established a more stringent emissions standard for heavy-duty diesel engines from 2000. These engines are used in a wide range of vehicles, including lorries and buses. From 2005 almost all heavy-duty diesel vehicles will effectively be fitted with particulate traps&mdash;which can reduce particle emissions (PM10) by up to 90 per cent.</p>

Once listed, it is an offence to execute, or cause to be executed, any works for the demolition of such a building, or for its alteration or extension in any manner that would affect its character as a building of special historic or architectural interest. The Department also has powers to control the demolition of buildings in Conservation Areas designated under the Order.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/2">The draft Planning (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, will introduce some important new enforcement powers and increase from &pound;5,000 to &pound;30,000 the maximum level of fine that can be imposed on a person on summary conviction for breaching a Listed Buildings Enforcement Notice. The draft Order will also introduce the possibility of custodial sentences, for those found guilty of an offence, of up to six months on summary conviction and up to two years on conviction on indictment. The draft order was laid at Westminster on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-16">16 January 2003</phrase>, and was debated in the House of Commons Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-04">4 February 2003</phrase>. The draft order is due to be debated in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-13">13 February 2003</phrase> and, subject to Lords' agreement it is expected that it will be taken at the February Privy Council meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/3">In addition, the draft Order will introduce a fast track mechanism for listing buildings of special architectural or historic interest, which are considered at risk of demolition or adverse alteration. It will also introduce a new control over the demolition of buildings, by making it clear that demolition comes within the meaning of development for planning purposes. For the time being, however, it is my intention to apply this new control over demolition only to the demolition of buildings in Areas of Townscape/Village Character.</p>

	<p pid=".940W.5/19">These figures cover the usual consulting roles e.g. for advising on options and feasibility in the initial stages of a project. They exclude the cost of whole projects being implemented by outside consultants e.g. Cap Gemini/Ernst Young who are main contractors for the installation of the FCO's PRISM project.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.5/20">So far as the FCO is concerned, the vast majority of expenditure is associated with our major Information Communications Technology (ICT) and Estate construction programmes. Consultants have also advised on legal, financial and personnel issues and provided support in areas where we have skills shortages. Increasing expenditure over the last three years is associated with the growth of our ICT programme which is being used to support business change. Such projects include FTN, a new global telecommunications network and PRISM, a new integrated management information system covering finance, personnel, procurement and payroll.</p>

The Secretary of State's first DMA report was for the year 2000&ndash;01. He reported that 57 per cent. of child benefit decisions were correct. For child benefit, this report was concerned only with the decision making process, not with the outcome&mdash;accuracy of payment. It is quite possible for there to have been a technical error in the process but for the payment to be entirely correct. This applies with particular regard to evidence, in particular the retention of original documents required by the monitors when checking decisions made on review.</p>
	<p pid=".952W.5/19">Decisions resulting from such reviews were classed as errors regardless of whether the award itself is correct. Figures for 2001&ndash;02 have not yet been reported but indications are that around 77 per cent. of decisions were correct, again reflecting a DMA monitoring specification that concentrated on the process and not on the outcome&mdash;payment accuracy. For 2002&ndash;03, the DMA monitoring specification closely aligns the process and payment accuracy to give a more realistic indication of decision-making standards. Emerging findings indicate an accuracy level of 99.6 per cent. for 2002&ndash;03.</p>

A comprehensive programme of evaluation is in place to assess its effectiveness. Reports on different elements of the evaluation will be published between early 2003 and 2004; a series of synthesis reports will bring together the available evidence at various points during the evaluation programme.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.11/2">After a slow start, the performance of job brokers in Scotland has improved significantly. In support of this, a recent exercise was conducted to increase coverage and 20 organisations are now involved with the delivery of NDDP in Scotland, ensuring greater choice and availability to customers. In the financial year to April 2002, there were 44 authorised job entries in Scotland. By the end of November'2002, this figure had increased to 479 (a percentage increase of 91 per cent.). The available information is in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".963W.5/1">Increasing the basic state pension for older pensioners would not target resources on those who are most in need.

For example, the median net income of the richest fifth of pensioner couples is around four times that of the poorest fifth.</p>

	<p pid=".966W.9/1">The Government do not consider that there will necessarily be any impact on the clean-up costs of previously developed land arising from the water framework directive. The standard for clean-up under both the contaminated land provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the planning system is the removal of unacceptable risk, so as to make a site suitable for its existing and future uses respectively. This will ensure that all receptors of potential discharges from a site are protected, including humans, surface and groundwater, flora, fauna and buildings. This approach is already advised in draft planning technical advice for England, which was issued for consultation in February 2002 and which will be finalised later this year. The Government consider that this approach will be consistent with the requirements of the water framework directive as regards water quality.</p>

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has ensured that all local authorities receive a grant increase on a like for like basis which is at least greater than inflation. The London Borough of Havering has benefited from this guarantee. It will receive &pound;154.4 million in general grant in 2003&ndash;04, which is an increase of &pound;5.2 million.</p>

	<p pid=".970W.5/1">Guidance was first published in 1996 on counting methodology developed in partnership with charities and voluntary organisations helping people sleeping rough. Independent evaluation has confirmed that the methodology remains the most robust method for measuring relative levels of rough sleeping and of change over time.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.5/2">Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that the counts are undertaken and that the methodology is followed. The snapshot counts should take place on a single night, between 12 am and 6 am. The definition of people who should be included in rough sleeper counts is clearly set out in the guidance. It is: people sleeping, or bedded down, in the open air (such as on the streets, or in doorways, parks or bus shelters); people in buildings or other places not designed for habitation (such as barns, sheds, car parks, cars, derelict boats, or stations). Guidance is also given on the appropriate timing of rough sleeper counts&mdash;which will depend on the level of rough sleeping reported and on local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.5/3">Portsmouth last carried out a count in May 2002 and found one rough sleeper; Southampton last carried out a count in November 2001 and found six rough sleepers; and Fareham last carried out a count in February 1998 and found 13 rough sleepers. Since 1998, Fareham has reduced its numbers of rough sleepers and in the Housing Investment Programme return, July 2002, returned an estimate of 0&ndash;10.</p>

	<p pid=".971W.5/2">The Government do not have any plans to establish a fund specifically targeted at local authorities most affected by fly tipping of tyres, since this would be against the polluter pays principle and may create a perverse incentive for people to fly tip tyres safe in the knowledge that the public purse will fund any clearance. However, the Environment Agency has set up the Tyre Watch campaign to help tackle the problem of fly tipped tyres and to support a sustainable recovery and disposal system. The DTI is also exploring alternative routes for disposing of tyres, given the forthcoming ban from disposal to landfill under the Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".971W.5/3">We have provided additional finance of &pound;46 million to local authorities to cover their costs of disposing of refrigerators. Also, interim funding has been agreed for local authorities to help with the implementation of the End of Life Vehicles Directive, which may lead to an increase in levels of abandoned cars. The DTI will meet the additional costs and have secured three years funding (&pound;25 million for 2003&ndash;04, 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06) which was agreed in Spending Review 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".976W.3/1">In 1997&ndash;98 56,116 cases were listed for trial in the Crown Court of which 1,967 (3.50 per cent.) failed to take place due to the accused, and 3,848 (6.85 per cent.) due to the witness(es), failing to attend.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.3/2">Between April and September 2002 (the most recent data currently available) 27,427 cases were listed for trial in the Crown Court. 1,024 (3.73 per cent.) failed to take place due to the accused, and 1,717 (6.26 per cent.) due to the witness(es), failing to attend. Data on why cases fail has only been collected nationally by magistrates' courts from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.3/3">For the six month period April to September 2002 81,437 trials were listed for trial in the magistrates' court, of which 6,780 (8.32 per cent.) failed to take place due to the accused, and 2,875 (3.53 per cent.) due to the witness(es), failing to attend.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.3/4">Action is being taken across Criminal Justice Agencies to reduce the failure of court cases due to non attendance of witnesses, in particular the use of video links for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and the introduction of Victim Support into all courts.</p>
