	<p pid="d.768W.3/1">The responsibility for funding Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) rests with Natural England and Defra would not interfere in the decisions Natural England takes in setting the budget of any AONB.</p>
	<p pid="d.768W.3/2">The funding for AONBs consists of three elements: core funding for staff and essential administrative costs; projects; and the Sustainable Development Fund. In 2008-09 Natural England has been able to add 2 per cent. to AONB core grants. Core funding is based on a formula which, among other factors, takes into account the area of each AONB. However, funding for projects has had to be prioritised to those of highest importance and those which AONB partnerships are locked into, such as Heritage Lottery Fund schemes. As for the Sustainable Development Fund, each AONB can bid for up to &pound;61,666 from Natural England. There is, therefore, no strict correlation between the area of any one AONB and the amount of total funding it receives and it is inappropriate to relate the total funding of any AONB to its area.</p>

	<p pid="d.769W.2/2">In line with the core group of industry stakeholders, the Government consider that mass vaccination through the 2008 programme for Bluetongue type 8 (the only programme so far) can be best and most rapidly achieved through a voluntary approach, supported by an industry-led campaign promoting the benefits of vaccination. DEFRA has contributed to the industry campaign by giving prominence to bluetongue messages in its existing communications channels, e.g. website, advertising in farming press and campaigns such as Livestock Market Roadshows and the website-based 'Give Disease the Boot' campaign. In addition, DEFRA has worked with the Animal Health Agency to alert local veterinary surgeons and others to the availability of vaccine as it has been rolled out across England.</p>
	<p pid="d.769W.2/3">These costs for bluetongue vaccination campaigns are not available separately. However, the overall indicative budget for Livestock Markets Roadshows and Animal Disease Prevention communications (excluding publications, Farming Link and shows) is &pound;400,000 in the current financial year. In the 2007-08 financial year, the total spend amounted to approximately &pound;280,000.</p>

	<p pid="d.770W.3/2">There are 10 combined heat and power (CHP) schemes located on the Government estate registered with the Government's CHP Quality Assurance programme (CHPQA). In 2007-08 these 10 schemes produced just over 19 gigawatt hours of Good Quality CHP electricity. This represents around 0.1 per cent. of the 28,677 gigawatts electricity produced in total by Good Quality CHP plants in the UK in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.770W.3/3">Early information from the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) as part of its annual Sustainable Development in Government (SDiG) report indicates that total CHP generated electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08 was 311 gigawatt hours. This would mean that the 19 gigawatt hours of Good Quality CHP electricity generated on the Government estate represents round 6 per cent. of the total CHP electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="d.770W.9/1">The UK Government's Forest Governance and Trade Programme aims to tackle illegal logging and trade associated with it. It works to promote governance reforms in developing countries where illegal logging is a problem, and to improve the functioning of markets for wood products. Efforts focus on negotiating and implementing bilateral Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) between timber-producing countries and the EU, as part of the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan.</p>
	<p pid="d.770W.9/2">The European Commission published recently a proposal for legislation requiring traders in timber to exercise due diligence to ensure that the timber they buy and sell is legally harvested. Once the regulation is agreed, the new requirements will ensure that legally harvested timber only is traded in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="d.770W.9/3">The UK has lobbied hard for Community-wide measures to exclude illegal timber from the European market. This legislation will support the Government's efforts under the FLEGT Action Plan, which provides support to timber-producing countries who have problems with illegal logging to verify the legality of timber exports. The UK seeks to work in collaboration with other EU member states in preference to unilaterally introducing binding regulations.</p>

	<p pid="d.775W.9/1">There have been four confirmed cases of the Warrior chain gun firing un-demanded since 2000. A total of 17 cases were recorded during this period, but after investigation by the MOD's serious equipment failure investigation team, 13 of these were found to be negligent discharges (human error) or undemanded operation (usually identified during pre-firing checks or maintenance procedures) where the gun operated, but no rounds were fired.</p>
	<p pid="d.775W.9/2">To prevent un-demanded firings MOD is improving a number of vehicle sub-systems. This includes upgrading the chain gun control unit, which controls the firing of the gun, replacing the existing foot firing switch with a hand firing switch to operate the gun, and enhancements to turret electronics to prevent the possibility of short circuits. The modification programme is significantly improving the reliability of the chain gun across both Challenger and Warrior vehicle fleets. I am looking closely at the issue to see if there is more that can be done.</p>

	<p pid="d.776W.0/1">There are no plans to phase out the recruitment of under 18s into the armed forces. If the armed forces were required to raise the minimum age of entry, it would create serious manning problems, since 28 per cent. of all recruits in FY2007-08 were aged under 18. The services, in particular the Army, would be unable to man current structures and maintain current capabilities. It is probable that should the minimum entry age be raised, good quality school leavers would settle into other careers and thus be lost to the services.</p>
	<p pid="d.776W.0/2">All service personnel under 18 years of age who have completed 28 days service have a right of discharge within the first six months of service by giving not less than 14 days notice in writing to the commanding officer if they decide that the armed forces are not a career for them. In addition, service personnel under 18 years three months who have passed their statutory six month period for &quot;discharge as of right&quot;, and have registered, before reaching their 18th birthday, clear 'unhappiness' at their choice of career, can request permission to leave the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="d.776W.0/3">No young person under the age of 18 years may join the UK armed forces unless their application is accompanied by the formal written consent of his or her parents or guardian. This has then to be witnessed by someone of standing in the community, before the applicant can enter service. There is already a robust system in place ensuring that all potential recruits are given full details of all the advantages and risks involved in service life. Throughout the recruit selection process, the staffs at the Armed Forces Careers Offices (AFCO) provide comprehensive written and verbal guidance to all potential recruits, in particular those of less than 18 years of age, and their parents or guardians. This guidance covers the potential recruit's terms and conditions of service, the commitments that they would be undertaking, and their rights to discharge.</p>
	<p pid="d.776W.0/4">It is defence policy that service personnel under the age of 18 are not deployed on operations outside of the UK, except where the operation does not involve personnel becoming engaged in, or exposed to, hostilities. In addition, in line with UN policy, service personnel under 18 are not deployed on UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

Further reductions may occur as we continue to review our manpower requirements to ensure that we are delivering best value for money, while continuing to deliver Defence outputs.</p>

	<p pid="d.783W.8/1">The Visiting Forces Act 1952 together with the Visiting Forces and International Headquarters (Application of Law) Order 1999 make provision for dealing with offences committed by members of visiting naval, military and air forces from certain listed countries by their own service authorities and service courts rather than by United Kingdom authorities and courts. The Act does not affect the specific legislation under which defendants are prosecuted in the United Kingdom, although it may determine which country's legislation will be applied when an offence is committed.</p>
	<p pid="d.783W.8/2">Information on whether court cases take place under the jurisdiction of the Act is not held by the Ministry of Justice because the information on criminal proceedings contains only the specific statute for the offences under which defendants are prosecuted, not any other statutes governing the court case itself. For example, where a defendant is prosecuted for robbery, an offence under section 8 of the Theft Act 1968, the record held by the Ministry of Justice will list the prosecution as under this Act only. It would not be possible to tell whether the above offence was committed by a member of the visiting US personnel, as circumstances surrounding the case are not reported to the Ministry of Justice. Therefore the Ministry of Justice are unable to provide data on those visiting US personnel who were prosecuted under UK law, those dealt with under US law for offences committed in the UK and the results of these cases.</p>

The Home Secretary recently announced that she has reviewed existing policy on the exclusion from the UK of those individuals who encourage violence or hatred in support of their ideology. In particular, the Home Office will consider, in all future cases, whether it would be in the public interest to disclose that an individual has been excluded, with a presumption to inform the public.</p>

	<p pid="d.799W.0/1">The function of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is to match DNA profiles taken from crime scenes with those taken from individuals. It does not contain any information on whether those on it have been arrested, charged or given a reprimand or final warning.</p>
	<p pid="d.799W.0/2">Information is available on the number of those whose profiles have been added to the NDNAD by English and Welsh police forces, as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-16">16 July 2008</phrase>, broken down by ethnic appearance category and the age groups requested, as given in Table 1. Age is defined as the person's age at the time DNA was taken from them, not their current age. This data could only be further broken down to show which profiles were added in each of the last five years at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.799W.0/3">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion.</p>

	<p pid="d.802W.2/1">Information held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is recorded on the basis of the police force which took the DNA sample. The address of the person sampled is not recorded. Thus, the figures for the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Authority area include people from outside the GMP Authority area who were arrested and sampled by GMP; and exclude people from the GMP area who were arrested and sampled by police forces elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="d.802W.2/3">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles from the SGM to the SGM Plus profiling system.

	<p pid="d.826W.2/3">The rest of the programme will explore models of personal health budget where the budget is held on the patient's behalf. These are already available to primary care trusts under current legislation, and also offer considerable scope to give patients more choice and control.</p>

	<p pid="d.834W.2/2">Revenue allocations are made to PCTs on the basis of a weighted capitation formula. The aim of the formula is to ensure there is sufficient funding to provide equal access for equal need in all parts of the country, and to reduce avoidable health inequalities. The key determinant of need is the size of the population for which PCTs are responsible. This is then adjusted to take into account age related need, additional need (over and above that accounted for by age), and unavoidable geographical variations in the cost of providing services (the market forces factor). Revenue allocations are not broken down into funding for individual policy streams such as maternity.</p>
	<p pid="d.834W.2/3">However, the NHS Operating Framework for 2008-09 (a copy of which has already been placed in the Library), the key planning document for the NHS, identified maternity services as an area where PCTs are expected to take particular action to improve access as part of the wider Maternity Matters Strategy to deliver safe, high-quality care.</p>
	<p pid="d.834W.2/4">In the light of the NHS Operating Framework, PCTs set priorities and commission services that meet the needs of their local communities, and that is what they are doing on maternity services.</p>

	<p pid="d.840W.2/2">In response to the report 'Improving access to medicines for NHS patients' by Professor Mike Richards, the National Clinical Director for Cancer, my right hon.

Following this statement, the NHS chief executive has written to the NHS to make it clear that no patients should lose their entitlement to NHS care as a result of buying additional private care, as long as that additional care is delivered separately.</p>

This entitles all London residents over the age of 60 to free travel on bus, tube, national rail and DLR/tram services in Greater London all day at the weekend and after 9 am on a weekday; and since April 2003, disabled pass holders have had free 24-hour access to these services.</p>
	<p pid="d.846W.6/4">In the event that the discretionary scheme operated in London did not offer certain minimum bus (and other) concessions for London residents, the 'reserve free travel scheme' provisions under section 240 of the GLA Act 1999 would be triggered.</p>
	<p pid="d.846W.6/5">Section 63 of the Transport Act 1985 provides for a local authority to secure through the payment of subsidy the provision of bus services which meet a public transport requirement that would not otherwise be met. Sections 89-92 of the 1985 Act, as amended by section 152 of the Transport Act 2000, set out the obligations to invite tenders for contracts for the provision of subsidised bus services. Section 153 of the Transport Act 2000 applies the competition test included in schedule 10 of that Act to the exercise of a local authority's functions relating to subsidised bus services. The Local Transport Bill, now before Parliament, includes an amendment to section 63 of the 1985 Act which will enable local authorities to use its subsidy powers where a service of a particular standard would not be provided without subsidy.</p>

The Student Loans Company (SLC) databases only capture the number of applications for maintenance grants which have been received and are being processed.

The average maintenance grant is larger than the average HE grant because both the maximum grant amount and the income thresholds are more generous. The number of students eligible for the maintenance grant before means-testing will steadily increase from 2006-07 as each new cohort becomes eligible.</p>

	<p pid="d.857W.0/52">In 2009-10, low income entrants will receive &pound;2,906 of maintenance grant and &pound;3,497 of maintenance loan. In real terms, the maintenance grant will be over 20 per cent. higher than in 1997-98 and the maintenance loan over 50 per cent. more generous.</p>

	<p pid="d.867W.6/1">The Parliamentary Boundary Commissions do not group constituencies, but they may group local authority areas to help them construct constituencies according to the rules for the redistribution of seats contained in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. These rules require, in England and Wales, that parliamentary constituency boundaries do not cross county or London borough boundaries; in Scotland that regard must be had to local authority area boundaries; and in Northern Ireland that ward boundaries are not crossed. The rules also allow the Commissions in each country to depart from a strict application of this rule if they consider it appropriate to avoid excessive electoral disparity between constituencies and enable them to observe a further rule requiring constituencies to be about the same size. The decision whether to group areas and what particular groupings to apply, however, rests entirely with the relevant Commission.</p>

It is currently expected that it will be introduced in 2010. It was developed following extensive consultation with the advice and credit sectors. It is intended specifically to support only those debtors who encounter unforeseen short-term difficulties from which they are likely to recover in a relatively short period. Other options, such as the reformed Administration Order (AO), which is contained in Chapter 1 of Part 5 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 exist for those with more long-term problems.

	<p pid="d.869W.2/1">Under existing legislation, rolling registration exists alongside the household registration system in Great Britain as a means of allowing individuals to register to vote. The current law requires Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to conduct an annual canvass and publish a revised register by <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December</phrase> each year. The Government have no plans to issue guidance on the use of rolling registration to update registers.

	<p pid="d.869W.2/2">The Government have been clear that they are committed to the principle of individual registration. However, this would be a far-reaching reform, and it would need to be undertaken with great care&mdash;both to ensure that a new system is robust, and to ensure that it properly tackles the problem of under-registration. The Government's approach to electoral registration is clear: we want to protect the rights of every eligible person to participate in the United Kingdom's democratic process by ensuring complete, accurate and secure electoral registration.</p>

	<p pid="d.870W.5/1">A charging order, under the Charging Orders Act 1979, is a means of securing a judgment debt by placing a charge onto the debtor's immovable property, particularly a house or land, although it can also be used against shares. A charging order also allows a judgment creditor to apply subsequently to the court for an order for sale. Charging orders therefore provide a means by which a judgment creditor can gain access to any equity a debtor holds in property.</p>
	<p pid="d.870W.5/2">Charging orders are one of a number of enforcement methods available and the securing of a charging order does not prevent the creditor from exercising other methods of enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="d.870W.5/3">The Second Phase of the Civil Enforcement Review identified no significant means by which the charging order procedure should be changed, as published in the White Paper &quot;Effective Enforcement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.870W.5/4">Research indicates that charging orders are used most often as a form of long-term security for a judgment debt. In the overwhelming majority of instances, once the security of a charging order has been obtained, creditors are more likely to accept long-term &quot;time to pay&quot; agreements to clear the judgment debt, knowing that their position is secure.</p>
	<p pid="d.870W.5/5">The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE Act) made a number of changes to the charging order regime. These changes will allow a judgment creditor to apply for a charging order even where a debtor is up to date with an instalment arrangement. The Act will also introduce new minimum thresholds below which it will not be possible to apply for a charging order or an order for sale.</p>
	<p pid="d.870W.5/6">The Government have not yet implemented provisions of the TCE Act relating to charging orders, and we are keeping this under review.</p>

	<p pid="d.882W.0/1">We received reports that, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-16">16 October</phrase>, Iran's Deputy Prosecutor-General for Judicial Affairs announced that a directive had been issued to all judicial officials stating that people convicted of crimes which took place when they were under the age of 18 would not be executed and would instead be given alternative sentences, regardless of their offence. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-18">18 October</phrase> he clarified that this only applied to non-sharia crimes, and that sharia crimes such as murder were not included.</p>
	<p pid="d.882W.0/2">Despite its international human rights commitments, Iran remains the world's number one executioner of children. While we welcome any small step towards the abolition of this abhorrent practice in the country, all six juveniles executed so far this year had been sentenced for sharia crimes, making the impact of the directive limited. Additionally, similar non-binding directives or declared moratoria by the Iranian judiciary have had limited impact and have not subsequently been adopted into law. International human rights organisations expressed concerns that the statement intended to deliberately mislead Iranian and international public opinion.</p>
	<p pid="d.882W.0/3">The UK Government's principled opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances is well known, and the execution of juvenile offenders is considered to be against all human rights standards. We will, therefore, continue to urge the Iranian Government to end the execution of juveniles once and for all in both law and practice. This year alone we, and the EU, have raised this subject and made representations in individual cases of juveniles facing execution at least twenty-two times in meetings with the Iranian authorities and through public statements. Senior Foreign Office officials did so most recently during the visit of Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister in September.</p>

	<p pid="d.884W.5/1">The Israeli government and defence forces provide a wide range of financial and security assistance to settlers. We regard all settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories as illegal under international law and settlement construction as a serious obstacle to peace. The Roadmap is clear that Israel should freeze all settlement construction including the &quot;natural growth&quot; of existing settlements, and dismantle all outposts built since 2001. We have repeatedly raised our concerns about settlement activity with the Israeli government at the highest level.</p>

	<p pid="d.888W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Andrew Hind, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-28">28 October 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.888W.0/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question tabled for answer today.</p>
	<p pid="d.888W.0/4" class="indent">The Charity Commission is the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales. The commission produces guidance for charities regarding campaigning and political activity, which explains the legal position on this issue. The guidance is called Speaking Out and is available via our website at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>. I have also enclosed a printed copy for ease of reference and arranged for a copy to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.888W.0/5" class="indent">The guidance confirms that campaigning and political activity can be legitimate and valuable activities for charities to undertake. Charities may try to influence the policy of a political party in various ways. However, the guidance explains that &quot;a charity must not give its support to any one political party&quot;. The guidance further clarifies that &quot;A charity cannot give financial support, or support in kind, to a political party&quot;. A charity cannot therefore sponsor a political party by way of donations.</p>
	<p pid="d.888W.0/6" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you have specific concerns about this issue, please do let me have the details so that the Commission can look into them.</p>

Note that official employment estimates are published on a three month rolling basis; estimates for individual months are not available. The October-December 2006 estimate has therefore been provided. Estimates for April-June 2006 have also been included in the table to allow comparison of employment levels between the latest period available, and two years earlier.</p>
	<p pid="d.889W.0/6" class="indent">Please note that the figures quoted in the <i> Official Repo</i>rt (365,000 and 865,000) refer to the decrease in UK born employment, and increase in non-UK born employment respectively, over the last three years. However, due to a printing error in Hansard, the answer to Parliamentary Question 226214 (<i> Official Report, 13</i> October 2008, columns 953W to 956W) incorrectly showed the estimated change in UK born employment from 2007 to 2008 as -24,000 rather than +24,000. As a consequence the estimated decrease in UK born employment over the last three years is 317,000 not 365,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.889W.0/7" class="indent">The estimates in the table are derived from Labour Force Survey (LFS) microdata which are weighted using the official population estimates published in autumn 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.889W.0/8" class="indent">They are not entirely consistent with the figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release which are weighted using more up-to-date population estimates.

	<p pid="d.892W.2/2"><i> </i>I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/3">Specific information regarding incomes and circumstances of households in the United Kingdom is available in the &quot;Family Resources Survey 2006-07&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/4">The data source does not allow us to provide robust numbers for estimates below the level of the north west Government office region.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/5">For the north west, three survey year averages are given. This is because robust single year estimates for regions cannot be produced because of the volatility in estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/6">Over the period 2004-05 to 2006-07, the median income per capita in 2006-07 prices for the north west is &pound;218 per week. The equivalent figure for the United Kingdom over the same period is &pound;228 per week in 2006-07 prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/7" class="indentitalic"> Notes:</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/8" class="indent">1. These statistics are based on Family Resources Survey data.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/9" class="indent">2. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.2/10" class="indent">3. The reference period for Family Resources Survey figures is single financial years. Three sample years have been combined for the north west as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility, so statistics for the north west cover the period 2004-05 to 2006-07, and are presented in 2006-07 prices. A three-year average has also been presented for statistics covering the United Kingdom, so these statistics are comparable to the statistics for the north west.</p>

	<p pid="d.899W.2/1">There are two fundamental changes expected in post 16 provisions over the next 10 years. Firstly by 2015, subject to the successful passage of the current Education and Skills Bill, all young people will be required to be in some form of education or training until at least 18. Secondly, in the future, all publicly funded qualifications will fall within one of four routes&mdash;Apprenticeships, Diplomas, the Foundation Learning Tier or General Qualifications (GCSEs and A Levels). The growth in numbers of Apprenticeships toward one in five young people, alongside the delivery of 17 Diploma lines, will both enable full participation of young people and mean that the growth of pupil numbers is not predominantly schools based.</p>
	<p pid="d.899W.2/2">In 2007/08, there were 447,500 16 to 17-year-olds and 23,800 18-year-olds participating in schools out of a total of 1,119,400 16 to 17-year-olds and 375,800 18-year-olds participating in Education and Work Based Learning. Mid-year population estimates for 2015 suggest that, with full participation, there will be around 1,197,300 16 to 17-year-olds participating in Education and WBL. The trajectory, and costs attributed to achieving these levels of participation, including the relative contribution of schools, colleges and other providers will be agreed as part of the next spending review.</p>
	<p pid="d.899W.2/3">The changes in provision will mean changing requirements as to what schools, colleges and learning providers offer, with some implications for school estates. The 16-19 capital fund was established to meet the cost of new post-16 places in schools and colleges. The value of this fund is &pound;630 million in the three years to 2010-11. In addition, there will be a further &pound;30 million in 2010-11 in recognition of the additional post-16 costs associated with raising the participation age. Further monies will need to be agreed as part of the next spending review.</p>

In 2007-08 these 10 schemes produced just over 19 gigawatt hours of good quality CHP electricity. This represents around 0.1 per cent. of the 28,677 gigawatts electricity produced in total by good quality CHP plants in the UK in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.903W.6/3">Early information from the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) as part of its annual Sustainable Development in Government (SDiG) report indicates that total CHP generated electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08 was 311 gigawatt hours. This would mean that the 19 gigawatt hours of good quality CHP electricity generated on the Government estate represents around 6 per cent. of the total CHP electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="d.913W.2/2">Based on internal analysis carried out for departmental planning purposes, it has been estimated that of the approximately 280,000 lone parents on income support affected by the changes which start to be implemented from November 2008 (i.e. whose youngest child is aged 12 or over from November 2008, 10 or over from October 2009, or seven or over from October 2010):</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/3" class="indent">around 20,000 will move into work immediately after being affected by the changes;</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/4" class="indent">a further 15,000 will move into work within three months of being affected by the changes;</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/5" class="indent">a further 20,000 will move into work within six months of being affected by the changes;</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/6" class="indent">a further 10,000 will move into work within nine months of being affected by the changes;</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/7" class="indent">a further 10,000 will move into work within 12 months of being affected by the changes;</p>

	<p pid="d.913W.2/9" class="indent">a further 5,000 will move into work within 24 months of being affected by the changes.</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/10">These estimates include those lone parents who would have entered employment anyway. They relate only to existing income support lone parent claimants when the changes are introduced from November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/11">The estimates are dependent on a number of assumptions made by the Department including around the destinations of lone parents on income support after the changes come into effect, their behaviour on other benefits and the destinations of lone parents when they leave benefits.</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/12">Some lone parents are exempt from these changes and will still be able to receive income support. These include lone parents: who are in receipt of carer's allowance; have a child for whom they are receiving the middle or higher rate care component of disability living allowance; who are fostering.</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.2/13">We have commissioned a comprehensive evaluation of the changes and will monitor their impact over time. These estimates are sensitive to the particular assumptions made and will be fully tested in the evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="d.916W.2/4" class="indent">Maternity Allowance numbers are forecast by trends in the number of births in Great Britain. Past sets of births projections, which are produced by Office for National Statistics have shown a gradual rise in births. As a result Maternity Allowance forecasts predicted that Maternity Allowance claims would increase by around 5%.</p>
	<p pid="d.916W.2/5" class="indent">During the planning process for the centralisation of Maternity Allowance into four units, staffing numbers required were calculated based on that forecast increase in claims, with some productivity improvements, in line with the challenge faced by the whole organisation. In fact Maternity Allowance claims have increased by nearly a fifth this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.916W.2/6" class="indent">Although this increase was not forecast, we quickly put plans in place to increase staffing in line with the increase and to ensure work was efficiently distributed across the benefit delivery network. This has ensured arrears of claims which built up earlier in the year are now cleared and we have returned to our normal workload.</p>

	<p pid="d.920W.3/5" class="indent">Statistics of people made redundant in each month is not available; however the Labour Force Survey (LFS) does collect data on those made redundant in the last three months.</p>

	<p pid="d.920W.3/8" class="indent">The estimates in the tables are derived from the LFS microdata weighted to estimates published in 2007. They are not entirely consistent with figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release which are weighted using more up to date population estimates. As with any survey, results are subject to a margin of uncertainty. The sample sizes supporting these estimates at the level of detail requested are very small and therefore should be treated with extreme caution.</p>

	<p pid="d.924W.5/1">The administration of the social Fund is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.924W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter form Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="d.924W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what steps the Government is taking to ensure funeral payments from the Social Fund are made as quickly as possible. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.924W.5/4" class="indent">We aim to process all claims as quickly as possible. For funeral payments there is an internal target of 16 working days. The actual average clearance time for September was 14.51 days with the year to date figure at 13.63 days. We believe this is well within the period funeral directors would allow for settlement of the bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.924W.5/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has in recent years introduced a number of initiatives to help funeral directors. This includes allowing payments to be made before the funeral is held where a funeral director is willing to provide an invoice and there are no other outstanding issues. We have recently amended our guidance to make sure staff are aware of this provision. From November 2007 we have also introduced the facility to allow payments to be made directly into the bank account of the funeral director where the bill had not been paid. Previously the payment had been made by a cheque in the name of the funeral director and sent to the customer for them to pass onto the funeral director.</p>
	<p pid="d.924W.5/6" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

As the economic situation deteriorated during the year and particularly since September, the FSA worked increasingly with the banks concerned.

This is irrespective of the number of predecessor societies in which they held accounts or of the trading names under which the accounts are subsequently held. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is responsible for making the rules of the financial services compensation scheme (FSCS). The FSA is considering whether the compensation scheme should continue to offer compensation on a per authorised entity basis or should move to a per brand (trading name) or per account basis, and the treatment of temporary high balances (for example those arising after a building society merger). If appropriate, the FSA will consult on specific proposals in due course.</p>

	<p pid="d.940W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) understands social enterprises to be businesses set up to tackle a social or environmental need, in which profits are reinvested to sustain and further their mission for positive change. Many producer co-operatives, self-help groups and fairtrade producer groups could be considered as social enterprises. DFID's country programmes work with a range of these and DFID centrally has supported the fairtrade movement for many years.</p>
	<p pid="d.940W.5/2">As part of a donor consortium, DFID is currently funding the global Fairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO) and one of its member bodies, the UK Fairtrade Foundation, to help rapidly expand the reach of fairtrade through bringing many more poor producers, particularly from low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, into fairtrade markets. Bringing producers into fairtrade certification involves informing producers about the standards required, including that a democratically-run group must exist that decides how to invest for social purposes the 'fairtrade premium' they will receive. Our funding helps support specific work such as the FLO 'Strategic Review' currently under way, that considers progress against the objectives of providing market access on good terms for poorer producers in developing countries, to identify and share what is working and what remains a challenge.</p>

	<p pid="d.944W.5/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) support to Swaziland is through its Southern Africa Regional Programme. As part of this, DFID is providing &pound;19 million (2007-11) to community organisations which address health issues through the regional Behaviour Change Communication Programme (BCC).</p>
	<p pid="d.944W.5/2">The BCC provides funding of over &pound;500,000 each year in Swaziland through the South African non-governmental organisation Soul City and local partner Lusweti, to provide popular and easily understood information on health and HIV and AIDS. This programme reaches over 80 per cent. of adults and young women and men in Swaziland.</p>

	<p pid="d.945W.0/1">The Platform2 programme was launched in February 2008. It is implemented on behalf of the Department for International Development (DFID) by Christian Aid in partnership with Islamic Relief and the British Universities North America Club (BUNAC). A mid-term review of this programme, including cost-effectiveness issues, will be carried out in mid-2009 with a final review due in early 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.945W.3/1">A recent independent audit of the Global Fund's financial management arrangements in Zimbabwe reported that $7.3 million, from a previous grant, had been withheld from intended recipients by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Following demands by the Global Fund, this money has now been released back to the commercial banks where the Global Fund principal recipients hold accounts. A further $500 million, recently approved in principle by the Global Fund board, will only go ahead when a fully accountable funding mechanism is secured.</p>
	<p pid="d.945W.3/2">The UK, along with other donors, has actively encouraged and been fully supportive of the audit and the tougher stance taken by the Global Fund. Funding of this type is desperately needed in Zimbabwe, but it must be delivered through mechanisms which ensure that it reaches deserving people on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="d.946W.2/1">Under current circumstances and management arrangements, we do not consider the Reserve Bank (RBZ) of Zimbabwe to be, in any way, a credible partner in our humanitarian and social protection programmes. The RBZ is not open to scrutiny: its operations remain unaccountable and appear to be aimed primarily at propping up the ruling elite, especially through the allocation of scarce foreign exchange. The Department for International Development (DFID) does not transfer funds to the government of Zimbabwe and no payments are made through the Reserve Bank.</p>
