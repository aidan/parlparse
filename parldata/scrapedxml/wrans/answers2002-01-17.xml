	<p pid=".408W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence has been approached in the past to grant funds to Dundee university for such studies into the possible radiation exposure of nuclear test veterans. We have declined to do so because there are reservations about the capabilities of the proposed techniques for estimating historic radiation doses. Other studies using these techniques have found them to be inconclusive when there is a considerable time lapse since exposure, and where the exposure is low. These constraints were found to be particularly so in an age group typical of British nuclear test veterans.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.3/1">We continue to monitor events in the province of central Sulawesi closely. Sporadic clashes between Muslims and Christians in and around Poso, and more recently between Muslims and the security forces, continued after three Christian militia leaders were sentenced to death on <phrase class="date" code="0201-04-05">5 April 201</phrase> for their part in killings in May and June 2000. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-19">19 November 2001</phrase>, the Supreme Court in Jakarta dismissed appeals by the three militia leaders against the death sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-23">23 November 2001</phrase>, our charg&eacute; d'affaires in Jakarta raised our concerns about the escalating violence with Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian Co-ordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs. Mr. Yudhoyono confirmed that police and military reinforcements had been despatched to Poso to help contain the situation. During a visit to Central Sulawesi on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-05">5 December 2001</phrase>, Mr. Yudhoyono announced that President Megawati had ordered a six-month security restoration plan for the province. The Indonesian Government subsequently brokered an agreement between the warring factions to end the fighting which was signed on <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase>. This appears to be holding up reasonably well, although four bombs exploded outside churches in the region on new year's eve. The culprits are unknown but both Christian and Muslim leaders have appealed for calm.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.3/3">HMG have consistently made clear their view that long-term solutions to regional conflicts can be achieved only through negotiation and consultation. We continue to work with the Indonesian authorities to promote reconciliation, begin wider reconstruction work and offer practical assistance where appropriate. As part of our effort to support conflict prevention initiatives, the British Government recently funded a series of Conflict Reporting training workshops for journalists in various provinces in Indonesia, which included participants from Poso.</p>

	<p pid=".417W.2/1">I am pleased to announce a new, additional benefit for members of the mineworkers' pension scheme on the lowest incomes, at a cost of &pound;90 million. This will be funded out of the Government's share of the scheme's reserves.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/2">The package will help mineworkers' pension scheme members who have only very modest miners' pensions, despite many years of service to the industry before 1975. Help for that particular group was identified as a priority in discussions with the scheme's trustees. Now, thanks to gains in the scheme's value under the Government's guarantee, the Government and Trustees have agreed a package of benefits, which includes special one-off payments for up to 66,000 of these members, alongside the 9 per cent. bonus for all members agreed earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/3">These lump sum payments will apply to members with at least five years service who left British Coal before or shortly after 1975 and who are on low pensions, defined on a sliding scale from not more than &pound;5 a week after five years' service to not more than &pound;10 a week after 10 or more years' service. The amounts they will receive will depend on their length of pensionable service and the current value of their pensions. Those with the longest service and the lowest pensions will receive the most. Payments, will range between &pound;200 (e.g. for someone with, five years' service on &pound;4 to &pound;5 a week, or with 10 years' service on &pound;9 to &pound;10 a week) and &pound;2,000 (for someone with 10 or more years' service on less than &pound;1 a week). Details will appear in the next edition of the mineworker's pension scheme newsletter.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/4">Members will not need to claim the money&mdash;most of those eligible, including all the existing pensioners, are expected to be paid in May, with the remainder paid within the next 18 months.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/5">The Government and the Trustees of the two former British Coal pension schemes, the mineworkers' pension scheme and the British Coal staff superannuation scheme, have also agreed a joint statement agreeing a review of arrangements for the Government's guarantee of members' basic pension benefits. The text of that statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/6" class="indent">&quot;In 1994, when British Coal was privatised, the Government agreed to guarantee benefits already built up in the Corporation's pension schemes. These arrangements have served the members of the schemes very well, providing the basis for average pension increases of some 30 per cent. since 1994. Without the Government's guarantee, these closed schemes would have had to pursue entirely different investment strategies, based primarily on holding bonds, and would not have been able to pay anything like these increases.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/7" class="indent">However, both the Government and the Trustees recognise that there have been changes in circumstances since 1994. They have therefore agreed to explore how these changes might best be reflected in revisions to the 1994 arrangements which would benefit members. In doing so, they recognise that any revisions will need to be based on an equitable sharing of risks and reward between the schemes and the Exchequer, and will need to be sufficiently robust to operate satisfactorily in a wide variety of conditions.&quot;</p>

One of the mobile testing units has been deployed at Mansfield since mid-October 2001. To date, these centres have assessed, through the full medical assessment process (MAP) over 5,130 live claimants, with a further 2,072 appointments being made.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.12/2">Claimants are usually invited to attend a test centre within a 25-mile radius from their residence. However, claimants are given the option to attend a different centre if a more suitable time is available. For those claimants who are not able to travel to a centre, and have a letter from their doctor, Healthcall, the company contracted to undertake the MAP can carry out home visits.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.12/3">There has been much focus on resources in this region and the Department, in consultation with the claimants' solicitors, is continuously reviewing ways of improving services and increase throughput. Plans to convert Mansfield into a double testing centre are currently under negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.12/4">As at the end of November, the Department had made 8,862 interim payments and settled some 3,322 claims. In total, the Department has paid out some &pound;45.3 million in the midlands area.</p>

The proposed reductions in ALCOA's UK work force form part of a global restructuring plan involving 6,500 redundancies brought about by recent falls in world demand for aluminium products.

Dolgarrog is also part of an Objective 1 Assisted Area and so the Assembly Government and its partners will be looking to secure the maximum financial support available.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.2/1">On its own the opening of a new WTO trade round will have little impact on UK manufacturing. This is because the opening of the round merely launches multilateral negotiations. A fuller assessment of the impact on UK manufacturing and the UK economy overall should come after the hoped for successful conclusions of those negotiations. World wide reductions in industrial tariffs should, for example, lead to both improved market access for UK manufacturing overseas and lower cost sources of components. Negotiations start with an expectation of significant benefits. A halving of WTO members' tariffs, for example, could increase world incomes by around $200 billion a year. UK manufacturers could be expected to benefit significantly from such increases in world incomes.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.5/1">As my hon. Friend knows from personal experience, China is a key market for British trade and investment. The Government, through Trade Partners UK, recently announced an extensive programme of supported activity for British companies in the China market for 2002&ndash;03, including 18 Government supported trade missions, 26 trade fair groups and 10 sector specific seminar initiatives. This is in addition to the regular ministerial visits to and from China including the visit by Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao in November 2001. Visits from the UK during 2001 included the then Minister for e.Commerce, the then Minister for Trade, the then Minister for Construction, the Minister for Science, the Minister for Energy and Industry and the Financial Secretary.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.5/2">Trade Partners UK is also supporting a programme of major events in China aimed at promoting the UK's strengths as a competitive, technologically innovative economy and a strong business partner for China. This began with a large scale, award winning UK pavilion at the China High-Tech Fair in Shenzhen last October, visited by Lord Sainsbury. In October 2002 there will be a major programme of activity in Shanghai, followed by a wide-ranging series of events around China in 2003 centred on Beijing.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.5/3">This high level of activity in China is complemented by awareness-raising activity among British companies in the UK. Trade Partners UK, in close co-operation with the China-Britain Business Council, is engaged in a rolling programme of events to alert UK companies to business opportunities in China. This activity includes the formation recently of a Beijing Olympics Taskforce, which aims to maximise the contribution of UK business to the preparations for the 2008 Games.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.5/4">UK exports to China rose by 21 per cent. in 2000 and by a further 18 per cent. in the first 10 months of 2001. The work of Trade Partners UK, with the CBBC, is designed further to enhance UK companies' competitiveness in China.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.5/1">Leprosy is a curable disease, and treatment provided in the early stages averts disability. Three quarters of a million cases are still detected each year, of which about 70 per cent. are in India. Ten developing countries account for 90 per cent. of cases. An effective drug cure is available free of charge via the World Health Organisation (WHO) in sufficient quantities to treat all people diagnosed with the disease. The priority now is to get treatment to all who need it, especially in isolated rural areas. To eliminate the disease, political commitment in the key endemic countries is needed along with the successful integration of leprosy treatment into strengthened general health services. Our strategy is to support the creation of basic health care systems&mdash;encompassing the public, private and informal sectors&mdash;to improve poor people's access to the care, services and essential health products to safeguard their health. Within the foreseeable future it should be possible to reduce the prevalence of the disease to such a low level that it no longer constitutes a public health problem.</p>

The second, in 2000, was the theft of jewellery to the value of &pound;250 which reduced the proceeds of Bona Vacantia to the Consolidated Fund. The third, in 2001, involved the misappropriation of &pound;170,000 from the proceeds of Bona Vacantia through the use of forged wills. The loss was to the Consolidated Fund. Of the sum lost, &pound;47,000 has since been recovered and action continues to recover further sums.

There are cost implications against budgets from maintaining proactive systems of financial control and governance seeking to ensure fraud against the Departments does not occur.

	<p pid=".432W.0/1">The HMCPSI report on London was published <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-13">13 December 2001</phrase>. The substance of any Inspectorate report is always the subject of discussion between the Law Officers in their capacity as superintending Ministers and the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is the Head of the Crown Prosecution Service. In this instance, the Attorney-General and I have been closely involved in decisions about the response to the report from the time when it appeared from the emerging finding that there were a number of issues of concern to be addressed. Additionally, I have undertaken a series of visits to units in London to establish at first-hand what have been particular problems which CPS London faces.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.0/2">The environment in which CPS London operates and has operated since its creation makes it different from any other CPS area&mdash;in particular, the transient nature of the population and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified and unqualified staff. Now that better funding arrangements have been put in place it should be possible to recruit staff &quot;to the level required&quot; and to ensure that basic systems are maintained. The area is currently involved in a rolling recruitment campaign to increase the numbers of lawyers and administrative staff employed in London.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.0/3">The area is currently involved in a rolling recruitment campaign to increase the numbers of lawyers and administrative staff employed in London.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.0/4">The area will be producing by the end of January a detailed &quot;action plan&quot; which will address all recommendations made by the CPS Inspectorate. The Attorney-General and I will take a close interest in the implementation of the plan, and this will be followed by a review.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.0/5">Senior management have completed a review which is now being implemented. This has meant an increase in the number of Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutors from three to five, who exercise firmer control of the units for which they are responsible.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.0/6">Much has been done already to address issues of concern, working with the police. These include dealing with the number of ineffective trials and the high rate of discharged committals. By adopting this approach the area should be able to build upon the many features of their operation which were commended by HMCPSI.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.0/7">Finally, a Ministerial Committee, which I chair, has been established which focuses on criminal justice system issues as a whole in London.</p>

	<p pid=".434W.6/1">The Department commissioned independent assessors to lead a review of the inquiry report and other relevant information and make recommendations on whether or not any action should be initiated in respect of Dr. Doyle. The assessors were Lesley James, former Vice President of the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development and Sir David Carter, Vice Principal of Edinburgh university. Their overall conclusion was that Dr. Doyle responded appropriately to the information he was given by Dr. Bolsin on <phrase class="date" code="1994-07-19">19 July 1994</phrase> about poor results following paediatric cardiac surgery in the Bristol unit, taking into account the context in which he was operating at the time. They concluded that while it is possible with hindsight to question Dr. Doyle's decision not to examine the detailed data he was given by Dr. Bolsin, any criticism has to be balanced both against the prompt and positive action he did take in writing to Professor Angelini at the trust, raising the concerns that had been drawn to his attention and seeking reassurances, and against the subsequent assurances he was given. The Chief Executive of the Department of Health, Nigel Crisp, has accepted their conclusions, including the recommendation that no disciplinary action is warranted and that Dr. Doyle should resume his current duties in the Department, working as the senior medical officer providing advice on renal services and transplant services&mdash;which he has done.</p>

In the light of that experience the initial performance benchmarks have been reset, generally to make the benchmark level of performance higher.

	<p pid=".443W.2/2">The Department has received representations from hon. Members, learners and learning providers about the inability to register learning onto the ILA system between <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.2/3">The ILA programme was closed down on <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 23 November</phrase> following evidence of serious potential fraud and theft and it is the Department's first duty to safeguard both public funds and the interests of individual learners. I do recognise the impact the decision to withdraw the programme will have on learners; however, because the programme is now closed, learning that was not booked onto the ILA system before <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase> will not be eligible for a discount. We cannot therefore accept account holders for registration who could not register by the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase> because of the decision to close down the programme on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.8/1">I am pleased to announce that 30 new areas will be eligible for funding from the Local Network Fund in its second and third years of operation. The Local Network Fund is designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage among children and young people by making grants direct to local community and voluntary groups helping vulnerable children aged 0&ndash;19. &pound;70 million is available over three years with second year areas operational from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/2">The Local Network funds are used to support local and community groups under four themes:</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/3" class="indent">Aspirations and experiences&mdash;projects that give children experiences, or help them achieve goals that more privileged children may take for granted.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/4" class="indent">Economic disadvantage&mdash;projects that help families to improve their living standards and cope with difficulties that come from being on low incomes. Isolation and access&mdash;projects that help children that are isolated or alone, or have trouble accessing services.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/5" class="indent">Children's voices&mdash;projects that give children and young people the chance to express their opinions and give advice on matters that concern them.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/6">Examples of the type of projects funded in the first year of operation are shown in the table along with the full list of the new areas eligible for funding and the provisional budget for each area.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.8/69" class="indent">The library lends good quality toys to families with pre-school children. Over 100 children from around 70 families use the toy library regularly. The Local Network grant helped to purchase new equipment and fund the costs of training new volunteers.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.8/71" class="indent">Covering the Helston, Porthleven and Lizard areas of Cornwall, which have the highest rate of unemployment in the district, this project provides a range of services including evening club activities for 10 to 14-year-olds, a drop-in centre and coffee bar with cheap wholesome food. The Local Network grant helped provide outreach into rural areas to help isolated young people and their families access the centre and its information and support services.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/72" class="indentitalic">Alpha Grove Community Centre, Millwall, East London</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/73" class="indent">The Alpha Grove Community centre is working to help disadvantaged young people in the area, providing an environment where they can meet, learn, create, express and develop social skills. A Local Network grant will allow a local artist to work with these young people to produce artwork for the centre which reflects subject matter derived from debates conducted with them on the issues they feel are relevant to them.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/74" class="indentitalic">Tyne and Wear Youth Bank, Newcastle Upon Tyne</p>
	<p pid=".452W.8/75" class="indent">YouthBank is a grant making scheme run by young people. The Local Network grant is redistributed by the young people to small projects in the Tyne and Wear area which are run by and for young people.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.8/77" class="indent">SWACA was established 24 years ago to provide a range of services for women and children who are victims of domestic violence, including valuable one-to-one support to children aged 0&ndash;17 years. The new grant will enable the group to assess what impact this service is having on the children and whether it is meeting their real needs. It will run group sessions with children aged five and over, so that they can describe what they would like to get from the service, allowing them to discuss issues of concern to them.</p>

	<p pid=".455W.6/38" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".455W.6/39">1. The costs of increases in the basic state pension and state pension are net of income related benefit savings that would be generated by these increases.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.6/40">2. The costs given for earnings uprating of state second pension assume that expenditure on SERPS (accruals up to 2001&ndash;02) would not be affected.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.6/41">3. The costs of earnings uprating of the state second pension only begin to become significant by 2015 because S2P only begins accruing in 2002&ndash;03 and therefore the amount of S2P in payment will be negligible for some time after that.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.6/42">4. The costs shown for state second pension in the table have been calculated based on the estimated costs of S2P which were shown in the report by the Government Actuary on the Financial Effects on the National Insurance Fund of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill 1999 (Cm 4573). The costs shown are the increase in expenditure over and above the baseline projected S2P expenditure shown in this report.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.6/43">5. It has been assumed that the basic state pension and state pension changes would not happen together. If they did, there would be an interaction because the Lower Earnings Limit is linked to the basic state pension. This means that the cost of S2P would be reduced if the basic state pension and, therefore, the LEL were raised.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.6/44">6. Average earnings are assumed to grow in line with Treasury economic assumptions until the end of the Parliament and then 1.5 per cent. above inflation over time.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.6/45">7. The pensioner population is assumed to grow according to GAD's central population growth estimates.</p>

	<p pid=".457W.2/1">The objective of the basic state pension, since it was introduced in 1948, has always been to provide a foundation for income in retirement on which individuals could build their own second pension or other savings income. The Government are committed to retaining the basic state pension in this role as well as making it easier to build up second pensions, whether through private stakeholder pensions or the new state second pension (which will particularly help people on low pay or with broken work records such as carers or disabled). In addition, the Government are committed to tackling pensioner poverty directly with the minimum income guarantee and ensuring that thrift is rewarded through the pension credit.</p>

	<p pid=".463W.11/2">The European Union Court of Justice decision 268/99 ruled that a member state is entitled to rely on the public policy limitation aspect of the Association agreements where it adopts measures designed to combat prostitution carried out by its own nationals.</p>
	<p pid=".463W.11/3">The United Kingdom adopts a number of measures designed to combat prostitution. In particular, soliciting is an offence. Should a Polish, Czech or Slovak national seek to enter the United Kingdom in order to establish themselves as a self-employed prostitute they would, in order to conduct that business successfully, have to engage in an illegal activity. Therefore, the United Kingdom would be within its rights to refuse such an application on public policy grounds.</p>

I therefore welcome the Charity Commission's announcement of <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-30">30 November 2001</phrase> that community amateur sports clubs may now apply for registered charitable status. Eligible clubs which successfully apply to become charities will enjoy a range of financial benefits including mandatory rate relief of 80 per cent.

	<p pid=".471W.2/2">The Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England is the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES). HEES is marketed as the Warm Front Team. Two scheme managers, Eaga Partnership Ltd. and TXU Warm Front Ltd. administer the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.2/3">HEES has been developed to help tackle the problem of fuel poverty, those who spend 10 per cent. or more of their income staying warm. Fuel poverty is caused by a combination of energy inefficient housing and low incomes. Certain people are particularly vulnerable to cold-related ill health&mdash;the old, families with children, the disabled and the long term sick. HEES is targeted at these priority households and all applicants are therefore treated equally.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.2/4">We have no intention of removing the current first-come approach. Any prioritising system would be complex to administer and likely to dissuade households from the scheme. Instead, we believe it is better to concentrate resources on reducing the time taken to install measures on all households.</p>

	<p pid=".472W.6/2">The Regulations place a monitoring duty on the Environment Agency. The agency continues to trace businesses which should be subject to the packaging regulations and they have the powers to monitor businesses which they believe should be subject to the regulations. It is impossible to estimate the number of businesses that might still be evading their producer responsibility obligations. However, comparison of the data derived from obligated businesses with estimates derived from materials organisations and making allowance for businesses outside the scope of the regulations because they do not satisfy turnover and packaging tonnage threshold limits, the amount of packaging not accounted for is probably less than 2 per cent. of the total. The Environment Agency's compliance plan for 2001&ndash;02 has provision to check on more than 2,000 businesses and the agency is on schedule to fulfil that commitment. The number of registrations under the regulations (which includes individual businesses and groups of companies) has continued to rise, from 5,451 at the end of 2000 to 5,629 now.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.6/3">Agency enforcement is steadily improving. There were 38 prosecutions in 2001 (a total of 72 since the start of the agency's enforcement programme in 1998). Fines are on average higher, with fines totalling &pound;152,350 (average &pound;4,000) in 2001, compared to only &pound;63,878 (average &pound;2,060) in 2000 in 31 cases. The highest fine last year reached &pound;25,000. As fines increase, so does their deterrent effect.</p>

	<p pid=".478W.0/2">The cost to public funds and land managers cannot be estimated accurately without knowing in advance the number of projects subject to EIA. As part of the Regulatory Impact Assessment, it was estimated that the cost to DEFRA might be in the region of &pound;0.1 to &pound;0.2 million per annum. Costs to land managers will vary depending on the nature, size and potential impacts of the project and whether any changes need to be made in the light of the assessment. As an illustration it was calculated that the costs arising from 100 projects subject to an application, of which 10 led to preparation of an Environmental Statement prepared by a consultant, could be around &pound;20,000 to &pound;28,000.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.0/3">Two formal consultations were carried out in 2001; the first in May on the options for implementation elicited 42 responses; the second in September, with detailed proposals, received 32 responses. Respondents included statutory agencies (English Nature, English Heritage, Environment Agency and Countryside Agency) and bodies representing environmental and historic interests and the farming industry.</p>

	<p pid=".478W.6/2">The number of fuel poor households in England in 1998 is set out in Table 4.1 of the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy. This shows that out of the 2.7 million vulnerable households in fuel poverty in England in 1998, 2 million were in private sector housing and 0.7 million in social housing.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.6/3">Chart 4.2 of the strategy shows that in 1998, some 14 per cent. or half a million fuel poor households had a child under 16. It is not possible to estimate the breakdown of this between different housing tenures.</p>
