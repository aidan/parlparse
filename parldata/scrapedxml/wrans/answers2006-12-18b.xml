However, the evidence also points to areas where welfare problems continue. The draft strategy proposes a new approach to delivery in order to make progress in these areas. It will continue to be the Government's role to enforce appropriate baseline standards of welfare through regulation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1432W.8/1">Minimum space allowances for the transport of farmed livestock, horses and poultry are set for road, sea and air transport in Council Directive 91/628/EEC on the protection of animals during transport. These, along with other requirements of the directive, are implemented in Great Britain by the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997. The same space allowances are contained in the superseding European Union (EU) Regulation 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport which apply from <phrase class="date" code="">5 January 2007</phrase>. Recommendations from the EU scientific committees (now the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare) were used as the basis for the space allowances.

One of the Government's key objectives in this sector is to ensure that biofuel production and development is environmentally sustainable. That is why the Government are developing an environmental assurance scheme as an integral part of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). This will require all obligated companies to report on the greenhouse gas balance and wider environmental impacts of their biofuels. The reports will include details of the previous use of the land on which the biofuel feedstocks were grown, and the impacts on biodiversity of growing those feedstocks. This will encourage companies to supply biofuels which deliver the maximum greenhouse gas savings with the minimum environmental impact. It will also ensure that we can monitor the impact of both imported and domestically-sourced biofuels.</p>

	<p pid="b.1435W.8/1">Energy efficient light bulbs are already cost-effective purchases for most consumers. However, the Government recognise the need to accelerate market take-up and has a range of policies which aim to achieve this. There is, however, no target to ensure that every home switches at least three bulbs to energy saving bulbs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.8/2">Under the Energy Efficiency Commitment, electricity and gas suppliers are required to meet targets for the promotion of improvements in domestic energy efficiency. They do this by encouraging and assisting household consumers to take up energy efficient measures, including compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) which are often offered to consumers at subsidised prices. We announced last year the results of the first three year phase of the commitment which saw around 10 million British households, six million of which were on low incomes, benefit from energy saving measures delivered by the energy suppliers. These included about 40 million CFLs, 60 per cent. of which were distributed to a priority group of low-income consumers, mostly for free. CFLs continue to be promoted under the current phase of the Energy Efficiency Commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.8/3">Low energy light bulbs are one of the measures that can be installed under the Government's Warm Front scheme, which is our main programme for tackling fuel poverty in England. Further information on this scheme is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1437W.0/1">Departments have adopted targets to reduce energy use across the central Government estate of buildings, with the aim of making Government offices carbon neutral by 2012, and to reduce the Government's total emissions from buildings by 30 per cent. by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.1437W.0/2">To help achieve these targets, Departments are committed to buying energy efficient equipment, including lighting, for its buildings. Current procurement standards for replacement light bulbs require A-rated performance, which corresponds with compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) technologies.

	<p pid="b.1437W.0/3">These measures are designed to ensure lighting systems and all standard light bulbs are replaced by the most efficient alternatives. Our estimate is that this has the potential for lighting savings of over 160 GWh per year once all lighting had been improved, equivalent to over 16,000 tonnes of CO2. Most of the savings will come through using more efficient fluorescent lamps and ballasts, and installing lighting controls.</p>

	<p pid="b.1437W.6/2">Sewerage service charges are increasing for some Northumbrian Water non-household customers, and reducing for others, due to the transfer from a rateable value based charging method to a site-area based charging method for the surface water drainage (SWD) element of the sewerage charge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1437W.6/3">In 2003 Ofwat carried out a review of SWD charges and published its conclusions in a letter to all companies (RD35/03). Ofwat advocated a move towards site-area based charging for non-household customers. It considers that charging by site area is the fairest method of charging as it results in more cost-reflective charges for non-household customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1437W.6/4">Northumbrian Water are phasing in site-area based charging for SWD for existing non-household customers over three years. By 2008-09 charging will be based wholly on site area. This is designed to phase the impact on customers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1438W.8/1">DEFRA policy with respect to meticillin-resistant<i> Staphylococcus Aureus</i> (MRSA) in animals is guided and advised by the DEFRA Antimicrobial Resistance Co-ordination (DARC) group, and specifically by the MRSA subgroup of DARC that was established in 2004 in response to increasing interest in this area. Following consultation with the subgroup and other interested parties, DEFRA has commissioned a research project, being conducted by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, to test all clinical isolates of <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> from cattle over a two-year period, for meticillin resistance. This work began in January 2006 and, to date, no MRSA isolates have been identified. DEFRA has also commissioned research, currently under way, investigating the risk factors for MRSA-related disease in companion animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1438W.8/2">The inclusion of other livestock species, including pigs, in the remit of this project has been considered by the subgroup but has not been taken forward due to little evidence of the occurrence of MRSA in other food-producing animals in the UK, and due to the fact that <i> S. aureus </i>is not generally considered to be a major pathogen in livestock species other than cattle, where it is a significant cause of mastitis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1438W.8/3">There is no current evidence that food-producing animals form a reservoir of MRSA infection in the UK, although the DARC MRSA subgroup will keep the situation under continued review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1438W.8/4">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is not aware of any UK surveillance of imported pork or other meats for the presence of MRSA. An FSA-funded survey to determine the prevalence of various pathogens and indicator organisms on raw red meat on retail sale is currently being undertaken across the UK. Both UK-produced and imported pork is included in this survey and, while enumeration of <i> S. aureus</i> is being undertaken, isolates are not being screened for antimicrobial resistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1438W.8/5">The FSA's advice on cooking of pork and pork products recommends that they should be thoroughly cooked. As there is no evidence to suggest that MRSA is more heat tolerant than other <i> S. aureus, </i>cooking would be expected to destroy any MRSA if it was present on raw meat.</p>

	<p pid="b.1441W.2/1">The Department does not hold a definitive list of all local authority recycling collection schemes, and these are also subject to rapid change. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) are aware of at least 15 local authorities that offer separate collection of food waste to their residents. There will also be others that co-collect food waste with garden waste. In 2005-06, local authorities in England collected an estimated 2.4 million tonnes of organic material, consisting of both kitchen and garden waste, although the vast majority of this will be garden waste. This organic waste was collected for centralised composting schemes from households via kerbside schemes or taken by householders to civic amenity sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.1441W.2/2">As well as providing compost, a useful end product, recycling food and kitchen waste helps divert waste from landfill and therefore contributes to our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1441W.2/3">WRAP is working to encourage more composting, providing support and advice to local authorities on collecting dry recyclable and organic wastes through its Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team (ROTATE).</p>
	<p pid="b.1441W.2/4">WRAP is also working with local authorities and other partners to improve the uptake of home composting and has distributed 1 million home composting bins to households across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1441W.5/1">The EU waste framework directive (WFD) classes composting as a recovery operation. Full recycling of kitchen and gardening waste occurs when the compost can be considered to be a finished product. The British PAS 100 standard for compost is widely accepted as defining requirements for finished compost products. The standard requires the plastic content of the compost to be strictly limited. In practice this means that only plastics conforming to the European standard EN13432:2000 should be included in garden and kitchen waste collections.</p>

	<p pid="b.1450W.6/1">The security situation across much of Afghanistan is broadly stable. However in the south, particularly in the provinces of Kandahar and Helmand, Government of Afghanistan authority and the rule of law has not yet been established. As a consequence the security situation is much more fragile.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.6/2">In much of the country, therefore, security is not the primary constraint to development. However in the south, poor security does present difficulties for delivering development, particular for the agencies which donors and the Government of Afghanistan employ to implement their programmes. The ability of those agencies to operate is constrained by concerns about the security of their staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.6/3">Despite the security constraints in Helmand, the UK has committed about $9 million to over 80 quick impact projects in that province, and will see the start very soon of the construction of 200 wells and49 kilometres of road in an around Lashkar Gah, under the DFID funded Helmand Agricultural and Rural Development Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.6/4">Afghanistan remains one of the most fragile of states in which DFID works, but it is also one of the poorest countries in the world. Although in most of the country security is adequate for development to take place, that is not uniform across the country.

	<p pid="b.1451W.2/1">Improving the status of women will be vital to achieving the Government of Afghanistan's development objectives. DFID's programme is helping to improve the status of women in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1451W.2/2">DFID is supporting a five year Women's Empowerment programme, implemented by Womankind, through our Civil Society Challenge Fund. This &pound;500,000 initiative is focused on promoting women's equal participation in governance; building awareness of women's rights among civil society and policy makers; and on providing educational, health, community and psycho-social support to those women affected by violence and conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.1451W.2/3">DFID provided significant support to the Government of Afghanistan to help ensure women fully participated in the election process in 2005. Workshops took place to enable women to help shape their new constitution and to educate the women about the election and voting process. 43 per cent. of the total voters were women. Currently a quarter of MPs in Parliament are women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1451W.2/4">DFID has provided &pound;20 million to the Micro-Finance and Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA). This provides micro credit loans to over 234,000 beneficiaries across 20 provinces. Over 70 per cent. of these beneficiaries are currently women, giving them the opportunity to develop their own economic opportunities. MISFA plans to expand to all 34 provinces by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1451W.2/5">DFID has provided &pound;17 million to the Afghan Government's National Solidarity Programme (NSP). This programme has led to the creation of 15,103 Community Development Councils (CDCs). Under this programme, DFID is pressing for more effort tobe placed on improving women's participation in the councils. Female-only CDCs have already been established and have become fora for discussion on issues that women could not previously discuss openly in mixed gender CDCs (e.g. on health, domestic violence and literacy).</p>
	<p pid="b.1451W.2/6">The UK also continues to work with the Afghan Government to ensure gender is fully addressed and integrated into the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, which will provide the framework for development over the next five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1452W.0/2">However, Womankind, an organisation which DFID supports through the Civil Society Challenge Fund, published a report in October 2006 called Taking Stock Update: Afghan Women and Girls Five Years On'. This research report, which was recently launched at an event in the House of Commons, looks at progress made in line with international and national law.

	<p pid="b.1452W.3/1">As stated in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-21">21 November</phrase>, UNICEF reports that the number of children in school increased from 1.2 million in March 2002, to 5.1 million in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.3/2">As DFID does not provide direct assistance tothe education sector, we have not made a detailed assessment of the effect of violence and intimidation on school attendance. However, according to a recent report from Human Rights Watch: 'Lessons in Terror: Attacks on Education in Afghanistan', the majority of children of primary school age remain out of school, and many children in rural areas have no access to schools. The report cites the main reasons for this as:</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.3/3" class="indent">(i) attacks on teachers, students and schools by armed groups forcing schools to close; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.3/4" class="indent">(ii) attacks against representatives of the Afghan Government and NGOs, along with general lawlessness, making it too dangerous to open new schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.3/5">Despite the improvements, the effects of violence and intimidation on enrolment rates and attendance are deeply worrying, particularly for girls. The problem is particularly acute in the areas where security is poor. The UK is working to improve security in Afghanistan, particularly in the south, and in so doing providea better enabling environment for development, including education, to take place.</p>

	<p pid="b.1453W.3/1">DFID's activity in Angola has two objectives that address good governance and probity: to promote the transparent use of resources in support of reducing poverty; and to promote systems that enable citizens to influence state policy and practice. We primarily support these through partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1453W.3/2">For example, we are promoting the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Angola. EITI supports improved governance in resource-rich countries through the full publication and verification of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas and mining. We have encouraged the Government of Angola to sign up to this initiative, and have also supported the World Bank to engage on this with them. Although the Government are not yet a member of EITI, it now attends EITI conferences as an observer, and has taken a number of steps in line with EITI including: independent audits of the national oil company Sonangol; publishing of budgetary information on the Ministry of Finance website; and adoption of an integrated financial management system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1453W.3/3">Other areas where we are engaging on good governance and probity include: technical support to help the Ministry of Finance identify and address capacity needs on planning and budgeting, in partnership with the European Commission; support for fiscal decentralisation through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which is helping the Government with the development of new legislation and decentralisation pilots; and support for strengthened citizen-government engagement on urban poverty and services through an NGO consortium(the Luanda Urban Poverty Programme). A recent independent review of this last programme (October 2006) found that it had raised the profile of urban poverty and influenced the course of some key policy decisions in Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1453W.3/4">We will continue to work with partners on these issues, which we see as critical for sustained peace and equitable development in Angola.</p>

Since the progress made on cluster munitionsat the Review Conference on the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) Ministers have not discussed the issue. Officials from DFID, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office are, however, in regular contact on how best to support the work of the Expert Group which will report back to the meeting of CCW States Parties in November 2007. This is an essential preliminary step towards negotiations for a new legally binding instrument.</p>

	<p pid="b.1455W.2/1">Certain types of cluster munitions have unacceptably high failure rates, which vary in relation to the prevailing conditions in which they are used. If they are used in large numbers, unexploded bomblets can be left scattered densely and indiscriminately over a wide area. When these are set off, the explosion can kill anyone within 50 m. They represent a threat to aid workers, peace-keepers, medical services, Internally Displaced Persons and anyone else entering an area immediately after the cessation of hostilities. The design of cluster munitions means that often children are attracted to them. The threat to returning civilians is exacerbated when cluster munitions are used over soft terrain such as recently ploughed farmland. Unexploded bomblets can lie buried just beneath the surface making it dangerous for farmers to cultivate their land.</p>
	<p pid="b.1455W.2/2">Casualty figures are hard to verify but reports indicate that unexploded cluster munitions killed thousands of civilians in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. The UN reports around 1 million unexploded cluster bomblets in Southern Lebanon. So far,23 civilian deaths and 145 injuries have resulted from unexploded ordnance, mainly cluster munitions. Of these totals, children 18 years old or younger accounted for six of the fatalities and 55 of the injuries.</p>

We need all the major producers and users of cluster munitions to participate in negotiating new protocols on the use of these weapons. Without these countries an agreement won't deliver the humanitarian benefits we want. SoI think it is better to give the UN process&mdash;agreedat the Review Conference of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW)&mdash;a chance to succeed.

We cannot withdraw them from service immediately as this would risk leaving our armed forces with a capability gap.

	<p pid="b.1456W.6/1">DFID does not maintain an agreed list of 'states affected by conflict'. We do have a list of 'fragile states' which we are currently reviewing, as countries frequently move in and out of fragility and conflict, and political circumstances in a country can rapidly change. This list will include countries that are generally recognised to be conflict-affected. Detail on DFID's current definition and list of fragile states can be found in DFID's policy paper, &quot;Why We Need to Work More Effectively in Fragile States&quot;, page 7 and annex 1, which is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1456W.6/2">There is not a universally recognised single indicator for 'access to primary health care'. The primary source of global health statistics is the World Health Organisation's &quot;World Health Statistics&quot; publication, of which the 2006 edition is the latest. This lists 50 health indicators for WHO's 192 member states. Indicators include infant and maternal mortality rates, life expectancy at birth, immunisation coverage, births attended by skilled health personnel and a variety of indicators covering nutritional status. Collating this data and then deriving a single measure of the proportion of the population able to access primary health care would be both difficult and incur disproportionate costs. I have instead placed a copy of the WHO publication in the House of Commons Library. However, by way of illustration, the 2004 figures for measles immunisation among one-year-olds in the DRC, Somalia and Sudan are 64 per cent., 40 per cent. and 59 per cent. respectively, compared to 91 per cent., 83 per cent. and 94 per cent. for Uganda, Ghana and Tanzania.</p>

	<p pid="b.1457W.2/2" class="indent">Improving our understanding of the context and the underlying causes of conflict in order to improve the effectiveness of our development assistance. Over the past three years the number of conflict advisers working for DFID has increased from 10 to 35.</p>

We are working with others to push for reform of the UN and regional organisations such as the African Union so that they are better able to respond effectively to conflict and humanitarian crises. With other donors, we have agreed a set of 'Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations'. These have been endorsed by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee and are currently being piloted in nine countries. For more details on UN reform and institutional strengthening please refer to the DFID written answer to PQ 105318.</p>
	<p pid="b.1457W.2/4" class="indent">Delivering aid through both government and non-government channels as appropriate to ensure that aid reaches those most in need. We support multi-donor funds, such as the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust fund and the Joint Programme for HIV and AIDS in Burma as a way of co-ordinating donors and reducing transaction costs for recipients. Social Funds, for example that developed in Yemen, have also proved successful.</p>

The DFID office in Uganda remains in close touch with UNHCR and is ready to help if required. Other EU member states that have missions in Uganda are also monitoring the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1459W.5/1">&euro;22,682 billion will be spent through the 10th European Development Fund (EDF 10, 2008-2013). Of this amount, &euro;21,966 billion will be spent on programmes that will benefit the 78 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, &euro;286 million will benefit the overseas countries and territories (OCTs) and &euro;430 million will cover administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1459W.5/2">The Commission has allocated just under half of the &euro;21,966 billion to national indicative programmes for ACP countries, primarily based on their needs and performance. Needs are measured by factors such as population size, income levels, the level of social development and a country's vulnerability to external shocks. Performance is measured by the absorption of previous EDF funds, and a series of indicators that measure economic, political and social performance. Each country's initial national allocation stands to be increased by around 25 per cent. according to its performance against a series of governance indicators and its commitment to further governance reforms. None of the ACP countries will receive less than they receive under EDF 9 (2003-2007). The allocation model has been discussed with member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1459W.5/3">Around &euro;5.1 billion of funds will be provided for regional programmes and activities including trade integration and peace and security work. This money is allocated partly as a proportion of funding for national indicative programmes in each of the regions, and partly on the basis of needs for specific activities identified by the EC and agreed with member states. &euro;1.5 billion will be used by the European Investment Bank to make loans to support private sector development in ACP countries. The criteria for allocating funds to the OCTs will be agreed inearly 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1461W.6/1">Prime Minister Maliki's Government is just six months old and faces immense security, political and economic challenges as a result of more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic underinvestment from Saddam's brutal regime. Continued violence, including sabotage of key infrastructure facilities, and low (but growing) levels of technical capacity in Iraq's national and local governments, is slowing progress. However, there have been some notable successes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/2" class="indent">In December 2005, just over 12 million people (76 per cent. of the population) voted in democratic elections, putting in place a Council of Representatives for the next four years. An Iraqi Government of National Unity has been in place since May.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/3" class="indent">The economy has rebounded quickly; Iraq's GDP is projected at $48 billion in 2006, up from $18.4 billion in 2002. With help from donors, including DFID, the interim government negotiated an Emergency Post-Conflict Agreement (EPCA) with the IMF worth US$436 million, paving the way for the Paris Club debt reduction deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/4" class="indent">Iraq's infrastructure was badly maintained during the1990s with little new investment. Since 2003 more thanUS $3.5 billion has been spent on electricity, adding nearly 5,000 MW to the grid. However improvements have been off-set by continued sabotage, inadequate fuel supplies, and lack of Iraqi capacity to operate and maintain the new systems. Current generation averages 4,400 MW, compared to 4,300 MW pre-conflict and 2,500 MW immediately post-conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/5" class="indent">Over 5 million children have received life-saving vaccinations. More than 180,000 teachers and healthcare professionals have been trained. Hundreds of healthcare facilities have been rehabilitated. Over 5,000 schools have been rehabilitated, and a further 450 are planned or under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/6" class="indent">Media and civil society is flourishing. 250 newspapersand magazines have been launched since the fall of the regime, and new, independent radio and TV stations are now up and running. 2,500 Iraqi NGOs are now registered with the Iraqi Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/7">DFID is committed to supporting Iraq's reconstruction progress. Our programme focuses on:</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/8" class="indent">Improving power and water services in southern Iraq. By summer 2007, we will have improved electricity supply and access to water for around a million people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/9" class="indent">Helping Iraq manage its substantial resources effectively.

	<p pid="b.1464W.2/1">DFID takes corruption very seriously. The Government of Kenya are clearly not tackling corruption as effectively as they could and we need to adopt a coordinated and common response across the donor community. The Government of Kenya have developed a governance strategy which Kenyans want to see implemented and leading to high level prosecutions based on sound evidence. We expect the same and will continually monitor progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.2/2">Direct budget support is not appropriate for Kenya so we give our aid in other ways. Our aid has stringent safeguards and checks and is making a significant impact. For example, our support to the education sector is channelled through a separate account to help ensure that all the money goes towards the stated aims of an extra 12,000 classrooms, education materials for each of the 19,000 primary schools, etc. Much of our aid, especially in public financial management and political empowerment but also across all our programmes, aims and assists to shed light on the Government of Kenya's operations. We will continue to engage with other agencies, strengthening systems and institutions, building capacity and supporting reform. By doing so, over time, and as long as the Government take the lead, the opportunities for corruption will be removed, checks and balances built, and accountability strengthened.</p>

This evaluation concluded that the programme has been in large part successful in delivering what it set out to achieve. It acknowledged that this is a good outcome in a difficult governance environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.5/2">At an individual project level, DFID requires that all projects over &pound;1 million are subject to annual and completion reviews. Over two-thirds of these reviews over 2000-06 concluded that the aims of the projects are likely to be completely, largely, or partly achieved.

The Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) has directly provided fuel to the Gaza electricity company, hospitals and water installations to maintain basic services following the destruction of the Gaza power plant in June this year. The TIM has also been used to pay for allowances for teachers and medical workers, thereby helping President Abbas negotiate an end to the public sector strike in those sectors. In March, at the start of the economic crisis, the World Bank predicted a 27 per cent. decline in real GDP by the end of the year. Due to the increase in aid flows, including the support provided by the TIM, they have now adjusted that to8 to 9 per cent. decline.</p>

	<p pid="b.1466W.2/1">In Rwanda, DFID fosters civil society groups in several different ways. Most importantly, DFID facilitates participation of civil society groups in policy discussion with the Government of Rwanda and the international development community. This is an effective way of increasing civil society's capacity to hold Government to account. For example, DFID has provided project funding to Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) to encourage associations of people with disabilities to participate in preparations for Rwanda's new Poverty Reduction Strategy. We also support capacity building in civil society groups. Recently, for example, DFID has been assisting Norwegian People's Aid, Action Aid, Trocaire and SNV to assess how far their processes and programmes are successfully supporting gender equality objectives.</p>

	<p pid="b.1467W.5/1">Over the last seven months, fighting in north Darfur has had a severe impact on the ability of humanitarian agencies to access those in need. In some areas, the security situation makes it too dangerous for the UN and NGOs to operate, leaving many people without food aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.5/2">In the last few months, fighting and attacks on humanitarian agencies have led to the evacuation of international staff and the suspension of their operations in a number of locations in north Darfur. The very recent clashes in El-Fasher, the state capital, has further exacerbated the situation, forcing the temporary relocation of 134 international agency staff from a total of around 330. The insecurity has restricted access to camps for displaced people around El-Fasher, and has also limited the ability of agencies to service the few remaining sub-offices they have in other parts of north Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.5/3">Where feasible, humanitarian agencies are trying to maintain operations using local staff and volunteers, accessing areas when the security situation allows.

	<p pid="b.1467W.8/1">Tetanus spores enter the body viadeep wounds. In addition to wounds caused by accidents, mothers are susceptible to tetanus infection immediately following childbirth. Similarly, new born babies are at risk of tetanus infection where a non-sterile instrument is used to cut the umbilical cord (for example an un-trained traditional birth attendant using a piece of bamboo) and where traditional practices involve placing unclean &quot;dressing's&quot; over the exposed area (such as dried and powdered cow dung used to help dry the cord in parts of South Asia). Without urgent treatment tetanus is fatal, causing an estimated 200,000 newborn child deaths a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.8/2">Tetanus is preventable through good hygiene and vaccination. The tetanus toxoid (TT) injection is part of a package of immunisation given to children under five and to pregnant women. Children have three doses of TT which is typically administered in the same syringe as diphtheria and whooping cough (pertussis), and given at the same time as polio immunisation (drops on the tongue). As in the UK, this is known as 'DPT and polio'. Because preventing tetanus is an integral part of overall immunisation policy and practice, DFID funding for tetanus immunisation in developing countries is contained within our overall spending on immunisation for children and pregnant women and cannot be separated out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.8/3">DFID works to support developing countries efforts to strengthen the health services through which immunisation is provided. In 2005-06 DFID provided &pound;453.1 million as direct support to health. DFID also provided &pound;12.5 million core support to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and &pound;19 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 2005-06. Both WHO and UNICEF are key global actors in vaccine preventable diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.8/4">In addition, DFID supports the work of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) to introduce new vaccines (such as hepatitis B and haemophilius influenza) into country immunisation schedules. In some cases these new vaccines are administered in combination with diptheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT). In these cases, GAVI also supports tetanus immunisation. In some of the world's poorest countries, GAVI provides support to improve the health systems which deliver immunisation and this support has recently been linked to improvements in the rates of DPT immunisation coverage in these countries. DFID has contributed over &pound;43 million to GAVI since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.8/5">The UK is also committed to developing innovative financing mechanisms such as the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFm) which was launched in September 2005. So far this has raised US $1 billion which will be channelled through GAVI, allowing a significant scaling-up of their immunisation work. The UK has committed a total of &pound;1.38 billion for IFFm over the next 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.8/6">The European Commission and World Bank are also major recipients of UK multilateral aid. They both provide substantial support to improve health services in developing countries. Budget support and sector specific programmes help finance the implementation of immunisation programmes including those which combat tetanus.</p>

	<p pid="b.1473W.2/1">The Tristar aircraft plays a vital part in the worldwide transport of troops and equipment as well as undertaking air to air refuelling tasks. It has helped to contribute to 80 per cent. of all flights to and from Afghanistan and Iraq being achieved on time and a 42 per cent. increase between April to December on the number of passengers flown by the RAF in the same period last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1473W.2/2">Operational reliability is assessed by the numbers of aircraft that are deemed as fit for purpose (FFP) against the planned average FFP figure. Aircraft are deemed fit for purpose if they are capable of undertaking the required task on a given day. Aircraft are not available for tasking if they are undergoing scheduled maintenance, modification programmes or any unforeseen rectification work that can arise on a day to day basis. The figures do not reflect the fact that an aircraft assessed as not fit for purpose may be returned to the front line at very short notice to meet the operational need. The planned average FFP for the Tristar aircraft for 2006-07 is 4.8 aircraft per day. We have so far achieved a FFP figure of 4.75 aircraft per day for the same period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1476W.2/17">The helicopters listed are all crewed by a team of people and cannot be flown by one pilot. The figures represent the total number of crew flying hours completed each month for each type of helicopter, divided by the number of crews of each respective helicopter cadre that were available for flying duties in the same period. The figures include all operational flying, but exclude flying hours flown by crews at the School of Army Aviation to avoid distorting the averages.</p>

	<p pid="b.1478W.6/1">The most significant recent studies relating to mental health are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1478W.6/2">A major research study into the physical and psychological health of personnel who were deployed to Iraq on Operation Telic is being conducted by King's College London. This work began in 2003 and entered its second three-year phase in September 2006. The first two scientific papers resulting from this work were published in May 2006 and showed that there had been no substantial increase in symptomatic ill health among regular personnel from participation in the operation. There was evidence for a small though statistically significant mental health effect among reserve personnel, however, and changes in the provision of mental healthcare for reservists have been made to address this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478W.6/3">An independent charity, the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (HASCAS), was commissioned by the MOD to review the mental healthcare available to UK veterans and further work is now underway to take forward the HASCAS recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478W.6/4">The Department is funding a one-year study bythe Centre for Suicide Prevention and National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness at the University of Manchester. The purpose of this work is to determine the rates of suicide among UK veterans and to compare them with rates among serving personnel and in the general population. The study began in June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478W.6/5">A compendium of Defence medical research has been maintained since 2004. The following table shows those mental health studies that have appeared within the compendium. Where an item has appeared more than once in different versions, only the most up-to-date entry has been included. The compendium includes personal degree research as well as studies commissioned departmentally.</p>

It does not mean that these individuals are severely ill, nor would necessarily regard themselves as being in need of treatment. Also, while more of those reservists who served in Iraq reach the indicator threshold than those who did not serve in Iraq, this should be looked at in the context of the general adult UK population where the same level of indicators of common mental illness have been detected in over 30 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1485W.6/1">The future Phase 2 supervisory requirement will depend on how training is to be delivered. Defence is constantly seeking to modernise the delivery of training taking into account options of distributed training, E learning and simulated training. Improved learning methodology may also determine how training will be delivered in the future. Future student to instructor ratios in 5, 10 and 15 years time will be determined by the nature of the activity being undertaken and therefore it is not possible to anticipate what these will be. However, in seeking to partner with industry to develop innovative training solutions, the Defence Training Review programme includes the following requirement: In Phase 2 there must be sufficient military instructors so that at least 40 per cent. of the class contact time (combining specialist and non specialist training) is with military instructors, and a minimum of 25 per cent. of the specialist training programmed periods must be taught by a military instructor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1485W.6/2">Data on geographic dispersal or the percentage of Phase 2 skills training delivered by military, ex-military and contracted instructors are not routinely held by the services and MOD does not have access to information on the background of contracted staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1485W.6/3">Earlier this year the MOD revised its supervisory care policy in order to focus attention on reducingthe risks to trainees. The policy mandates the determination of a supervisory care directive, underpinned by a Unit Commander's Risk Assessment. The policy mandates that minimum levels of supervision are determined from the Unit Commander's Risk Assessment and must be articulated against the relevant serials during the working day, out of hours, weekend and leave periods. The supervisory provision will change throughout the day and night dependent on the activities being undertaken. For example, in the classroom environment one instructor might supervise up to30 trainees but this ratio could reduce to 1:4 for a higher risk activity or for practical reasons and down to 1:1 for flying training. While average weekday ratios are no longer centrally collated, training establishments are subject to audit and evaluation of their supervisory care regimes and implementation of the supervisory policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1485W.6/4">The implementation of supervisory policy is subject to audit and evaluation by service and defence teams and additionally the duty of care and welfare provision is currently subject to external inspection by the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI). The ALI is currently engaged in conducting a series of visits to training establishments.</p>

	<p pid="b.1489W.2/1">The annual increase in the rate of Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) is based on the average cost of fees at those schools with at least30 pupils from Service families. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, school fee increases have been higher than inflation. Over the same period, the number of Service children benefiting from the allowance rose from 7,130 in 2001-02 to 8,029 in 2004-05, before declining to 7,886 in 2005-06. This accounts for the increase in cost of Continuity of Education Allowance between 2001 and 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1492W.9/1">The majority of schools funding in 2005-06 was delivered through the wider Local Government Finance Settlement which is not directly comparable with the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) allocations introduced in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1492W.9/2">The 2005-06 baseline figure is based on local authority spend in 2005-06. The following table shows: the 2005-06 baseline; final 2006-07 DSG allocations; and the percentage increase in 2006-07. The indicative DSG allocations planned for 2007-08; and what this would give as a percentage increase from the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1492W.9/3">The increase in Dedicated Schools Grant allocations year on year are less than the per pupil increases(5.9 per cent. compared to 6.8 per cent. in 2006-07 and 6.0 per cent. compared to 6.7 per cent. in 2007-08) due to the impact of falling pupil numbers nationally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1506W.0/1">Since late 2005, the Colombian authorities have reported a dramatic increase in coca cultivation in the border area with Ecuador. The Colombian authorities have therefore decided to resume, temporarily, aerial spraying in these areas. Manual eradication methods are not feasible due to the presence of illegal armed groups and drug traffickers in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506W.0/2">The UK is not involved in Colombia's eradication programmes but has recently committed funds through the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to part-fund the current satellite survey of coca cultivation in Ecuador.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506W.0/3">We are aware of Ecuadorian concerns over the environmental and health impact of aerial spraying. Ecuador has delivered a strong protest to the Colombian Government and is threatening to withdraw its Ambassador to Colombia. We also understand that President-elect Correa has raised the issue with the UN and the Organisation of American States. The UNODC is monitoring the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1511W.8/1">NATO's invitation for Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to join Partnership for Peace (PfP) was taken in the interests of long-term stability in the Western Balkans and as recognition of the progress the two countries have made. However, the communiqu&eacute; from the Riga summit makes clear that NATO expects Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to co-operate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and will closely monitor their respective efforts in this. This will be important for both countries as PfP members, and if they want to move beyond PfP towards full NATO membership. The level of co-operation of both countries with the ICTY is subject to regular review by ICTY's Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte.</p>

	<p pid="b.1515W.2/1">We are very concerned at recent reports that criticised parties to the Sri Lanka conflict including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Karuna faction for the recruitment and use of child soldiers. We deplore this practice: there can be no excuse for failing to observe such basic human rights. We fully support the UN Security Council Resolutions on children in armed conflict, including Resolution 1612 that set up a monitoring and reporting mechanism on the recruitment and use of child soldiers in a number of countries including, Sri Lanka. We are actively involved in the Working Group on children and armed conflict at the UN. We also actively contribute to EU policy formation and implementation on this issue, including the recent Statement of the EU Presidency to the UN Human Rights Council, which raised detailed concerns about the recruitment and use of child soldiers in Sri Lanka. Bilaterally, we have and will continue to underline to the Sri Lankan authorities as well as to the LTTE the unacceptability of the recruitment and use of child soldiers in violation of applicable international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1515W.2/2">We understand that since these reports Colonel Karuna has contacted the UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict and given assurances the Karuna Group will work formally with the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to implement an action plan to prevent the recruitment and use of children. We, and international partners, will be closely monitoring this initiative.</p>

	<p pid="b.1518W.2/16">Since 1997-98 the Cabinet Office has used DHL along with other companies to provide courier services. Usage of DHL for such services up until 1999-2000 was low, with the costs incurred by a handful of different management units. From the latter part of 2000-01, the Department had a need for more regular secure courier services from DHL, in relation to daily secure courier delivery of confidential citizen data enabling printing of registration and enrolment letters and pin codes for the Government Gateway. Thereafter, the cost fluctuated according to the business need of the Government Gateway team.</p>

	<p pid="b.1522W.2/14">Of the total value of grant funding clawed back, over the last five financial years, &pound;3,362,323 relates to the clawback of Gap Funding provided under the Partnership Investment Programme, a programme which emda inherited from English Partnerships. Under the terms of the programme English Partnerships provided the shortfall of funding to land developers, between the cost of developing a site and the likely future sales value. As part of the funding contract where the future sales value of a site was greater than that forecast, grant funding would be due back and hence the clawback of monies by emda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.2/15">In addition a further &pound;885,330 has been clawed back under the Single Regeneration Budget scheme where again, under the terms of the funding contract any profits made on schemes grant funded by emda must be repaid.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.2/16">The remaining balance of &pound;1,429,739 consists of many small claims for clawback. This generally arises where there are contractual obligations to repay grant funding that has generated a profit, similar to the above schemes. In several other cases clawback has arisen where intermediary organisations, responsible for distributing grants on behalf of emda, have not distributed their full allocation of monies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1525W.8/2">The latest ONS employee jobs data estimates that there were 171,099 employee jobs in manufacturing in Wales in June 2006. The equivalent June 1997 figure for Wales is 210,376.</p>
	<p pid="b.1525W.8/3">ONS data shows that manufacturing output is experiencing some welcome revival in 2006, growing 1.6 per cent. by October, compared to the end of last year. Productivity growth in manufacturing, using the &quot;per job&quot; measure, was 3.5 per cent. in quarter two of this year, compared to the previous quarter. This was higher then the equivalent measure for the whole economy, which was 2.0 per cent. So whilst regrettably the decline in manufacturing jobs continues, manufacturing continues to contribute in an important way to economic output.</p>

	<p pid="b.1549W.2/1">All bodies, whether in the public or private sector, incur VAT when they purchase goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/2">While, there are certain special schemes designed to provide VAT refunds to certain public bodies in relation to specific purchases or activities, the normal principle of public funding is that VAT, like any other cost, should be taken into account within the funding allocated to those bodies. This is the way the VAT system has worked in relation to public bodies since its introduction in 1973.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/3">The normal VAT liability rules apply to all public sector capital spending projects, including those carried out under the BSF Programme&mdash;i.e. that VAT is chargeable on non-residential new build or renewal work to non-listed buildings, except where the body concerned is a charity and the building is used at least 90 per cent. for a relevant charitable purpose.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/4">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have discussed VAT and Building Schools for the Future (BSF) with local authority representatives. All advice provided to date on VAT and BSF is covered by the usual rules of taxpayer confidentiality, and no general guidelines have been published. HMRC and HM Treasury remain in close contact with DfES, local authorities and local authority representative groups on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/5">HMRC does not hold detailed figures on any VAT that has previously been collected on buildings used for educational purposes; on any VAT charged on BSF projects to date; or on any VAT which may be levied on such projects in the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/6">However, if any VAT is chargeable on BSF projects, this will in general be reclaimable by a local authority where it relates to its statutory non-business functions, such as the delivery of free education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/7">VAT is also reclaimable by a local authority in relation to taxable supplies, and to exempt activities where the amount of this VAT is insignificant. Where VAT is incurred by a non-local authority school, this will be reclaimable under the normal VAT rules, to the extent that it relates to taxable business activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/8">As previously stated, if any VAT is charged on a BSF project and is not reclaimable, it will in general be taken into account in the funding allocated to the spending body.</p>

	<p pid="b.1551W.7/1">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) applies hedonic methods as a means of quality adjusting prices for a limited range of goods, including personal computers and laptops. The ONS no longer publishes the retail prices index (RPI) on the basis of the methods used prior to the introduction of hedonic methods. Therefore, estimates of the impact of incorporating hedonic methods on the RPI, and hence any effects on public expenditure, are not readily available. However, there is a presumption that any such effects are likely to be small: when hedonic methods were first introduced into the consumer prices index in 2003 the ONS noted that 'the change would have had little impact on the overall published index'.</p>

	<p pid="b.1564W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what total amount of additional unpaid maintenance has been recovered to date as a result of the Child Support Agency's Operational Improvement plan; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/5" class="indent">The Operational Improvement Plan announced in Parliament on 9<sup>(th)</sup> February 2006 and launched in April 2006 aims over the next three years to improve our service to clients, increase the amount of money we collect, achieve greater compliance from non-resident parents and as a result achieve a reduction in child poverty and a better standard of living for many more children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/6" class="indent">The initial phase of the Operational Improvement Plan has focussed on the organisational and operational restructuring of the Agency, and the training of our people. Once this phase is complete we can expect to see more clearly the benefits of the Plan. Even now early results show improvements in several key areas; at the end of September 2006 compared with a year ago:</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/7" class="indent">67,000 more children benefited from maintenance arrangements</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/8" class="indent">Uncleared applications were down by 12 per cent and stood at their lowest since comparable records began in May 1999</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/9" class="indent">An average of &pound;71.3 million every month is being collected or arranged through Maintenance Direct (up from &pound;67.5 million each month in 2005/06)</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/10" class="indent">The Agency cleared more applications: 55 per cent within twelve weeks (up from 44 per cent and meeting target level) and 73 per cent within six months (up from 60 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/11" class="indent">59 per cent of new scheme cases with a liability made a payment or arranged Maintenance Direct (up from 53 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/12" class="indent">The Agency answered 97 per cent of queued calls (up from91 per cent in March 2006)</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/13" class="indent">The Operational Improvement Plan included plans to contract out some of the outstanding debt owed to parents with care, to private debt collection agencies. By the end of October 2006 over &pound;180,000 had been collected by these agencies. A letter sent by the Agency to inform clients that their debt is to be transferred to the external debt collection agencies had also resulted in an additional &pound;250,000 collected by the Agency by the end of October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/14" class="indent">During the year ending March 2006 a total amount of&pound;13.5 million was collected through specific legal enforcement work, an average monthly amount of &pound;1.1 million. This has increased during the first half of the reporting year 2006/2007 during which the Agency has collected &pound;8.6 million, a monthly average of &pound;1.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/15" class="indent">The Agency continues to improve the collection of child support maintenance arrears and during the year ending March 2006 a total amount of &pound;80.8 million was collected, an average monthly amount of &pound;6.7 million. This has increased to an average monthly amount of &pound;7.1 million during the first half of the reporting year 2006/2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1565W.2/5" class="indent">The attached table shows the average time taken to answer telephone calls received in respect of both new and old scheme cases on the new computer system (CS2). It is not possible to disaggregate this data by scheme, and monthly information is only available from July 2003 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565W.2/6" class="indent">The speed of answering calls has improved steadily since 2004. On average, the Agency has answered telephone calls within one minute on both new and old computer systems every month since March 2006, as committed to in the Agency's published service standard. However, in September 2006, there was a seasonal dip in performance caused by high call volumes. To reduce the impact of such seasonal variations in future, the Agency is investigating ways of being able to deploy its people at times of high call activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565W.2/7" class="indent">Further information on the Agency's telephony performance is contained in table 16 of the September 2006 Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link:</p>

The correct definition of this target is, therefore, that: 'The Agency will collect arrears equivalent to 40 per cent. of the amount accruing due to non-payment of regular maintenance between <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase>.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1568W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-18">18 December 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many Child Support Agency cases are (a) outstanding and (b) unprocessed in each year from 1993 to 2006; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/5" class="indent">The Agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. Any applications that have not yet been cleared can be regarded as outstanding. The amount of work required to achieve clearance and the elapsed time it involves varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the Agency. As such, the Agency holds only a negligible number of completely unprocessed applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/6" class="indent">The attached table shows the number of uncleared applications at points in time between May 1999 and September 2006. For the period prior to May 1999, reliable management information on uncleared applications is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/7" class="indent">The information provided in the table can be derived by combining information from Table 1 and Table 2.1 of the September 2006 Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link:</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_sep06.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_sep06.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/9" class="indent">Although the total volume of uncleared applications, 247,500 in September 2006, is the lowest since comparable records began, the Agency recognises that this remains unacceptably high. The Agency therefore has a 2006/07 target to ensure that, by March 2007, the volume of new scheme uncleared applications outstanding at March 2006 is reduced by 25% and our challenge, as set down in our Operational Improvement Plan, is that the Agency should not have a backlog by March 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1569W.2/5" class="indent">The answer to your question can be found on the following table. Data on the old scheme (until March 2003) was only recorded quarterly. Monthly figures are available from March 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.2/6" class="indent">The Agency now collects more than double the amount of arrears payments each quarter than it did in 1997. However, we are aware that there remains a great deal of work to be done in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1569W.2/8" class="indent">a target to reduce historic debt owed by non-resident parents by &pound;200m up to 2009;</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.2/9" class="indent">a major increase in the number of designated enforcement people;</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.2/10" class="indent">an objective to raise levels of case compliance for new scheme cases to 75 per cent by March 2008 and 80 per cent in March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.2/11" class="indent">We have also launched a Specialist Trace Service, so that cases which have been suspended because the Agency has insufficient information to trace the non-resident parent, can be transferred to the private sector to make use of their specialist tracing skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.2/12" class="indent">As such, we plan to reduce significantly the levels of historic debt in the Agency, and ensure that more non-resident parents meet their responsibilities to their children.</p>

	<p pid="b.1572W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many parents with care are owed Child Support Agency maintenance arrears; what the average arrears per case are; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.0/5" class="indent">In September 2006 there were 598,600 cases that had outstanding arrears owed to the parent with care by the non-resident parent in respect of their child or children. The mean average arrears for these cases was &pound;3,170 and the median average was &pound;660. These figures exclude arrears owed to the Secretary of State by non-resident parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.0/6" class="indent">The Agency recognizes that current debt remains high and targets have been introduced to slow down and stabilise the growth of debt. As part of the Agency's &quot;Operational Improvement Plan&quot;, published in February 2006, we:</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.0/7" class="indent">have contracted out some debt collection to the private sector;</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.0/8" class="indent">are improving our own efforts to collect, by increasing the number of people dedicated to enforcement activity within the Agency and learning lessons from the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.0/9" class="indent">These measures will enable the Agency to collect over 200 million more historic debt over the next three years.</p>

The Bill would enable the scheme to receive social security information in order to target those eligible for assistance and so help to increase take up among those eligible. There will also be extensive communications to raise awareness about the scheme and we continue to work closely with the Digital Switchover Consumer Experts Group, which includes a number of leading voluntary sector organisations including Age Concern, RNIB and RNID, to explore how best to communicate with eligible groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.1587W.5/1">The 2012 Roadshow was funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), with contributions from Camelot (benefits in kind), Transport for London (&pound;9,000) and Sport England (&pound;5,000).</p>
	<p pid="b.1587W.5/2">Aside from staff (and travel, accommodation and related) costs, the Department's expenditure was approximately &pound;22,600. The vast majority of this arose from the hire of the Roadshow bus from Arriva plc, associated expenses and a contribution towards the cost of 'wrapping' the exterior of the bus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1587W.5/3">LOCOG contributed a similar amount of money as well as providing event management and planning support, with colleagues from the London 2012 Nations and Regions Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.1587W.5/4">Camelot provided creative services during the design of the bus's wrapping and elite athletes to support Roadshow activities during the three-week tour, which coincided with the launch of the National Lottery's Dream Number game in support of the 2012 Games. Transport for London contributed to the cost of wrapping the bus, while Sport England made a contribution towards the cost of printed material, merchandise etc.</p>
	<p pid="b.1587W.5/5">The Roadshow, which aimed to ensure that as many people as possible across the UK were made aware of and able to take part in the unique opportunities that the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games can bring, was developed in partnership with the Devolved Administrations and regional stakeholders, who were responsible for costs incurred at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1597W.8/1">The chair of the Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships, Dr. Robert Prescott, was appointed by the Minister for Culture on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April 2006</phrase>, and eight committee members were appointed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July 2006</phrase>: Roger Hanbury, John Kearon, Dr. Campbell McMurray, David Newberry, Martin Parr, John Robinson, Matthew Tanner and Captain Simon Waite. Further appointment processes are being undertaken to select committee members to represent Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.8/2">It is not the Government's policy to provide funding for historic ships directly, other than through grant-in-aid to centrally funded museums which hold vessels of historic significance in their collection. However, through the activities of the Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships, the Government aim to deliver a policy which enables the identification of priorities for the preservation of historic vessels; ensures that guidance on preservation and recording strategies is widely available; and promotes public interest in ships, and their educational value. The committee will therefore advise the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on national historic ship preservation and funding priorities. It will also provide leadership and strategic vision across the national historic ships community and wider maritime sector by acting as a focus for advice on aspects of preservation, helping both public and private owners achieve a sustainable future for their historic vessels. The committee is currently consulting on its document 'Understanding Historic Vessels', which is a first step in establishing criteria through which historic ships can be properly recorded, understood and, wherever possible, preserved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.8/3">Capital funding for historic ship projects will continue to be dealt with by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and other public and private grant-giving bodies. However, the committee will act as a source of advice to the HLF on preservation priorities and individual applications it receives to fund historic ships, and to other public funding bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.8/4">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has provided funding for the running costs of the committee from 2005-06 to 2007-08, and in 2006-08 there is allowance for a revenue challenge fund of &pound;80,000 per annum to support activities relating to the preservation of historic vessels.</p>

This exceeded the target of 75 per cent. for 2006 and demonstrates a considerable increase from the estimated 25 per cent. in 2002. This target will rise to 85 per cent. by 2008.

	<p pid="b.1606W.0/1">The National School Sport Strategy is creating equal opportunities in which all young people can participate in high quality PE and school sport by responding to the diverse learning needs, capabilities and preferences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1606W.0/2">An analysis of the School Sport Survey 2005-06 shows that 82 per cent. of all pupils in special schools, which are schools provided by local authorities for certain children with special educational needs are now receiving two hours high quality PE and sport per week. This is above the national average of 80 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1606W.0/3">All schools are now in one of the 450 School Sport Partnerships. There are 11 special schools which are Specialist Sports Colleges and eight of these act as hub sites for their School Sport Partnership. These schools are leading the way on curriculum development, teaching and learning as well as ensuring this expertise is shared. In addition, there are 110 School Sport Co-ordinators based within these special schools and their role is to support networks of other special schools and advise mainstream schools on developing high quality opportunities beyond the curriculum time and links to community activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1606W.0/4">A national working group comprising the Youth Sport Trust, Sport England, UK Sport and the British Paralympic Association have been working in partnership to create a playground to podium framework. The framework combines the expertise and functions of these four agencies along with Governing Bodies of Sport, Disability Sport Organisations, School Sport and County Sport Partnerships to ensure England is able to identify and support talent leading to the 2012 Paralympic Games. The framework is due to be released in February 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1606W.0/5">In addition, the Government have also funded the development of the new Paralympic Education Resource &quot;Ability vs Ability&quot; which is a web-based cross-curricular resource developed by the BPA and the NASUWT. The project aims to raise awareness of disability, disability sport and the Paralympic movement through education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1606W.0/6">The inaugural UK School Games was held in Glasgow in September 2006. The UKSG will be held annually to 2011 providing opportunities for talented young athletes to showcase their skills as well as giving them the experience of competing in a multi-sport event. The 2006 event featured two disability sports&mdash;swimming and athletics&mdash;and provision for disability sports will increase in future years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1606W.0/7">There are also a number of specific schemes aimed at supporting talented disabled athletes which will contribute towards our target to be first in the Paralympic medal table in 2012. The Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS) enables talented athletes to continue in their sport beyond the age of 16 while pursuing further or higher education. TASS 2012, a strand of the TASS programme, supports our most talented 12 to 18-year-olds in a variety of Olympic, Paralympic, non-Olympic and non-Paralympic sports. Between 2004 and 2008, Government will have committed &pound;17 million to TASS and TASS 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.1611W.3/1">Yes. A key element of the Government's strategy to increase race equality and community cohesion is 'development of strong and positive relationships between people from different backgrounds and circumstances in the workplace, in schools and within neighbourhoods'. Ability to understand and converse in a common language is essential for all members of society, increasing educational outcomes and employment prospects and the ease with which people can carry out their day-to-day life.</p>
	<p pid="b.1611W.3/2">The Government actively promote language proficiency in programmes of the Department for Education and Skills and Home Office. For example, since 2001 we have invested over &pound;1 billion in English for speakers of other languages (ESOL); over 1.8 million ESOL learning opportunities have been taken up and over 160,000 learners have achieved a first Skills for Life ESOL qualification. Also, prospective British citizens are required to show a specified level of language competence (as well as knowledge of life in the UK); it was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December</phrase> that from <phrase class="date" code="">2 April 2007</phrase> this will be extended to those seeking permanent settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1613W.11/1">The development of the national occupational standard for domestic energy assessors (DBAs) has involved extensive consultation with industry, where all stakeholders have had the opportunity to comment on the content of the standard. It is now for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to ensure that the right balance has been struck before granting approval.</p>

	<p pid="b.1614W.2/1">Fire and rescue services record details of incidents attended on the Department's FDRl and FDR3 returns. The data from these returns are the basis for the fire incident National Statistics collection which covers fires and false alarms attended by fire and rescue services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/2">Information on response times is collected on the FDR1 return, which covers primary fires attended by fire and rescue services. A primary fire covers fires in buildings, vehicles and outdoor structures; or any fire involving casualties, rescues; or fires attended by five or more appliances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/3">For primary fires, fire and rescue services report three response times:</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/4" class="indent">Time of first call to brigade&mdash;defined as 'the time that the first call to the fire was received by fire control'</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/5" class="indent">Time mobilised&mdash;defined as 'the time when the [fire control] operator finished transmitting the mobilising message (pressed 'send' button)'</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/6" class="indent">Time of arrival at fire&mdash;defined as 'the time when the first appliance arrived at the fire ground'</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/7">Times are recorded in hours and minutes, for example, 3.45.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/8">At present, response times are not collected centrally for other incidents attended by fire and rescue services. These other incidents comprise false alarms, secondary fires and non fire incidents such as road traffic collisions. However, a new electronic incident recording system (IRS) which is currently being piloted in 9 fire and rescue areas will collect response times for these types of incident in future.</p>

However before doing so we will have to be fully satisfied that necessary protections will be maintained or enhanced by the change. Decisions about replacement of the 1989 regulations will therefore be taken in the light of <i> (a)</i> evidence gathered during a period of parallel running of the regulations and the regime applied by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005; and <i> (b)</i> discussion and consultation with stakeholders through a small working group.</p>

	<p pid="b.1630W.5/2">The Thames Gateway Interim Plan, published last month, was the product of a collaboration between my Department and the Thames Gateway Strategic Partnership (TGSP), on which local delivery vehicles (LDVs) sit. LDVs are charged with representing local views, including those of PCTs. In addition, the boards of the LDVs often include members of the LSP or local PCT, as in Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation and Bexley Regeneration Partnership, Invest Bexley.</p>
	<p pid="b.1630W.5/3">The TGIP also notes that Communities and Local Government funded a project undertaken for the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham by the NHS Healthy Urban Development Unit to develop a way of modelling the impact of population growth on the need for services. PCT colleagues from the Barking and Dagenham PCT and the Director of Regeneration for the North-East London Strategic Health Authority, managed the project and met members of my Department on several occasions to discuss progress and how the findings of the project could best be used. The model that has been developed could be used by other authorities across the Gateway to help them plan healthcare and other services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1644W.5/1">Local authorities with ALMOs that have achieved a rating of two stars or better from the Audit Commission receive funding in the form of supported borrowing, the agreed total of which is taken into account in the calculation of the Housing Revenue Account subsidy. Table 1 gives the annual supported borrowing for each LA with respect of its ALMO. The number of homes is those recorded at the point management responsibility transferred to the ALMO.</p>
	<p pid="b.1644W.5/2">The PFI subsidy payments are used by the LAs along with other resources to meet the Unitary Charge that is charged annually by the PFI contractor. PFI subsidy payments are calculated from the level of PFI credits that have been awarded for the scheme. The annual subsidy payments are set out in table 2 . The number of homes for the Housing Revenue Account schemes is the reduction in the number of non-decent homes once the construction and refurbishment phase of the contract is complete. The number of homes for the General Fund schemes is the number of additional social rented homes that will be constructed under the contract.</p>

	<p pid="b.1648W.5/2" class="indent">Rents change in line with rent restructuring policy such that, by 2011-12, individual property rents approaches their formula rents. This is subject to constraints such as caps on individual property formula rents and limits on the annual change in individual actual rents.

	<p pid="b.1651W.0/1">The recommendations in the Preventing Extremism Together report were suggestions presented to Government from the community-led working groups set up after the London bombings. They were practical actions for both the Government and Muslim communities and organisations to consider and implement where appropriate. Progress on delivering the recommendations has been good with 49 of the 64 either completed or in progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/2">With regard to the specific PET recommendations included in your questions:</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/3" class="italic"> Muslim women</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/4" class="indent">While no specific work has started as a direct result of the suggestion of a national campaign and coalition (recommendation 27), the Government's work to engage with Muslim communities in part focuses on increasing the visibility of Muslim women and empowering them to become informed and active citizens within society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/5" class="indent">A specific focus of the Faith Communities Capacity Building Fund is to support projects which develop the skills and capacity of Muslim women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/6" class="indent">The recommendation for the creation of a manifesto for Muslim women is one for communities to lead on.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/7" class="italic"> Muslim Youth Handbook</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/8" class="indent">The handbook has not yet been produced; we are currently actively seeking community partners to develop this recommendation further.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/9" class="italic"> Citizen's Rights and Responsibilities pocket guide</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/10" class="indent">We are currently in discussions with partners who are keen to take this forward, at this time no funding has been awarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/11" class="italic"> Research (Recommendation 64)</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.0/12" class="indent">While there has been no specific research commissioned as a direct result of the PET recommendations, we continue to broaden our knowledge base through ongoing stakeholder engagement work and existing surveys such as the Citizenship Survey, which is the most substantial research of its kind.</p>

All sexual offences where it is possible to determine from the wording of the statute that the victim was a child have been included and cover offences of buggery, indecent assault, sexual assault, unlawful sexual intercourse, indecency, rape, sexual activity, incest, familial sexual offences, procuration, exploitation of prostitution, abduction, abuse of children through prostitution and pornography, abuse of trust and gross indecency.</p>

But faith monitoring (ie the regular gathering of administrative data on faith) would be a significant step, for which we do not accept that there is currently a need.

A confiscation order can then be made by the court as part of the sentencing process. The money laundering provisions in the Act include the offences of concealing, acquisition, use and possession of property that a person knows or suspects constitutes benefit from any criminal conduct. If an individual is living beyond their identifiable means a money laundering investigation could commence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1670W.5/3">The initial payment rate for PNDs was 53 per cent. in 2005; an increase of 1 per cent. on 2004. (Only 1 per cent. requested a court hearing.) 42 per cent. of PND recipients had a fine of one and a half times the penalty registered against them as they failed to pay the penalty or request a court hearing within the 21 day suspended enforcement period. Once registered, these fines fall into the HMCS fine enforcement and collection systems. The courts are currently claiming an overall payment rate for fines of 95 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1674W.8/1">Once authorised to use less lethal weapons, it is for the individual officer to ensure they act within the law. Under section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, the use of force for the prevention of crime and apprehension of offenders and those unlawfully at large (both by the police and the public) must be 'reasonable' in all circumstances. It may be for a court to decide whether the officer's behaviour was reasonable. Common law also recognises that the use of force may be lawful if it is necessary for example in self defence or defence of another.</p>

This includes processing intelligence on staff corruption in the Prison Service. However, when complaints are received they are passed to the appropriate line management for action. During the past 18 months no complaints have been received about Pentonville prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.1684W.8/1">The advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing the functions of the probation service were assessed in the light of experience gained following the contracting out of areas of activity on the custodial side on the National Offender Management Service. Estimated efficiency savings were modelled in the range of 3.5 per cent. to 8.5 per cent., in line with the savings delivered after those earlier contracting out exercises. The financial disadvantages of outsourcing, arising from additional tendering and contract management costs, were outweighed by the estimated savings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1685W.3/2">The Director of Commissioning regularly reviews the performance and effectiveness of all the NOMS commissioners, including the Director of Offender Management, Wales. The effectiveness of what commissioners can achieve in relation to probation performance is limited until legislation is in place that will enable commissioners to contract with other providers where underperformance is not addressed sufficiently by a current provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.1685W.3/3">The reviews of commissioner effectiveness include specific attention to probation area performance, and the degree to which probation areas are delivering the SLA requirements. Commissioning remains under development in NOMS and commissioners have, to date, had limited scope to re-specify services to align them more closely to identified needs. In parallel with commissioners reviewing performance against the SLAs the National Probation Directorate (NPD) continues to have a line management function of probation Chief Officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1685W.3/4">The NPD publishes quarterly performance reports, many elements of which are also addressed in the SLAs between probation areas and commissioners. The most recent report includes positive commentary from the National Probation Director reinforcing the longer term trend of overall probation performance improvement nationally. The report includes a 'weighted score car', and a 'zero line' above which probation areas are generally meeting expectations, and below which they are not. For Wales the current position is that three areas are above the 'zero line' and one, North Wales, is not.</p>

	<p pid="b.1689W.3/1">Since 2004, &pound;7.8 million has been allocated to the 60 'Together' Trailblazer and Action Areas to use as an extra front line resource to tackle antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.3/2">This is in addition to the &pound;25,000 per annum which has been provided to every Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership in England and Wales for an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator to prioritise and drive forward action on local issues.</p>

We welcome the National Audit Office's conclusions that our twin track approach of support and sanction is effective. The findings show that the majority of people surveyed who have received an antisocial behaviour intervention have not re-engaged in antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.3/4">The effectiveness of action in Trailblazer and Action Areas has also been identified through the British Crime Survey (2002-03 and 2004-05) which shows that between 2002 and 2005, the percentage of people perceiving there to be high levels of antisocial behaviour in their area fell at a greater rate in Trailblazer and Action Areas (from 25 per cent. to 19 per cent.) than in other areas (from 19 per cent. to 16 per cent.) over the same period. Similarly, the Recorded Crime Statistics for 2003-04 and 2004-05 also show that the fall in antisocial behaviour-related forms of criminal damage in the 60 areas, for example graffiti, was above the national average.</p>

Thanks to the efforts of the staff in the screening programme, these targets have now been achieved in all local breast screening units. The expansion is already showing an effect, with nearly 12,000 cancers diagnosed by the programme in 2004-05, an increase of 40 per cent. on 2001 when the expansion began.</p>
	<p pid="b.1695W.2/4">However, the changes together represent a 40 per cent. increase in the workload of the programme.

	<p pid="b.1698W.12/1">Measurements have consistently shown that radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field exposures surrounding mobile phone masts (base stations) are very much lower than the international guidelines (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/">www.hpa.org.uk/</a> radiation). The guidelines are based on a thorough review of published scientific literature. They apply to mobile phone masts, other communications masts and all exposures to electromagnetic fields irrespective of their source. The expert authorities keep the guidelines continually under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1698W.12/2">Nevertheless, in response to continued concern, the mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has supported a number of studies investigating the potential health effects of (RF) mobile phone technology below the guideline levels. Most of the studies relate to mobile phone exposures which are considerably higher than base station exposures albeit still below the guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1698W.12/3">Individual studies under the MTHR programme relating directly to base stations include a study of cancer incidence in early childhood near mobile phone base stations being carried out at Imperial College London and a study of symptoms associated with RF electromagnetic field exposure being carried out at the University of Essex. A description of all the individual studies in the MTHR programme can be found on its website:</p>
	<p pid="b.1698W.12/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1698W.12/5">Research on the potential health effects from mobile phone technology is evaluated periodically by the Health Protection Agency's Radiation Protection Division. The report entitled &quot;Mobile Phones and Health 2004&quot;, available on the HPA website (<a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a>), noted that there are continuing concerns about the impact of base stations on health and well-being &quot;despite the current evidence which shows that exposures of individuals are likely to be only a small fraction of those from phones&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1704W.2/1">It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to review with dentists the potential factors affecting levels of patient charge income. It is not possible to assess at national level the precise relative importance of different factors. However, relevant factors may include the annual number of units of dental activity commissioned by PCTs, the time needed for new dental services to be commissioned and come into operation, the timeliness of the reports submitted by dentists on completed courses of treatment, changes in the mix of charge-paying and charge exempt patients treated, and the incidence of certain charge-free courses of treatment for patients who would normally pay charges. Variations in these and other factors may either reduce or increase the income from patient charges from one year to the next.</p>
	<p pid="b.1704W.2/2">Any action taken by PCTs and dentists will depend on the nature of the factors relevant at local level. Action might, however, include improving the timeliness of reporting, reviewing practice protocols for accepting new patients, and discussing with providers the reasons for higher than expected levels of charge-free treatments.</p>

	<p pid="b.1709W.8/1">There are no data collected nationally on deaths from suspected stroke or myocardial infarction as a result of ambulance response times in excess of 10 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1709W.8/2">999 ambulance calls are prioritised based on information obtained from the caller. The national response time requirement for calls classified as category A (immediately life-threatening) is that 75 per cent. of patients should receive an emergency response within eight minutes. In 2005-06 over 1.2 million category A calls received a response within the eight-minute standard. For stroke the emphasis on a rapid response, where there are no life threatening signs and symptoms, is to facilitate immediate scanning and thrombolysis for suitable patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.1713W.2/1">The Department is working in collaboration with charities and others with an interest in raising public awareness of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote key messages about when to seek help throughout Lung Cancer Awareness Month November, and will be reviewing the impact of the various events early in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1713W.2/2">For other cancers, the Department has collaborated with the Prostate Cancer Charter for Action to fund a pilot public awareness programme on the prostate and its function, which took place in October and is now being independently evaluated. The Department also funds a small number of voluntary sector organisations to test out approaches to raising awareness in hard to reach groups. Pilot work has been undertaken in 2005-06 to raise awareness of mouth cancer, in a project with Cancer Research UK. Further pilot work is also planned with the Improvement Foundation's healthy communities collaborative, raising awareness of breast, bowel and lung cancers in deprived communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1720W.5/2">The new cancer reform strategy will build on the progress of the national health service cancer plan published in 2000 by spreading best practice and recommending what more needs to be done by cancer networks and the NHS to improve clinical outcomes, drive up quality and increase value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.5/3">The new strategy will recognise the new challenges and opportunities facing cancer; the number of new cases is rising, as are patients' expectations.

It will focus on reform rather than spending commitments&mdash;giving patients more choice, strengthening commissioning and making the new NHS levers work for cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.5/4">The National Director for Cancer, Professor Mike Richards has been tasked with taking forward the strategy. He will work with doctors, nurses, cancer charities and all those with an interest in cancer to develop a strategy that fits the needs of tomorrow's cancer services.</p>

It is for primary care trusts and other national health service organisations to ensure that the services they provide meet the needs of the populations that they serve including the provision of interpreting services if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1725W.3/1">The Government's aim in promoting direct payments is to increase individuals' independence and choice by giving them control over the way the services they are assessed as needing are delivered. The person uses the payment to secure for him or herself the relevant services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1725W.3/2">If there is a local register of approved providers of services, the council could bring the register to the attention of the individual. However, councils should not require the individual only to contract with providers from the register.</p>
	<p pid="b.1725W.3/3">As a general principle, local councils should aim to leave choice in the hands of the individual by allowing people to address their own needs as they consider best. Councils will want to satisfy themselves that the agreed outcomes are being achieved.</p>
