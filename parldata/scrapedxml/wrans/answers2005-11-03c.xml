	<p pid="c.1237W.3/2">It is the Government's position that responsible creditors who are owed money and having gained valid judgments through the courts should have the right to enforce that judgment by the most appropriate means available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1237W.3/3">Such action is balanced by proposals to enhance consumer protections, including proposed tightening of the licensing procedure through the Consumer Credit Bill to tackle unscrupulous lenders at source, appropriate limits to the application of charging orders, and action to ensure greater use of time order&quot; provisions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1241W.9/1">Female-held FTSE 100 directorships have risen from 5.8 per cent. in 2000 to nearly 10 per cent. in 2004. The Cabinet Minister for Women will later this month be launching the 2005 Female FTSE Report produced by Cranfield university to see what further progress has been made. However, in 2004 17 per cent. of new FTSE 100 board appointments have been women, up from 13 per cent. in 2003 and 10.5 per cent. in 2002. The total number of female directorships in the FTSE 100 was 110, up from 101 the previous year. The number of boards with more than one female member has risen from 22 to 29 in 2004. It is disappointing to note that 31 of the FTSE 100 companies are run by men-only boards. Of the new women appointed in 2004, 33 per cent. already had FTSE experience and incoming non-executive directors are also far more likely than the directors they replace to have public or voluntary sector experience.</p>

I have placed a copy of the letter in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mr. Gareth Thomas to Mr. Alex Salmond, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-29">29 September 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/3" class="indent">Thank you for your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-29">29 July</phrase> to the Prime Minister enclosing a postcard from your constituent about Tearfund's HIV/AIDS and Children&quot; campaign. I am responding as the Minister who leads on the issues raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/4" class="indent">It is a terrible human catastrophe and presents an unprecedented challenge to the developing world and to the eradication of poverty. The cost in terms of human life and economic burden on national governments, communities and families is enormous. Women and young people, including the rising number of orphans are particularly vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/5" class="indent">The Government is taking action. Last year we published Taking Action&mdash;the UK's strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world&quot;, and committed at least &pound;1.5 billion to tackling HIV and AIDS over the next three years. Of this, at least &pound;150 million will go into supporting orphans and children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS. The UK was one of the first countries to endorse UNICEF's Strategic Framework for the Protection, Care and Support of Orphans and Children Made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/6" class="indent">DFID is working directly with national governments to support the development and implementation of national programmes for the support and care of children affected. In Mozambique we have given funding to help the Government properly track its programmes for orphans and vulnerable children to ensure that aid reaches the children that need it most. In Kenya we are directly supporting community based organisations to help them deliver home based care services, including to children affected by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/7" class="indent">We are investigating the best ways to build systems that provide support to vulnerable children and their families, possibly in the form of monthly child or family allowances. This will simplify the tracking of funds from government budgets to the poorest families. The cash received through these transfers enables families and communities to make their own decisions about the best way to improve their livelihoods and care for their children. Another important area in which we are investing is the health of children living with HIV. For example we have supported trials of a cheap and widely available drug (co-trimoxazole) which have shown that it can halve the death rate for HIV infected children in Africa. We are also supporting a new research programme to assess how to provide antiretroviral treatment for children in resource-constrained settings</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/8" class="indent">Monitoring development expenditure by category, as your campaign highlights, is an area where all of us, the international community, donor organisations and national governments can all do better. DFID has recently introduced a new system to enable us to better monitor our support for orphans and vulnerable children, Activities which will be recorded include special programmes for children made vulnerable by AIDS, cash transfers to vulnerable families, exemption from school fees and help with food.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/9" class="indent">DFID also believes that monitoring and evaluation are crucial with regards to other financing instruments such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). DFID has funded work specifically to develop the Global Fund's capacity for monitoring and evaluation. We believe that progress is being made, but there is more to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/10" class="indent">We are delighted to be co-hosting with UNICEF, later this year, the Global Partnership Forum on children affected by AIDS. We anticipate that this Forum will examine how funding can better reach community based organisations. Bottlenecks that prevent funding getting to those most in need must be identified and unlocked We see this as a crucial part of the wider efforts at Making the Money Work&quot;&mdash;a process being led by UNAIDS to ensure greater harmonisation and co-ordination alongside the additional resources now being made available to tackle HIV and AIDS The steps we are taking are a start, but there is much still for all of us to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.3/11" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.1250W.2/1">The Home Office currently assesses violence against children aged under 16 through the Offending, Crime and Justice Survey part of which measures victimisation of children aged 10 to 15, including assaults with and without injury. The results on victimisation from the 2003 survey have been published (see findings 246) and data will also be available from further sweeps of the survey in 2004, 2005 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) measures levels of violence against adults (ages 16 and over) living in private households, and as part of its core measures includes domestic violence. Risks of domestic violence are published annually by age group for men and women, including ages 45&ndash;64, 65&ndash;74 and 75 and over. The British Crime Survey is conducted on a continuous basis, having used the same essential methodology since it began in 1982 to ensure comparability over time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/3">However, it is recognised that the core BCS measure of domestic violence is likely to be an underestimate as some victims may be unwilling to report experience of domestic violence to an interviewer. The special self-completion module on interpersonal violence (which measures domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking) is not asked of respondents aged 60 and over. The issue of elder abuse&quot; in common with child abuse is better explored using dedicated surveys.</p>

Training requirements for staff are subject to in house&quot; arrangements at the NSPCC and would not fall under the jurisdiction of the DfES. However, there is an expectation that the NSPCC, along with other organisations involved in child protection would follow Government guidance such as Working Together To Safeguard Children&quot; (1999) and Complex Child Abuse Investigations: Inter-Agency Issues&quot; (2002). Local authorities purchasing work from the NSPCC would also need to quality assure that work.</p>

My Department does work with the police service to reduce the bureaucratic burden and we are making good progress by, for example, cutting nearly 9,000 unnecessary forms; civilianising posts; rolling out the penalty notice for disorder scheme; and ensuring forces have the best scientific and technological support&mdash;like video identity parades, electronic fingerprinting and the online Violent and Sex Offender's Register&mdash;so that our police spend more time actually in communities, tackling crime and antisocial behaviour and reassuring the public. The Frontline Policing Measure shows that in 2004&ndash;05 Thames Valley police officers spent an average of 69.3 per cent. of their time on frontline duties compared with the national average of 64.1 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1255W.0/3">The Government are committed to publish data from the Worker Registration Scheme (WRS) on a quarterly basis.

The next monitoring report will be published at the end of November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.0/4">The report states that in total, there were 232,000 applicants to the WRS between <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase> of whom up to 30 per cent. may have already been in the UK before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. 220,000 of these applicants were issued with Worker Registration certificates and cards.</p>

	<p pid="c.1255W.0/7">Most non-EEA nationals coming to the UK for skilled employment require a work permit. Work permits can be issued in any sector, as long as the relevant requirements are met. They are issued for the duration of the post on offer, up to a maximum of five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.0/8">The employer applies to Work Permits (UK) for the work permit on behalf of the migrant. They must show that all the relevant criteria are met.

Work permits can be issued for vacancies in any sector but are not issued to employment agencies.</p>

The previous licensing arrangements required by the Employment Agencies Act 1973 were found not to provide an effective control and were repealed in 1995. Only a small percentage of new applicants or licence renewals were rejected and EAS inspectors found breaches of the legislation among those with licences. When the previous licensing arrangements were repealed they were replaced by new powers, which allow the DTI's Employment Agency Standards (EAS) Inspectorate to apply to an employment tribunal to prohibit unsuitable persons from running employment agencies and employment businesses, for periods of up to 10 years. In addition, the EAS Inspectorate can prosecute an agency in a magistrates court, where the court can impose a maximum fine of &pound;5,000 for each offence.</p>

	<p pid="c.1272W.11/1">The H5N1 virus is one of the A series of influenza viruses (the other series are B and C). The H5N1 avian influenza virus is categorised as a notifiable avian influenza virus (as are all Al viruses which are H5 or H7). The epidemiological characteristics of any H5 virus depend on to what degree they have become adapted to cause overt disease in the animal which they infect. The most recent outbreaks of H5N1 (particularly in Asia) have been categorised as being caused by a highly pathogenic strain (HPAI) of H5N1, causing high levels of mortality in domestic poultry.</p>

	<p pid="c.1273W.2/1">There are a number of distinct steps in the overall process in testing samples with a view to identifying whether avian influenza viruses of any type are present. These include growth on eggs, injection into a group of 4&ndash;8 week old chickens, and genetic sequencing techniques. This is a largely linear process, which limits the opportunities for decreasing the overall testing speed. Nevertheless, discussions have been held with the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to investigate possibilities for minimising any significant delays.</p>

	<p pid="c.1274W.8/1">It is too early to make an accurate assessment of the impact of the new right of access under the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act 2000 but monitoring procedures have been put in place. The Countryside Agency will carry out an initial four-year monitoring programme measuring both the impacts and the outputs of the new right across a range of key areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/2">One of the key areas of open access monitoring will look specifically at those who own and manage access land, through a land manager survey.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/3">The survey will be carried out across a sample of land owners and managers across all mapping areas in order to track awareness and understanding of the CROW Act. Importantly, the survey will also address land owners' and managers' experience of the new right of access and will track both attitudes and perceptions of how the Act is working on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/4">Our preliminary view is that measures, guidance and funding are in place to ensure that generally access will not have a significant impact on farmers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/5">Where land is subject to the new right, the CROW Act strikes a careful balance between delivering more and better access, and respecting other interests in the countryside. The new right is subject to restrictions to take account of legitimate interests, including the need to ensure effective management of land and livestock. Landowners and agricultural tenants have the discretion to exclude or restrict the new right for up to 28-days each year, for any reason. They may also apply for restrictions or closures where necessary for land management, safety or fire prevention purposes. In addition, we have established a national access management grant scheme to help local authorities, land managers and communities manage open access in their areas proactively. Funding is available for a rapid response service to help access authorities respond quickly&mdash;within 72 hours&mdash;to unforeseen on-site management issues raised by land managers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/6">Overall, we hope the new right of access will provide opportunities for land managers to diversify their farming practices to take advantage of new visitors and to promote their local produce to a new market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/7">Part II of the CROW Act makes a statutory obligation for local authorities to produce rights of way improvement plans. A key aspect of both developing and implementing the plans is to work with landowners and other partners to identify and agree new routes that will improve the network and provide opportunities for diversification of farming activities e.g. horse riding and recreational cycling. The majority of the other provisions in Part II of the Act are aimed at better delivery of existing goals for the rights of way network under current legislation and place few new burdens on farmers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/8">In respect of Part III of the Act concerning sites of special scientific interest, the regulatory impact assessment prepared at the time the Bill was introduced to Parliament considered the likely effects of the proposals on owners and occupiers of SSSIs, of which farmers are one group. No further assessment of the impact of the SSSI provisions in the Act has been made. However the entire SSSI regime as enhanced by the CROW Act provisions has been challenged and found to be compatible with the human rights of owners and occupiers of SSSIs by the court of first instance and the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.8/9">We do not think any of the other provisions of the CROW Act will have a significant impact on farmers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1276W.5/1">Defra has overall policy responsibility for flood risk management in England and provides funding to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities, in this case the Environment Agency. The works programme to manage risk is driven by the operating authorities; Defra does not build defences, nor direct the authorities on what specific works to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="c.1276W.5/2">Powers to undertake flood defence works are established in the Land Drainage Act 1991 and Water Resources Act 1991. These powers are permissive. Neither Act confers a responsibility on either Defra or the Agency to compel British Waterways to undertake flood protection work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1276W.5/3">I understand that the embankment of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal protects the residents of Frampton-on-Severn against flooding from the Severn Estuary. The Environment Agency considers the condition of the embankment to be of a sufficient standard to provide the requisite protection. Maintenance will be required over time and the agency and British Waterways have agreed to work together to ensure this is done. As a last resort, the agency would have the legal powers to carry out necessary maintenance work itself to ensure continued protection against flooding from the estuary but it is highly unlikely these powers will be required.</p>

	<p pid="c.1292W.2/1">DFID recognises that social transfers could have an important role to play in reducing chronic poverty in very poor countries. DFID has recently published a paper entitled: Social transfers and chronic poverty: emerging evidence and the challenge ahead.&quot; The paper describes how social transfers have helped tackle poverty in many better off developing countries and suggests that they may have a similar impact in very poor countries. It recognises that there are significant challenges to implementing social transfer programmes in countries with weak institutional capacity but suggests that these are not insurmountable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.2/2">DFID is working with a number of governments in very poor countries to develop a better understanding of the potential role that social transfers could play in tackling chronic poverty. A number of specific social transfer programmes are already under design or are being implemented. DFID has committed &pound;70 million over three years to support a safety net programme for five million chronically poor people in Ethiopia that provides both work programmes and social transfers. We are also supporting social transfer pilot programmes in Zambia and Kenya and our Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction programme in Bangladesh provides social transfers to very poor women.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.2/3">DFID is committed to continuing to collect evidence on the effectiveness of social transfers. For example, the department will provide further funding of up to &pound;7.5 million over five years to the Chronic Poverty Research Centre (CPRC), a research consortium with members in the UK, Africa and South Asia. A key element of CPRC's work will be to examine further how social protection, including social transfers, can help tackle chronic poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.2/4">Chronic poverty, of course, needs to be tackled by a range of policy responses, not just social transfers. For example, DFID is working to strengthen health and education services for the chronically poor, as well as increasing their opportunities to participate in economic growth and be more included within national political processes.</p>

	<p pid="c.1292W.5/1">Many of the Commission for Africa's recommendations have been picked up in the commitments made by the G8 at Gleneagles and by the UN at the Millennium Review Summit. The UK Government have regular meetings at ministerial level to monitor implementation. At the international level, the Africa Partnership Forum will be tracking delivery on the basis of a Joint Action Plan now being prepared, which will bring together the commitments of Africa and its development partners for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/2">Important progress has already been made on many of the Commission's recommendations. For example:</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/3" class="indent">G8 and EU countries have made commitments that will result in an additional US$25 billion in aid for Africa by 2010. 15 EU member states have set at deadline of 2015 to reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent. of national income provided as aid. The US$4 billion International Financing Facility for Immunisation was launched in September, with support from the UK, France, Sweden and Italy, which could save five million lives by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/4" class="indent">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank's shareholders have agreed to provide 100 per cent. debt cancellation for eligible Highly Indebted Poor Countries, worth US$55 billion and Nigeria the single largest debt cancellation for an African country (worth US$30 billion).</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/5" class="indent">Specific targets and a monitoring process have been agreed to improve the effectiveness of aid on the basis of the Paris Declaration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/6" class="indent">The UN has agreed the principle of Responsibility to Protect, along with the establishment of the Peace Building Commission and the Human Rights Council. The Central Emergency Revolving Fund has been strengthened to enable funding to be targeted to the places in most need; six countries including the UK have committed US$150 million between them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/7" class="indent">African Ministers have agreed a five-year Consolidated Plan of Action for Science and Technology; we are now discussing funding options.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/8" class="indent">US$3.7 billion has been pledged for the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for 2006&ndash;07. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AID (UNAIDS) has started work on a plan to deliver on the G8 and UN commitment to as close as possible, to universal access to AIDS treatment by 2010. The Commission for Africa recommended further investment in health related research, and the UK recently announced funding of &pound;2 million a year over the next five years, for research into anti-malarial drugs via the Medicines for Malaria Venture.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/9" class="indent">The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa has been launched (on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October</phrase>) to overcome obstacles in the sector and to help identify finance for programmes identified as priorities by Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.1292W.5/10" class="indent">On trade, there has been increased international support for the aid for trade initiative endorsed at Gleneagles, including commitments by the EU to increase their support for trade related capacity building. We continue to press for further progress with this and other trade-related areas in the run up to Hong Kong.</p>

	<p pid="c.1294W.5/1">DFID is committed to meeting the Energy White paper target for central Government estates of reducing absolute carbon from fuel and energy efficiency used in buildings in their estate by 12.5 per cent. by 2010&ndash;11, relative to 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1294W.5/2">The recent refurbishments of our UK offices has given us the opportunity to improve significantly the energy efficiency of our buildings. For instance, DFID has installed Building Management Systems which allow us to monitor and manage energy usage to a much greater extent than in the past. DFID has also installed energy efficient heating systems and also lighting systems that are movement sensitive and take account of natural lighting levels. An Environment Management System (EMS) has been implemented at both main UK offices and we are currently looking at the feasibility of a wind turbine and a combined heat and power plant at the East Kilbride office. The design for refurbishing the East Kilbride office earned an Excellent&quot; and the London office a very good&quot; BREEAM rating (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology).</p>
	<p pid="c.1294W.5/3">DFID actively encourages car sharing schemes and we publish bus/train timetables on our internal website as well as links to external public transport sites. DFID is also part of a carbon offsetting project with three major airlines where air miles are exchanged for earth miles which contribute to carbon offset projects designed to neutralise harmful emissions from air travel. DFID welcomes any support and advice on managing carbon emissions so we will be giving serious consideration to joining up to the Carbon Trust Carbon Management Programme.</p>

DFID was pleased to contribute to the revision of the Code of Practice for the International Recruitment of Healthcare Professionals last year and welcomed the strengthening of the code particularly in relation to the inclusion of the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.1296W.0/2">During my recent trip to Zambia and Malawi with the Minister of State for the DoH, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, we discussed health worker shortages and international recruitment practices with local officials and health workers. We recognised that while the code has had some impact, there is consensus that it can not address the root causes of worker shortages. A number of DFID country offices are working with developing country governments to address their health worker shortages based on locally recommended solutions to build stronger health systems and services. This includes increasing national training capacity while simultaneously making improvements to working terms and conditions which directly affect recruitment, retention and performance of existing workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1296W.0/3">Outside of my visits to Zambia and Malawi, I have not received formal representations from the other groups mentioned in the hon. Member's question. The DoH officials, along with national health service (NHS) employers are taking an active lead in the implementation and monitoring of the code and representations related to the code that have been directly addressed to the them.</p>

DFID funds a major programme of social and scientific research that enables effective solutions involving the full range of appropriate technologies.

	<p pid="c.1297W.8/1">Progress has been made on reconstruction in Iraq in spite of all the challenges. After decades of damage by a repressive regime it will take time to build Iraqi institutions, improve infrastructure and services for the long term, and for the private sector to flourish. Continued violence and sabotage have also inevitably hampered the reconstruction effort. However, there has been continued economic growth; power generation is higher than before the conflict; more Iraqis now have access to drinking water and sewerage systems; thousands of health care and education facilities have been rehabilitated; transport and telecommunication systems are improving and civil society groups and the media are flourishing and finding ways of engaging in the political process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/2">The Iraqi Government is leading on the rebuilding and development of Iraq. New Iraqi led donor co-ordination mechanisms are up and running in Baghdad. Sector working groups in health, education, energy, and rule of law are meeting regularly, led by Iraqi Ministries with support from the UN, the World Bank, and a range of donors. There is now an increasing number of international donors and representatives of the multilateral agencies based in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/3">DFID has so far disbursed more than &pound;290 million on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Iraq since 2003. DFID's programme in 2005&ndash;06 focuses on:</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/4" class="indent">advising the Iraqi Government on macro-economic reform;</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/5" class="indent">building Iraqi Government institutions at the centre of government in Baghdad and in the four southern provinces;</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/6" class="indent">improving power and water services in the south and helping the Iraqi government to develop a long-term power sector strategy;</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/7" class="indent">supporting the development of Iraqi civil society organisations; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/8" class="indent">encouraging broad participation in the political process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/9">DFID also provided &pound;70 million to the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq (IRFFI). The UN and the World Bank manage the IRFFI and continue to carry out a range of programmes in sectors such as health, education, and water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1297W.8/10">The following table outlines some of the major reconstruction achievements.</p>

		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.1297W.8/16"> <td>Economy</td> <td>Rapid recovery with 50 per cent. growth in 2004. Inflation is under control and the new Iraqi Dinar is holding its value against the dollar. DFID support contributed to the Iraqi Government's successful negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2004 and 2005, paving the way for agreement of an 80 per cent. Paris Club debt reduction deal.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1297W.8/17"> <td>Power</td> <td>In spite of regular sabotage and breakdowns of dilapidated infrastructure, power generation has remained above pre-war levels. However, demand has also increased dramatically as a result of economic growth and greater use of electrical goods. DFID has repaired transmission lines securing electricity supplies for 1.5 million residents of Basra; improved distribution to 13 areas of Basra and by summer 2006 will have added or secured 720MW.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1297W.8/18"> <td>Water and sanitation</td> <td>1.25 million more Iraqis have access to drinking water than before the conflict; 9.6 million more have access to a sewerage system. DFID has repaired 4,880 leaks across the four southern governorates; provided technical advice for a major sewage installation in al Amarah, providing up to half the city's population with access to a piped system and replacing open sewage channels; and is currently establishing water towers to improve supplies to 500,000 people in the poorest district of Basra city.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1297W.8/19"> <td>Health</td> <td>The Iraqi Government reports that health care spending is up more than 30 times on the pre-conflict level. Extensive disease control programmes, led by the Iraqi Government and UN agencies, have led to a decline in malaria, polio, measles, and rubella. Over 150 health care facilities have been rehabilitated and several thousand health care professionals have been trained.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1297W.8/20"> <td>Education</td> <td>Over 3,500 schools have been rehabilitated. 69 million textbooks have been delivered to 19,000 schools.More than 30,000 school teachers and administrators trained.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1297W.8/21"> <td>Civil Society</td> <td>2,500 Iraqi NGOs are now registered with the Iraqi Government. Freedom of speech has been established in law and independent media is flourishing. DFID has funded new, independent radio and TV stations in the south, and is supporting grass-roots Iraqi organisations such as women's groups, trade unions, and student organisations.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1299W.2/1">The exact number of IT projects of all sizes developed in DFID since 2001 cannot be determined without incurring a disproportionate cost. Three large current projects have been subject to the Gateway process, two assessed as medium risk and one as low risk. Gateway review reports have been produced for two of these projects and are confidential to the Senior Responsible Owners. Under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000, each request for the release of information contained in a Gateway review is considered on a case-by-case basis. To date, DFID has received no FOI requests relating to Gateway reviews.</p>

	<p pid="c.1302W.3/1">Some 529,000 woman die in pregnancy and childbirth every year, equivalent to one woman every minute. Without considerably more action, target 5 of the millennium development goals (MDGs), to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015, will not be met. Maternal mortality is one of the greatest indicators of the stark inequities between rich and poor. A woman in Sierra Leone, for example, faces a risk of dying each time she gives birth which is 200 times that of a woman in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302W.3/2">Achieving this millennium goal will be difficult, but as outlined in our 2004 strategy for reducing maternal deaths, DFID is committed to a year-on-year increase in our support to improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality. The UK has been recognised for having developed this strategy specific to maternal health (and remains the only bilateral donor to do so). Feedback indicates that the high level of political commitment to reducing maternal deaths by DFID is effectively raising the profile of this important development issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302W.3/3">DFID is supporting work on maternal health through our bilateral country programmes, and assistance to the UN and the World Health Organisation (WHO). In India, where a quarter of all maternal deaths occur, political commitment is growing and DFID supports the national Reproductive and Child Health programme. In Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia, Cambodia, China and Bangladesh, DFID continues to be at the forefront of work to reduce maternal deaths. In Africa, we are working against severe constraints (in part reflecting the impact of HIV and conflict on maternal deaths), to address the lack of human resources and basic health services. As described in the strategy, we ensure focus to the broader reproductive health and rights of women essential to preventing these unnecessary and tragic deaths.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302W.3/4">DFID is also supporting the new global Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, as a catalyst in helping countries harness, for the benefit of women and children, the significant resources committed by the G8 and promised by the EU for poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="c.1303W.2/1">DFID has considered the use of deployable rapid assembly shelters for use following natural disasters.</p>
	<p pid="c.1303W.2/2">In any disaster situation, we consider a number of different factors when assessing what type of shelter is most suitable. These include the needs of the people, the average size of families, issues such as heating arrangements and cooking facilities based on the way the people normally use such items and the relative cost of the different options available. We then make a judgment on what shelter is the most appropriate for any given disaster or situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1303W.2/3">We also consider the availability of transport to move items around the country, to ensure that materials sent to a disaster region are distributed immediately. In addition we must also consider how easy it is to build and maintain the shelters that we do send.</p>
	<p pid="c.1303W.2/4">In the case of the devastation caused by the South Asia earthquake, we believe that winterised family tents are the most cost effective and efficient use of aid resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.1303W.5/1">A key way to ensure moneys are spent as intended is to have an effective, independent and reliable audit system. As the result of the support of a number of donors, the Nicaraguan National Comptroller's Office will soon be able to share its audit of all central Government expenditure (for 2004 expenditure) with donors for the first time. DFID, together with German aid, is providing the support needed also to complete the first audit of all municipal government expenditure (for 2004 and 2005 expenditure) by the third quarter of 2006. Together, these audits will enable donors to compare actual expenditure with planned expenditure for the bulk of activities funded by the Government of Nicaragua, including monies allocated for the Atlantic Coast Region.</p>
	<p pid="c.1303W.5/2">DFID's support for the audit of municipal authorities is part of a recently approved &pound;1.5 million project to strengthen the accountability of municipal governments. The project will also support the ability of private sector organisations and civil society to monitor the performance of municipalities. This will increase the pressure on them to use monies as intended.</p>
	<p pid="c.1303W.5/3">The Nicaraguan Ministry of Finance has recently introduced a financial management system that provides web access to monthly statements of unaudited expenditure by sector, department and institution, this information can be found the web address at: (www.consultaciudadana.gob.ni/cciudadana). The Nicaraguan Ministry of Finance is also able to analyse expenditure by region and intends to make these reports available on the web as well in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="c.1304W.2/1">The Nigerian Government have decided that all of the savings from debt relief will be dedicated to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. For 2006, these savings will be around $1 billion. The Nigerian Government are ensuring that this is spent on poverty reduction through an expenditure tracking system known as a Virtual Poverty Fund&quot;. This will track the flow of funds into spending on sectors such as health, education, water, agriculture, power and roads.</p>
	<p pid="c.1304W.2/2">The President has welcomed international involvement in overseeing expenditure through this mechanism and has set up a high level committee including donors and civil society; the structure should be in place by the end of this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will monitor progress with reform as part of the debt deal. The World Bank will also carry out a public expenditure review next year.</p>

He met with Mr. Dipak Patel, Minister for Commerce, Trade and Industry, who was subsequently appointed by President Mwanawasa to head a ministerial committee on the fuel shortages. The committee is resolving the crisis and developing a medium term strategy to ensure better fuel supplies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306W.5/2">Recent shutdowns at Indeni in Ndola (Zambia's only oil refinery) seriously disrupted supplies of petrol and diesel. There have been long queues at filling stations around the country. Major businesses including the copper mines and commercial agriculture have been affected. Continued fuel shortages will reduce economic growth and increase inflation. Rising transport costs have pushed up other prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306W.5/3">Food prices are of particular concern given the recent drought and there may be a rise in the number of people in need of food aid. DFID is assessing the case for more humanitarian relief over and above recently agreed funding of the World Food Programme and Oxfam in Zambia.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306W.5/4">Last week, most parts of the country had some petrol and diesel due to more refined supplies being brought into the country by tankers. However, the situation is not back to normal. The Indeni refinery is not yet operating effectively. The lack of reserves remains a concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.1306W.5/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-05">5 October 2005</phrase>, the Zambian Government requested support from DFID to advise on options for future petroleum supplies in the country, including a technical and financial review of the Indeni refinery. DFID organised the visit of an expert to Lusaka to discuss these requests with Minster Patel and agree on their scope. DFID will be providing further support in co-operation with other development agencies.</p>

The requirements are designed to ensure that teachers are able to support pupils with SEN and can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of such pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.1307W.3/2">The National Occupational Standards for Teaching/Classroom Assistants also contain elements relevant to working with pupils with SEN or particular educational needs. Similarly, the Standards for Higher Level Teaching Assistants (HLTAs), for which the Training and Development Agency for Schools is responsible, require HLTAs to be familiar with guidance about meeting SEN given in the SEN Code of Practice. The IDA will be reviewing its standards as part of its new responsibilities for the school work force.</p>
	<p pid="c.1307W.3/3">Some social workers also come into contact with autistic children and their families. The new Social Work degree was introduced in 2003 as a three year course to improve the skills base and competence of newly-qualified social workers. For non qualified Social Care staff, the National Minimum Standards, set by the Department of Health, require that 50 per cent. of care staff and 100 per cent. of registered managers achieve an NVQ qualification by 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="c.1307W.3/4">Information as to the specific amount of time allocated by teacher training institutions or schools to training in particular aspects of SEN, such as autism and dyslexia, is not collected centrally by the Department. However, we have pointed to the importance of these areas. The Good Practice Guidance on Autistic Spectrum Disorders, which the Departments for Education and Skills and Health published in 2002, made knowledge and understanding of ASDs the first of its key principles which should underlie provision for children with the disorders. It advised that</p>
	<p pid="c.1307W.3/5" class="indent">all those who plan and provide for children with an ASD should have some knowledge and understanding of autism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1307W.3/6">As regards dyslexia, the Department's Primary National Strategy has produced an extensive range of specific guidance material for schools on evidence-based interventions for children with significant literacy and numeracy difficulties. A three wave model of intervention has been developed, designed to identify and support those children experiencing difficulty in literacy and/or mathematics, a good many of whom are likely to fall somewhere on the dyslexia spectrum.</p>
	<p pid="c.1307W.3/7">We have also produced guidance material on classroom strategies to enable dyslexic pupils to access learning and have recently released a new interactive CD-ROM based in-service training resource, Learning and teaching for dyslexic children&quot;. This has been developed in collaboration with the British Dyslexia Association and the Dyslexia Institute. The resource is designed to help school staff increase their awareness and understanding of the barriers to learning presented by dyslexia, and the teaching strategies that can be used to overcome them.</p>

The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and Department of Health are currently in the process of assessing bids to make permanent arrangements for the temporary allocations, and will make recommendations to the HEFCE Board in January. HEFCE and the Department for Health intend to inform institutions of the Board's decision early in the new year, and will be assessing the need for further expansion in dental places in the lead up to the next Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="c.1311W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October</phrase>, I made an announcement, setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for the coming period. My main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1311W.8/2">In addition, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published Priorities for Success&quot;&mdash;a document that sets out the funding strategy for the next two years in more detail. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1311W.8/3">Although more funding will be going into the sector, we will focus funding even more strongly on key priorities of raising participation and achievement 14&ndash;19 and driving down the skills deficit in the adult work force. This will mean that less provision outside these priority areas can be supported at previous levels, and that there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between government, employers and learners to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1311W.8/4">The Chancellor announced in the 2004 spending review settlement for education and skills in April 2004, that there will be over &pound;1 billion of additional investment in the learning and skills sector by 2007&ndash;08. We will not know what this will mean for regional and local budgets until allocations are made by the National LSC Office, following receipt of the grant letter from my Department.</p>

	<p pid="c.1315W.3/1">The Department for Education and Skills is working with the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Trade and Industry and Her Majesty's Treasury to develop a package of measures that are known collectively as new deal for skills. As announced in Budget 2004, new deal for skills is a package of measures to help people move from welfare into sustainable, productive work and help adults in employment progress from low to higher-skilled work. For those moving from welfare into work, new deal for skills comprises three main strands: Skills coaching, skills passports and the adult learning option and is jointly project managed by DfES and DWP. DfES has made available &pound;4 million in 2005&ndash;06 for the development and trials of skills coaching and skills passports which are being delivered by the Learning and Skills Council to support DWP priority customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1315W.3/2">DfES has been actively involved in the design and development of the DWP-led adult learning option which aims to test the effectiveness of providing financial support to encourage low skilled Jobcentre Plus customers to take full time Level 2 learning where a lack of skills is considered to be the barrier to a return to the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1315W.3/3">In supporting progression for those adults in work, the new national employer training programme (NETP), which will be rolled out from April 2006, will encourage employers to develop people at all levels. Unemployed people who are engaged in the new deal for skills and who join an NETP participating company will be able to draw on the services of a skills coach to help them through their first few months of employment and development.</p>

	<p pid="c.1316W.5/1">A joint survey conducted by DfES, the Confederation of Education and Childrens Service Managers and the Audit Commission, covering local authority school transport policies, expenditure and pupil numbers carried, was published for the first time in January 2004. It reported that about 700,000 pupils received free and assisted home to school transport in England, and that just under 13,500 pupils received free or assisted transport to mainstream schools in Lancashire in 2001/02. No more detailed information is available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1316W.8/1">The action approved for individual schools, over and above the input from local authorities, is set out in the following table. In summary, additional funding has been approved for seven schools to improve capacity; 14 schools have been supported by School Improvement Partnership Boards, also with additional funding; an Interim Executive Board (IEB) has been approved for eight schools; Fresh Start proposals have been approved for three schools; four schools are part of London Challenge initiatives; and proposals have been approved for three schools to become Academies. Proposals for further Academies and another Fresh Start are currently under consideration. The power to close a school under Section 45 of the 2005 Education Act has provided a powerful stimulus to local authorities to take action in anticipation of any use of that power and has not yet been used.</p>

However, we do know that:</p>
	<p pid="c.1321W.5/2" class="indent">The Social Exclusion Unit's report on Teenage Pregnancy (1999) identified ignorance&quot; of sex as a major contributory factor in England's high rate of teenage pregnancy, and argued that improving the quality of SRE should be a key element of the multi-faceted strategy to halve the rate of under-18 conceptions by 2010;</p>

	<p pid="c.1321W.5/4" class="indent">The national evaluation of the first four years of the teenage pregnancy strategy shows that young women receiving the greatest number of SRE lessons and reporting that SRE fully met their needs, are significantly less likely to become pregnant before 18.</p>

	<p pid="c.1322W.2/1">There is a statutory duty on secondary schools to teach key aspects of sex and relationships education (SRE)&mdash;in particular teaching about human reproduction and STIs and HIV&mdash;within the statutory science curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.1322W.2/2">DfES further recommends that schools should teach about sex and relationships within the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), and in 2000 issued non-statutory guidance on SRE to help schools achieve this objective. PSHE aims to give young people the skills and knowledge to avoid a range of negative outcomes, including unplanned pregnancies and STIs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1322W.2/3">DfES is also supporting improved delivery of PSHE by providing continuing professional development (CPD) programmes for teachers and community nurses involved in delivering PSHE; developing guidance for schools to help them better assess what young people are learning in PSHE; and by making it a requirement that schools who achieve healthy school status must have an effective PSHE programme in place.</p>

	<p pid="c.1322W.5/1">Local authorities have important and extensive duties to identify, assess and make provision for children with special educational needs and to keep their arrangements for doing so under review. Schools, early education settings, local authorities and others must have regard to the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, which gives guidance on carrying out their statutory duties under the 1996 Education Act. Decisions about the support to be provided for children in Gravesham are a matter for the Kent local authority, taking account of their statutory duties. The Government have no direct role in this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1322W.5/2">More broadly, the national policy on SEN is set out in the Government's SEN strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, published in February 2004. The strategy sets out a long-term programme to improve SEN provision and to improve outcomes for children and young people with SEN. As part of this strategy, the Department is promoting more consistent practice through a team of national SEN advisers. The advisers are working with all local authorities to provide support and challenge on key SEN issues, including the management of provision for children with special needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1327W.5/2">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) lobbied and argued strongly for a threshold of 30 months, as currently applies in the United Kingdom. The FSA had commissioned an independent risk assessment which concluded that removal of vertebral column at 12 months rather than 30 months would make a negligible difference in diminishing the bovine spongiform encephalopathy risk in the UK. This report was passed to the European Commission as evidence that it would be disproportionate to require removal at 24 months and to other member states as part of the lobbying process. There was insufficient support from other member states for a European Union threshold of 30 months and one of 24 months was adopted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1327W.5/3">Officials in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are currently leading a public consultation on lifting the export ban and harmonising specified risk material controls with those in other member states. A full assessment of the impact of requiring removal of vertebral column from cattle aged 24 to 30 months at slaughter will be completed at the end of the consultation, based on responses received and preliminary economic assessment work currently under way.</p>

	<p pid="c.1333W.6/29">The new system will differ from the current fee per item system, where dentists' remuneration is based on each individual treatment&mdash;a filling, a crown, etc. The evidence of PDS pilots, where remuneration is not based on fee per item, is that dentists provide fewer and simpler interventions within each course of treatment. This allows dentists to spend more time with patients, adopt a more preventive approach to patient care and better manage their work load.</p>

	<p pid="c.1336W.8/2">NHS Employers, on behalf of United Kingdom health Ministers, is currently discussing with the British Medical Association's general practitioners committee revisions to the existing general medical services contract, from April 2006 including changes to the quality and outcomes framework from April 2006. As part of this, an expert panel was engaged by NHS Employers to consider independently the evidence for any new clinical indicator within the quality and outcomes framework. That advice is informing negotiations. An announcement on changes to the current contract that will apply from April 2006 will be made at the end of the negotiating process, and once approved by the respective UK health Ministers. This is intended to be later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1342W.0/16">In the period between entry to medical school and full registration, it is estimated that training a doctor costs between &pound;200,000 and &pound;250,000. Doctors generally continue training after full registration. As the duration and nature of post-registration training varies greatly and as service and training costs are closely related it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost of training.</p>

The pilot will test different ways of setting up this service&mdash;for example with full time IMCA advocates and with sessional advocates. It will test referral systems, systems for recording and systems for monitoring. The outcome will be good practice guidance which will be useful both for the commissioners of this service when it becomes a national requirement and also for the future IMCA advocacy providers, many of whom may be small and will benefit from the good practice guide.</p>

	<p pid="c.1348W.2/1">The 2004 suicide prevention strategy annual report of progress sets out the actions that are underway to reduce the number of suicides in the general population, including older people. Although there are no specific actions targeting people 75-years or over, many of the measures in place will help prevent suicides amongst all age groups. Consequently, it is not possible to specify the amount of funding allocated to the prevention of suicide in older people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1348W.2/2">The our healthier nation target is to reduce the overall death rate from suicide and undetermined injury from a baseline rate of 9.2 deaths per 100,000 population in 1995&ndash;97 to 7.3 deaths per 100,000 population in 2009&ndash;11. The latest available data for the three years 2002&ndash;4 show a rate of 8.6 deaths per 100,000 population; a reduction of 6.6 percent., from the baseline. The latest data for older people, 65 and over, show that this rate has fallen from a baseline rate of 10.0 deaths per 100,000 population to 9.0 deaths, a fall of 9.7 percent., over the period. For the 75 and over age group, the rate has fallen from a baseline rate of 11.5 deaths per 100,000 population to 10.3 deaths, a fall of 11.2 percent., over the period.</p>

	<p pid="c.1351W.9/1">The Cabinet Office competence based recruitment system is designed to identify candidates with the most suitable skills and competences for the job. Candidates are asked, on their application form and at interview to give evidence of their ability to communicate effectively. Candidates are assessed on their ability to communicate effectively both verbally and in writing, and where necessary asked to provide evidence of their numeracy levels. There is also scope, within the selection system, for further testing of candidate's communication and numerical skills through verbal and numerical reasoning tests. Specifically, the Department has used the SHL VCC3 verbal evaluation test and the SHL NCC4 numerical evaluation test.</p>

	<p pid="c.1355W.3/1">The social fund plays an important part in helping people on the lowest incomes avoid the need to resort to high cost lenders. Significant improvements to the social fund budgeting loan scheme are being introduced in April 2006. These changes, which are being supported by an additional &pound;210 million (net) over the three years to 2008&ndash;09, are intended to make loans more accessible and more affordable. The improvements include changes to the way in which existing budgeting loan debt affects an applicant's ability to take out a further loan, lower repayment rates, longer repayment periods and a major simplification of the way that the maximum loan amounts that can be offered to eligible applicants are calculated. The minimum amount an applicant can borrow as a budgeting loan will increase from &pound;30 to &pound;100 and the maximum debt available as a combination of crisis and budgeting loans will increase from &pound;1,000 to &pound;1,500.</p>
	<p pid="c.1355W.3/2">It is important that people on low incomes are not penalised for saving. That is why the changes to the budgeting loan scheme will also include an increase in the capital limits. From April 2006 the amount an applicant can have in savings without it affecting their access to budgeting loans will be doubled to &pound;1,000 for working age applicants and &pound;2,000 for pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1355W.3/3">The aim of future changes will be to ensure that the social fund is not merely a safety net in times of need but will also help people to become self-reliant and able to take control of their spending decisions. We want to ensure that reform will contribute to improving financial inclusion for those on the lowest income.</p>

	<p pid="c.1357W.5/1">Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 sets out the framework for the new scheme funding requirements that will apply to most private sector defined benefit occupational pension schemes and which will replace the current minimum funding requirement. The detail of the requirements will be set out in regulations to be made under part 3 of the Act. I expect these to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1357W.5/2">The new arrangements place the ultimate responsibility for funding decisions with the trustees, acting in partnership with the employer, and taking account of the advice of the scheme actuary. We firmly believe that this responsibility should rest with the trustees, given their fiduciary duty to act in the interests of scheme members.</p>
	<p pid="c.1357W.5/3">We therefore do not consider that it is appropriate for the scheme actuary to continue to set contribution rates in the exceptional circumstances where a scheme's rules currently give the actuary this power, rather than the trustees or the employer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1357W.5/4">In these circumstances, trustees will be required to agree the funding strategy with the employer, having regard to the recommendations of the actuary on certain key matters. In addition, the actuary's certification of the scheme's schedule of contributions must state that the rates shown are not lower than those he or she would have provided for if the actuary, rather than the trustees, had the responsibility for preparing the schedule.</p>

	<p pid="c.1357W.8/1">The information is not available. The Government are currently inviting notifications from affected pension schemes to the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), and are therefore obtaining some information on the number of members facing pensions losses due to company insolvency. In due course, information will also be collected on individual members in schemes qualifying for FAS, including their addresses, at which point it may be possible to make some estimates of numbers affected in particular areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1357W.8/2">Based on our most recent data collection for the FAS, we know of around 70,000 non-pensioner members in schemes that are potentially eligible for assistance from the FAS as a result of their schemes being wound up in circumstances of insolvency or where the employer no longer exists.</p>

But there are many other factors, including political and financial gain, which motivate the formation and activities of these armed groups. In recent weeks Darfur has seen a worrying increase in violence, caused mainly by banditry. We condemn these attacks and have made clear that those responsible must be brought to justice.</p>

	<p pid="c.1362W.11/1">Since my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-14">14 June 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-06-14.8"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 8&ndash;9WS</phrase>, the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Anna Tibaijuka, has visited Zimbabwe to examine the effects of Operation Murambatsvina. Her report provided a damning indictment of the inhumanity of the Mugabe Government. We supported discussion of her report in the Security Council in July and October. The Foreign Secretary also drew attention to her findings, and to the need for action, in his speech to the UN General Assembly in September. We deplore the Government of Zimbabwe's rejection of the Special Envoy's report and we are concerned at the continuation of policies that exacerbate the suffering of those affected. We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to help the victims of this policy and, together with our international partners, press the Government of Zimbabwe to reverse its policies so that they address, rather than worsen, the humanitarian situation of its people.</p>

	<p pid="c.1363W.3/1">The procedure for evicting a private sector tenant who is guilty of antisocial behaviour can be initiated at relatively short notice under the notice to quit procedure. Where the tenant's own landlord is unwilling to take action, the Housing Executive, registered housing associations and private sector landlords can seek injunctions to protect their tenants, persons visiting their tenants and persons carrying out a lawful activity in the vicinity of their tenants' homes, from conduct causing or likely to cause nuisance or annoyance. A landlord can seek such an injunction against any person, including a tenant of another landlord.</p>
	<p pid="c.1363W.3/2">In addition, the Anti-social Behaviour (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 allows the Housing Executive to seek antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) to protect its tenants, persons visiting or residing with their tenants, and persons in or likely to be in the vicinity of the executive's houses, from behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. The Housing Executive can apply for an ASBO against any person, including a private sector tenant.</p>

The contractors intended to complete this work during November and December 2003. However, it is the Department's understanding that, once work had commenced, the weight of the waterlogged carriages necessitated cutting them into three sections to allow their movement and relocation. As a result, the work took longer than originally anticipated. Documentary and photographic evidence obtained by departmental staff during two site visits in February 2004 recorded the completion of the relocation work.</p>

	<p pid="c.1378W.6/1">At present, all private tenancies are governed by some of the provisions of the Rent (Northern Ireland) Order 1978. The main measures in place to regulate the sector are that all tenants must be provided with a rent book, must be given four weeks notice to quit when a tenancy is being brought to an end, and cannot be subjected to illegal eviction or harassment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1378W.6/2">In the case of rents, regulation or control applies only to that section of the private rented sector subject to protected and statutory tenancies under the 1978 order. Some of these dwellings are in very good repair while others are not fit for human habitation. Security of tenure and the right to pass on a tenancy to a resident family member, likewise, only applies to such tenancies. Other tenancies are governed almost entirely by their tenancy agreements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1378W.6/3">The Rent (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 has been reviewed by the Department for Social Development and a draft Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 has recently been published for consultation. This order provides a more comprehensive regulatory framework for the private rented sector than currently exists.</p>
