The Head of Policy is the Director's deputy, and leads the policy team day to day. The team as a whole comprises four people, and as a small team, responsibilities are carried out flexibly.</p>
	<p pid="e.365W.10/5">The policy team advises the IPSA Board on a range of policies and issues. It has taken the lead in the development and maintenance of the MPs' Expenses Scheme, and associated reviews and consultation, including the current review of MPs' staffing needs. The team will lead the policy work on MPs' pay and, when IPSA receives the powers, MPs' pensions.</p>
	<p pid="e.365W.10/6">The Director also has a role as a member of the IPSA executive's senior leadership team, providing direction and support to the organisation as a whole. The Director chairs IPSA's contingency panel, which meets weekly, to consider any contingency applications from MPs. The Head of Policy will chair the panel meetings in the Director's absence.</p>

	<p pid="e.368W.2/5">Through the MPs' Expenses Scheme, IPSA has put in place a set of rules, underpinned by the principle of independent regulation, which we believe will contribute to the restoration of public confidence in the manner in which MPs' expenses and costs are reimbursed.</p>
	<p pid="e.368W.2/6">We undertook a poll of the public as part of the annual review of the MPs' Expenses Scheme in November 2010 and a majority of respondents believed that IPSA would ensure that MPs were only paid legitimate expenses. We will carry out further surveys as part of our regular review of the expenses scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.368W.2/7">A recent survey commissioned by the National Audit Office found that 55% of the general public felt that the situation with regard to MPs' expenses had improved in the last year.</p>

	<p pid="e.372W.2/1">The Government are committed to working with our international partners to improve the conservation of high seas biodiversity. The UK played a key role in the establishment in 2010 of six High Seas Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the North East Atlantic under the OSPAR Convention, building on the work that established the world's first High Seas MPA under the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/2">The UK fully supports the United Nations General Assembly resolutions 61/105 and 64/72, particularly as they relate to the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems from the impact of bottom fishing on the high seas. The UK has worked within the EU to review the actions that have been taken to date and what still needs to be done to ensure the long term protection of these ecosystems and deep-sea species.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/3">Progress has been made, for example, in establishing an access regime for vessels engaged in deep-sea fishing, in the North East Atlantic and on the protection of the high seas where no regional fisheries management organisation exists. However, more work is needed in a number of areas, for example to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/4">Through the International Whaling Commission, the UK will continue to strongly support the moratorium on commercial whaling, introduced in 1985/86 and will continue to work with other countries to achieve greater conservation and protection of cetaceans.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/5">However, the Government recognise that threats to high seas biodiversity are increasing and further work is required. In the Government's Natural Environment White-Paper we have set out a commitment to work towards delivering a new global mechanism to regulate the conservation of marine biodiversity in the high seas. We consider that such an agreement, working within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, should set up a clear means of designating High Seas Marine Protected Areas, building on the work undertaken in Regional Seas Agreements, such as OSPAR.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/6">We have already made progress on this issue. Working in co-operation with other nations we secured agreement for the United Nations General Assembly to consider, at their meeting in September 2011, a recommendation to consider the need for a new multilateral agreement which would cover MPAs, and environmental impact assessments for deep sea activities. The UK, working with our EU partners and other nation states, is committed to press for a global response to the management of high seas biodiversity and sees this recommendation as a key step in the process.</p>

	<p pid="e.377W.5/1">It is a condition of payment under the single payment scheme that farmers have to meet a range of environmental standards known as cross compliance. These include a requirement for farmers to adhere to specific regulations in the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (England) (No 2) Regulations 2006. These regulations are designed to protect uncultivated land and semi-natural areas from being damaged by agricultural work. They also guard against possible negative environmental effects from the restructuring of rural land holdings. The regulations apply to projects that are greater than two hectares, but this threshold can be disapplied where it is thought that a project of less than 2 ha may have a significant impact on the environment (for example, this may be due to the particularly high environmental quality of the land or the cumulative impact of the project.</p>
	<p pid="e.377W.5/2">Cross compliance also requires farmers to avoid over grazing or unsuitable supplementary feeding on natural or semi-natural vegetation.</p>
	<p pid="e.377W.5/3">There is a broader obligation in the EU rules governing cross compliance that member states need to monitor the proportion of agricultural land that is &#8216;permanent pasture&#8217; and maintain levels of &#8216;permanent pasture&#8217; above a minimum ratio, set on a historic basis. However the EU definition of &#8216;permanent pasture&#8217; does not distinguish between natural/semi-natural grassland of high environmental value and enriched and reseeded grassland of low environmental value so provides little protection to the former. The Task Force on Farming Regulation recognised this failing in the current system. The UK will consider this issue as part of the forthcoming negotiations to reform the CAP.</p>

	<p pid="e.378W.3/1">Common Ragwort is one of five injurious weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959. The Act does not make it illegal to have weeds growing on land, but provides that the Secretary of State can serve an enforcement notice for the occupier to take action to prevent the spread of weeds to neighbouring land.

Their strategic approach, supported by HMRC's new anti-avoidance strategy, was set out in the Budget document 'Tackling Tax Avoidance'. The Government's commitment to tackling avoidance has been underlined by their reinvestment of &#163;917 million in HMRC which will enable it to better tackle tax avoidance and evasion.</p>

This allows the UK to reduce the interest rate on our bilateral loan to Ireland, while ensuring all the benefit goes to Ireland and not to higher interest rates paid to euro area governments. The amount by which the interest rate will be reduced is under consideration. The Government will still be more than covering the cost of their borrowing.

	<p pid="e.399W.7/3">This Government are committed to eradicating child poverty in the UK by 2020. We published our first child poverty strategy, &#8220;A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families' Lives&#8221;, covering the period to 2014, in April this year. It sets out a new approach to tackling poverty and securing, social justice aimed at transforming lives and tackling the causes of poverty. At its heart are the principles of work, fairness, responsibility and support for the most vulnerable. It draws together our radical programme of reform of welfare and education, tackling worklessness and benefit dependency and increasing children's life chances, with tailored support to overcome barriers and a greater concentration on early intervention and on whole-family and whole-life measures.</p>
	<p pid="e.399W.7/4">Our strategy establishes a UK-wide framework for tackling child poverty. It confirms our intention to support local authorities and their partners in meeting their duties under the Child Poverty Act 2010 to assess child poverty needs in their areas and publish strategies to reduce its level and mitigate its effects.</p>
	<p pid="e.399W.7/5">We are working with local authorities to develop new ways of pooling budgets and commissioning and delivering services through initiatives such as Community Budgets (Birmingham is a Community Budget area), Social Return on Investment and Payment by Results. We are drawing on our strong local networks to embed an evidence-based focus on what works best in sustainably eradicating child poverty, including sharing evidence from across the suite of child poverty pilots (which included a child poverty innovation pilot in North Warwickshire, a teenage parents in supported housing pilot in Worcestershire) and to ensure local experiences are properly reflected in the development of our national policy.</p>

Subscription fees charged by non-profit-making golf clubs are therefore exempt from VAT. The exemption does not extend to subscription fees received by proprietary (profit-making) clubs.</p>

	<p pid="e.417W.8/2">The London 2012 Business Network promotes opportunities from the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG), through events, communications, business bulletins and CompeteFor. The ODA and LOCOG also undertake visits to the nations and regions to promote games-related contract opportunities and host business delegations to the Olympic Park. Overall, nearly 50% of contracts awarded to date are to companies outside of London, with two-thirds of these small and medium-sized enterprises. The ODA held 60 events between June 2007 and April 2010 and visited every nation and region during the height of its procurement activity, and engaged with over 10,000 businesses. The programme of events concluded in April 2010 as much of the procurement work had been completed. LOCOG's engagement with businesses is still continuing.</p>

	<p pid="e.422W.3/1">The forecasted Village construction end date for the Games is early 2012. The 2,818 homes will be temporarily fitted out for the use of Olympic and Paralympic Athletes during the Games. 1,379 affordable homes in the Village have been pre-sold to Triathlon Homes, an approved provider of affordable homes, who will also manage the homes. From summer 2013/spring 2014 the final high quality homes will be delivered to Triathlon ready for residents to move into. Triathlon has been working with the host boroughs and the Greater London Authority on the lettings strategy for the social rented homes on the site. This is currently being approved by all parties and will be published later in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="e.426W.0/1">The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) is responsible for staging the Olympic Cycling Road Races next year. The majority of the route will not require ticketing and LOCOG is working with partners to ensure that the events are a success for athletes and spectators, including ensuring provision for as many spectators as possible to view the race at Box Hill and throughout the route. Spectator arrangements must balance the ambition to provide viewing opportunities for as many people as possible with the obligation to ensure the safety of both spectators and the general public. LOCOG and Surrey county council are working with Transport for London, who are responsible for arrangements for the safe movement of spectators and the general public across the entire route. Box Hill carries two legally binding conservation designations, as both a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. LOCOG are working in partnership with Natural England and the National Trust to ensure spectators are able to enjoy the race, while safeguarding the areas of specialist habitat. Officials from this Department work closely with these organisations and other local partners.</p>

	<p pid="e.427W.0/1">Bexleyheath and Crayford stand to gain from the wide range of opportunities created by the 2012 games, through businesses winning games-related work, increased tourism and cultural celebrations. Some examples of how Bexley will benefit from the games are given as follows.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/2">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) has awarded contracts to 759 direct suppliers in London. Examples of companies based in your constituency that have supplied the ODA include Blakley Electrics, who were responsible for temporary electrics at the Olympic Stadium, and Bexley Accessible Transport Scheme, which provided equipment.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/3">Information on businesses in London that have directly supplied the ODA is available in the business section of the London 2012 website at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/4"><a href="http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/oda-suppliers/index.php">http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/oda-suppliers/index.php</a></p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/5">This information does not include contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/6">So far 42,403 companies in London have registered on Competefor (the website where London 2012 contract opportunities are advertised), and 845 contracts have been awarded to Competefor suppliers in London.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/7">Over 19,000 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for the London 2012 Organising Committee's (LOCOG) London 2012 education programme Get Set. To date, 2,556 London schools and colleges have registered, of which 75 are in the London borough of Bexley.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/8">Over 1,600 cultural or sporting projects across the UK have been awarded the Inspire mark, 241 of these are in London. As part of the Olympic Torch Relay, Bexley will hold an Olympic Torch evening celebration on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-22">Sunday 22 July 2012</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.0/9">In addition, London has received &#163;2.89 million from the Legacy Trust. One of the programmes which received funding is Big Dance, a programme which will embrace the widest possible definition of dance and the broadest spectrum of activity. It will engage London's communities and engage artists with communities across the city.</p>

	<p pid="e.427W.3/1">The Nations and Regions Group, established by the Government Olympic Executive (GOE) and London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG), includes representation from each of the UK nations and regions and works directly with them to help realise and maximise the benefits from the economic, sporting and cultural opportunities offered by the games.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.3/2">The economic benefits of the games continue to flow to businesses across the East Midlands. To date the region has secured almost &#163;340 million of Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) Tier one contracts, the second highest value outside the greater South East. Over the past six months, contracts have been let to supply a diverse range of goods and services to London 2012 across each level of the LOCOG and ODA supply chains. Examples include; archery targets from Target Tech (Hugglescote, Leicestershire) and plaster and plasterboard from British Gypsum (Loughborough, Leicestershire).</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.3/3">The ODA is responsible for developing and building the venues and infrastructure for the London 2012 games. Over 1,500 businesses, including those directly involved in the construction programme, have supplied the ODA from across the UK, 44 of which are from the East Midlands. One of those businesses is Leicester-based Industrial Fire Protection which specialises in the design, supply and installation of passive fire protection. It secured a contract to design supply and fit soffit insulation to the undersides of the concrete floors in the main Olympic stadium.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.3/4">Pre-Games Training Camps (PGTCs) provide an opportunity to create further economic benefits, including inward investment, through the international attention that will follow. Two agreements are now in place in the East Midlands for teams to use facilities in the region. The agreement between the Japanese Olympic Committee and Loughborough University has already brought both cultural and economic benefits.</p>
	<p pid="e.427W.3/5">The games will also provide a focus for the tourism industry. The Government's Tourism Policy, published in March, aims to help the tourism industry achieve its potential for growth through a range of measures. This initiative aims to generate 4 million extra overseas visitors over the next four years bringing in an extra &#163;2 billion worth of visitor spend and helping to create 50,000 new jobs across the country.</p>

	<p pid="e.446W.5/1">The UK maintains a close and active bilateral relationship with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In July, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (Mr Hague), met with BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj in London, underlined the UK's commitment to a strong and constructive bilateral relationship with BiH. In June, I visited BiH, meeting government, parliament, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and civil society representatives. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-11">11 July</phrase>, Baroness Warsi represented the UK Government at the commemoration of the 16<sup>(th)</sup> anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica and had a wider programme of meetings. Our bilateral relationship with BiH ranges across a variety of issues, for example the UK has worked closely with BiH during its two years as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council (2010-11).</p>
	<p pid="e.446W.5/2">The UK is actively committed to BiH as a sovereign, stable country with functioning state-level institutions, irreversibly on path to EU and NATO. We urge progress towards the formation of a State-level government. We are fully committed to the territorial integrity of BiH and have repeatedly made clear that challenges to the structure of the state established by the Dayton Peace Agreement are unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="e.446W.5/3">The UK Government fully and strongly supports the OHR in its efforts to improve the functionality of the state and to deal promptly and decisively with challenges to the Dayton Agreement. The UK has consistently argued for strong international support for the High Representative, and to uphold the &#8216;5+2&#8217; objectives and conditions necessary for the OHR's closure. We have also worked to help reinvigorate the EU's strategy towards, and presence in, BiH, while maintaining the safeguards provided by the High Representative and the EU Peacekeeping mission, EUFOR Althea. We welcome the new EU Special Representative assuming his mandate in September, as a means of strengthening EU engagement with BiH, working with the range of international actors.</p>
	<p pid="e.446W.5/4">The international community can however only do so much: the onus must be on Bosnian politicians to act responsibly and in the interests of the Bosnian people. We continue to give this clear and unequivocal message in country.</p>

	<p pid="e.447W.2/1">The political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is of serious concern. A new state-level Government have still not been formed following elections in October 2010. There has been a failure to deliver important reforms which are necessary for progress towards the EU and which would improve the functionality of the Bosnian state.</p>
	<p pid="e.447W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-13">13 April 2011</phrase> the RS National Assembly (RSNA) passed Conclusions calling a referendum on the authority of state-level judicial institutions, and rejecting the authority and past decisions of the High Representative in BiH. This was a serious development. The UK made clear that Conclusions represented a serious challenge to the Dayton Agreement and the rule of law in BiH and condemned the move.</p>
	<p pid="e.447W.2/3">We welcomed the firm response from the international community, including the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) and EU. We also welcomed active EU engagement, including by EU High Representative Baroness Ashton which led to RS President Dodik pledging to repeal referendum legislation, in a return for a dialogue on judicial issues. This dialogue was in fact already allowed for as part of the EU accession process. We noted the annulment of the referendum decision on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-01">1 June</phrase>. We welcomed the PIC Steering Board of <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-29">29 June</phrase> reiterating that the <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-13">13 April</phrase> Conclusions do not discharge the requirement of the RS authorities to meet their obligations under Dayton. We urge participants in the EU dialogue to engage constructively, but recall that this is a technical dialogue aimed at accession standards, not a political forum.</p>
	<p pid="e.447W.2/4">The UK's support for the Office of the High Representative in upholding the Dayton Agreement will continue to be firm and unwavering. The Government are firmly committed to BiH as a sovereign, stable country with functioning state-level institutions, irreversibly on the path to EU and NATO membership. We are engaging actively to this end and continue to urge political leaders to form quickly a broad-based and representative government, capable of undertaking reforms.</p>

	<p pid="e.456W.5/19">Since 2000 the FCO has also funded a number of small projects with UN involvement. However aggregation of the data would involve disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="e.456W.5/20">The UN regular budget is negotiated biennially, with the next negotiation taking place this autumn for the budget period 2012-13. Furthermore the UK's share of contributions to that budget is subject to periodic changes according to the Scales of Assessment, rating countries' capacity to pay. Therefore it is not possible to project precisely what the UK will pay over the next three years.</p>

We are enlisting the input of a Steering Group made up of academics and leading organisations from the voluntary and community sector. The Steering Group will assist in building a robust evidence base about what support can help different families and examine whether therapeutic justice would be an appropriate approach.</p>

	<p pid="e.460W.2/5">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) has jurisdiction, i.e. legal authority, to make a maintenance calculation and collect child support maintenance only when the parent with care, the non-resident parent and the qualifying child are all habitually resident in the United Kingdom (UK). Habitual residence is a legal concept which means more than simply 'where you live'. A person can habitually reside in more than one country or in none. Habitual residence can continue during an absence from UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.2/6">Under the current child maintenance scheme, which deals with cases opened since March 2003, if the non-resident parent works for a company based overseas, it is not possible for earnings on which UK tax has not been paid to be taken into account within the maintenance calculation. This is because such earnings do not align with the statutory definition of net weekly earnings upon which the calculation is based. The Commission continues to have jurisdiction over any additional income earned and taxed in Great Britain. Any arrears that were built up while the non-resident parent was earning in Great Britain would continue to be enforceable if the non-resident parent subsequently became entirely dependent on income from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.2/7">The Commission has reviewed child maintenance cases under the 2003 child maintenance scheme where the Commission determines a non-resident parent has no assessable income and is presently in the process of proposing regulatory changes which will resolve this anomaly to some degree.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.2/8">The Commission has just launched an external consultation with stakeholders on these regulatory changes; one of which will include a new measure that would allow the Commission to take into account the UK taxable earnings of all non-resident parents (including those that work offshore and seafarers) that are habitually resident in the UK, even if they are paid abroad. This will reduce the number of cases where the Commission is required to make a nil-assessment. The Consultation commenced on the <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-26">26 July</phrase> and will end on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-26">26 October 2011</phrase>. You can obtain a copy of the consultation at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="e.460W.2/10">We are also aware that there might -be a small proportion of non-resident parents, who although habitually resident in the UK for child maintenance purposes are non-resident for UK tax purposes; and as such will continue to be nil-assessed. We are presently reviewing this matter to establish how best to handle such cases.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.2/11">Finally, I should also add that recent EU legislation which came into effect in June 2011 allows the Commission to recover arrears of maintenance which have arisen in a case within the statutory maintenance schemes from non-resident parents who live within the EU.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.2/12">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

Of these, 5,020 cases existed where there was a liability to pay child maintenance with 2,110 cases being nil-assessed. Management information does not record the reason why cases are nil-assessed.

Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National statistics and there are some issues with the data; for example, it does not include applications which were processed clerically and have not yet been entered on to the social fund computer system. 6. If an applicant receives an initial award and this award is increased on first review in the same month as the initial award was made, then the Policy, Budget and Management Information System (PBMIS) does not count the initial award and the review award separately, but counts one award on the one application. However, if a first review award is made in a later month than the initial award, then PBMIS counts two awards on the one application. Similarly, if an initial or first review award is increased by the Independent Review Service, then all awards made in the same month on one application count as one award. However, if an initial award or any review award(s) on one application are made in different months, then PBMIS will count one award for each month in which an initial or review award was made. Because of this counting method, only the numbers of initial awards have been given.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.463W.5/1">Procurement and purchasing in the Department for Work and Pensions and its non-departmental public bodies is conducted under a commercial strategy that has an objective to achieve the best outcome for the UK taxpayer in terms of cost, quality and business outcome. Progress against this objective has been measured since 2001 by a key performance indicator that reports the commercial function's contribution to the Department living within its spending review allocations. This indicator is based on tracking all commercial expenditure and measuring procurement value for money gains. The Department uses a procurement value for money measurement methodology initially developed by the then Office of Government Commerce (OGC) in response to the Peter Gershon Review of 1998-99. The methodology was subsequently updated by OGC to reflect new efficiency policy.</p>
	<p pid="e.463W.5/2">The methodology is applied in the Department by procurement category teams and results are subject to annual internal audit. It allows savings to be counted from the value added by procurement negotiations, collaboration, process efficiencies and improved contract or asset management. It also provides a distinction between procurement action that releases cash and other action that adds value but does not release cash, for example cost avoidance by resisting a suppliers bid to raise prices.</p>
	<p pid="e.463W.5/3">Since May 2010 the Department has worked with the Efficiency and Reform Group to incorporate savings from Crown supplier negotiations and centralised procurement into departmental procurement savings results.</p>

This work should be completed shortly and we will then make a final decision on the way forward. We are committed to getting this right to ensure that disabled people are able to get out and about and live independently. Any changes will be rolled into the introduction of personal independence payment from April 2013.</p>

	<p pid="e.465W.3/1">Disability living allowance is intended to focus additional help with the extra cost of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled earlier in life and who as a consequence have less opportunity, to work, earn and save compared to non-disabled people. It is normal for pensions and benefit schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="e.465W.3/2">Where someone is in receipt of the higher rate mobility component before their 65<sup>(th)</sup> birthday, it can remain in payment beyond age 65 as long as the conditions of entitlement remain satisfied. A new entitlement to the higher rate mobility component, under whatever provision, cannot be established after the age of 65 as to do so would not be consistent with the principle of this benefit which is to ensure that additional help is focussed to those who become disabled earlier in life.</p>

	<p pid="e.468W.8/1">At the outset of a claim to jobseeker's allowance, guidance to Jobcentre Plus advisers is to discuss and put in place a Jobseeker's agreement, which contains information about the type of work being sought, the claimant's availability for work and jobsearch activities that, if taken, offer best prospects of employment.</p>
	<p pid="e.468W.8/2">Guidance stresses the importance of taking into account individual personal circumstances, including child care responsibilities and agreeing appropriate restrictions on the claimant's availability for work, eg lone parents with a child aged 12 or under may restrict their availability to their child's normal school hours.</p>
	<p pid="e.468W.8/3">Taking into account the claimant's agreed availability for work, advisers provide information, advice and guidance on how best to identify and apply for suitable jobs, including those outside of school hours, where they are appropriate given the claimant's circumstances. The adviser can also offer ongoing personalised support which may include pre and post employment support, appropriate training; signposting to other relevant services and information about the support available to help overcome issues that may be making it harder to find and keep jobs, for example, in-work financial support and information about available child care.</p>
	<p pid="e.468W.8/4">For many parents to enter sustained employment they will need to source and utilise formal child care. Advisers recognise the importance of child care as a key enabler to work and therefore provide parents with the necessary support, assistance and advice to overcome this barrier to work.</p>

	<p pid="e.469W.2/1">Estimates of the number and proportion of children and pensioners living in poverty are published in the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series. HBAI uses household (rather than family) income adjusted (or &#8220;equivalised&#8221;) for household size and composition, to provide a proxy for standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="e.469W.2/2">The sample size of this survey is not sufficient to provide estimates for small areas such as Leicester. However, figures at a regional level, for the East Midlands are available. Three survey years have been combined to ensure sufficient sample sizes.</p>
	<p pid="e.469W.2/3">Statistics covering 2007-08 to 2009-10 are the most recent available and are shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="e.469W.2/4">The targets set out in the Child Poverty Act and our broader set of income measures in the Child Poverty Strategy are calculated on a &#8220;Before Housing Costs&#8221; (BHC) basis. International comparisons are also calculated this way.</p>
	<p pid="e.469W.2/5">When considering the living standards of children, measures After Housing Costs (AHC) can underestimate the true standard of living as a family may make a choice to spend more on rent or mortgage to attain a higher standard of accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="e.469W.2/6">Conversely measures for pensioners are generally on an After Housing Costs basis. This is because pensioners are far more likely to own their homes outright and so receive value from housing, without having to pay for rent or mortgage payments out of their current income. So for assessing pensioner poverty a Before Housing Costs basis does not provide a good comparison of living standards.</p>

Support through personal independence payment will be focused on those with the most need.

Totals may not sum due to rounding. 2. &#8216;&#8212;&#8217; denotes nil or negligible. 3. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded. 4. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital. 5. &#8216;Mental health disabilities&#8217; encompass the main disabling conditions &#8216;learning difficulties&#8217; and &#8216;mental and behavioural disabilities&#8217;. In October 2008 much finer classifications were introduced for new DLA claimants. DWP do not report on these finer classifications as the majority of pre-2008 claims still have the &#8220;old codes&#8221; on the administrative system. A new code (cognitive disorders&#8212;other/type not known) was introduced within the general classification of &#8220;psychiatric disorders&#8221;. Claimants allocated to this group are included within &#8220;mental health disorders&#8221;. 6. &#8220;Physical disabilities&#8221; encompass all categories not included in &#8220;mental health disabilities&#8221;, including the main disabling conditions arthritis, muscle/joint/bone disease, blindness, stroke related, epilepsy, deafness, malignant disease, chest disease, back ailments, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disorders, aids, skin disease, frailty, multiple sclerosis. The small number of cases with unknown medical code (see note 7) have been included in &#8220;physical disorders&#8221;). 7. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5% sample data are generally the preferred source for analysis on DLA disabling condition as information is more complete. However in this case the WPLS data have been used as some of the caseload figures produced are very small and so would have a high level of statistical variation should the sample data have been used. 8. Parliamentary constituency is based on the Westminster Parliament of May 2010. <i>Source</i>: DWP Information Directorate: Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS)</td> </tr>

Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital. 5. &#8216;Mental health disabilities&#8217; encompass the main disabling conditions &#8216;learning difficulties&#8217; and &#8216;mental and behavioural disabilities&#8217;. In October 2008 much finer classifications were introduced for new DLA claimants. DWP do not report on these finer classifications as the majority of pre-2008 claims still have the &#8220;old codes&#8221; on the administrative system. A new code (cognitive disorders&#8212;other/ type not known) was introduced within the general classification of &#8220;psychiatric disorders&#8221;. Claimants allocated to this group are included within &#8220;mental health disorders&#8221;. 6. &#8220;Physical disabilities&#8221; encompass all categories not included in &#8220;mental health disabilities&#8221;, including the main disabling conditions arthritis, muscle/joint/bone disease, blindness, stroke related, epilepsy, deafness, malignant disease, chest disease, back ailments, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disorders, aids, skin disease, frailty, multiple sclerosis. The small number of cases with unknown medical code (see note 7) have been included in &#8220;physical disabilities&#8221;). 7. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5% sample data are generally the preferred source for analysis on DLA disabling condition as information is more complete. However in this case the WPLS data has been used as some of the caseload figures produced are very small and so would have a high level of statistical variation should the sample data have been used. 8. Parliamentary constituency is based on the Westminster Parliament of May 2010. <i>Source</i>: DWP Information Directorate: Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS)</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.477W.2/1">The Government have made a commitment that there will be no cash losers purely as a result of the move to universal credit. At the point of change a comparison will be made between current amount received in tax credits and/or benefits and the household entitlement under universal credit. If the universal credit entitlement is less, and no other circumstances have changed, a cash amount will be paid in order to make up the difference. Details of this protection will be available when policy details have been finalised but we would expect future increases in universal credit entitlement to reduce the need for transitional protection.</p>

	<p pid="e.478W.0/1">New measures introduced in April 2011 allow Jobcentre Plus to offer more flexible support to people with mental and behavioural difficulties, ensuring provision is tailored to personal and local labour market needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/2">This includes advice and support about maintaining well-being and managing health in preparation for a return to work</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/3">The Work programme is a cross benefit programme that ensures providers are free to innovate and design support that addresses the needs of individuals. Work programme providers are paid more to support harder to help groups into sustained employment, including those claiming employment support allowance.</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/4">In addition, disabled people may be able to access a range of specialist employment provision including Work Choice; Access to Work; Remploy Employment Services and Enterprise Businesses; and Residential Training.</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/5">Jobcentre Pius Disability Employment Advisers offer help with finding and retaining employment. They can refer individuals to specialist programmes including Residential Training and Work Choice and may also use the professional expertise of Work Psychologists specialising in working with disabled people. They can advocate with employers on the individual's behalf and help employers to explore job solutions such as the restructuring of a job's tasks or the environment, or the provision of, or change to equipment.</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/6">Jobcentre Plus Mental Health and Well-being Partnership Managers work with mental health services to ensure an awareness of the services available locally, and to develop the knowledge and confidence of Jobcentre Plus advisers. Advisers also have access to resources such as the mental health adviser toolkit, and the Hidden Impairments toolkit, developed in conjunction with professional experts, charitable organisations and service users.</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/7">As part of the Department for Work and Pensions Health and Work programme, occupational health advice services are available across Great Britain to employers in small businesses who need to support an individual employee to remain in or return to work, and to GPs who require support on patient-specific or general occupational health issues. Also, Fit for Work Services are being piloted across Great Britain to ensure individuals can access case-managed, multidisciplinary support in the early stages of sickness absence to help them back to work as soon as possible and ensure they remain in work.</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/8">The Royal College of Psychiatrists, supported by the Department for Work and Pensions, has produced an online resource providing information and guidance about returning to work after a period of mental ill health to provide support to workers, employers, clinicians, and carers.</p>
	<p pid="e.478W.0/9">As part of the Department of Health (DH) Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, which will be rolled-out across England by March 2015, employment support coordination ensures employment and advice support providers and psychological therapy services work together to help people remain in or return to work when issues arise. In Scotland, support for those with mental health conditions is delivered through the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives, which provides training to employers on developing Mentally Healthy Workplaces. In Wales, the Mental Health in Primary Care Network works to improve awareness of the importance of work to health, making specific reference to mental health and well-being.</p>

	<p pid="e.484W.2/1">There is currently no review into the effectiveness of administration of the Disabled Facilities Grant. However, the recently published report by the Commission on the Funding of Care and Support recommends reviewing the operation and administration of the Disabled Facilities Grant. The Government welcome this report and will be reviewing the recommendations with the care sector over the autumn. Following this engagement, we will publish a White Paper on social care reform in the spring next year, as well as a progress report on funding reform.</p>

	<p pid="e.484W.8/1">Following the termination of the FiReControl project we consulted the fire and rescue community on the future of control services and, at the same time, invited Fire and Rescue Services to discuss with us how they might use the buildings. The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority took on the lease for the building in London in March this year and are planning to move their control room later this year. We are in discussion with a number of Fire and Rescue Authorities who are interested in taking on other buildings; where there is no interest the buildings are being marketed more widely, including to other emergency services. This approach is building improved control room resilience through local solutions, not imposing a solution from central Government.</p>

	<p pid="e.494W.2/1">The Government are reforming the planning system to ensure that the sustainable development needed to support economic growth is able to proceed as easily as possible. This embraces a range of measures which should make it easier to obtain planning permission for appropriately sited anaerobic digestion plants.</p>
	<p pid="e.494W.2/2">Anaerobic digestion plants are a maximum 8 MW, so these are all local planning decisions governed by the planning framework and guidance. We consider that local authorities are best placed to manage the waste management needs for their area; and to best deliver workable renewable energy. Through our proposals for reforming the planning system we are creating the right framework to facilitate a significant increase in the amount of energy from waste through anaerobic digestion. Our reforms sit alongside the Anaerobic Digestion Strategy and Action Plan, published by DEFRA in June 2011, where the Government are making &#163;10 million available to promote use of anaerobic digestion (food waste).</p>
	<p pid="e.494W.2/3">DCLG facilitate a forum/hold regular meetings to discuss and understand planning reform as they affect anaerobic digestion. Following the recent publication of the draft National Planning Policy Framework, work is ongoing to consider links between the planning system and its support for injection of biomethane into the national gas grid.</p>

	<p pid="e.494W.5/2">More broadly, the Government are committed to supporting homeownership but we also recognise that a strong private rental sector is required to provide a flexible alternative. We want to ensure the housing market is stable and responds to demand.</p>

	<p pid="e.497W.5/1">The British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) became a wholly owned subsidiary of British Coal in 1969. British Coal was a very large company with records spread over numerous sites. Over the course of time many of those records were lost or destroyed. Those that remain that are under the Department's control, including the remaining BCURA records relating to the period while it was in British Coal ownership, are held by the Departments records management contractor, Iron Mountain, at their facility in Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="e.497W.5/2">As for the period after BCURA left the ownership of British Coal, BCURA are responsible for those records and the question should be directed to BCURA for that period and for any documents transferred to them at that time. However we are also aware that the Coal Research Establishment (CRE) deposited a number of records outside the British Coal archive system. We do not know the nature and extent of those deposits. One potential source of further enquiries is with the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. A review of that Institute's annual report for 2008-09 indicates that at least some CRE/BCURA records/libraries are held by them. The National Archives also hold some documents related to BCURA.</p>

	<p pid="e.512W.5/1">Initial analysis suggests there is cost-effective energy efficiency potential across the economy which is unlikely to be realised through the current mix of policy measures. A key role for DECCs new Energy Efficiency Deployment Office will be to develop this analysis and assess those areas where it might be appropriate to tighten existing policy or introduce appropriate additional measures, to encourage greater energy efficiency. I would expect to make public the results of this assessment when it is sufficient developed.</p>
	<p pid="e.512W.5/2">As part of this work DECC is keen to ensure that electricity consumers contribute an appropriate share of the UK's overall improvement in energy efficiency and will undertake an assessment over the coming year to determine whether further steps are needed to improve the support and incentives for the efficient use of electricity. The results of this assessment will be made public over the course of next year.</p>

	<p pid="e.512W.8/1">The impact assessment on implementation of the third package of legislation on the single market in energy concluded that significant benefits could derive to the UK from full compliance with the package across the EU. The package should have an overall positive effect on economic growth by promoting cross-border trade and increasing competition. Increased trade and greater market integration should reduce our vulnerability to supply and price shocks and provide opportunities for exports. Increased competition should put downward pressure on consumer prices through reducing market power and providing incentives for suppliers to keep costs down. It should also encourage innovation with its positive effects on productivity and economic growth. Consumers should also benefit from greater choice and improved service. However, further action under the package to agree cross-border technical codes, which is already underway, will be required to complete the single energy market and this should lead to greater benefits for the UK. The aim is to achieve this by 2014.</p>

The Government are engaged in a number of processes, including the North Seas Countries' Offshore Grid Initiative and the All Islands Approach agreed at the British Irish Council summit in June, that are considering the costs, benefits and technical challenges of a more integrated offshore grid in the North and Irish seas and how it could be developed. Later this year, the Commission are expected to publish proposals for facilitating investment in energy infrastructure across the EU, including major electricity links. Any developments are likely to take place in an incremental manner over a period of years.</p>

	<p pid="e.518W.2/1">The UK Renewable Energy Roadmap, published in July 2011, provides illustrative 'central ranges' for deployment for a number of renewable technologies&#8212;including onshore wind, offshore wind and biomass electricity&#8212;based upon modelling of variables such as technology cost, build rates, and the policy framework.</p>
	<p pid="e.518W.2/2">Using these central ranges, the potential contribution to electricity generation from the following technologies in 2020 is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="e.518W.2/3"><i>(a)</i> onshore wind could contribute between 24-32 TWh, 6-9% of overall electricity generation;</p>
	<p pid="e.518W.2/4"><i>(b)</i> offshore wind could contribute between 33-58 TWh, 9-15% of overall electricity generation;</p>
	<p pid="e.518W.2/5"><i>(c)</i> biomass (including dedicated feedstock, energy from waste, landfill and sewage gas, conversion and co-firing) could contribute between 32-50 TWh, 9-13% of overall electricity generation.</p>
	<p pid="e.518W.2/6">The central ranges do not represent technology specific targets or the level of our ambition. They are based on our current understanding of deployment, costs and non-financial barriers and could change significantly as the market evolves to 2020.</p>

	<p pid="e.522W.5/1">At the start of this year I launched the UK Marine Energy Programme which has established three working groups, Financing, Planning and Consenting and Knowledge Sharing, to examine the issues and potential barriers to the development and deployment of marine renewable technologies at commercial scale.

	<p pid="e.522W.8/1">Under the reforms outlined in the EMR White Paper, the competitive market will continue but four inter-locking policy instruments are proposed to change the returns generators can expect for the power stations they build and the electricity they generate:</p>
	<p pid="e.522W.8/2">Greater long-term certainty around the additional cost of running polluting plant through a carbon price floor. Proposals from the Treasury to provide greater support and certainty to the carbon price will increase investment in low carbon generation by providing a clearer long-term price for carbon in the power sector.</p>
	<p pid="e.522W.8/3">Long-term contracts for low carbon generation will make clean energy investment more attractive still. Through a 'contract for difference' feed-in tariff, the Government will agree clear, long-term contracts, resulting in a top-up payment to low carbon generators if wholesale prices are low but clawing back money for consumers if prices become higher than the cost of low carbon generation. An alternative 'premium' feed-in tariff is also set out in the consultation document.</p>
	<p pid="e.522W.8/4">Additional payments to encourage the construction of reserve plants to ensure the lights stay on. A capacity mechanism will ensure there remains an adequate safety cushion of capacity as the amount of intermittent and inflexible low carbon generation increases.</p>
	<p pid="e.522W.8/5">A back-stop to limit how much carbon the most dirty power stations&#8212;coal&#8212;can emit. An Emissions Performance Standard will reinforce the existing requirement that no new coal is built without carbon capture and storage.</p>

	<p pid="e.526W.5/1">The licensing system under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is demand led and provides no direct mechanism for reducing the breeding and use of animals. Instead the Act requires that animal use is kept to a minimum.</p>

	<p pid="e.527W.8/1">There are currently no plans to recover the policing costs from the perpetrators of the disorder. However, courts can impose a compensation order for any offence that has resulted in personal injury, loss or damage. This will apply where individual victims have been injured, as well as where individuals or businesses have experienced offences such as theft, burglary or criminal damage. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill will strengthen the law on compensation orders by giving the courts a clear, positive duty to consider imposing such an order in any case where there is an identifiable victim.</p>

	<p pid="e.529W.9/1">Available homicide data are collected by the Home Office from police forces in England and Wales and have been extracted from the Homicide Index. Table A shows the number of offences recorded as homicide (murder, manslaughter and infanticide) in 2009-10 for which no-one has been convicted. It is not possible to separately identify those offences recorded as murder.</p>
	<p pid="e.529W.9/2">Data are as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-28">28 September 2010</phrase> and subject to revision as cases are dealt with by the police and by the courts, or as further information becomes available. This is particularly the case for 2009-10 data given the time it can take to bring suspects to trial.</p>
	<p pid="e.529W.9/3">The data include cases for which: the principal suspect committed suicide or died before proceedings could be initiated or before proceedings could be concluded; the suspect was found to be insane; all suspects were acquitted and police investigations are continuing; and, no suspects have been charged.</p>
	<p pid="e.529W.9/4">Although provisional homicide data for 2010-11 were published in &#8220;Crime in England and Wales&#8221; 2010-11 on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase>, these figures do not include convictions data. A first analysis of 2010-11 homicide data including convictions will be available in January 2012.</p>
	<p pid="e.529W.9/5">Data on police recorded sexual offences are collected by the Home Office. The data relating to police recorded sexual offences for 2010-11 are provided in Table B. Data relating to conviction status is not available.</p>
	<p pid="e.529W.9/6">Data on reported sexual offences which have not yet resulted in convictions are not available centrally. The Ministry of Justice collects data on convictions for sexual offences but these data are published on a calendar year basis and are counts of persons classified by their principal offence. As such, convictions data cannot be linked to police recorded crime data to track individual offences through to their outcome at court.</p>

	<p pid="e.546W.5/1">Defence Equipment and Support currently employs around 100 civilian staff in Glasgow and around 5,500 civilian staff at its headquarters in Bristol. The significant difference in numbers means that direct comparisons cannot readily be made. In the year to July 2011, about 2.5% of Bristol staff and about 1% of Glasgow staff left through retirement or resignation compared with around 4.5% for Defence Equipment and Support as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="e.546W.5/2">The restrictions on recruitment across the whole of the Ministry of Defence mean that there has only been external recruitment into critical or specialised posts. In the year to July 2011, we recruited around 150 new staff in Bristol and none in Glasgow.</p>

	<p pid="e.549W.2/4">the Efficiency and Reform Group's tough new efficiency regime which will drive savings in procurement, major projects and estate management;</p>

Ministry of Defence (MOD) savings in the relevant categories were included in the overall figure. The MOD also spends substantial amounts on procuring and purchasing goods and services that are not covered by the Efficiency and Reform Group's regime, particularly the acquisition of military capability. The MOD does not use a set method for estimating savings to the Defence budget from changes to these activities.</p>

They are too often overlooked even though they provide invaluable support and endure demands beyond those encountered by the rest of society. None the less, we have no plans to award formal recognition. Medals are awarded for gallantry, long service, service on qualifying operations, and commemorative purposes. There are no plans to extend eligibility to partners, beyond those medals already awarded posthumously.</p>

These exercises have involved more than 100 UK personnel, including ground crew, and the intention is to deploy them in theatres of operations as part of the normal national rotational cycles. Specific information on the deployment of UK helicopter pilots who have trained through the EDA Helicopter Initiative is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The EDA do not hold records on the nationality of individuals trained through the initiative, and, therefore the only way to gain the information would be to track individual pilots and seek authorisation for release of information regarding subsequent deployment.</p>

Further information on these proportions can be found at: http://www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf The application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is now available directly from Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES). Information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data. <sup>(2)</sup> PCT/SHA data quality In July 2006, the NHS reorganised SHAs and PCTs in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years. Data have been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided. <sup>(3)</sup> SHA/PCT/local authority of residence The SHA, PCT or local authority (UK) containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another area for treatment. <sup>(4)</sup> Assessing growth through time HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i>Note</i>: Data quality: HESs are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source</i>: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.562W.11/1">This information is not held centrally. However, a whole-family approach in planning services is particularly relevant where young carers are involved. Service users and carers of all ages can benefit from an integrated and holistic approach to providing personalised care and support. Such an approach helps to ensure that admission and discharge plans identify and assess the needs of patients who are parents so they do not have to rely on their children to provide care.</p>
	<p pid="e.562W.11/2">&#8220;Carers and Personalisation&#8212;improving outcomes&#8221; which the Department of Health published in November 2010, includes good practice guidance on whole family approaches. A copy has already been placed in the Library and is available at:</p>

	<p pid="e.562W.11/4">The Department also supported the development of &#8220;Carers as partners in hospital discharge&#8221;, published by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services in February 2010, which brought together key policy and good practice materials to inform hospital discharge processes. The guidance recognises the importance of the impact of hospital discharge on carers including young carers.</p>

	<p pid="e.563W.2/1">Achieving good-quality early diagnosis and intervention for all is one of the Government's four priorities in implementing the National Dementia Strategy. The Department undertook a public awareness campaign in the North West and Yorkshire and Humber national health service regions in March 2011, encouraging people to seek a diagnosis for dementia where they have concerns. The campaign included leaflets available to the general public on the early signs and symptoms of dementia. Consideration is currently being given to rolling out the awareness campaign on a national basis.</p>

Firstly, the local authority arranges short breaks care for a family based on their assessment of family need and the availability of resources.

	<p pid="e.572W.11/1">Entitlement to free national health service hospital treatment is based on residency in the United Kingdom. Some overseas visitors are also exempted from charges as set out in the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2011 and will receive free treatment. The Department does not hold data on the nationality of those whose treatment is provided for by the NHS budget.</p>
	<p pid="e.572W.11/2">Other overseas nationals, together with UK nationals who are not ordinarily resident in the UK are charged by hospitals for the costs of their treatment. Income received by NHS trusts from chargeable NHS patients for 2009-10 was &#163;17,036,000. The Department does not collect information from NHS foundation trusts so the total figure will be higher.</p>

QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract on 1 April 2004. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part. 2. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF. 3. QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists. 4. Coverage of QOF: Patients will only contribute to the figures in QOF if they are registered with a general practice participating in QOF. Not all practices participate in QOF and some participate in only some parts (especially PMS practices who are paid under different arrangements for providing services which are part of QOF for GMS practices). Most indicators in QOF have rules that allow for patients to be excluded (e.g. patient refuses treatment) and so the denominator for a given indicator may be less than the number of patients on the register for that disease. Note also that some indicators have age limits and so exclude some patients on the register. <i>Source</i>: QOF, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.576W.3/1">It is the responsibility of local social care services to determine and make arrangements for the provision and repair of communication aids and assistive technology.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/2">The &#8220;Vision on Adult Social Care, Capable Communities and Active Citizens&#8221; is clear that councils should commission a full range of appropriate preventative and early intervention services such as re-ablement and telecare, working in partnership with the national health service, housing authorities and others.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/3">Generally, councils may supply equipment costing up to &#163;1,000 free of charge but in some circumstances may make direct payments to purchase equipment or adaptations themselves.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/4">No discussions have taken place between the Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40541" name="Andrew Lansley">the right hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley)</phrase>, and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40116" name="Eric Pickles">the right hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr Pickles)</phrase>, about the funding of communication aids and assistive technology for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities. Local authorities are responsible for assessing the adult social care needs of local people and making arrangements to ensure that eligible needs are met. They are also responsible for determining spending on adult social care to meet local needs and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/5">Professor Mansell's report &#8220;Raising Our Sights&#8221; included views from the Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities Network, Mencap, families, care staff, service managers and other respondents. The report recommended that the Government consider whether funding the provision and repair of communication aids for adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities should be the responsibility of the NHS or of local authority social care services.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/6">The question of monitoring and assessment are for local determination. The White Paper &#8220;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&#8221; proposes closer worker relationship between the NHS and local authorities. NHS and local authority partners should work closely together to improve integration.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/7">There are no plans at present to provide information about communication aids and assistive technology.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/8">The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) welcomes funding applications for research into any aspect of human health. These applications are subject to peer review and are judged in open competition, with awards being made based on the scientific quality of the proposals made. In all disease areas, the amount of NIHR funding depends on the volume and quality of scientific activity. The Health Technology Assessment Programme is &quot;needs led&quot; and so suggestions for research can be submitted to the programme through a number of routes including an electronic web form at:</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/9"><a href="http://www.hta.ac.uk/webforms/webforms/hta/0.asp">http://www.hta.ac.uk/webforms/webforms/hta/0.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/10">The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme has held several teleconferences with a range of experts in the area of learning disabilities to focus on and identify research priorities including those in the areas of communication aids and assistive technology. Any priorities identified will be fed in to the appropriate NIHR work streams.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/11">The HTA programme has advertised for research, in to &quot;supported self-management of diabetes in people with learning disabilities&quot;. A full proposal will be considered in September 2011.</p>
	<p pid="e.576W.3/12">The Whole System Demonstrator Programme was established to determine the cost and clinical effectiveness of telehealth and telecare. The findings are currently being evaluated and will be independently peer reviewed before publication later this year. The benefits of remote monitoring are that it can lead to more independence, people having fewer admissions to home and support clinical monitoring of larger populations.</p>

	<p pid="e.578W.2/3">In the meantime, we have made &#163;50 million additional funding available for cancer drugs in 2010-11 which has helped over 2,400 patients. Since April 2011, the Cancer Drugs Fund is helping thousands more patients access the drugs their clinicians believe will help them.</p>

	<p pid="e.580W.3/1">Surveillance of meningococcal infection is a core responsibility of the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Currently, registered medical practitioners are required to immediately report cases of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia to the HPA. Enhanced surveillance of meningococcal disease is undertaken in the HPA and involves following up all cases of vaccine preventable infections to ascertain vaccination status and additional clinical details. These data are used, in conjunction with information on coverage of vaccination, to establish the effectiveness of the current routine vaccination programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.580W.3/2">The HPA also carries out pneumococcal disease surveillance. National pneumococcal surveillance is used to monitor the impact and effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines currently given in the childhood immunisation schedule.</p>

	<p pid="e.584W.5/1">National health service organisations and local authorities are responsible for nutrition screening policies. There are a number of initiatives in place to help organisations develop their policies. These include the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on malnutrition which recommends that all hospital in-patients be weighed, measured and have their Body Mass Index calculated on admission to hospital. Additionally, the &#8220;Essence of Care&#8221; benchmarking system includes a benchmark on &#8220;food and drink&#8221; which illustrates the good practice of screening and assessment of patients on initial contact with a health professional in health and social care settings. This is reinforced within the Council of Europe resolution on food and nutritional care in hospital recommending the screening of all patients on admission to hospital.</p>

	<p pid="e.588W.3/1">When establishing the Specialised Services Patient and Public Engagement Steering Group, the Department was mindful of the need to ensure broad representation from a range of different stakeholder interests without making the steering group so unwieldy that it would have problems discharging its functions. As such, in consultation with Specialised Services Commissioners, the Specialised Healthcare Alliance and the Department, a number of patient organisations were identified that would have different perspectives. The group has representatives from the two main umbrella organisations with an interest in specialised health care, the Specialised Healthcare Alliance and the Genetic Alliance UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.588W.3/2">In consultation with the Specialised Healthcare Alliance, it was agreed that additional members would represent a patient's organisation with a mental health focus; an organisation with a focus on children's health; and organisations with backgrounds in acute and chronic illnesses. It was also agreed to have a mix of small and large organisations, to gain a broad perspective. In addition, there is membership from a representative of the Richmond Group, representing 10 of the largest patient/service users organisations in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="e.588W.3/3">By selecting these organisations, we aim to ensure that the future model is aware of the different ways in which engagement would need to function for different types of health condition. The group is a &#8220;broad-church&#8221; to provide advice on the design of a future structure and as such does not aim to represent the unique and particular interests of every health condition. Its aim is to design a framework that can be used sensitively to ensure appropriate patient engagement across the range of specialised health services.</p>

Reducing the share of the illicit tobacco market also helps to reduce tobacco consumption, reduce organised crime in local communities, reduce potential revenue loss to the Treasury and support legitimate retailers. Latest estimates indicate action led by HM Revenue and Customs over the past decade has reduced the illicit share of the cigarette market down to 11% in 2009 (from 20% in 2000) and the illicit share of the hand-rolling tobacco market down to 49% in 2009 (from 60% in 2000).</p>

	<p pid="e.597W.2/2">Any revision of the special educational needs (SEN) Code of Practice following the SEN and disability Green Paper, &#8216;Support and aspiration&#8217;, will make clear that schools will continue to have a duty to &#8220;use their best endeavours&#8221; to make appropriate provision to meet the special educational needs of children with SEN but without education, health and care plans or SEN statements.</p>
	<p pid="e.597W.2/3">The Green Paper sets out a proposal that local authorities must publish a &#8220;local offer&#8221; of the support that is normally available for children with SEN or who are disabled and their families, and from whom.</p>
	<p pid="e.597W.2/4">The new inspection requirements set out in the Education Bill are quite explicit with regard to disability and SEN. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector (HMCI) will be required, when reporting on the quality of education in a school, to consider how the school meets the needs of pupils who have a disability and pupils who have special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.597W.2/5">We are also considering a package of measures to ensure that schools are properly accountable for outcomes for vulnerable pupils. We are exploring the options for publishing better information on pupil destinations on leaving school and on progress made by the lowest performers.</p>

However, in the recent Green Paper, &#8220;Support and aspiration: a new approach to special educational needs and disability&#8221;, we announced our intention to introduce Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 destination measures.

	<p pid="e.598W.3/1">In March 2011 the Government published their SEN and Disability Green Paper, &#8220;Support and aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability&#8221;. The Green Paper made wide ranging proposals to improve the efficiency of special educational needs provision across the country, including in Pendle. Consultation on the Green paper closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June</phrase> with over 2,300 responses received.</p>
	<p pid="e.598W.3/2">Proposals in the Green Paper include: a new single early years setting and school- based category of SEN; replacing the statutory SEN assessment and statement for children with complex needs and the Learning Difficulty Assessment for those aged 16-25 with a new, stronger single assessment and plan, called the Education, Health and Care plan; reducing the time limit for the statutory assessment process from 26 weeks to 20 weeks; a local offer, set out by local authorities and other services, of all services available to support children and young people who are disabled, or who have SEN and their families and the option of a personal budget by 2014 for all families with an Education, Health and Care plan.</p>
	<p pid="e.598W.3/3">The Green Paper also promotes a reduction in the bureaucratic burdens on professionals so that they can concentrate on helping children and young people fulfil their potential. It commits the Government to simplifying and improving statutory guidance for professionals working with children with SEN and disabilities so that it is clear accessible and helpful and to withdrawing guidance that does not provide useful support. In particular, we will shorten the SEN Code of Practice and incorporate within it other guidance that is considered helpful to professionals.</p>
	<p pid="e.598W.3/4">The process of commissioning pathfinders to test out some of our proposals began in June, to start from September 2011. Local pathfinders will show what is possible and whether central Government must act to facilitate local innovation, working with local areas and the voluntary and community sector to drive reforms.</p>

	<p pid="e.599W.0/1">Schools and agencies will continue to be responsible for appointing the most suitable supply teachers. The Department's Quality Mark scheme will continue to ensure the quality of supply teachers provided to schools by agencies. The Quality Mark recognises private sector agencies and local authorities which have demonstrated good practice in recruiting and managing supply teachers for schools. The award gives increased confidence to schools, parents and pupils that staff supplied through agencies have been recruited properly.</p>
	<p pid="e.599W.0/2">The Agency Workers Regulations will entitle agency supply teachers to be paid the same rates they would receive if they had been recruited by either the school or the local authority. This will only apply after the teacher has completed a qualifying period of 12 weeks in the same role with either the same school or local authority. After the qualifying period, teachers in maintained schools will be paid at their appropriate point on the main or upper pay scale in the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD). Teachers in academy schools which are outside the STPCD will be entitled to the same salaries as other teachers in the academy.</p>

	<p pid="e.599W.8/1">Skills are vital to achieve sustainable growth, prosperity, social mobility and fairness. The Skills Funding Agency is responsible for funding arrangements, and has made an allocation of &#163;14,151,665 for post-19 further education to colleges and training organisations in the London borough of Tower Hamlets for the 2011/12 academic year. This includes support for adult apprenticeships as the programme at the heart of the skills system we are building. The agency does not hold specific data relating to the constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow.</p>
	<p pid="e.599W.8/2">As well as apprenticeships, this investment will fully fund basic literacy and numeracy qualifications for those who left school without basic reading, writing and mathematics, and foundation learning and first full level 2 and level 3 qualifications for young adults. We will also fully fund units and full qualifications to support unemployed people into work who are in receipt of active benefits. The Government will continue to invest in training outside those areas where full subsidy is available, with the costs shared between the Government and the learner or employer.</p>
	<p pid="e.599W.8/3">From 2013/14, FE fee loans will be introduced for learning at Level 3 and above for those aged 24 and over.</p>
	<p pid="e.599W.8/4">Our investment for 2011/12 will also support Informal Adult and Community Learning in Tower Hamlets. Informal learning is an important part of the wider learning continuum and comprises a broad range of provision. We are currently reviewing nationally how to maximise this form of learning's contribution to initiatives such as building the Big Society through learning for personal development, digital inclusion and motivating people from disadvantaged groups and supporting their progression.</p>
	<p pid="e.599W.8/5">As part of our wider reforms, we have provided greater freedoms and flexibilities for FE colleges and training organisations, including simplifying funding so that colleges can manage their budgets more flexibly in line with priorities. This will place them in a better position to respond to the needs of learners, employers and communities to whom they will be increasingly accountable.</p>

I launched &#8220;Making Prisons Work: Skills for Rehabilitation&#8221;, the report on the review, at the Association of Colleges' offender learning conference in May, and took the opportunity whilst there to speak to representatives from further education colleges that provide offender learning. In addition, I have regular meetings with Martin Doel, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, and offender learning is often on our agenda.</p>

This ensures that any issues are sufficiently addressed with responses being provided by the most suitable partner. The correspondence covers a range of areas including questions about the parameters of the programme and comments when an individual has not had an application approved.

In the same period, there has only been 275 pieces of correspondence submitted to the Young People's Learning Agency regarding PCDLs. The Department's PCDL policy team has dealt with 40 letters since PCDLs replaced career development loans in July 2009.

	<p pid="e.609W.2/2">There is no estimate available for the effect of trade with EU member states on UK national income as the consequences of the counterfactual, the absence of trade with these countries, are particularly difficult to establish. However, there is no doubt that the single market is important to the UK's prosperity: it gives UK business access to the world's largest market with 500 million people generating about &#163;10 trillion economic activity. EU countries account for half of the UK's overall trade and foreign investments. As a result, around 3.5 million jobs in the UK are linked to the export of goods and services to the EU. Available estimates show that the greater level of trade liberalisation achieved through the single market leads EU countries to trading currently twice as much with each other as they would do otherwise. As a result, the single market may be responsible for income gains in the UK between 2% and 6%, that is between &#163;1,100 and &#163;3,300 a year per British household.</p>
	<p pid="e.609W.2/3">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is publishing a series of economic studies on trade related issues, as part of its work on the Trade and Investment White Paper. As these are being published, they are available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
