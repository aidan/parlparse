	<p pid="a.518W.2/21">Collection of council taxes continues once the financial year to which they relate has ended.

	<p pid="a.521W.3/1">The price of a home information pack will be set by the market, not by Government. The main components affecting costs are the searches and the energy performance certificate. Searches are already paid for in housing transactions at the moment and their cost varies substantially from area to area. Energy performance certificates are the only new element and could save buyers hundreds of pounds in fuel bills as well as having the potential to help them get access to green mortgages or grants from utility companies for energy saving improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/2">The price of HIP's will also be affected by the level of competition and economies of scale as well as factors such as the size and type of the property. At least one estate agent has said it will provide HIP's for free and others will provide them on a 'no sale, no fee' basis.</p>

The UK in turn has a right to expect this co-operation, and a responsibility to give all reasonable assistance to the Islands, and to respect their autonomy and work for its preservation. The most recent statement of the relationship between the UK and the Channel Islands is to be found in Part XI of Volume 1 of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution (1973).</p>

	<p pid="a.532W.10/1">The additional funding for elite sport, which was made available from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> last year, has enabled UK Sport to increase significantly the level of support for all Olympic and Paralympic sports (except football and tennis). In particular, it has allowed UK Sport to support those Olympic and Paralympic sports which had not previously received any high performance investment, including hockey, volleyball and handball.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.10/2">While it is too soon to link the additional investment to recent successes, it is clear that this enhanced level of support is beginning to bear fruit. For example, since the additional investment was made available:</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.10/3" class="indent">11 out of 12 sports with performance medal targets for their major championship either met or exceeded their medal count, agreed with UK Sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.10/4" class="indent">In the 11 sports which competed at world championship level in 2006, 23 medals were won in Olympic disciplines, including six world champions.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.10/5">Particular successes include the British Paralympic swimming team, which came first in the medal table in the 2006 IPC World Swimming Championships in South Africa, and the British cycling squad who finished top of the medal table at the recent UCI World Track Cycling Championships in Mallorca, winning a total of 11 medals, seven of which were gold. Team GB also came first in the medal table at the 29th European Indoor Athletics Championships in Birmingham with a haul of 10 medals, including four golds.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.10/6">UK Sport's investment strategy is also having a major impact on the professionalism and governance of British Olympic and Paralympic sports. At the time of the Budget announcement, UK Sport introduced a series of 'Funding Triggers' aimed at ensuring that the National Governing Bodies are all 'fit for purpose' to receive public funding and that the sport is able to deliver its agreed targets.</p>

Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of section 52 for financial year 1999-2000. School based expenditure in local authority maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br/> 2. School-based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. Central local authority expenditure cannot, in all cases, be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently is excluded from the tables.<br/> 3. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the section 52 form from the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row.<br/> 4. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02, this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards, only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some local authorities, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the central local authority part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br/> 5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) prior to the 1996-97 financial year in the county of Cleveland resulted in the creation of four new unitary local authorities (Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees). Consequently figures for Hartlepool LA are not available prior to 1996-97.<br/> 6. The Tees Valley sub-region comprises of the four unitary authorities created by the local government reorganisation of the county of Cleveland in 1996 (namely Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees LAs) along with the borough of Darlington which became a unitary authority in 1997. Consequently figures for the Tees Valley sub-region are not available prior to the 1997-98 financial year.<br/> 7. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/> 8. The 1999-2000 figures reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br/> 9. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;1,000. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 2 April 2007.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.546W.5/1">Free school meal rates give a broad indication of the level of deprivation among pupils attending a particular school. FSM information is collected by schools and accurately records pupils who are known by the school to be eligible for and claiming free school meals. The criteria for FSM eligibility are consistent across schools nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.546W.5/2">When assessing the level of deprivation among pupils within schools, the Department makes use of a range of different deprivation indicators. free school meals is an important indicator because it is the only one which reflects the actual home situation of individual pupils. Other indicators of deprivation, such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation, the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI), or ACORN categories, cannot directly identify pupils who are living in deprived households as they are only available on an &quot;area&quot; basis. These other indicators are used by linking to pupils indirectly through their home postcodes, and therefore can only reflect the extent to which pupils live in deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.546W.5/3">In certain contexts such as the calculation of contextual value added scores in the achievement and attainment tables, FSM is used together with an area-based indicator (IDACI) so that the two indicators together give a rounded picture of the levels of deprivation affecting each school.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.2/1">The DfES does not hold information on academy teaching staff, school leader or principals' salaries as these are matters for academy governors to resolve as independent schools with their principals. We are aware that head teachers' salaries in academies tend to be higher as they expect to recruit experienced head teachers and the challenges they can face are often immense. Sometimes, academy principal salaries are identified in advertisements and in March 2007 there were two academy principal posts currently advertised with identified salaries. These were in Sheffield, which offered a salary of &pound;80,000 and in Darlington, which offered a salary &quot;circa &pound;85,000&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.558W.8/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's (QCA) approach to the curriculum adopted in the secondary curriculum review is built on evidence from ongoing work with schools and colleges. The 'futures in action' programme, which has been running since 2005, has continued to demonstrate a high degree of consensus about many of the characteristics of how the curriculum should be shaped. QCA's work is also supported by the results of its annual curriculum monitoring programme which includes interviews and questionnaires with head teachers, deputy heads, teachers and pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.562W.0/3">Cross-government targets are to source at least 10 per cent. of electricity from renewable sources by 2008. In 2005-06 DEFRA purchased 63 per cent. of its electricity from renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.0/4">All major new build or refurbishment projects are subject to a sustainability review to ensure they fully embrace the Government's sustainability objectives. Renewable energy is a major element of this process.</p>

	<p pid="a.562W.0/11" class="indent">increase energy efficiency per m<sup>(2)</sup> by 30 per cent. by 2020, relative to 1999-2000 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.0/12">To achieve these targets, DEFRA has signed up to a Carbon Management Programme (CMP). Working with the Carbon Trust, the programme has enabled the Department to develop a systematic approach to carbon management and take a strategic approach to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions through operational improvements, reduced energy costs, staff awareness and monitoring initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.0/13">Utility information systems have enabled the Department to monitor and analyse energy consumption across the estate. This has enabled a focussed approach to identifying significant energy/carbon savings. Pilot projects have recently been implemented with a view to wider rollouts in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has regular contact with Foreign Minister Spanta and discussed border management with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during her recent visit to Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.0/2">The issue of policing Afghanistan's borders is covered by the International Police Coordination Board, on which our embassy in Kabul is represented by its chief police adviser. Embassy officials also attend monthly International Police Coordinated Action Group meetings chaired by the German Police Project Office (GPPO).</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.0/3">Currently the official establishment of the Afghan Border Police (ABP) is set at 12,000. However, should the overall establishment of the Afghan National Police rise from 62,000 to 82,000, as is currently being considered, then the revised establishment of the ABP will increase to 18,000. Presently, the actual number of ABP is approximately 7,900, deployed at 13 official land border crossing points, four international airports (Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif), and within a Quick Reaction Force and their HQ at the Ministry of Interior. In addition to static security at these fixed locations, they attempt to police at least another 400 unofficial land border crossing points located around the country. While it would be inappropriate to comment in detail on the precise surveillance techniques used at the border crossing points, we are aware this remains an area where the potential for major development exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.0/4">Developing the ABP remains one of the top priorities for the GPPO and will also be covered by the proposed European Security and Defence Policy mission to Afghanistan. The UK will continue to keep a keen interest in the ABP's development given its significance in helping to stem the flow of insurgents and weapons through the eastern and southern border areas, as well as the fight against the narcotic trade and other illicit smuggling activities. On the northern border, the UK is contributing to a European Commission project to build border infrastructure and capacity for the Afghan border police and customs in Badakhshan province.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.2/1">We welcome the steps that the Government of Kazakhstan has taken on human rights and democratic reform since independence. These include a moratorium on the death penalty, progress on prison reform including reduction of the number of persons in detention and the introduction of public monitoring of places of detention, and in December 2005 ratification of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/2">Political pluralism has, however, been affected negatively by recent legislation which restricts freedom of expression, association and assembly. The powers of the Parliament and Government and the independence of the judiciary could be further enhanced to introduce checks and balances into the system of administration. In December 2005, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights International Observation Mission noted that despite some administrative improvements, the presidential election did not meet international standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/3">Wherever possible, we look to work with the Kazakh authorities to improve the human rights situation. We have funded projects aimed at improving the conditions in prisons, preventing torture in places of detention and encouraging the abolition of the death penalty. We have continuing dialogue with the Government of Kazakhstan on transparency issues and are working closely with non-governmental organisations on this too. We also stand ready to work with President Nazarbayev on his programme of democratic reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/4">The OSCE has looked into the cases of Makhambet Abzhan and Azamat Zhetpisbayev and attended several of the related court hearings. We, with the OSCE and the EU, will keep a watching brief on both cases in view of the importance of respect for human rights and good governance in Kazakhstan.</p>

Councils are expected to take account of the relevant aspects of the HRA in their contracting arrangements, including those with care providers. Residents placed in a private care home under a council contract should, therefore, have their human rights protected through the contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.2/4">Residents in private care homes who fund the entire cost of their own care are not covered by the provisions of the HRA.</p>

	<p pid="a.574W.5/1">Use of medicines is a fundamental component of each of the national service framework (NSF) standards and there are common medicines elements for every standard. A document entitled 'Medicines for Older People' on implementing medicines-related aspects of the NSF for older people was included with the NSF documents when they were published. No specific information on compliance with the standards is collected centrally. However, national health service trusts are encouraged to make use of the medicines management framework which is specifically designed for hospitals as a self-assessment tool to evaluate processes in place to ensure clinical and cost-effective medicines use. Identifying whether medication review has taken place is generally only possible from patients' medical records.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.5/2">Care homes should meet the performance standards and milestones on medicines management set by the National Care Standards Commission. Care homes should seek advice from pharmacists about medicines in line with national minimum standards (NMS) for care homes for older people, and inspection teams visits to care homes should focus on medicines systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.5/3">Care homes are governed by the Care Homes Regulations 2001 and associated NMS, which are concerned with ensuring that services are safe and of good quality. The regulator, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, must have regard to the NMS when inspecting care homes to establish compliance with the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.5/4">The regulations and NMS, copies of which are available in the Library, include requirements for the recording, handling, safekeeping, safe administration and disposal of medicines in care homes. The NMS contain specific requirements for staff to monitor the condition of service users on medication, to call in the service user's GP if they are concerned about any change in condition that may be a result of medication, and prompt the review of medication on a regular basis. The NMS are under review at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.583W.5/2">The Government are committed to reducing the number of patients who are delayed in hospital, when they could be better cared for elsewhere. Councils and their national health service partners have already made significant progress in reducing delays in hospital. Between September 2001 and December 2006, the number of people over the age of 75 delayed in hospital reduced from 5,673 to 1,651&mdash;a reduction of 71 per cent. Total delays for the same period were reduced from 7,065 to 2,190&mdash;a reduction of 69 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.5/3">Intermediate care can be used to facilitate discharge from hospital, reducing the period of time the individual has to stay there. This aims to help speed recovery, re-establish the individual's independence and maintain social and community links. It can be used to respond to, or avert, a health crisis and thereby act as an alternative to hospital admission. This policy also has the effect of reducing demand on secondary care resources, making beds available and reducing the likelihood of readmission. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, there were 29,644 intermediate care places, benefiting over 393,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.5/4">A key goal of the White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, is to provide better prevention and early intervention for improved health, independence and well-being. Support for implementation is being provided by various pilot sites. These include 30 care closer to home demonstrations, that are working across six specialties to offer more care in community settings, including step-down facilities allowing people to be discharged from hospital to facilities near their home.</p>

	<p pid="a.585W.2/1">Predicting the effect of the administration of Tamiflu is dependant on whether or not the unknown virus will be sensitive to Tamiflu, the clinical attack rate, the characteristic complications profile of the as yet unknown virus, the antiviral policy (such as targeted treatment or treating everyone), other interventions, and the effect of antivirals and other interventions on reducing spread. It is not a fixed figure. We use 25 per cent., 35 per cent. and 50 per cent. as our standard raw clinical attack rates for planning purposes because the pandemics of the 20th century had attack rates between 25 per cent. and 35 per cent. in the UK whereas 50 per cent. is the reasonable worst case.</p>
	<p pid="a.585W.2/2">Overall, on prescribed medical and scientific advice, the administration of antivirals is expected to reduce the proportion of clinical cases who require hospitalisation and the case fatality rate&mdash;possibly by up to 50 per cent. In such calculations many assumptions need to be made, of which only two are that Tamiflu will be as effective against a pandemic strain as against seasonal influenza and that antiviral treatment will reach the patient within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.</p>

The Agency is currently out to consultation on detailed guidance on compliance, which it has sought to tailor to the needs of small businesses. In addition, the Agency has decided to make public the developing list of United Kingdom health claims on its website, which should help small businesses monitor what claims are available for general use and help them co-ordinate effort to register missing claims.</p>

	<p pid="a.592W.0/1">There are two breeding and supply centres within the European Union that are accepted as suitable sources of non-human primates intended for use in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom, none in the USA, and five outside the European Union. It is not Home Office policy to name overseas supply centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/2">The guiding principle applied in appraising overseas breeding and supply centres is that they should meet the relevant standards set out in the Home Office code of practice for the housing and care of animals in designated breeding and supplying establishments at least in respect of animals destined for the United Kingdom. Minor deviations from those standards, such as minor variations in cage heights, may be acceptable provided that they do not have adverse consequences for the welfare of the animals at the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/3">The International Primatological Society (IPS) guidelines for the acquisition, care and breeding of non-human primates are not a set of minimum compliance criteria for supplying animals for use in the United Kingdom. Rather, they are considered to provide guidance on good practice to which all breeders of non-human primates should aspire. Except where they differ from the requirements of the United Kingdom code of practice, Home Office policy is that compliance by overseas centres with the IPS guidelines is generally expected and overseas centres are required to identify any areas in which they do not meet the standards of the IPS guidelines when seeking acceptance as suppliers to the United Kingdom. However, not all of the IPS guidelines are appropriate in all circumstances. For example, providing a fixed light-dark cycle cannot apply where, as is the case in many source countries, animals experience natural daylight/day length throughout the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/4">Providing any deviation from the UK code of practice provisions does not have a material adverse effect on animal welfare, centres may be deemed acceptable as overseas sources. On this basis, all of the overseas supply centres currently accepted by the Home Office as suitable sources of non-human primates are judged to have appropriate animal welfare standards, even though they do not comply with every provision of the code of practice and IPS guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.605W.4/1">It is not possible to determine the total cost of heating the buildings on the House of Commons estate. All the buildings are heated by natural gas boilers which are not metered separately; the gas meters record total consumption for providing hot water services as well as heating. The approximate total gas consumption and cost for each of the last three years has been:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.605W.4/4"> <td></td> <td><i> Consumption MWh</i></td> <td><i> Cost (&pound; million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.605W.4/5"> <td>2003-04</td> <td>21.5</td> <td>0.3</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.605W.4/6"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>20.0</td> <td>0.3</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.605W.4/7"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>21.6</td> <td>0.4</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.605W.4/10">The increase in cost for 2005-06 is mainly due to significant increases in the unit price of gas in that year. Gas consumption reduced in 2004-05 and then increased in 2005-06; due to fluctuations in heating energy consumption caused by variations in outside temperatures measured in Degree Days. The following table shows the Degree Days for the Thames Valley region which includes London. From these figures a higher consumption would have been expected in 2005-06. That it was not so is due the installation of more efficient Palace boilers in 2004.</p>

The February claw-back has therefore been reversed and repaid to pharmacies in the March monthly payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.612W.3/1">Research organisations across the UK were invited in January to provide information on energy related research capacity, capabilities and resources and to indicate any interest in hosting the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) director and support staff. The submissions are being considered by representatives of the industrial and public sector funding partners who will prepare initial advice for the ETI Board, once legally established, and the director, once appointed, to consider in detail and to follow-up as appropriate. Decisions will be a matter for the ETI itself. The key criteria being used to assess the submissions to host the ETI director are:</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.3/2" class="indent">Reputation and culture: in particular, a world class reputation for research and development across a range of energy themes; and strong existing industrial and academic relationships, with sustained collaborative working and networking track record;</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.3/3" class="indent">Space, facilities and location: including ability to expand to provide a suite of office/conferencing facilities commensurate with the developing needs and aspirations of the ETI, thus providing a showcase for the ETI; with good communications and access;</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.3/4" class="indent">Commitment to support and promote ETI; and</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.3/5" class="indent">Value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.612W.3/7">Once specific research and development programmes have been determined by ETI, the selection of research partners will be based on those best equipped to undertake the programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.630W.8/5" class="indent">The Child Support Agency retains the power to pursue a non-resident parent who moves overseas, only where the non-resident is regarded to be habitually resident in the UK. The criteria for establishing Child Support jurisdiction when a non-resident parent leaves the United Kingdom is described at Section 44 of the Child Support Act. There is no distinction made between an EU state and a non-EU state.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.8/6" class="indent">There are certain cases where the nature of employment will bring the non-resident parent under the jurisdiction of the Child Support Agency, for example those employed in the Civil Service or a member of the naval, military or air forces. The Agency may also have jurisdiction where a non-resident parent is employed by a company that is prescribed in Child Support (Maintenance Arrangement and Jurisdiction Regulations) 1992, Regulation 7A(2).</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.8/7" class="indent">If the non-resident parent is not regarded as habitually resident in the UK, then the Agency has no power to pursue. However the courts may be able to help the parent with care in obtaining ongoing child support maintenance, whether there is already a court order or not. The Department for Constitutional Affairs in the UK is responsible for the administration of reciprocal enforcement arrangements with more than 100 countries and territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.8/8" class="indent">Once an application is sent to the foreign authorities it will be dealt with according to laws and procedures of that country. The UK has no control over how long that process will take but will periodically check on the progress of a case with the foreign authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.8/9" class="indent">I hope you find this response helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.5/1">The national strategy for older people and an ageing society: Opportunity Age, Meeting the challenges of ageing in the 21<sup>(st)</sup> century was launched in March 2005. It focuses on promoting independence and well-being in later life, extending opportunities to work in later life, supporting healthy active ageing in our communities and giving older people more choice and independence in how they use the services at their disposal. The strategy celebrates the fact that people are living longer lives and highlights the valuable and increasing contribution that older people make to our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.5/2">Already, much has been achieved. We have made major reforms of policies (including the biggest package of reform on pensions since the Second World War); started modernising services around the needs of the customer, including through a wide range of pilot programmes such as Link-Age Plus, Individual Budgets, and PoPPs. We have significantly increased spending for older people (on pensions and benefits, health, care, free bus travel, winter warmth).</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.5/3">Incomes of pensioners have increased broadly in line with those in work; and for the first time ever in a period of sustained economic growth, pensioners are now no more likely to be living in poverty than people of working age. Older people's well-being has improved across a broad range of indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.5/4">The strategy also addresses the needs of the baby boomer generation by helping them make the right choices to ensure retirement is a time of opportunity: by tackling age discrimination; ending the cliff edge from work into retirement; and helping them to balance work and caring responsibilities.</p>
