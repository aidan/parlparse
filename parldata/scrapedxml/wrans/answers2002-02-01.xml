	<p pid=".569W.2/1">I have asked the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) to carry out a joint study with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport examining long-term sports policy. The project team will consider the roles and responsibilities of Government, and the private and voluntary sectors in helping sport better achieve the objectives of increased grassroots participation in sport and elite sporting excellence. The project team will clarify the roles and responsibilities and interventions of Government to help sport better achieve its own objectives. They will develop an overall strategy for guiding Government's decisions on sports policy (including major events), and review the existing institutional and financial arrangements, in the context of Government's own wider objectives. The initial scoping note for the project is available on the PIU website <a href="http://www.piu.gov.uk/2001/sport/scope.shtml">http:///www.piu.gov.uk/2001/sport/scope.shtml</a>. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will be the Sponsor Minister for the project. The unit aims to complete its study by summer 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".571W.2/5">The success of these various initiatives will be measured by the numbers and quality of applications received for individual programmes, a reduction in the number of ineligible applications, success in reaching targeted groups, such as marginalised and minority ethnic groups, and in the use made of the website. Monitoring will be undertaken by the departments managing individual programmes. The Active Community Unit is currently devising a common evaluation framework by which the success of simplification of small grants will be measured.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.2/6">There is no one Minister with specific responsibility for the rationalising and simplification of access to state funding for the voluntary and community sector, although I have responsibility for the Active Community Unit and will be taking a particular interest in this issue.</p>

	<p pid=".572W.5/2">The Government believe that valid registration can help combat mobile phone theft by identifying the customer with his or her phone in order to authorise the blacklisting of stolen SIM cards or, where technically possible, the disabling of the stolen handset itself. It is already the case that contract phone users are required by all mobile phone operators to register their details and that the Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card inside each mobile phone identifies the user with a full name, address and landline number (if available).</p>
	<p pid=".572W.5/3">Registration of pre-pay mobile phones is not at present compulsory. This is partly due to the European Community Communications Data Protection Directive 97/66 which encourages the development of telecommunications service options which allow anonymous or strictly private access, and also because compulsory registration may disadvantage low income users, who may be of no fixed abode. Orange is the only operator to require registration details from its pre-pay customers. We are encouraging the other major operators, which all have voluntary registration schemes for pre-pay customers, to enhance take-up of these schemes. We will keep the need for legislation under review on this and other measures.</p>

The changes are set out in the Heads of Agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/2">The changes include a new competence-related payment of &pound;1,002 at the top of each of the federated ranks' pay scales.

	<p pid=".574W.2/3">Under the new special priority payments scheme, officers could qualify for one-off payments of between &pound;500 and &pound;5,000 a year. Chief officers and police authorities will draw up a local scheme of payments, in consultation with local staff associations, having regard to national criteria and to guidance from the Secretary of State. The national criteria are that posts carry a significantly higher responsibility than the norm for the rank; or are particularly difficult to fill; or have specially arduous working conditions. All parties in PNB recognise that there are a number of specialist posts where long hours are a necessary and integral part of the officers' role rather than due to management failure.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/4">In addition, chief constables will be able to award bonuses of between &pound;50 and &pound;500 for occasional work of an outstandingly demanding, unpleasant or important nature, such as hostage negotiation, or fingerprinting and searching badly decomposed bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/5">The Police Federation was party to the negotiations in PNB when it had the opportunity to make representations on all the proposed new payments.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.2/4">Not all fines and fixed penalties will have been paid.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.2/5">All fixed penalty fine revenue is passed to Her Majesty's Treasury. However, in April 2000, eight partnership areas, comprising local police forces, local authorities, highways authorities and magistrates courts, piloted a new 'netting-off' scheme. This allows a proportion of the fixed penalty fine revenue from speed and red-light cameras to be re-invested to fund camera enforcement. Fine revenue is used to meet each of the partners' costs in relation to the administration, purchase, installation, operation and maintenance of the cameras.</p>

The wastage rates quoted include voluntary withdrawal, medical discharge, discharge by purchase and discharge Services No Longer Required.</p>

	<p pid=".595W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence keeps under continuous review its capability requirements in this area. To date, studies have concluded that the roles currently met by BL 755 are likely to be carried out by a range of different weapons in the future. Some of the roles will be met by existing or planned systems such as Maverick and Brimstone. This work has also concluded that cluster bombs will still retain some utility, particularly against area targets such as storage depots and concentrations of lighter armoured vehicles. No other weapon is currently available to meet the same military objectives. To fulfil the same role as cluster bombs with unitary bombs would require a far greater weight of explosives, which would risk far greater damage than using cluster bombs.</p>

	<p pid=".596W.11/2">The Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) entered service in January 2002. As a result of a delay in the In Service Date, the Ministry of Defence has incurred additional costs of approximately &pound;7 million. These include extra intramural expenditure and costs arising from the need to maintain Sidewinder missiles in service. During the period in question we have also been without the additional capability provided by the ASRAAM missile. Liquidated damages associated with the late delivery of the missiles are being claimed from the manufacturer. Overall, the total procurement cost of ASRAAM remains less than the original approved cost.</p>

It is administered on behalf of the Ministry of Defence by The Royal British Legion and the MOD contributes seven-eighths of the costs of a visit. Over the past 17 years, this scheme has enabled over 4,000 widows to make this very special journey and there are no plans to change the arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".599W.6/3">Our first priority has been to concentrate on reducing the risk of further computer theft and losses, and of enhancing computer security to limit the damage should they occur. From an initial review of the available historical data we assess that there are two main reasons for this increase in the number of reported incidents:</p>
	<p pid=".599W.6/4" class="indent">since 1995 there has been a substantial and sustained growth in the numbers of all types of computer equipment used in support of Defence activity, reflecting a similar trend across Government and in society at large; and</p>
	<p pid=".599W.6/5" class="indent">there has also been a significant increase in the MOD's use of portable computers, which, by their nature, are particularly vulnerable to theft.</p>

	<p pid=".600W.9/1">A full assessment has been made of the transportation of Tornado aircraft from the UK to the Falkland Islands. This included options for air-to-air refuelling, airlift charter, ship and C-17. Given all of the constraints, the C-17 was deemed to be the most suitable operational option and the one that gave the best value for money and best value for effort.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.9/2">Until mid-January 2002, the threat assessment presented by surface-to-air missiles, specifically to identifiable military aircraft, limited our use of RAF aircraft operating into Afghanistan. The use of civilian Antonovs was less restricted. We therefore, chartered Antonovs for the essential operational movement of vehicles, equipment and supplies. While the C-17 is now being used for airlift to Afghanistan, the size of the task necessitates the continued charter of Antonov aircraft.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.9/3">The Antonov has been chartered by MOD on 35 occasions since the delivery of the C-17 in May 2001. All of the tasks have been in support of operations. The C-17 has been used extensively for Operation Bessimer in Macedonia, Exercise Saif Sareea II and other operational tasks associated with Operation Veritas.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.9/4">It is not, therefore, a question of a simple cost comparison between the use of C-17 or Antonovs. Both were needed to support operations.</p>

	<p pid=".601W.5/1">Figures for the amount the Ministry of Defence spends on defence equipment and non-equipment for the years 1998&ndash;99 to 2001&ndash;02 are published by the Defence Analytical Services Agency in UK Defence Statistics (available in the Library of the House). These data, which are given in the table, are broadly split by type ie whether it is air, land, sea or 'other' equipment for the years where this information is available. The 'other' category refers to equipment not specific to a particular environment. This division (air, land, sea and other) does not necessarily match the particular end destination of the equipment (ie RAF, Army and Navy). For example, not aerospace equipment is used by the RAF.</p>
	<p pid=".601W.5/2">During 1999&ndash;2000, we estimate that the MOD spent some &pound;600 million on defence equipment directly with contractors based in Scotland. A breakdown of this into air, land, sea and 'other' is not available.</p>

From April 2002, however, the weekly Payable Order Book method of payment applicable to some 2 per cent. of all pensioners, will cease. Under the new arrangements they will have the option of having their pension credited to a bank of building society account, or by a voucher sent to their home address encashable through a bank or building society. Both options allow payments to be made on a weekly or monthly basis.</p>

	<p pid=".611W.2/2" class="indent">92 per cent. of shops which opened on Sundays before the 1994 Act, paid employees a premium rate. There was no evidence that any shops had stopped paying premium rates after the introduction of the act.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.2/3" class="indent">At the time of the survey in 1996, 50 per cent. of shops paid the premium rate at 'double' time or 'time and three quarters,' 41 per cent. at 'time and a half' or 'time and a quarter' and 7 per cent. received an extra 'flat rate'. Larger shops tended to pay the higher premium rates.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.2/4" class="indent">Following the introduction of the 1994 Sunday Trading Act, 18 per cent. of all shops increased the premium rate, 57 per cent. left the rate unchanged and 25 per cent. reduced the rate.</p>

	<p pid=".615W.5/1">The procedure for appointing the independent members to the Strategy Board will be open and transparent with appointments made on the basis of merit. While the appointments do not fall within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, the procedures follow the principles and best practice laid down in the Commissioner's Code. I have employed search consultants to help us with the process.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.5/2">The appointments will be advertised on the Department's website which will include an information pack containing details of the full procedure, job and person specification, and how to apply. This information will also explain the process for appointing independent members to an Executive Board, chaired by the Permanent Secretary, and to other Boards across the Department. Analogous procedures to those outlined above will be adopted for all these appointments.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.5/3">I see this as an unprecedented opportunity for the Department to benefit from fresh thinking. Candidates will be drawn from a wide range of fields and backgrounds. Their role will not be to represent any particular interest; rather we are looking for people to help us improve internal processes, service delivery and change management. They will not take decisions, but will have an important challenging and advisory role. I will announce the appointments during May.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.5/4">In addition, we will shortly be advertising for the posts of Chief Economic Adviser and Director General, Science, Technology and Innovation. Both are Senior Civil Service appointments.</p>

	<p pid=".618W.0/1">We have received a number of representations on the prevention of illegal imports of meat and food from a wide variety of sources, including Members of Parliament, the farming industry and the public. We have introduced a number of new measures aimed at combating illegal imports and will be taking into account the views expressed as we consider what further measures may be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.0/2">DEFRA receives many approaches about investment in research of all kinds and this information is available to the public via documents and the website. The funding per annum on the Animal Health and Welfare research programme is approximately &pound;37.4 million. This is being kept under review in the light of the FMD outbreak and any inquiry recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.2/1">The progressive alignment of EU area payment rates for oilseeds with those for cereals is provided for in Council Regulation 1251/99, which implements the decisions on CAP reform taken by the European Council in March 1999, as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement.</p>

This assessment will therefore form part of the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.2/3">In addition, in response to a request from the Agriculture Council in December 2000, the European Commission has already produced a report on the options for increasing EU plant protein production following the Council's decision to ban meat and bone meal (MBM) from animal rations. The report notes that there is a plentiful supply of plant proteins on the world market and that EU is already the world's largest importer of oilmeals. In the light of this, it concludes that the most cost effective and least trade distorting solution is to look to the world market to make-up the gap left by the MBM ban, rather than to subsidise additional EU plant protein production. The Government agree with the Commission's analysis and fully supports the conclusions reached.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.4/2">The National Service Framework (NSF) for older people, published in March 2001, outlines a programme of action for the national health service to reduce the incidence of stroke in the population and to ensure that those who have had a stroke have prompt access to integrated care services. A programme of research to underpin the implementation of the NSF is currently being planned by the Department. Funders forums have been established in cardiovascular disease research and in older people's research; research into stroke is likely to be of interest to both.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.4/3">The Department's main national programmes of research which includes the NHS research and development programmes and the policy research programme, are currently funding a number of research projects into stroke. These include many projects with forward commitments over the next three years. Details of projects are available on the national research register at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/research/nrr.htm">www.doh.gov.uk/research/nrr.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.4/4">The NHS research and development programme on service delivery and organisation has recently funded a five-year project on &quot;Continuity of care in stroke and its relation to outcomes&quot;. A call for proposals has recently been advertised for the NHS research and development programme on the new and emerging applications of technology, which includes stroke as one of the priority areas. Funding will be dependent on the quality of proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.4/5">In addition to funding specific projects, the Department also provides and will continue to provide support for research commissioned by charities and the research councils that takes place in the NHS. Much of this will include research on strokes.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.4/6">The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC operates in response mode, and it is therefore difficult to predict expenditure over the coming years. However the MRC spent &pound;3.4 million on stroke research in 2000&ndash;01 and does not anticipate a major change to this level of support.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.7/1">Sir Kenneth Calman, the then chief medical officer, published his annual report on <phrase class="date" code="1996-09-25">25 September 1996</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="1997-09-30">30 September 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1998-09-09">9 September 1998</phrase>. Since then no similar reports have been published. Although the previous format served its purpose well in the past, the practice of the report containing descriptions of a wide range of Government policies added to the detailed nature of the reports and such information is well covered in other reports and is freely available on the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.7/2">When Professor Donaldson took up the post of chief medical officer in September 1998, he took stock of the publications issued by the chief medical officer and introduced a number of changes. One of these changes was to introduce a new style of report which is shorter, more focused and more accessible. The first use of this new format for his annual report was in December 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.7/3">Since his term of office Professor Donaldson has produced a number of major reports including: &quot;An organisation with a memory: report of an expert group on learning from adverse events in the National Health Service&quot;; &quot;Supporting Doctors, Protecting Patients&quot;; &quot;Stem Cell Research: Medical Progress with Responsibility&quot;; &quot;Building a safer NHS for patients&quot; and &quot;The Removal, Retention and Use of Human Organs and Tissue from Post-mortem Examination&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.8/1">The modernisation enabling projects identify gaps within the electronic record development and implementation programme (ERDIP). These pieces of work will be for a short timescale and with a minimum amount of funding as a major investment has already been made within the ERDIP programme. These sites have already received various amounts of funding over and above health authority allocations. The Department is currently considering a small number of sites that can do additional work linked to NHS Plan priorities that can be delivered by the <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-05">5 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".621W.8/2">ERDIP is a national co-ordination programme, which seeks to develop solutions to national problems. The purpose of setting up the demonstrator communities was to: demonstrate the achievements in improving health and healthcare through making faster progress in their plans to modernise care, and demonstrating robust techniques and good practice reproducible on a national basis; act as a focus for the identification, definition and testing of standards and good practice; raise awareness of what is possible, and the health and healthcare benefits that can be achieved; and provide learning and feedback for the wider National Health Service community. The two patient access sites at Bury Knowle and Hadfield are an integral part of this programme.</p>
	<p pid=".621W.8/3">A key element of the information management and technology strategy is to enable health communities to make decisions on procurement of software and hardware based on existing systems and reflecting local circumstances. The Government are supporting the NHS in this by ensuring that the additional money allocated for the implementation of the targets in 'Information for Health, Building the Information Core' and the NHS Plan reaches the level at which the decisions are taken. A majority of the money therefore goes out as part of health authority allocations.</p>

The research also suggests that home care hours for older people will need to increase by 7.5 per cent. over the same period. These projections assume current patterns of care.

	<p pid=".624W.0/1">It is not our intention to issue new guidance to strategic health authorities regarding eligibility criteria for free continuing care. The guidance issued in June 2001 (Health Service Circular 2001/015:Local Authority Circular (2001)18) reflects the legal position outlined in ex-parte Coughlan. The legal position has not changed since the guidance was issued.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.0/2">It was made clear at paragraph 15 of the guidance that as health authorities are replaced by SHAs they should align their inherited continuing and ensure only one set of criteria exist across each SHA.</p>

	<p pid=".625W.2/1">Speech and language therapists have a broad range of responsibilities and autism is one of the many important disorders with which they can help. The proportion of their time devoted to treatment of people with autism varies according to local needs assessment. So it is not possible to quantify the amount of speech and language therapy that is used to specifically treat autism. As at September 2000 there were 5,343 (headcount) speech and language therapists working in the national health service with 4,070 whole-time equivalents.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/2">Between 1997 and 2000 the number of speech and language therapists working in the national health service has increased by 560 (11 per cent.) and the number of training places available for students has increased by over a hundred since 1998. There will be further increases in the number of students entering training as a result of the NHS Plan commitment to provide 4,450 more training places each year for therapists and other health professionals by 2004. The increased investment in training, work to make the national health service a better employer and investment in return to practice initiatives will result in a continuing increase in the number of speech therapists available to work in the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/3">It is for health authorities in partnership with primary care groups/trusts and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services.</p>

	<p pid=".633W.2/2">The Government have made a significant investment in support of SEN. Through the Department's standards fund 2001&ndash;02, we are supporting local expenditure of &pound;82 million on SEN. One of the expenditure headings is in-service training and development of teachers, and other staff, including learning support assistants. In 2002&ndash;03, we are increasing this investment to &pound;91 million. Training will again be a major component, extended to cover training in disability, as well as SEN, in order to help schools and local education authorities prepare for their responsibilities under the Special Education Needs and Disability Act 2001, and the implementation of the new SEN Code of Practice.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.2/3">In addition, the Department has also introduced in 2002&ndash;03 two new funding streams specifically to support the creation of new training opportunities and resources for teachers, and other staff, linked to a number of key priorities. One of these is supporting those who work with pupils with learning difficulties, including pupils with autistic spectrum disorders. Competitive bids have been invited from voluntary organisations, as part of the Department's SEN small programmes fund, and from higher education institutions, under the new SEN training and development fund. &pound;2 million will able available under these initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.2/4">With regard to advertising campaigns, the Government have introduced a significant number of recruitment measures to help schools to recruit the teachers they need. The grant that my Department provides the Teacher Training Agency to enable it to discharge its functions includes funding to cover advertising costs. The standards fund support I have referred to assists teachers to acquire specialist knowledge.</p>

Better outcomes for children with autism are encouraged by early identification and intervention to meet their special educational needs. In 2002, the Department for Education and Skills will be publishing guidance for schools, local education authorities and others which will include pointers to good practice on provision for children with autism, including early identification. The Department will continue to work with the National Autistic Society and other interested parties to raise awareness of autism and improve provision for children with the condition.</p>
