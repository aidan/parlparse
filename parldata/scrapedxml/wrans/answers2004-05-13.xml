	<p pid=".471W.6/1">The Government recognise that with the expected reduction in the number of landfill sites taking hazardous waste from July 2004, hazardous waste could travel further in the short term. Nevertheless, it is recognised that even under the present system significant amounts of special waste travel across the country. In 2002, 42 per cent. of hazardous waste crossed a regional boundary. Government have not commissioned any specific studies to evaluate the forthcoming changes on this specific issue. Clearly in the longer term, the implementation of the Landfill Directive requirements will see an increase in treatment costs, which in turn will provide a greater incentive for hazardous waste minimisation and the use of more sustainable treatment technologies.</p>

	<p pid=".473W.5/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that all the growth areas are equipped with the water and sewerage services and infrastructure necessary to guarantee the long-term health of these communities. To achieve this, we recognise the importance of involving the respective water undertakers and environmental regulators at an early stage in the development of proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.5/3">The Environment Agency has previously (June 2003) provided companies with draft breakdowns of the indicative housing numbers by sub-region and company area, to assist in draft Water Resource Plans work. But given the varying and quickly evolving extent of information available, the Water Resources Planning Guideline (issued by the Environment Agency to companies on how they should produce their water resources plans) is not prescriptive about how companies should take account of the sustainable communities plan. However, the Environment Agency report &quot;Securing water supply&quot; (November 2003) states that it will work with companies to understand the implications and that:</p>
	<p pid=".473W.5/4" class="indent">'Where appropriate companies should ensure that they have included the latest proposals in the sustainable communities initiative in their plans'.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.5/5">The Environment Agency expects the water companies supplying the Milton Keynes/South Midlands area to provide their best available estimates of the impacts of the sustainable communities programme on their supply demand balance contained in their water resources plans. However, it is recognised that the next periodic review will have access to more definitive numbers.</p>

There were objections to the application and correspondence was received from the constituency MP and from MPs representing users of the campsite.</p>

In the light of the mediator's report, I agreed to issue a camping exemption certificate to the Woodcraft Folk for one year, subject to further discussion between the parties to resolve outstanding issues.</p>

	<p pid=".476W.0/1">At the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the Chancellor had various discussions with Finance Ministers. In addition to continuing to support countries in making progress through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, it was recognised that there was an urgent need to support countries as they emerge from conflict and progress towards participation in the initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.0/2">It was also recognised that it was important to take forward work on the debt sustainability framework that the IMF and World Bank have proposed, in order to support long-term debt sustainability for poor countries.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.0/3">However, debt relief alone is not sufficient. All HIPC countries will need additional aid to meet the millennium development goals (MDGS). That is why the UK's proposal for an international finance facility is so important. It can provide the much-needed substantial increase in resources&mdash;in the form of grants, concessional loans, or further debt relief&mdash;needed to attain the MDGS.</p>

Following the developing country statement at the 8 April conference, both the G24 and African Governors endorsed the IFF and called on donors to implement the proposal. The World Bank's interim paper on Financing Modalities found that the IFF is technically feasible and concluded that frontloading of aid holds considerable attractions. Communiqu&eacute;s looked forward to reviewing the on-going joint World Bank and IMF work on aid effectiveness, absorptive capacity and, results-based measurement mechanisms, such as an IFF, at the Annual Meetings in September 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".478W.3/1">The UK has the largest insurance industry in Europe. Implementing the IMD is a key step in completing the single market in financial services, and will enhance consumer protection in an important sector of financial business. The UK market for selling insurance is competitive with many players giving customers wide choice, and this will continue in the new regime. Already thousands of firms have applied to the FSA for authorisation for the new regime.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/2">The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 requires the FSA to publish a cost-benefit analysis of its proposed rules and guidance. The FSA has published cost benefit analysis in each of its consultation papers, which includes analysis of the market impact on firms. These state that regulation might result in some reduction in the number of firms selling insurance. In particular they stated that some businesses for whom selling insurance was a marginal activity may withdraw from the market once subject to statutory regulation. However there will be thousands of firms in the market providing consumers with a wide choice. The FSA have estimated that around 20,000 new firms will come into regulation as a result of mortgage and general insurance regulation and the vast majority of these will be involved in general insurance business.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/3">The Government have consulted widely on the regulatory regime, publishing a public consultation document including draft regulations and a draft regulatory impact assessment in October 2002. Following analysis of the responses to the consultation, Parliament approved legislation on 24 June 2003. The activities to be regulated are: introducing, proposing or carrying out other work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance; assisting in the administration and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim; and concluding contracts of insurance. In drawing up its rules for insurance mediation, the FSA has carried out extensive public consultation on its rules.

	<p pid=".478W.3/4">FSA regulation of insurance brokers will commence from 14 January 2005. This date is two years from the publication of the directive in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities. All member states have to implement the directive by this date.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/5">In implementing the directive the Government and the FSA have worked closely with the industry to design a regulatory regime that takes account of market practice, and does not load the industry and ultimately the consumer with unnecessary costs. Both the Government and the FSA have been concerned to minimise the impact on smaller firms and sole traders.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/6">The fees charged are a matter for the FSA. Application fees for insurance intermediaries have been set following consultation with the industry and are based on the volume of business undertaken. Up to 50 per cent. discount is offered for an early application together with further discount if the application is made   electronically. Smaller intermediaries seeking authorisation could pay a fee of only &pound;500. If a firm is already authorised by the FSA for other regulated activities, the application fee it would pay for IMD activities is halved. The periodic annual fee which will be charged by the FSA for on-going supervision of authorised intermediaries following the commencement of regulation has not yet been set and will be the subject of a forthcoming consultation this summer.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/7">Monitoring the implementation of the IMD across the EU is a matter for the Commission. The UK has focused its efforts on the implementation of the IMD in the UK market. We do however have informal working level contacts with other member states.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.14/2">The size of this cost depends upon behavioural effects and any estimate of cost would inevitably be very broad-brush. However, given the potential additional pension savings from those in the top 1 per cent. of the earnings distribution, plus the possibility of the additional scope for tax avoidance or evasion, the cost to the Exchequer could be up to several hundred million pounds over this period.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.8/1">Member states are permitted only to introduce reduced rates of VAT from the prescribed list of goods and services as set out in Annex H of the EC Sixth VAT Directive. There is no general provision in Annex H for devices which improve safety in the home.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/2">But Annex H does allow a reduced rate for certain works to housing and the Government have used this to introduce a reduced rate of VAT for the grant-funded installation of certain security measures (for example window and door-locks and smoke alarms), when installed at the same time as energy saving materials or central heating systems also paid for by a qualifying grant. Qualifying grants are targeted at people aged 60 or over and those receiving specified benefits, so the related reduced rate is similarly well targeted at those who need help most.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/3">The UK's existing zero rates also cover a number of measures that contribute to safety in the home, such as burglar alarms and security lights, but only if they are installed in new homes at the time of construction.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/4">A review of the reduced rate provisions is currently under way in Europe and the Government have made clear in these negotiations that we will not agree to the removal of any of our zero and reduced rate VAT derogations.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.8/1">Very high cost criminal cases (VHCCCs) represent around l per cent. of all Crown court cases but take up (currently) around 51 per cent. of Crown court expenditure (&pound;250&ndash;300 million). Over the last three years the percentage increase in the cost of the most expensive 1,000 criminal cases in each year has been 14 per cent. The new contracting scheme, which now applies to all these cases, introduces greater control and works on the basis of fixed rates for both barristers and solicitors. Cases are paid for as each stage is completed. That is an advantage from the lawyer's point of view over the former system where cases are on average paid two years after their start.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.8/2">The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and I are concerned about the refusal by barristers to take on some very high cost criminal cases (VHCCCs) under the contracting regime which now applies to all cases. We have therefore set up a Review Committee with the Bar and Law Society to examine the VHCCC regime and report by 28 May 2004. The committee also includes the Legal Services Commission, the Treasury and the Crown Prosecution Service. I am pleased to note that the Chairman of the Bar has written to his members to help ensure that the essential public interest priorities are met pending the outcome of the review.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.8/3">The VHCCC Review Committee met for the first time on 26 April, under the chairmanship of Ian Magee CB (Second Permanent Secretary at the Department of Constitutional Affairs, and Chief Executive, Operations with responsibility for legal aid). There was a useful exchange of views between the Bar, the Law Society, my Department and the Crown Prosecution Service and a programme of rapid work has been agreed, which should enable a full report to be prepared by 28 May.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.8/4">The Review Committee's terms of reference are:</p>
	<p pid=".484W.8/5" class="indent">&quot;To examine the workings so far of the very high cost criminal case regime and to make recommendations on how its procedures and structures might be improved to provide a better service to clients and a better system for those working within it.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.8/6" class="indent">The Review should consider:</p>
	<p pid=".484W.8/7" class="indent">the management and bureaucracy of the Scheme, including the balance between cost management and professional judgment;</p>
	<p pid=".484W.8/8" class="indent">whether there are opportunities to rebalance payments in the scheme to address anomalies;</p>

	<p pid=".484W.8/12" class="indent">There is no commitment on the part of the Government to fund any measures, which would have the effect of increasing overall legal aid expenditure. But if the length of cases reduces overall, this may be reflected in increased rates.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".487W.3/1">The abolition of the Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) means-test for parents of children with disabilities came into effect from 16 February 2004. It is therefore too early for any assessment of effectiveness to be carried out. The working group which was set up to look at the matter considered the potential impact of the abolition in terms of cost to the Government and numbers who could be helped by the abolition. It was   estimated that 25&ndash;30 applications for DFG are withdrawn each year due to the high contribution.</p>

The survey did not, however, attempt to determine whether they were statutorily homeless or not.

The latest Survey published in December 2003 shows 48 per cent. of rural households to be within a 10 minutes walk of an hourly or better bus service compared to 39 per cent. in the 1997&ndash;1999 Survey. This shows the position for all bus services, including those supported by RBSG.</p>

	<p pid=".495W.8/1">The main Yantlet shipping channel is over 2 km from the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery, and is separated by the extensive Nore Sands sandbank. This whole area lies within Port of   London Authority jurisdiction, and they have undertaken a risk assessment of the whole London Gateway Project. This suggests that there would be no additional risk from vessel movements which could not be handled by the Vessel Traffic Services.</p>

DFID's future focus will be on these areas, as well as on food security, and quality basic education for poor people. DFID has consulted with the NLD about our approach and focus.</p>

	<p pid=".500W.3/1">All funds in the Development Fund for Iraq are subject to audit by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB), created under UN Security Council Resolution 1483. The role of the Board is to ensure that the Development Fund for Iraq is used in a transparent manner for the benefit of the people of Iraq, and that export sales of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas from Iraq are made consistent with prevailing international market best practices. The Board consists of representatives of the UN, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/2">DFID is unaware of any specific demands for accountability from the IAMB. As recorded in the statement following their 23 April meeting (<a href="http://www.iamb.info">www. iamb.info</a>) the IAMB continue to work closely with the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and others in the achievement of their objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/3">Surplus funds received from the oil-for-food programme, above those required to complete existing contracts, are paid into the Development Fund for Iraq. Like other funds, including oil revenues, seized and vested assets, their allocation is decided by the CPA Programme Review Board. These allocations are then subject to IAMB oversight.</p>

	<p pid=".500W.6/1">In spite of continuing security problems, there is no widespread humanitarian crisis in Iraq. Iraqi Ministries, United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent, NGOs and Iraqi citizens have been working together to assist people affected by the recent fighting in Falluja, and have made preparations for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance, if required, in other parts of Iraq. An Emergency Co-ordination Group has been established to ensure the effective coordination of emergency assistance in Iraq. Its membership includes UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent, and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.6/2">US$32 billion in grants and soft loans was pledged for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid Donors' Conference in October last year. DFID has committed &pound;278 million to humanitarian and reconstruction work in Iraq since the beginning of 2003. Over the last year, Iraqi Ministries, together with the Coalition Provisional Authority and aid agencies, have made significant progress in restoring essential services, maintaining the Public Distribution System for food rations, reopening hospitals and schools and beginning the process of longer-term reconstruction.</p>

	<p pid=".501W.8/1">The target to detect 70 per cent. of (smear positive) Tuberculosis (TB) cases globally by 2005 was set by the World Health Assembly and forms the basis for DFID's public service agreement target. Much progress has been made. In 2002 an estimated 37 per cent. of estimated new smear positive cases were notified under the internationally recommended control strategy for TB (DOTS), an increase from 27 per cent. in 2001 and halfway towards the 2005 target.</p>
	<p pid=".501W.8/2">However, even with these encouraging recent trends at current progress the case detection rate will only be 50 per cent. by 2005. Concerted international action is needed to overcome challenges to scale up effective TB programmes in high burden countries, including strengthening political commitment, health systems, human resource capacity, primary health care provision, private sector and corporate sector contributions and working with poverty reduction strategies. DFID is committed to playing its role in accelerating progress towards the 2005 target as an active member of the Stop TB partnership.</p>

	<p pid=".502W.8/1">There have been significant humanitarian needs in Zimbabwe for nearly three years as a result of the Government of Zimbabwe's misguided economic policies, including the poorly implemented fast track land programme. These needs are exacerbated by the effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and erratic rainfall.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/2">The current Emergency Operation of the World Food Programme and the general distributions by NGOs whom we fund directly are beginning to wind down as this year's crop is now being harvested. The harvest should temporarily make food available to the majority of the population.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/3">The Government of Zimbabwe have cancelled the joint crop assessment with WFP and FAO, claimed that they will produce 2.4 million MT of maize, and declared that international food aid will not be needed this year. The UK and other donors do not believe that the Zimbabwean Government's crop forecast is credible and regret the cancellation of the joint crop assessment which would have provided an internationally accepted basis on which to plan for humanitarian operations later this year. The UN and the rest of the international community have consistently made clear to the Zimbabwean authorities that their lack of transparency in dealing with humanitarian issues, including their plans to import food, makes it more difficult for us to   respond effectively. We and other donors will nevertheless continue to work with the UN and other agencies to monitor the humanitarian position in Zimbabwe. Households most likely to be in need of assistance will be those with no access to land or income that are also affected by HIV/AIDS or include orphans, disabled children and the elderly.</p>

	<p pid=".504W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Our role is to continually monitor developments, and to create   a competitive market place, including through good international relations, within which liberalised markets will deliver energy reliability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".504W.2/3">To this end my Ministers and officials have over the past year held a number of meetings with representatives of foreign governments.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.2/4">On June 26 2003 during the State Visit of President Putin of Russia we held the &quot;Russia UK Energy Conference: Long Term Partners&quot; bringing together politicians, officials and the private sectors from both countries to discuss possible areas for energy cooperation.

It is anticipated that the agreement itself will be complete by the end of 2004 and the pipeline will become operational by 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.2/7">On Thursday 26 February 2004 I met with Mr. Khelil, the Energy Minister of Algeria. The BP/Sonatrach joint venture aimed at bringing new supplies of LNG to the UK was among other matters discussed</p>

It is the understanding of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that they have done so. We have been advised however that since August 2003, Barnet has not been supporting the eight street wardens and four neighbourhood wardens for annual leave, sickness and training under the scheme. Also because of where the base station has been located, wardens were spending 30 minutes of their duty at the beginning and end of the day travelling to and from Grahame Park. Funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for wardens schemes in Barnet began in December 2000 and ceased on 31 March 2004. Future funding is a matter for local agencies. Over 80 per cent. of the first round of warden schemes have already secured ongoing funding.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.5/1">The answers referred to gave the full extent of information currently available. Land Use Change Statistics are derived from Ordnance Survey's map revision process. In urban areas Ordnance Survey records mostly change within six months of the development taking place but in rural areas there can be up to five years between a change taking place and its recording by Ordnance Survey. Early estimates of percentages of dwellings that are on previously developed land and of dwellings per hectare on new developments have been found to be robust and are published early. Totals of land or dwellings, however, continue to increase as further data come in and at present only the 2000 figures are close enough to their final values to be published. There was a particular problem with the 1999 data, which is incomplete and will remain so.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.0/1">We are encouraged by the State Peace and Development Council's plans to reconvene the National Convention on 17 May to draft a new constitution, the first step of the road map outlined by Prime Minister Khin Nyunt on 30 August 2003. But it is essential that the National Convention is an inclusive, transparent process with a clear time frame. All political parties and ethnic groups should be invited to join the Convention, and to select their representatives freely. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all other National League for Democracy (NLD) members should be released immediately to allow them to prepare their approach to the National Convention.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.0/2">Without the participation of the NLD, the Convention will lack all credibility. There must be full freedom of debate and speech in the Convention and freedom of activity and association for political parties and ethnic groups. This includes ensuring that the 104   principles of the previous National Convention (1993&ndash;1996) are open for debate. Freedom from prosecution for views expressed on the Convention must be guaranteed.</p>

We would expect democratically-elected members to ensure appropriate representation of women and we will ensure they are fully aware of the Government's policy of encouraging this.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.2/2">The language of the Commission on Human Rights decision on Sudan was disappointingly weak. But it was a better outcome than last year, as the decision mandates an independent expert to provide formal international scrutiny of the human rights situation in Sudan. The EU insisted on the establishment of an independent expert to carry out this work. Such international scrutiny has been lacking since the end of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur when the EU-sponsored Sudan Resolution was defeated at last year's Commission on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/3">We fully supported the draft EU Item 9 Resolution on Sudan, but Commission on Human Rights procedure meant that an alternative draft decision on Sudan, tabled by the African Group under a different agenda item, took precedence. We also supported the two amendments to the decision proposed by the US, but these were defeated in a vote.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.5/1">Data on bullying are not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate of prevalence. However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools to tackle the problem. Our guidance pack 'Bullying: Don't Suffer in   Silence' and the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. In November 2003 I launched our anti-bullying Charter for schools, which schools are now signing. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies. The Charter was launched at the first of a series of regional conferences which have been running since November 2003 and culminate with a final conference in June. These conferences are an opportunity for schools and other partners to share good practice on this issue. Details of the conferences can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying">www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.3/1">The constituency of Ilford, North falls within Redbridge local education authority. Where the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) can or does collect information by constituency, it has been provided.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/2">Additional information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, my Department is investigating ways in which we disseminate information about the effects of our policies at a local level. We hope to have systems to facilitate this in place later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/3" class="italic">Children, Young People and Families</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/4" class="italic">Early Education</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/5">All 3 and 4-year-olds are now guaranteed a free, part-time, Government funded, early education place if their parents want it throughout England. We understand that the current early education participation rate in the Redbridge authority is around 68 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/6" class="italic">Child Care</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/7">There has been a major expansion in child care provision since 1997. We only have figures at local authority level. Since April 1999 we had created, by March 2004, over 3,200 new child care places benefiting over 5,800 children in Redbridge.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/8" class="italic">Children's Social Services</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/9">Children's social services in the constituency are delivered by Redbridge council which is a two star social services authority, with services for children and families assessed as serving most people well with promising prospects (as published in the Annual Review of Performance Reports, issued by the Chief Inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate).</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/10" class="italic">Disadvantaged Area Programmes</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/11">Some of our key programmes for young children and families target the most disadvantaged communities.

	<p pid=".525W.3/14" class="italic">Youth Services</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/15">Although not recently inspected by Ofsted, Redbridge Youth Service has used the findings of an independent inspection based on the Ofsted Framework and the Government's requirements within Transforming Youth Work to reconfigure the service during 2003/04. The 2004&ndash;05 plan, although still draft, demonstrates a commitment to achieving the performance measures required by Transforming Youth Work: Resourcing Excellent Youth Services.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/16" class="italic">Extended Schools</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/17">The Department is supporting the rollout of up to 240 full service extended schools by 2006, so that there will be at least one in each LEA area. Redbridge LEA will be developing one full service extended school from this year.</p>

Redbridge LEA has been allocated &pound;16.1 million for 2004&ndash;05. Some Voluntary Aided allocations have still to be included for 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.3/36">There is one secondary school in Redbridge in receipt of LIG, the Loxford School of Science and Technology. This is a high-performing school which receives LIG because more than 35 per cent. of its pupils are eligible for Free School Meals.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/37" class="italic">Behaviour Improvement Projects</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/38">All secondary schools in Redbridge LEA receive support from the Behaviour and Attendance strand of the Key Stage 3 Strategy, including a behaviour audit and training materials and support from specialist LEA-level consultants.

	<p pid=".525W.3/39" class="italic">14&ndash;19 Education</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/40">The Government's strategy for 14&ndash;19 education and training, set out in &quot;14&ndash;19: opportunity and excellence&quot;, will provide all young people with the opportunity to continue their education in different settings, including schools, colleges, and the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/41">The impact of the 14&ndash;19 agenda on Ilford, North includes:</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/42" class="italic">Strategic Area Reviews (StARs)</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/43">In April 2003, all local Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) started strategic area reviews (StARs) of post-16 LSC-funded provision. These reviews aim to achieve the   right mix of provision in an area to improve participation, raise attainment and improve learner choice. StARs will ensure that there is the breadth of opportunity and quality of provision to meet the needs of learners, employers and communities.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/44">All local LSCs have been gathering information, reviewing provider missions, and consequently building an understanding of each provider's role and the provision on offer. The next step is to develop strategic options.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/45">In the case of Ilford, North, and its local LSC, London East, progress is good and work continues with developing borough profiles and strategic proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/46">To support the StAR process, and to provide local providers with a clear understanding of what the local learning and skills priorities are, LSC London East are producing an over arching strategic framework document.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/47">The LSC London East has, in addition to the StAR process, conducted a survey to test its assumptions about what young people, adults and employers want from education.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/48" class="italic">Vocational Provision</p>
	<p pid=".525W.3/49">London East LSC currently has four work-based learning providers delivering vocational programmes in the constituency of Ilford, North.</p>

We only have figures at local authority level, but at March 2004 we had created over 4,200 new child care places since April 1999, benefiting over 7,500 children, in Newcastle upon Tyne, and over 4,300 new places benefiting over 7,700 children in North Tyneside.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/8" class="italic">Children's Social Services</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/9">Children's social services in the constituency are delivered by two councils&mdash;Newcastle and North Tyneside. Newcastle is a three star social services authority with services for children and families assessed as serving most children well with excellent prospects. North Tyneside is a one star council with services for children and families assessed as serving some children well with promising prospects. These judgments are set out in the annual review of Performance Ratings for Social Services in England published by the Chief Inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate in November 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/10" class="italic">Disadvantaged Area Programmes</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/11">Some of our key programmes for young children and families target the most disadvantaged communities. The constituency contains three Sure Start local programmes, two in Newcastle (West Walker and Fossway) and one in North Tyneside (Wallsend). The West Walker programme is also linked to the Walkergate Early Years Centre Early Excellence Centre. Wallsend and West Walker also have Neighbourhood Nurseries which, along with another two standalone projects, have created 131 new places in the constituency. Both authorities are now working on their plans for children's centres which will build on this existing provision. Newcastle upon Tyne intends to create nine centres and North Tyneside six, two of which have already been designated.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/12" class="italic">Connexions</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/13">Connexions, the Government's front line support service for all young people aged 13&ndash;19, is providing advice, guidance and support to young people in Newcastle Upon Tyne, East and Wallsend constituency through Tyne and Wear Connexions Partnership. Since its launch in April 2002 young people aged 13&ndash;19 have had access to support and advice on a range of issues to help them participate and achieve in education, employment and training and to reach their full potential as adults.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/14" class="italic">Youth Services</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/15">There are two local authority youth services in Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend: Newcastle; and North Tyneside. Both services have been subject to   Ofsted inspections in recent years, and in both significant weaknesses were found. But both local authorities have responded positively, increasing their investment in their youth services. They have also revised and updated many of their procedures and have fully embraced the Transforming Youth Work agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/16" class="italic">Extended Schools</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/17">The Department is supporting the rollout of up to 240 full service extended schools by 2006, so that there will be at least one in each LEA area. Benfield School in Newcastle LEA has been developing as a full service extended school from 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/18" class="italic">Schools</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/19" class="italic">Recurrent Funding</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/20">The estimated <sup>1</sup> increase in per pupil funding in real terms from 1997&ndash;98 to 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;920 in Newcastle upon Tyne and &pound;940 in North Tyneside compared with the national average of &pound;880.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/21" class="italic">Capital Funding</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/22">North Tyneside LEA had an allocation of &pound;11.5 million (including &pound;2.6 million which is devolved directly to schools, &pound;2.4 million in targeted Capital funding and &pound;0.5 million in VA Targeted Capital funding) for 2003&ndash;04 compared with &pound;1.4 million in 1996&ndash;97. North Tyneside LEA has been allocated &pound;6.7 million for 2004&ndash;05. Some Voluntary Aided (VA) allocations have still to be included for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/23">Newcastle LEA had an allocation of &pound;16.3 million (including &pound;3.4 million which is devolved directly to schools and &pound;5 million for VA Targeted Capital funding) for 2003&ndash;04 compared with &pound;1.0 million in    1996&ndash;97. Newcastle LEA has been allocated &pound;69.7 million for 2004&ndash;05 (including 360 million in PFI credits). Some VA allocations have still to be included for 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid=".528W.2/31">In Newcastle LEA the number of teachers has risen by 50 (FTE from 1997 to 2003). However there are 246 more teaching assistants than in 1997 and 434 more support staff than in 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/32" class="italic">Specialist Schools</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/33">There are eight specialist schools in Newcastle upon Tyne LEA and seven specialist schools in North Tyneside LEA.</p>

	<p pid=".528W.2/36" class="italic">Primary Strategy Leadership</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/37">17 primary schools in Newcastle upon Tyne LEA and 13 primary schools in North Tyneside LEA are part of the Primary Strategy Leadership programme this year. Additional schools will be selected by the LEAs to enter the programme in 2004/05.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/38" class="italic">Leadership Incentive Grant</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/39">There are 11 secondary schools in Newcastle upon Tyne in receipt of LIG and 11 secondary schools in North Tyneside in receipt of LIG. All are eligible for LIG because they are part of the Excellence in Cities programme.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/40" class="italic">Behaviour Improvement Projects</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/41">All secondary schools in Newcastle upon Tyne and North Tyneside receive support from the Behaviour and Attendance strand of the Key Stage 3 Strategy, including a behaviour audit and training materials and support from specialist LEA&mdash;level consultants. In addition, four secondary schools and 27 primary schools in Newcastle upon Tyne and four secondary schools and 15 primary schools in North Tyneside participate in the Behaviour Improvement Programme, which provides more intensive support for schools facing the greatest challenges.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/42" class="italic">14&ndash;19 Education</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/43">The Government's strategy for 14&ndash;19 education and training, set out in &quot;14&ndash;19: opportunity and excellence&quot;, will provide all young people with the opportunity to continue their education in different settings, including schools, colleges, and the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/44">The impact of the 14&ndash;19 agenda on Newcastle Upon Tyne, East and Wallsend includes:</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/45" class="italic">16&ndash;19 Area Inspection (14&ndash;19 from March 2003)</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/46">16&ndash;19 Area Inspections were introduced in 1999 as a key means of securing improvements in learning for young people. Both Newcastle Upon Tyne and North Tyneside have had a 16&ndash;19 area inspection, copies of their Ofsted reports can be found on their website <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/47">With Tyne and Wear LSC in the lead, local partners have developed Action Plans for both areas, which have been accepted by Ministers. Tyne and Wear LSC are responsible for the implementation of both action plans, which are still ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/48">In the autumn, Newcastle will under-go a further Area Inspection of 14&ndash;19 learning which will be undertaken jointly by Ofsted and the ALI. The LSC Tyne and Wear and the LEA will be jointly asked, along with local partners to prepare and implement an Action Plan, following the 14&ndash;19 Area Inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/49" class="italic">Strategic Area Reviews (StARs)</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/50">In April 2003, all local Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) started strategic area reviews (StARs) of post-16 LSC-funded provision. These reviews aim to achieve the   right mix of provision in an area to improve participation, raise attainment and improve learner choice. StARs will ensure that there is the breadth of opportunity and quality of provision to meet the needs of learners, employers and communities.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/51">All local LSCs have been gathering information, reviewing provider missions, and consequently building an understanding of each provider's role and the provision on offer.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/52">In LSC Tyne and Wear's area there were five 16&ndash;19 area wide inspections between spring 2000 and spring 2002, including for Newcastle and North Tyneside (the local authority areas in which the constituency of Newcastle East and Wallsend falls). As a result of these inspections both authorities, in conjunction with the local LSC and many other partners in the Learning Partnerships, produced and are now implementing 14&ndash;19 strategies. The objectives of these strategies align perfectly with that of the LSC's Strategic Area Review process.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/53">In both authorities, learning providers work in partnership on a wide range of learning issues, to deliver a learner entitlement for all young people. Over the last three years both authorities have seen an upward trend in participation and attainment at both GCSE and post-16 levels.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/54">The StAR process for LSC Tyne and Wear in relation to 14&ndash;19 provision is, therefore, one which builds on this effective partnership work, rather than proposing structural reorganisation.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/55" class="italic">Vocational Provision</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/56">Learners in Newcastle have easy access within the city to 21 work-based learning providers delivering a wide range of vocational programmes covering occupational areas/sectors which are significant to the sub-regional economy including Business and Administration, Construction, Engineering, Health and Care, Hospitality, ICT, Retail. These programmes are available at a range of levels, from Entry to Employment through Foundation Modern Apprenticeships to Advanced Modern Apprenticeships and, increasingly, to 14&ndash;16 learners as part of their individual learning programme.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/57">Four work-based learning providers are based in North Tyneside offering Business Administration, Construction, Engineering, Hair and Beauty, Hospitality and Catering programmes, as well as a very significant amount of Entry to Employment programmes and provision for learners with learning difficulties. Like Newcastle the provision in   North Tyneside is appropriate for employment opportunities in the Tyne and Wear area.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/58">In the compact sub-region which comprises LSC Tyne and Wear learners from both of these local authority areas have access to more than 60 providers of work-based opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/59" class="italic">Educational Maintenance Allowances</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/60">There is one Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) pilot area in Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend. The pilot scheme has been in operation in North Tyneside since September 2000. In its first year the EMA provided financial support for 800 students and in each subsequent year 1,500 students have benefited from the scheme. In the financial year 2003&ndash;04 a total of &pound;1.3 million in EMA payments were made for eligible students living in North Tyneside.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/61">The scheme has now been launched nationally and all eligible students in England can apply for EMA for academic year 2004/05.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/62" class="italic">Higher Education</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/63">The number of 18 to 20-year-olds entering full-time Higher Education courses, are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".534W.2/14">From the information available to the LSC it has not been feasible to obtain estimates at constituency level or   separate figures by subject without incurring disproportionate cost. Likewise it has not been feasible to obtain comparable figures for periods before April 2001 when the Skills for Life strategy was launched and the LSC was formed, but information shows it was considerably less than at present.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.2/1">The main means by which teacher workload is monitored is through the regular diary surveys undertaken for the Office for Manpower Economics. Last year's survey was conducted in March 2003. The most recent one was conducted in March 2004, with results available in the autumn. The March 2003 survey showed some reductions in hours, but this was obviously too early to draw any conclusions. The &quot;Making a Difference&mdash;Red Tape and Bureaucracy in Schools Second Report&quot; was published in March 2003. The Report included 125 separate outcomes to be completed up to September 2005, of which 79 have now been completed.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/2">The Implementation Review Unit (IRU) panel of 12 experienced practitioners drawn from schools across England was established in April 2003 to ensure that the bureaucratic and workload implications of both new and existing policies are kept under rigorous review, and to advise how red tape and bureaucracy can be minimised. Their first annual report was published on 30 April 2004, which provides an assessment of the progress that has been made, including the introduction of a system within the DfES to assess the impact of new initiatives before they are introduced. The report is available at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/iru">www.dfes.gov.uk/iru</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.2/1">Good progress is being made to reach our 2010 target of reducing by 40 per cent. those without a level 2 qualification (NVQ level 2 or equivalent). According to the Labour Force Survey, the reduction realised as of autumn 2003 was 5.4 per cent. from the autumn 2001 baseline. The interim milestone for 2006 is that there should be 1 million more adults in the workforce with full level 2 or better than in 2002. Autumn 2003 figures show an increase of 187,000 adults with at least a level 2 compared to the autumn 2002 baseline.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/2">These figures are broadly in line with the planned trajectories for meeting the PSA targets for both 2006 and 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/3">The Skills Strategy White Paper (published July 2003) includes a wide range of interlinked measures to remove barriers to learning, support participation for individuals and increase the amount of training undertaken with employers. It set out our intention to introduce a new entitlement for any adult in the labour force to have access to free tuition for their first full level 2 qualification. We are working with the LSC on phasing in the level 2 entitlement, with phase one in 2004&ndash;05 and full rollout beginning the following year.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/4">In September 2003, we started piloting the new Adult Learning Grant in ten local LSC areas, which offers up to &pound;30 per week to adults on low incomes studying full-time for a first full level 2 qualification. Over 3,000 ALG applications have been received and over 2,000 awards have been made to learners. From September, we are doubling the size of the current pilot by extending the ALG throughout the SE and NE regions, as part of linked trials of key initiatives announced in the Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/5">There are currently 12 Employer Training Pilots (ETPs) which are testing new financial support measures to improve access to training and enable employees to attain basic and level 2 skills. By mid April over 49,000 learners and nearly 9,000 employers were engaged. The expansion of ETPs was announced in the Budget and ETPs will now be available in 20 LSC areas in England.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/6">We believe that these and other related measures in the Skills Strategy will enable us to accelerate the trajectory towards meeting these targets.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.6/1">The gross cost of exempting all pensioners over 65 in receipt of carers' allowance from the overlapping benefits rule would be around &pound;200 million. After adjusting for offsets in income-related benefits the cost would be around &pound;130 million <sup>1</sup> . Exempting women only, aged 60 and over, would cost &pound;155 million (&pound;100 million after adjustments), although our commitment to the European directive on equal treatment would of course prevent us from introducing such a measure.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.6/2">These costs do not take account of the introduction of pension credit where carers' allowance is taken fully into account but an additional amount may be awarded in respect of the caring.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.6/3">Neither do the figures take account of the behavioural effect of carers who have not claimed a carer's allowance but who would be induced to do so if the overlapping benefits rules were amended as suggested.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.6/4" class="indent"><sup>1</sup>  Estimates use benefit rates for 2003&ndash;04 and are based on a 100 per cent. extract of claims for carers' allowance taken from the carers' allowance computer system for May 2003, a 5 per cent. extract from claims recorded on the income support computer system in 2003 and a 1 per cent. extract of housing benefit/council tax benefit claims of May 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.3/49">5. DLA is payable to all ages, if claimed before 65. IIDB is payable to working age claimants. AA is only payable on new claims to those aged 65 plus. There remain a number of AA claims in payment from before 6 April 1992, which were not converted to DLA with the introduction of the new scheme, which explains why some people still receive a combination of DLA mobility component and AA for their care costs.</p>

	<p pid=".557W.8/1">A review of the structure, organisation and training of both the Warfare and Engineering Branches of the Royal Navy is currently taking place. It is probable that the term Engineering Technician will be adopted for all members of the Engineering Branch below the rank of Commissioned Officer, replacing the Artificer and Mechanic titles currently in use. The title Artificer no longer adequately describes the professional role that those personnel undertake in the modern Navy. Replacing them with Engineering Technicians will align the Navy with the standards of competence published by the Engineering Council United Kingdom, and refresh the image of this key role against increasingly competitive recruitment market forces.</p>
	<p pid=".557W.8/2">The fleet continues to require highly trained and experienced personnel to provide the necessary technical support to ensure that the Royal Navy delivers its full range of operational capability. An expected outcome from the current review is that training will be better targeted through a career, and that naval Engineering Technicians who complete the training satisfactorily will be awarded a Foundation Degree, reflecting the comprehensive set of skills that they will possess.</p>

	<p pid=".573W.8/20">All the funding, other than a small amount in the region of &pound;250,000 due to slippage on some projects in 2003&ndash;04, has been fully disbursed. This equates to 1.7 per cent. of the total capital allocation.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.8/21">Individual projects are developed by local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in conjunction with Regional Home Office Directors. Part of this process is to ensure adequate local targets have been set and systems put in place to measure performance against them.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.8/22">The evaluation of the scheme will pull out key best practice and learning points from eight case studies, plus four other regional sites. The evaluation will examine ways in which the scheme has impacted upon businesses, such as changes in levels of retail crime; fear of crime among businesses and their customers; business viability; partnership working; and improved security behaviour among businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".574W.2/1">In 1998, Dr. Mike Sutton produced, on behalf of the Home Office, a report entitled 'Handling stolen goods and theft: a market reduction approach'. This identified five distinct markets for stolen goods, one of which was commercial outlets such as pawn brokers and second hand goods shops.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/2">Under the Targeted Policing Initiative (part of the Crime Reduction Programme, which ran from 1999 to 2003), we provided funding totalling around &pound;1.4 million to projects in Stockport, Kent and West Mercia aimed at reducing the market in stolen goods. The second hand goods trade was just one of several distribution channels for stolen goods that these projects targeted. In particular, the Stockport and Kent projects used local legislation, which regulates second hand goods outlets. Under the terms of the Kent and Medway Acts 2001, Kent and Medway Councils must also present the Home Office with a report on the working provisions of the Acts by 1 December, which will subsequently be laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/3">The Home Office has also commissioned the University of Kent to evaluate the effectiveness of these and similar pieces of legislation and we are planning to lay a summary of the results of this research before Parliament at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/4">We are also aware of further research that is being undertaken into thieves' preferred method of disposing of stolen property and we will be looking to see what this adds to our existing knowledge.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/5">Our programme of work to drive down the market for stolen goods includes, amongst other things, activities aimed at those pawn brokers and other second hand goods outlets that deal in stolen property.</p>

Periods of care ongoing at the end of the datayear (unfinished admission episodes) are included.

In the South West Peninsula strategic health authority area, the Peninsula Local Specialised Commissioning Group is leading on the implementation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines on   photodynamic therapy on behalf of its PCTs. Photodynamic therapy is currently provided by the South Devon Healthcare National Health Service Trust at Torbay Hospital and the service will be expanded from June to accept referrals from across the Peninsula. In addition, consideration is being given to involving some other hospitals in the area so as to improve local access to this service.</p>

	<p pid=".591W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.2/2">The studies commissioned by the Milton Keynes South Midlands Health and Social Care Sub-group have been funded through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Growth Areas Fund. These studies cover two workstreams. The first workstream is to examine how the interaction between health and the built environment can inform best practice in developing sustainable communities in the MKSM Growth Area. The second workstream is focusing on the delivery of health and social care services in response to the proposed growth in housing and population. The studies will provide a 30 year health and social care vision for the sub-region with a development plan and action plan to achieve the vision. The studies are due to be completed in June 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.2/3">The Chief Executive of the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland Strategic Health Authority is the Chair of the Sub-Group. A full-time Project Director has also been appointed for the studies and to co-ordinate consultation activity.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.2/4">The Sub-group has comprehensive representation from the health community, including the representatives of the relevant Primary Care Trusts, local authority social care departments, the three Strategic Health Authorities; the three Regional Public Health Groups of the Department of Health; the three Workforce Development Confederations (WDCs) and from NHS Estates. In addition a stakeholder reference group has been formed which will enable emerging ideas to be tested with a wide range of stakeholders, including health service users. This currently includes representatives from the local   NHS Trusts, local authority Health Scrutiny Committees and patient representatives, and the intention is to expand its scope to include District Councils, Local Strategic Partnerships, independent sector service providers, and other interested groups.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.6/1">The Government is advised on the potential health risks from ionising and non-ionising radiation by a variety of bodies. The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) provides statutory advice to Government (<a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a>). The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) provides advice on health effects of radiation at the levels encountered in the general environment. Low-level internal radiation emitters are the remit of the Committee Evaluating Radiation Risks from Internal Emitters and it is due to report to COMARE in the autumn of 2004. The risks from exposure to low-level internal emitters are also regularly reviewed by international organisations, such as the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effect of Atomic Radiation.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.6/2">In addition, the Department runs its own radiological protection research programme in the area of low-level radiation exposure (both ionising and non-ionising), that provides information on the quantification of the risk to public health and the implementation of appropriate preventative measures. Research specifically aimed at investigating the potential health effects of mobile phone technology was set up in 2001 under the mobile telecommunications and health research programme.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.6/3">For non-ionising radiation, the NRPB has recently reviewed the scientific evidence relating to possible adverse health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range 0&ndash;300GHz (Documents of the NRPB: Vol 15, No 3, 2004). This document provides the basis of NRPB advice on quantitative restrictions on exposure and other measures to avoid adverse effects. It is available on the NRPB web site.</p>

We are also tackling the most common STI through our national chlamydia screening programme, which already covers a quarter of primary care trusts in England, and is being rolled-out across the rest of the country.</p>
