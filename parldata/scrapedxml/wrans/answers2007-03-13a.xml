	<p pid="a.176W.2/1">The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Regulation charges quoted are the pro rata charges which the Environment Agency would apply in respect of permits for intensive livestock installations issued in August 2007 covering the period to March 2008. The annual permit charges thereafter are currently set at &pound;2,229 and &pound;2,794 for small and large installations respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/2">IPPC applies to intensive poultry rearing installations with places for more than 40,000 birds, and to intensive pig rearing installations with places for more than 2,000 production pigs or 750 sows. For charging purposes, any installation with places more than 10 times these thresholds is regarded as &quot;large&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/3">Information on profits and turnover is held ona basis in which large farm businesses are those considered sufficient to occupy two or more standard labour requirements. Standard labour requirement (SLR) for a farm business represents the labour requirement (in full-time equivalents) for all the agricultural activities on the farm. All intensive livestock installations subject to IPPC are &quot;large&quot; in these terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/4">For poultry installations, annual charges for IPPC permits represent on average 0.2 per cent. of turnover and 5.0 per cent. of net profits, or 0.3 per Cent. and6.2 per cent. respectively if it is a &quot;large&quot; installation for IPPC purposes. For pig installations, the corresponding figures are 0.4 per cent. and 3.5 per cent, or 0.5 per cent and 4.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.5/1">Assessments of these flood risks are addressed as part of standard regulatory processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/2">The safety of nuclear installations in the UK is regulated by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), which is part of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Nuclear installations include all UK nuclear power plants and the Low Level Radioactive Waste Repository (LLWR) near to Drigg in Cumbria. Such installations must be licensed under the Nuclear Installations Act (1965). The safety of a nuclear plant is the responsibility of the licensee, who is required to submit to the NII a written demonstration of safety, the 'safety case'.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/3">NII requires that operators' safety cases address internal and external hazards, including various types of flooding. NII assesses the operators' safety cases to establish whether they are adequate. Safety cases are 'living documents' which are periodically reviewedand updated to reflect changing conditions. Changesin flood risk, whether due to changes in natural phenomena or man-made are taken into account during such reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/4">The environment agencies (the Environment Agency in England and Wales, and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in Scotland) regulate disposals of radioactive waste. The environment agencies would require any applicant wishing to develop a proposed disposal facility to assess impacts from a wide range of events and processes including those such as coastal erosion. This is in order to demonstrate that risks associated with radioactivity and other potential hazards would be acceptably low. Impacts from coastal erosion were considered in some detail during a recent review of the radioactive waste disposal authorisation for the LLWR near to Drigg in Cumbria.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.3/1">The international effort to achieve universal access has helped boost the numbers on anti-retroviral drugs (ARV) treatment. In sub-Saharan Africa, the numbers on treatment rose 10-fold from 2003 to 2006 from 100,000 to over 1 million. This is equivalent to 23 per cent. of those needing treatment. Similarly, the number of sites where people can receive treatment has increased significantly, including in Malawi and Zambia where there has been increases of 20 and 30-fold respectively. As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase>, Global Fund-supported programmes have put 770,000 people on ARV treatment for HIV. This represents more than one-quarter of the 3 million people on ARV worldwide and is 28 per cent. greater than the Global Fund targets for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.3/2">The UK has already pledged to spend &pound;1.5 billion on AIDS programmes between 2005 and 2008: this reflects our commitment to Universal Access. Despite this progress, much still needs to be done. In addition to funding AIDS programmes, we are supporting UNITAID, the new international drug purchasing facility, to fund second-line ARV, paediatric ARVs and TB and malaria drugs predominantly to low income countries. It is hoped that this mechanism will contribute to the necessary reductions in the prices of second-line drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir and tenofovir (Viread and Kaletra). The UK Government are also helping strengthen the World Health Organisation (WHO) medicines pre-qualification process through UNITAID, in order to speed up the availability of new second-line ARV products. WHO's pre-qualification process is a critical block for low income countries using new ARVs, with a long backlog of medicines seeking pre-approval. The additional funding will accelerate the process.</p>

While education is not currently formally a cluster, in December 2006, the Inter Agency Standing Committee (consisting of the key UN and non-UN humanitarian partners) agreed that the cluster approach would be applied to the education sector, under UNICEF's lead. Education will also be included in the 2007 global cluster appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.2/4">In countries, this means that following a disaster, UNICEF will present a request for funding for the education sector, based on humanitarian need, to the humanitarian co-ordinator to include in the flash appeal. Where education is deemed to be a priority need, the humanitarian co-ordinator will highlight this and it will be up to donors to provide adequate funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.187W.8/1">DFID's goal is to reduce povertyand inequality in Latin America in line with the international community's commitment to help achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) by 2015. DFID's main financial contributions to Latin America are through direct contributions to the multilateral institutions: the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Commission and United Nations. DFID also has a bilateral programme for Latin America (&pound;11 million in 2006-07). The purpose of this programme is to enhance the overall impact of the international system in the region. DFID's assistance to Latin America from 2004-07 is set out in the document entitled &quot;Regional Assistance Plan&quot;, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.8/2">DFID is working with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank, helping them to tackle social exclusion and to provide access to markets and international trade. Efforts are being made to provide accountable and responsive public sector management and effective political systems. DFID also works to improve donor coordination in support of government led poverty reduction strategies and also to improve regional, analysis and lesson sharing to achieve trade policies that better reflect the impact of trade on poverty and inequality. In the health sector it focuses on improved quality and effectiveness of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care drawing from regional organisations working with the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.8/3">DFID is also providing a further &pound;7 million a yearto British NGOs working in Latin America under Partnership Programme Agreements with DFID, and funding projects through the Civil Society Challenge Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.8/4">DFID's programme in Latin America provides flexible and responsive funding and seeks to pilot innovative new approaches. It works with others, for example the UN and international NGOs, to facilitate cooperation between civil society organisations and the World Bank and IDB. It collaborates closely with the complementary programmes of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and the British Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.8/5">Through the UK Government's Global Conflict Prevention Pool, DFID, alongside the FCO and the Ministry of Defence (MOD), supports security sector reform and small arms and light weapons reduction. The overall aim is to reduce armed violence, establish effective and appropriate rule of law in the region, and provide the security needed to enable development.</p>

	<p pid="a.188W.2/5">DFID's overall contribution to humanitarian coordination and assistance in Nepal during this financial year has been &pound;700,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/6" class="italic"> Economic assistance</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/7">DFID is spending &pound;36 million on development aid to Nepal in 2006-07. This is funding several major programmes that support economic growth, either directly or indirectly. Local livelihoods and economic activity in rural areas are being supported through DFID's Community Support Programme, the Livelihood and Forestry Programme, the Rural Access Programme and Agriculture support programme. In addition, we contribute to the cost of national government programmes in health and education, which increases spending and human development, which in turn will increase economic growth and create a better environment for investment. Finally, DFID's support to Maoist cantonments, the re-establishment of law and order, upcoming national elections and political inclusion initiatives are helping to build the legitimacy of the state and stabilise the country, which is vital for investment and growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/8" class="italic"> Military assistance</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/9">The UK supports the transition of the NepalArmy to a regular professional army under civilian control.

In October 2005, DFID commenced a five-year, &pound;15 million programme in support of the national HIV/AIDS programme. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) manages DFID's support in conjunction with their management of grants from the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria. DFID is currently the second major donor to the national HIV/AIDS programme, contributing 24 per cent. of the programme'sresources from mid-2006 to mid-2008. DFID support is aligned to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and its corresponding Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.2/2">DFID supports 73 projects through 59 NGOs or community based organisations in 27 of Nepal's 75 districts. DFID is the lead donor in support of services to: mobile populations; injecting drug users; people living with HIV/AIDS; prison populations; men having sex with men and male sex workers. The activities implemented range from information and awareness; peer education; voluntary counselling and HIV testing; harm reduction (including rehabilitation); care and support to people living with HIV/AIDS and safe blood supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.2/3">In addition to bilateral assistance, DFID also supports prevention and treatment to Nepali migrants in Nepal and India through the Asia RegionalPoverty Fund, a three-year, &pound;2 million project which commenced in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.2/4">Over the last three years, DFID has worked closely with the Government of Nepal (GON), the UN agencies and the World Bank to develop the Three Ones: one policy and programme, one national co-ordination body and one monitoring and evaluation framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.2/5">DFID plans to increase its policy engagement in HIV/AIDS. This will be focused on supporting the establishment of a national multi-sectoral semi-independent unit which can manage the programme, improve fund-flow to communities and attract more resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.190W.6/1">We fully recognise the importance of long-term security in attracting investment to develop biofuel production capacity in the UK. We believe that the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will provide a high degree of investor confidence in biofuels, and there are already signs that it is leading to increased investment in new biofuel production capacity, with a number of new plants due to come on stream very shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.191W.3/1">A report prepared for the Department and published in 1997 reviewed the use of mobile phones by drivers. TRL Report 318, &quot;The use of mobile phones while driving: a review&quot; is available from TRL Ltd (<a href="http://www.trl.co.uk">www.trl.co.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.191W.3/2">The Department has not needed to undertake its own further research into the risks of using any mobile phone because research by others adequately covers the subject and confirms that there is little difference in the distraction whether a hand-held or hands-free mobile phone is used. The Department's consistent advice, for example in the Highway code and the THINK Road Safety campaign, has been that mobile phones of any type should not be used while driving.</p>
	<p pid="a.191W.3/3">The research is conveniently summarised in the report of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones &quot;Mobile Phones and Health&quot;, published in 2000&mdash;see paragraphs 5.201 to 5.214, pages 86 to 90 for a summary of research worldwide&mdash;available online at: <a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk/report/text.htm">www.iegmp.org.uk/report/text.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.191W.3/6">Surveys for the Department on the level of mobile phone use are undertaken twice yearly.

All files scanned as part of this project will, in due course, be reviewed in accordance with established procedures. Those that The National Archives require for permanent preservation will be transferred there in accordance with the Public Records Acts.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.0/3">There is no file in the asbestos contaminated archive specifically related to Bulent Ecevit's visit to London in 1974. Although the archive contains a large number of files which have Turkey in their title, given the date in question only one of these could conceivably have covered the Ecevit visit. This file has been reconstituted and examined, but unfortunately holds no relevant information.</p>

	<p pid="a.203W.3/1">Since 1998, Defence spending plans have been set as part of the Government's Spending Review process. Prior to this, spending plans were set on an annual basis. The Government accounting process has changed progressively over this period due to the introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB). The terms in which these budgets were set are therefore not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.3/2">It is however possible to make a broad comparison between the near cash element of budgets under RAB and the cash element of the budget before the introduction of RAB<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.3/3">On this basis, the near cash/cash elements of the planned budget in real terms (2006-07 base year) and as a percentage of GDP are set out as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.203W.3/19">For the first two of these years, the Government made it clear that it would work within the existing spending plans while it tackled the structural deficit it inherited and set new policy objectives and spending priorities. Since the first two years, the average annual real increase in the cash/near cash element of the Defence budget, has been over &pound;300 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.207W.3/1">Paragraph 7-5 of the White Paper: &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&quot; (Cm 6994) indicated that decisions on whether to acquire a replacement for the Trident missile are unlikely to be needed until the 2020s. The White Paper set out the decisions needed now to join the programme to extend the life of the Trident D5 missile and to start detailed concept work on new submarines to replace the Vanguard class.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/2">The Ministry of Defence has made provision in its accounts for a wide range of nuclear decommissioning liabilities. The latest estimate of these liabilities is shown in the Ministry of Defence annual report and accounts for 2005-06, HC1394, which were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General. More detail is set out in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 778-79W.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/3">The estimate for the in-service costs of the UK's nuclear deterrent, once new submarines come into operation, set out at paragraph 5-14 of the White Paper includes an allowance for the decommissioning costsof a successor system. This estimate has not beensubject to external scrutiny. At this very early stage, we are not in a position to provide a breakdown of decommissioning costs in the way requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/4">Investment at the Atomic Weapons Establishment has been increased in recent years primarily in order to ensure we can sustain the existing Trident warhead in-service for as long as necessary. This investment involves the replacement or refurbishment of a number of facilities related to the design and production of nuclear warheads. Proceeding with the plan to replace our Vanguard-class submarines and participate in the life extension programme for the Trident D5 missile would not have a material effect on these plans. As the White Paper makes clear, decisions on whether and how to replace or refurbish our warhead stockpile are likely to be necessary in the next Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/5">Facilities at Sellafield are the responsibility of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency and British Nuclear Group Sellafield Ltd.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.2/1">I established the physiotherapy taskforce to address and provide workable, realistic solutions to the current situation of reported high levels of graduate unemployment among newly trained physiotherapists. It was considered important to involve representatives of the profession, the commissioners, employers and work force planners. Membership of the taskforce therefore comprises representatives of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, the trade union, HSS Trust physiotherapy management and Human Resources; a member of the physiotherapy work force and a physiotherapy student. A full list of members will be placed in the Library.</p>

While on a career break, officers may not pursue a business interest or other paid employment, or full time education unless it falls within policy guidelines and regulations. Although unpaid, officers retain their salary points and rank and sympathetic consideration is given to officers with regard to returning to their previous post. Should it be necessary, appropriate training can be provided on return.</p>

	<p pid="a.231W.2/3">Transparency International's Bribe-payers Index (BPI) aims to evaluate the supply side of corruption by asking business experts in emerging economies for their impressions of the likelihood that companies from the listed countries pay or offer bribes in their business activities. The UK is sixth out of 30 countries, the second G7 country and third EU country in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/4">Mechanisms are in place to address offences of bribery committed overseas by UK nationals or UK registered bodies through Part 12 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which clarified the application of existing bribery law to the bribery of foreign public office holders and gave our courts jurisdiction over such offences. DFID has recently committed funds to the City of London police to establish a dedicated police unit dealing solely with offences of bribery overseas.</p>

However it has also been necessary to use some of the accumulated unspent funds within the science budget to seek to manage these pressures. The pressures that require funding include, but are not limited to the rescue package for British Energy, costs associated with the MG Rover collapse, pan European space projects and the implementation of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. There will be no direct hypothecation of savings identified to individual pressures.</p>

For the current round of structural funds, areas in receipt of convergence objective funding&mdash;the highest level of funding&mdash;were defined as those NUTS 2 regions with GDP per capita less than 75 per cent. of the EU average, expressed in terms of purchasing power parities (PPP), using the average of data for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002.</p>

Rather than providing full details of each request and response, each log makes reference to documents held in electronic and paper format; it is these documents that provide information relating to the full text of the request and the exact nature of the response. Therefore, in their current form, the logs are not available for general inspection by hon. Members.

	<p pid="a.251W.7/1">We want all schools to offer access to extended services by 2010, providing a core offer of activities, with at least half of all primary and a third of secondary schools doing so by 2008. Primary schools are expected to provide, as part of the core offer, access to affordable child care at or through their school from 8 am to 6 pm all year round linked to a varied menu of activities. Secondary schools are not expected to offer formal child care but they are expected to provide access to a varied menu of activities (like study support activities such as sports clubs, music tuition, dance, drama and art clubs) before and after school from 8 am to 6 pm and during the school holidays in response to demand. Our proposals for access to wraparound child care through schools were first published in our ten year child care strategy &quot;Choice for parents, the best start for children&quot; in December 2004. We published further details in June 2005 in the Extended Schools Prospectus &quot;Extended schools: Access to opportunities and services for all&quot;.

Currently over 4,000 schools are providing access to the core offer of extended services.</p>

	<p pid="a.252W.2/2">The general requirements relating to the procurement of goods and services are set out in the Academies Financial Handbook, which the Department issues to all academies. This includes the requirement for probity in procurement, to demonstrate that all parties are dealt with on a fair and equitable basis and to ensure that there is no private gain. In particular the Financial Handbook requires governors, including sponsor governors, to make formal declarations of their interests in external businesses and to withdraw from any discussions regarding potential contracting with that business.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/3">In addition to any advice&mdash;or indeed directions&mdash;which the Department may give to academy trusts in relation to the procurement of goods and services, the law also precludes the payment of any charitable trustee&mdash;including the governors of an academy, of which the sponsor is one&mdash;unless legal authority for that payment is given in the charity's governing documents, or otherwise granted by a court or the Charity Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/4">The Charity Commission approves the governing documents of all companies proposed to be registered charities prior to granting registration, to ensure that any provisions conferring authority on the charity to make a payment to one of the trustees&mdash;or a company associated with a trustee&mdash;deal with conflicts of interest in a transparent manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/5">All academy trusts use the Department's model memorandum and articles of association as a basis for their own, and these include standard conflict of interest provisions recommended by the Charity Commission. These typically require any trustee of the company, who has an interest in a particular contract, to withdraw from discussions in relation to such a contract. In order to comply with these provisions, a sponsor of an academy trust would, for example, be required to withdraw from any meetings at which a discussion took place on the proposed remuneration of either themselves, or a company with which they are associated.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/6">Furthermore, Charity Law places an obligation on charitable trustees to act in the best interests of their respective charities, and contracting with a company in the knowledge that this might not be at the best terms available to the charity, would obviously be contrary to this obligation.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/7">Advice and guidance is also provided through the designated Project Lead within the Department, and academies are also referred to the Public Procurement Regulations 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.254W.11/21">Despite the claims that some have made that the variable fee system would put off those from less well off backgrounds, the latest UCAS figures for students applying for entry in autumn 2007 indicate that this has not happened. The figures indicate that although applicants from less affluent families are still in the minority, since 2005 there has been a bigger year-on-year percentage increase from applicants from the lower socio-economic groups than from applicants from more affluent backgrounds. As a result, the proportion of applicants who are from the lower socio-economic groups has risen from 30.9 per cent. in 2005 to 31.3 per cent. this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.6/1">Greenwich's wave 1 Building Schools for the Future (BSF) project has been allocated capital funding of &pound;169 million (including ICT) on the basis of the outline business case approved in January 2005. This level of funding will be confirmed only when a final business case for the project is approved which is scheduled to happen later this year. The authority has a further project in wave 5 of BSF. The funding allocation for this project has yet to be agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/2">Primary schools are not covered by BSF, but we are taking a similarly transformational approach to capital investment for the primary sector. The Primary Capital Programme aims to rebuild, remodel or refurbish at least half of all primary schools over the next 15 years. The programme will be rolled out nationally from 2009-10 when all local authorities, including Greenwich, will benefit from a share of &pound;500 million of additional investment. This will be allocated by means of a simple, open formula&mdash;still to be determined. Subject to future Government spending decisions, we anticipate that the additional investment will continue at that level throughout the life of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.4/1">Given the discretionary nature of the negotiated settlements, we cannot predict the extent to which they will be used and are unable to estimate the impact on debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.4/2">In relation to revaluation of interim maintenance assessments, I refer the hon. Member to the figures given in paragraph 5.42 of the Government's White Paper &quot;A new system of child maintenance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.4/3">Subject to consultation, the proposed revaluationof interim maintenance assessments would be basedon analysis of information held by the agency on converting interim maintenance assessments to full maintenance assessments. Conversion of punitive interim maintenance assessments almost invariably results in lower rate full maintenance assessments.The factor that we would use to revalue interim maintenance assessments would reflect the average effect of conversion and would be determined closer to the time of the revaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.4/4">In relation to making the revaluation subject to parent with care agreement, we would consider the detail of the process in the light of views received from the White Paper consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.275W.5/1">The winter fuel payment is a significant contribution to winter fuel bills which account for around 60 per cent. of the year's total fuel bill. It has risen from &pound;20 to &pound;200 from winter 2000-01 and to &pound;300 for people aged 80 or over from winter 2003-04. These increases have been at a significantly higher rate than inflation. Fuel prices do fluctuate and although fuel prices have risen since 2003, this follows a period of no change between 1997 to 2003. Companies are now starting to announce price reductions in their retail tariffs to domestic customers following recent falls in wholesale gas prices.</p>

	<p pid="a.287W.7/1">While advertising has been shown generally to influence individuals' awareness and attitudes, there is no clear evidence that advertising contributes to criminal behaviour such as violence. However, in response to the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy (2004), both the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP) strengthened the non-broadcast and broadcast alcohol advertising code rules. The regulatory bodies; the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and Ofcom, are undertaking work, designed to assess the impact of these regulatory changes. CAP and BCAP are committed to robust evidence-based rules. If there were new evidence showing major harms, then the codes, or their interpretation, may be reviewed.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.2/1">The interview officer role will gradually transition to that of interview and enrolment officer from 2009, and staff will be trained accordingly. This is to meet the need for the business additionally to record biometrics from all applicants in readiness for the issuing of second biometric passports and identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="a.290W.2/2">It is expected that there will be a need for more enrolment officers than the roughly 600 interview officers to be employed this year during the implementation of the authentication by interview process. Any additional staff are likely to be required from mid 2009, but it is premature to identify how many this will be as it depends on the date when IPS is ready to start initial biometric enrolment and the rate of increase in volume of customers which will depend on the progressive implementation plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.292W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/2">The Government deplore abuse of all older people. We have set out standards of care and treatment for older people in the national service framework and in national minimum standards for care homes and domiciliary care agencies. We have also created independent regulators and given them the powers they need to take action against poorly providing performers. Staff who provide personal care to older people in their own homes or in care homes are subject to statutory checks, including checks of their criminal record and the protection of vulnerable adults scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/3">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 introduces a new vetting and barring scheme which will be passed in from autumn 2008. The new scheme will be proactive, with vetting taking place on an individual's first application to work with children or vulnerable adults. This will make it far more difficult for abusers to gain access to the most vulnerable groups in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/4">Statutory guidance has been issued to local authorities on putting in place multi-agency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable people from abuse. &quot;No Secrets&quot; makes it clear that local strategies for the prevention of abuse of vulnerable adults should include plans to disseminate information to users, carers, relevant staff groups and agencies to ensure they are aware of local arrangements including how to report abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/5">The Department has commissioned research, jointly with Comic Relief, on the prevalence and nature of abuse of older people who live in their own homes. It will be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.5/1">The Department has not directly monitored the implementation of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's(NICE) clinical guidelines on depression. Healthcare organisations' compliance with NICE guidelines is part of the developmental standard D2 which is being assessed in shadow form in the Healthcare Commission's annual health check of mental health trusts in 2006-07. This means that assessment of performance against developmental standard D2 will not feed into the overall annual rating in 2006-07. However, it is expected to form part of the rating from 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="a.311W.0/1">On the recommendation of the Bichard Inquiry we are introducing a new centralised vetting and barring scheme for people working with children and vulnerable people. This scheme, as set out in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, will extend the coverage of the existing barring schemes and draw on wider sources of information to provide a more comprehensive and consistent measure of protection for vulnerable groups across a wide range of settings, including the whole of social care and the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.0/2">The new scheme will be proactive, with vetting taking place on an individual's first application to work with children or vulnerable adults and will make it far more difficult for abusers to gain access to some of the most vulnerable groups in society. The new scheme will be phased in from autumn 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.313W.5/2">The projected cost of the medical training application service at instigation was &pound;5.8 million over five years for an England only service. Expanding to United Kingdom wide coverage and incorporating academic/specialty and general practitioner recruitment into a single, two-round recruitment exercise has slightly increased set-up costs. The projected cost of the service is now expected to be &pound;6.3 million over five years.</p>
