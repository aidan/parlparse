	<p pid=".405W.5/1">Joint Force Harrier (JFH) operates Harrier GR7 flown by RAF pilots and Sea Harrier FA2 flown by RN pilots. GR7 is a ground attack aircraft, whereas FA2 is predominantly air defence. Each complements the other so that JFH has a rounded operational capability. Both RN and RAF aircrew are capable of operating from aircraft carriers in their own aircraft type, and both work closely together when embarked in carriers and when ashore. There is, though, no operational requirement for pilots of one Harrier aircraft type to fly the other. If there was a requirement for GR7 pilots to fly the FA2 or vice versa this could be achieved once operational conversion training had been completed. However, there exists an RAF/RN-wide pilot exchange programme which shares operational experience by providing flying tours with the other service. On this programme, currently there are <i>(a)</i> two RAF pilots flying the Sea Harrier, both from the Tornado F3, and <i>(b)</i> one RN (but non-Sea Harrier) pilot training to fly the Tornado GR4.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.8/1">Under Resource Accounting and Budgeting, the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) was issued with two Expenditure Limits at the start of the current financial year: for Current Expenditure and Capital Expenditure. Together they amount to Estimates provision of &pound;4,033 million for the logistic support of the armed forces. In the normal course of business there are adjustments to these limits as the year unfolds, which will be finalised in time for inclusion in the spring Supplementary Estimates. We would expect the DLO expenditure to be within the Estimates provision at the year end.</p>

	<p pid=".410W.3/1">We support the development of short rotation coppice and miscanthus for energy production through the Energy Crops Scheme. This is one of the integrated set of measures in the England Rural Development Programme and the scheme makes &pound;29 million of funding available to farmers over seven years. In addition we promote the use of forest material, for example through planting grants under the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, and woodland maintenance grants under the WGS. Market opportunities are key to future uptake and we are working closely with Government Departments and other bodies to develop power generation, combined heat and power and heat markets in order to increase the use of biomass.</p>

Measures were introduced in April 2001 to help encourage investment in new combined heat and power.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.3/4">An important component of the UK's Climate Change Programme is the Carbon Trust. Set up as a not-for-profit organisation by the Government and the devolved Administrations, the trust is encouraging the use of low-carbon technologies and resources in the business sector. The trust is expected to recycle approximately &pound;100 million of climate change levy revenue over a three year period. The Carbon Trust will develop programmes to support new and emerging low-carbon technologies. It will also take on management of the Government's Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme and the Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme that provides a fiscal incentive to businesses to improve energy efficiency. This scheme gives 100 per cent. first year capital allowances for companies which invest in approved energy saving equipment.</p>

This includes drinks containers such as milk bottles. The UK Regulations implementing the Directive also encourage re-use by allowing obligated businesses to exclude from the calculation of their tonnage recovery and recycling obligation, tonnages of packaging that are being re-used. Milk bottles are re-used for between 10 and 40 trips, so this provision will apply to the proportion of milk bottles that are being reused.</p>

	<p pid=".414W.2/3">The Government published their strategy for more sustainable construction, &quot;Building a Better Quality of Life&quot;, in April 2000. Last week we published a review of progress 'Building a better quality of life&mdash;a strategy for more sustainable construction: Report on Progress 20001', which is available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/construction/sustain/sustainableconstruction.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/ construction/sustain/sustainableconstruction.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".414W.2/4">One of the priorities identified in the strategy is the need to minimise the impact on the consumption of natural resources through the reduction in waste. The re-use and recycling of waste, often as building materials, is encouraged through a number of economic instruments such as the landfill tax, the forthcoming aggregates levy and the climate change levy. These measures promote the use of reconstituted building materials in construction by encouraging the minimisation of waste going to landfill and reducing the demand for primary aggregates.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.7/16"><sup>(3)</sup> The SBS Core Services funding is delivered through the Business Links network. The amount shown is solely that part of the budget referring to the IMD; the majority of the budget is determined by the number of local businesses. SBS Core Services funding was not allocated on a deprivation basis in 2000&ndash;01</p>
	<p pid=".415W.7/17"><sup>(4)</sup> DTI will have effective responsibility for all grant in aid to Regional Development Agencies from November 2001. Certain RDA expenditure programmes remain with DTLR until April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.7/18">In addition, while Structural Funds are not allocated on the basis of deprivation, eligibility for the urban strand of Objective 2 of the European Structural Funds in 2000&ndash;06 was in part designated using the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation (the predecessor of the 2000 IMD). Areas eligible for the Structural Funds used this index as one of a series of indicators (e.g. unemployment rate, industrial decline, etc) in designating Objective 2 status. Also within the Structural Fund Programmes, the IMD was used to target resources to meet the needs of the most needy communities in urban and rural area.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.7/19">Some DTI programmes take account of factors which are associated with deprivation: for example, the Regional Innovation Fund of &pound;54 million allocated to RDAs in 2001&ndash;02 took account of unemployment, GDP and R&amp;D spending.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.7/20">From April 2002, the RDAs will be funded through a single pot, which will take account of the IMD as well as related factors such as labour market indicators. The figure shown here for 2002&ndash;03 is for the roughly 28 per cent. of the &pound;2,550 million single pot which depends directly on the IMD.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.7/21">As part of the Government's fuel poverty strategy a working group was set up to look at issues surrounding extension of the gas network. This working group is currently considering how the Index of Multiple Deprivation may be used in combination with other information to prioritise areas where serious consideration should be given to extending the gas network, or taking other measures to improve domestic heating and energy efficiency, with a view to alleviating fuel poverty.</p>

The pace of this migration will be the subject of further guidance as the results of the implementation testing programme become clear.</p>

Most providers, particularly those providing specialist help, are able to appoint an external expert such as a sign language interpreter. We are working to increase the numbers of providers who offer such services. The Legal Services Commission is working with the London learning and skills council to help support small and ethnic groups achieve the quality mark. A pilot is being run in two London boroughs and includes disability groups.

	<p pid=".424W.13/1">In 1994&ndash;95 and 1995&ndash;96, when Railtrack was still in the public sector, grants of &pound;32 million and &pound;34 million were paid towards the cost of maintaining level crossings. Since its privatisation in 1996 the company has recovered those costs, and other costs, through access charges paid by passenger train operating companies (TOCs) and freight operating companies (FOCs). So, although no grant was paid direct to the company between 1996&ndash;97 and 2000&ndash;01, the company's profitability in those years was contingent on public money. Some 90 per cent. of its income is paid to it in access charges by TOCs and FOCs, most of which are supported by public money.</p>
	<p pid=".424W.13/2">In addition, in accordance with the terms of Railtrack's <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-02">2 April</phrase> agreement with Government, Railtrack received &pound;337 million of network grant on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>; and the company, or its successor body, will receive &pound;162 million of network grant in 2001&ndash;02 in respect of the (October 2000) final conclusions of the Rail Regulator's periodic review of access charges.</p>

	<p pid=".425W.2/1">The Government have committed themselves to provide the railway administrators with sufficient funds to allow them to continue to pay trade creditors as invoices fall due for payment. We have also committed ourselves to provide sufficient funds to pay non-default interest, lease rentals and scheduled repayments to finance creditors for an initial period of 45 days. This will continue for the finance creditors who have signed up to certain standstill arrangements until a transfer scheme is proposed.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.2/2">We intend to enable a proposal to be made to the railway administrators which would, if accepted, result in the transfer of both the business of the company and the debt of the finance creditors participating in the standstill to a new company limited by guarantee. The new company would be financially sound and have a credit rating of at least BBB and potentially higher. Indebtedness would be transferred on broadly the same economic terms, applicable in the absence of default, as applied immediately before administration. Lenders should not lose any principal or interest.</p>

	<p pid=".426W.11/2">We recognise the importance of affordable housing in maintaining balanced and successful rural communities. We are taking a number of measures to improve the delivery of social housing in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.11/3">Last year just under 4,400 homes were approved in larger rural areas and market towns through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development programme and local authority funding. This was in addition to 1,321 homes provided by the same means in small settlements of fewer than 3,000 people.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.11/4">Our overall strategy is to ensure that the housing needs of people living in rural areas are properly identified; to increase investment in new social housing; to maximum delivery of affordable housing through the planning system; and to make the best use of existing property. We expect to deliver around 9,000 affordable homes annually in rural areas by 2003&ndash;04 through these measures, as announced in the Rural White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.11/5">We expect all local authorities to develop housing strategies that address the need for affordable housing. In addition, we want local authorities to make better use of the planning system to secure more affordable homes as part of mixed developments in markets towns and villages. We will issue shortly a consultation paper on the review of the planning system. The fundamental objective of the review is to improve the efficiency of the system.</p>

The new system will permit authorities to borrow without prior Government approval. Each authority will decide how much to borrow, taking account of the revenue resources it can afford to make available to service debt, and acting in accordance with a professional code being developed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. This increased flexibility to invest in their communities will allow authorities to deliver better value for money over the whole range of services, including housing. There is no proposal to remove the present prohibition on the mortgaging of local authority capital assets. The potential seizure of the property by a creditor would threaten the delivery of essential services. Loans are secured on all the revenues of the authority and that will remain the position. Legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.6/1">The General Affairs Council met on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase> in Luxembourg to discuss the EU's response to international terrorism. The GAC declared its total solidarity with the United States and confirmed its wholehearted support for the action taken in the context of legitimate defence and in accordance with the UN Charter and the UN Security Council Resolution 1368.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/2">The GAC reiterated the importance of a multilateral and global approach under the United Nations' aegis in order to strengthen the international coalition in its fight against terrorism in all its aspects. It identified emergency humanitarian aid in Afghanistan as an absolute priority and undertook to mobilise without delay aid amounting to more than euro 320 million. The GAC supported the efforts of the UN specialised agencies and expressed its concern at the difficulties of access and of convoying humanitarian aid in Afghanistan. The GAC appealed to the countries of the region to facilitate by all means possible the humanitarian operations for hosting fresh flows of Afghan refugees and will implement the necessary means to assist them in doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/3">The GAC agreed on the following points to guide the Union's future proceedings on Afghanistan, once it is freed of the al-Qaeda network and of its terrorists:</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/4" class="indent">the establishment in Afghanistan of a stable, legitimate and broadly representative Government, expressing the will of the people;</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/5" class="indent">the essential role of the UN in seeking a peace plan for Afghanistan;</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/6" class="indent">maintaining absolute priority for emergency humanitarian aid;</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/7" class="indent">a plan for the reconstruction of the country;</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/8" class="indent">the regional dimension of the stabilisation of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/9">The GAC committed the EU to making contact without delay with the international community and in particular the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his personal representative, Mr. Brahimi, in order to contribute effectively to the UN effort.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/10">The GAC decided to intensify the European Union's relations with the countries neighbouring Afghanistan in order to contribute to the stability of the region. Particular reference was made to Pakistan, India, Iran and the countries of central Asia. The GAC also expressed its determination to continue a close and co-ordinated political dialogue with its Arab and Muslim partners.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/11">The GAC emphasised the urgent need to relaunch the middle east peace process. The Presidency issued a separate statement condemning in the strongest terms the assassination of the Israeli Minister for Tourism, Rehavam Ze'evi.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/12">The GAC stated that the Union would be more effective in developing the common Foreign and Security Policy and making the European Security and Defence Policy operational as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/13">The GAC welcomed the fact that, in all the Council's configurations, work on stepping up the fight against terrorism was progressing satisfactorily and had already produced initial results. It noted in particular the following:</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/14" class="indent">the measures which had already been taken, in particular pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1373, against the sources that fund terrorism, such as the political agreement on the Directive against money laundering, application in full of the FATF measures and freezing the assets of persons and organisations linked to the Taliban;</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/15" class="indent">work in progress to draw up a list of terrorist organisations; the Council believed that regular meetings of the intelligence services were vital if terrorism is to be combated successfully; the Council approved a system of indicators making it possible to evaluate the commitment and the co-operation of third countries in the fight against terrorism;</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/16" class="indent">the progress already made in the examination of the Commission proposals on the European arrest warrant and terrorist offences and the establishment of a co-ordinated EU position in the context of the conclusion of a general UN convention on international terrorism; the Council requested that consideration should be given to any measure facilitating mutual assistance with third countries concerning the pursuit of terrorists or terrorist organisations;</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/17" class="indent">the many current contacts with the USA, including the Troika meeting scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="">19 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/18">The GAC also welcomed the Presidency's road map setting out all the initiatives and work carried out by the Council and listing those responsible for implementation, the time frames and progress made.</p>

We work closely with Operation Lifeline Sudan, North and South, and with the UN, ICRC and NGOs over access for humanitarian operations in Sudan. We regularly urge the Government of Sudan to stop denying access for humanitarian operations. We urge both the Government and the SPLM to improve the conditions within which humanitarian organisations work. We also aim to expand their access by visiting areas not usually accessible. For example our Ambassador in Khartoum visited Blue Nile state last month, the first diplomat to do so for some three years. Local UNICEF representatives said that his visit would help them gain access and establish a new office in that state.</p>

Sharia law is by and large not imposed on mainly Christian areas such as south Sudan, although there are federal laws which infringe on religious freedom (eg Islamic banking system). The situation is worse for Christians in predominantly Muslim areas, such as around Khartoum, where they face implementation of Islamic punishments. We have maintained strong pressure on the Government of Sudan to change their policies in this respect and there has been limited progress over the last year and a half. We are also actively promoting inter-religious dialogue between religious leaders in Sudan and the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".436W.0/2">We have pushed hard for the ratification of the UN Convention Against Torture (CAT) and raised it most recently at the EU-Sudan dialogue on <phrase class="date" code="">23 October</phrase>. Ratification of CAT is now being considered by the Council of Ministers before being submitted to the National Assembly. We also regularly lobby on individual reports of torture and other abuses, working closely with the Sudanese Victims of Torture Group.</p>

	<p pid=".436W.9/1">There have been some optimistic signs in Maluku in recent months. However, we continue to monitor events in the province closely. The United Nations has made several assessment visits to Maluku since 1999. It has found concrete evidence of only a small number of conversions, including the most highly reported case in Kasiui and Tior. Many of the Christians evacuated from the province in January are now reported to be voluntarily returning to their homes. Also, many Muslims and Christians who fled their villages to escape the violence are returning and Muslim leaders in some villages have asked for help in encouraging Christians to return.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.9/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) has pledged more than &pound;4 million to help establish the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Conflict Prevention and Recovery Unit in Jakarta. The unit will build capacity in conflict reduction and recovery in the provinces torn apart by ethnic conflict, particularly in north Maluku. These new initiatives will complement DFID-supported humanitarian relief programmes by addressing the causes underlying conflict&mdash;abuse of power, alienation and loss of access to and control of resources essential for every day life. We will continue to work with the Indonesian authorities and UNDP to promote a reconciliation, begin wider reconstruction work and to offer practical assistance where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.9/3">The UK's message to the Indonesian Government has been consistently clear: a long-term solution to regional conflicts can be achieved only through political negotiation and consultation with the people. I raised these issues with Hamzah Haz, the Indonesian Vice President when we met in Jakarta on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-27">27 August</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.9/1">&quot;The Informal Economy&mdash;A Report by Lord Grabiner QC&quot; (published March 2000), proposed that we test the use of advertising as a tool for changing public attitudes towards benefit fraud. We responded by piloting the Targeting Fraud advertising campaign in the north-west. Expenditure on this was &pound;2.2 million spanning the financial years 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01. The success of the pilot campaign led to the launch of the national Targeting Fraud campaign. The initial spell of advertising in March 2001 cost &pound;4.6 million and a forecast &pound;9 million will be spent on the campaign running from September 2001 to March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.9/2">Around &pound;400,000 is currently spent each year to promote the National Benefit Fraud Hotline, including the Shared Fraud Hotline pilot.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.9/3">These campaigns are part of a long-term strategy to reinforce our message that benefit fraud is wrong, unfair and will not be tolerated.</p>

	<p pid=".443W.0/2">A surplus from a pension fund scheme can carry a tax liability. A tax charge is provided for under section 601 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It applies to all payments to an employer from the funds of an exempt approved pension scheme, as the Scottish Transport Group schemes are and the National Bus Company schemes were.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.0/3">The tax payable on payments to pensioners will depend on the nature of the payment and the personal tax circumstances of the individual. Payments to Scottish Transport Group pensioners have not yet been finalised by the Scottish Executive.</p>

	<p pid=".449W.6/1">The establishment of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has long been recognised as a complex and challenging project. This was acknowledged in the report of the Home Affairs Committee published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-28">28 March</phrase>, which also perceived that the crucial consideration should be to ensure that the service that the CRB will provide is both robust and effective, rather than aim for a particular date to begin operating.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.6/2">The registration process began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-01">1 May</phrase>. The target date for commencing the issue of Standard and Enhanced Disclosures has been kept under review as the project has progressed. Latterly, the target date was November. But, in the light of an independent review, it has been decided to add two further stages prior to the commencement of live operations. These will enable the CRB's disclosure service to be rigorously tested in a simulated operational environment, in order to provide added confidence in the bureau's state of preparedness to begin delivering a high standard of service.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.6/3">It remains the intention to introduce the service on a phased basis. Subject to the testing outlined, it is expected that the CRB will start processing applications at the beginning of March 2002 in respect of cases which are subject to police checks under present arrangements; and all other applications for Standard and Enhanced Disclosures at the beginning of April.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.9/1">We have received a number of representations from MPs and members of the public with regard to the provision of free early education for three- year-olds in Leicestershire. In 2001&ndash;02 Leicestershire has been allocated &pound;3.1 million of Government funding to create around 2,600 free early education places for this group. Additional Government funding is being progressively allocated to all local authorities so that, by September 2004, all three-year-olds will have access to a free place. This is on top of any funding made available by local authorities themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.9/2">In the first term of this financial year, Leicestershire has committed more funds than it had agreed with the Department that the Government would supply for that term. This is an issue for the local authority itself to resolve but we are working with it to provide what assistance we can within the existing budget.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.12/3">Since September 1998, all four-year-olds have had access to a free early education place. The table shows, by local education authority area, the number of free early education places for three-year-olds that the Government will fund during the financial year 2001&ndash;02. These places are in addition to those already made available by local authorities from their own resources. Information on the number of places taken up will be collected in the spring term 2002.</p>

To help deliver this, we have 333 School Sport Co-ordinators (of a total of 1,000) in place who are working to increase the quality and quantity of after-school sport and inter-school competition in their areas and to enhance links between the schools and their communities. &pound;150 million has been committed to rebuild primary school sports and arts facilities, and a further &pound;581 million will be used to improve both primary and secondary schools sports facilities in every local education authority.</p>

They will take account of all relevant factors before recommending any changes. We consult all key stakeholders, including trade unions and employer representatives, before implementing changes.</p>

Over 150 projects, involving over 500 schools and 50,000 pupils, have received a total of &pound;3 million since 1998. Each project is different and individual projects have covered most areas of the curriculum and included a wide range of different schools. Some projects encourage schools to share facilities. An external evaluation of the programme by Leeds University school of education in 1999 found that it was achieving its objectives and contributing to raising standards in a cost-effective way.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.105/2">All 205 pilot schools used the year 7 progress tests in English and mathematics this year. Our initial analysis confirms that there is still further work to do with children who need additional help: 29 per cent. of eligible pupils who sat the test attained level 4 in English, and 11 per cent. in mathematics.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.105/3">We are looking in more detail at the results of the pilot schools. We will also have Ofsted's report on the first year of the key stage 3 pilot in November. On the basis of these findings, we will be in a position to decide what, if any, changes should be made to the strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.114/1">Lord Moser's 1999 report, &quot;A Fresh Start&quot;, notes that perhaps as many as 7 million people (roughly one in five adults) in England have difficulties with functional literacy and numeracy. These adults have a wide range of needs, varying from those who cannot read and write or perform the simplest calculations, to those who simply need to brush up rusty skills. We are commissioning a new survey next year to provide an up-to-date assessment of the scale of basic skills need in England.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.114/2">The Government have recognised the vital importance to individuals and the economy of improving adult basic skills. The national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy skills, &quot;Skills for Life&quot;, was launched in March this year by the Prime Minister. Our target is to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of 750,000 adults by 2004.</p>
