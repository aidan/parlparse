The interests of the Ministry of Defence are recognised under a service level agreement with UKTI.</p>

	<p pid="a.3W.5/1">The principal anti-air missile system (PAAMS), known as Sea Viper by the Royal Navy, is the primary weapons system of the Type 45 destroyer. With this capability, the Type 45s will be able to engage a large number of targets simultaneously and defend aircraft carriers or groups of ships, such as amphibious landing forces, against current and future threats from the air. This includes stealthy, highly manoeuvrable missiles approaching in salvoes, simultaneously and from several directions.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.5/2">The missile system is undergoing a rigorous test and integration programme to ensure that all aspects of the system have been thoroughly trialled before it enters service. In June 2010, PAAMS successfully completed a series of test firings. The trials were conducted over a range of scenarios of steadily increasing complexity, culminating in a salvo firing against a high speed and manoeuvring, sea skimming target.</p>

	<p pid="a.5W.9/1">The UK will press for radical reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). There must be more regionalised decision-making; genuine integration of fisheries with other marine policies; longer-term management planning; greater flexibility and certainty in the system; and a mechanism to ease the transition to a sustainable and profitable future. In particular we want to see decision making decentralised, and simplified, to give more responsibility for implementation to member states, for example where they are working together regionally.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.9/2">The wasteful practice of discarding fish must be brought to an end. Reform should give fishermen more control, incentives and responsibility for managing fish stocks and helping to reduce discards. Reform also gives the UK an opportunity to deploy evidence on how switching from landing based quotas to catch quotas can reduce discards.</p>

	<p pid="a.8W.3/1">The amounts spent by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) on advertising, public relations, consultants/contractors, bonuses, entertainment and overtime in each of the last five years are shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/2">In respect of advertising and public relations the RPA Communications Directorate, responsible for dealing with advertising and public relations, was established as a separate entity in November 2006. Unfortunately the data required to provide information for the 2006-07 financial year and earlier years are not held in a form that is easily accessible. As the extraction and collation of these data would require a considerable amount of work and incur an unacceptable cost an answer cannot be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/3">The figures shown for advertising relate to space paid for in print/online media to raise awareness of existing and new RPA managed schemes, regulatory changes and application deadlines, as well as recruitment activity during the 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 financial years.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/4">The figures shown for public relations encompass external public relations activity to raise awareness of RPA managed schemes, direct costs in media relations and agricultural shows during the 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 financial years.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/5">With effect from 2007-08 RPA does not employ consultants. From then all external resources employed to provide expert opinion, including holding interim position, are recognised and accounted for as contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/6">Entertainment figures relate to refreshments for meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/7">The bonus amounts include payments made to senior civil servants in RPA.</p>

These figures represent the sums that the ODA has committed up to the <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-14">14 July 2010</phrase>. These values represent the sums that the ODA has spent to date, rather than the end contract value, as the end contract value in many cases will not yet be known.</p>
	<p pid="a.15W.3/8">The figures given only account for the contracts awarded to the top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors rather than by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains. Examples of businesses from across the UK that are supplying the ODA's contractors is available in the business section of the London 2012 website under the heading ODA Suppliers, where you will be able to find suppliers listed by venue and sector:</p>

	<p pid="a.15W.3/10">The ODA estimates that it has approximately 140 remaining contracts to let, covering remaining requirements on the Olympic Park, transport, and ODA corporate requirements. The estimated value of the remaining contracts is approximately &#163;275 million. The remainder of the ODA's budget is allocated to transport projects being delivered with other partners, security and ODA operational costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.20W.11/1">The European Commission announced in May that, following the volcanic ash crisis, it was looking again at EU Regulation 261/2004. The UK supports Regulation 261/2004, which has protected passengers' interests and raised airlines' standards of service. However, as part of the Commission's review process, the UK has asked that it also look at one specific aspect of the regulation, relating to flight delays, which changed radically as a result of a European Court of Justice ruling last November. The Government have received several representations from airlines about the effects of this ruling, which could bring detriment to customers as well as high costs for industry. The Commission's review will be of interest to passengers and airlines alike.</p>

However, at least 110,000 households have received advice on mortgage problems through the Citizens Advice Bureau or their local authority in the last year.

However the coalition Government are committed to ensuring that interest rates remain low for as long as possible. This will be achieved by tackling the &#163;155 billion deficit which will help enable homeowners to stay in their own homes and avoid repossession through ongoing lower interest rates. The Government believe this measure will prevent repossessions better than any other individual scheme.</p>

I have reviewed the repossession schemes offered by Communities and Local Government, to ensure that they provide the best support for homeowners and value for money for the taxpayer. I can confirm that the Mortgage Rescue and Homeowners Mortgage Support schemes remain available as a last resort to homeowners facing the threat of repossession. The Homeowners Mortgage Support scheme will end, as planned, at the end of the financial year. I will be considering the longer term role for the Mortgage Rescue scheme as part of the Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="a.43W.2/1">In the interests of transparency, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July</phrase> I am publishing a report commissioned by the previous Government yet never published on &quot;Modelling and Forecasting UK Mortgage Arrears and Possession&quot;. This report presents the findings of research that the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit commissioned from Professor John Muellbauer and Dr Janine Aron. The project developed a model aimed at improving our understanding of the drivers of mortgage arrears and possessions and to predict how arrears and possessions may move over the next few years in different economic scenarios.</p>
	<p pid="a.43W.2/2">The report indicates that in a worst case scenario there could be 175,000 repossessions by 2012. However the coalition Government are committed to ensuring that interest rates remain low for as long as possible. This will be achieved by tackling the &#163;155 billion deficit which will help enable homeowners to stay in their own homes and avoid repossession through ongoing lower interest rates. The Government believe this measure will prevent repossessions better than any other individual scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.43W.2/3">In addition, the Council for Mortgage Lenders forecast for repossessions in 2010 remains at 53,000 but maybe lower.</p>

	<p pid="a.44W.8/1">The rationale behind the proposed local justice area (LJA) mergers in London is set out on page nine of consultation paper HMCS CP 12/10.</p>
	<p pid="a.44W.8/2">Although the potential reduction to the HMCS estate provides a compelling reason for proposed LJA changes, there is a wider context that relates to the need for HMCS to continue to be able to deliver an efficient magistrates courts service in London to a good standard, at a lower cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.44W.8/3">The LJA amalgamations being consulted upon are not however just borne out of immediate necessity. HMCS has also considered the longer-term and believes that the proposed nine LJA structure creates a strong and flexible operational foundation upon which likely future estates and business strategies can be built.</p>
	<p pid="a.44W.8/4">In formulating the London LJA proposals, HMCS had regard to such issues as the wider estates strategy, the capacity within the courts in the area, the likely size of combined benches, transport links, projected workloads and existing/historic operational connections.</p>
	<p pid="a.44W.8/5">Alternative amalgamations were considered. However it was concluded that the proposed South London LJA represented the optimal operational fit (when viewed across London as a whole), creating an LJA of a similar size to others with reasonable transportation links between the component boroughs. Account was also taken of existing operational connections-the three existing LJAs, for example, have already established one judicial leadership group where the judiciary come together to make decisions for the benefit of the three LJAs as a whole.</p>

We remain extremely concerned by the recent attacks against UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeepers on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-29">29 June</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-03">3 July</phrase>, and <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-04">4 July</phrase>. The UK joined with other Security Council members in agreeing a press statement which condemned such attacks and made clear the need for UNIFIL to be afforded the freedom of movement and security necessary to fulfil its mandate. Prior to this period however, as the UN Secretary General makes clear in his latest report (13th) on UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701, the security situation has been relatively quiet. I represented my concerns to the Lebanese Government during my visit to the region on 13-<phrase class="date" code="2010-06-14">14 June 2010</phrase> and we hope for no repeat of this incident in the future.</p>

We call on both Israel and Lebanon to comply in full with UNSCR 1701 and to work to maintain the existing stability.</p>

	<p pid="a.63W.8/1">My recent visit to Yemen on 22 to <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-24">24 June 2010</phrase>, was my first trip to the region. I took the opportunity to reassure my hosts that Yemen is a priority for the new UK Government. I met President Saleh and a number of his senior ministers. My discussions focussed on bilateral relations, the Friends of Yemen process and economic reform and were productive, friendly and encouraging.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.8/2">I explained that the UK remains committed to the process of assisting Yemen to tackle the sources of instability, chief among these being the decline of Yemen's economy. The UK and others agree that negotiating an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is vital in addressing the problems facing Yemen's economy. I am pleased to learn that Yemen has now agreed to an IMF programme, which will go to the IMF board for approval later this month. It will be important to see a well-managed implementation of the programme, with support from across the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.8/3">I also discussed how the Friends of Yemen process could promote support for Yemen and its people and how the UK could help take forward the process launched at the meeting held in London in January 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.64W.7/1">The price of the key fob cannot be separated from the cost of the security token, as they are purchased as one integrated device. The current cost to IPSA of the key fob and the integrated security token is &#163;75 plus VAT, inclusive of postage and packaging. Replacement security tokens (where for example they are lost or stolen) will be charged to the MP at cost price. IPSA does not make a profit on the security tokens.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.7/2">This is a reduction on the original cost of replacement tokens, which was &#163;127.58 plus VAT. IPSA has extended its IT support contract to absorb the costs of set-up, registration and testing, meaning the supplier does not charge IPSA support costs per token when supplying replacements. The cost to IPSA and to MPs now just covers the physical device and postage and packaging.</p>

While outsourcing and rationalisation of the Government estate can and will deliver towards the 10% savings, the ministerial working group established to ensure the delivery of this emissions target has indicated that is it not acceptable to deliver the savings on the basis of these alone. The aim is to deliver improvements in the way Government operates and procures, in order to reduce Government's demand for energy in a sustainable manner. The group has therefore agreed that there should be a mechanism to ensure that the target can be compared against any overall reduction in estate size or outsourcing, and Departments have been asked to provide regular data on their estate area and number of employees in addition to their emissions.</p>

The Green Deal will enable financing for energy efficiency improvements at no up-front cost to the end user, with repayments via Energy Bills.

	<p pid="a.75W.8/1">The Government are keen to ensure that land use, land-use change and forestry projects meet minimum sustainability and environmental criteria. We support requirements within the Kyoto Framework designed to ensure all projects meet local environmental assessment requirements, are subject to stakeholder comment, and are assessed to be in accordance with sustainable development by the host country. Responsibility for assessment of sustainable development in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) rests with the host country, though projects may be reviewed by the CDM Executive Board for a failure to meet local environmental assessment requirements, or for failure to consult stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.8/2">The Government play a procedural role in approving participation in CDM projects. When approving participation in projects, the Government require confirmation that any proposed projects meet sustainable development criteria as determined by the host countries, and confirmation that the project design document- including references to environmental assessment and stakeholder comments-is correct before issuing any letter of approval. We believe enforcement of the system is primarily a matter for the UN's Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board, and the Designated Operational Entity-a third party auditor responsible for validating the claims made in the Project Design Document, though false statements made in an application to the Government can result in prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.8/3">Experience with projects in the forestry sector is limited-only 16 have been registered internationally and to date the Government have provided letters of approval for four forestry projects in the Clean Development Mechanism; one each in Chile, Colombia, Moldova and India.</p>

	<p pid="a.86W.8/32">We do not collect data to indicate the proportion of these individuals who are subsequently referred to talking therapies. However, we do know that from October 2008 to March 2010 the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme received 765,491 referrals. If the numbers referred for treatment continue to increase at the current rate in excess of 1.65 million people will be referred for talking therapies by March 2011. This is in line with the plans to see 900,000 people in the first three years of the programme. In year two, we have launched a further 111 sites and by 2011, we expect all 152 primary care trusts to begin to be implementing an IAPT service. Information on the number of people accessing psychological therapy services in primary and community settings was not collected centrally prior to the IAPT programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.92W.11/1">The Government set out in the Coalition agreement, 'our programme for government', a commitment to ensure greater access to talking therapies to reduce long-term costs for the national health service. This is a clear public health priority for us and we are currently working to identify how best to take it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.11/2">Revised National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on schizophrenia was published in March 2009. This outlines the best way to treat and manage adults with schizophrenia in primary and secondary care. The guidance recommends that treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy should be offered to all people with schizophrenia.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.11/3">Psychological therapies can be a key element of the treatment of people with severe and enduring mental health conditions, particularly when these conditions are experienced alongside depression and anxiety disorders. In these cases, the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy and other NICE-compliant therapies is the recommended treatment. Services for these clients is largely provided by psychology departments in specialist mental health trusts. The implementation of Improving access to Psychological Therapies services for people in community settings with mild to moderate conditions can reduce the number of referrals to specialist mental health trusts and enable them to focus on providing services to those with severe and enduring mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.11/4">General practitioners or consultant psychiatrists can prescribe any medicine or treatment which they consider to be necessary for treating NHS patients, including NICE-approved treatments, provided that the local primary care trust or NHS trust agree to supply it on the NHS. Clinicians are responsible for deciding on the most appropriate form of treatment for their patients, and in doing so they are expected to take NICE guidance fully into account. The Department does not become involved in making clinical decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.95W.2/1">As part of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), primary care trusts (PCTs) are currently responsible for weighing and measuring children aged four-five years and 10-11 years, informing parents about their child's results and providing follow-up advice and support to parents. Schools do not receive data that would enable them to identify the results for an individual child.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.2/2">In March this year, the Department of Health and Department for Education issued guidance to schools, &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: National Child Measurement Programme Guidance for Schools 2010/11&quot;. This guidance states the purpose of the programme and what schools can do to support the programme. It also provides details of additional material which might be helpful for explaining the NCMP to children and parents/carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.2/3">The guidance explains that schools may want to use the NCMP as a tool to help engage pupils and parents/carers in whole school activities and programmes that support a healthy weight. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.2/4">Schools can request feedback on the results of the programme for their school from the PCT. However schools will not receive raw data. This is because small numbers of children in the school mean that school-level analysis of obesity prevalence is unreliable. There is also a risk that individual children may be identified, especially where data is broken down by sex or ethnicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.2/5">Schools will usually receive school-level feedback that shows how prevalence of overweight and obesity compares with their local or regional average, for example, whether the prevalence of obesity at the school is higher than or lower than the local or regional average. This approach maintains the confidentiality of individual children's result.</p>

	<p pid="a.100W.6/1">The information available by each decile of the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) (a subset of the Indices of Multiple Deprivation) has been placed in the House of Commons Library, alongside a selection of data available on the Department's In Your Area web site. The Department uses IDACI to analyse pupil attainment in deprived areas and information about whether a pupil achieved five or more GCSEs or equivalent including English and maths GCSEs has only been available on the Department's National Pupil Database since the 2003/04 academic year. The information has been split into two separate tables as IDACI deciles for the years 2003/04 to 2006/07 are based on the 2004 IDACI scores, while IDACI deciles for the years 2007/08 to 2008/09 are based on the 2007 IDACI scores. The 2007 IDACI scores are updated versions of the 2004 scores, however there were some changes in the scoring criteria which means that care should be taken when comparing the two.</p>

	<p pid="a.108W.2/1">Revenue funding for maintained schools currently goes through local authorities. We have inherited a needlessly complex system of funding which it is our intention to simplify.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/2">The core element of maintained school revenue funding is the Dedicated Schools Grant, which the Department distributes to local authorities, who then allocate it to schools in consultation with their Schools Forum. The total Dedicated Schools Grant allocation for financial year 2010-11 is &#163;30.6 billion (this is post the removal of an estimate of academy recoupment). Data on school budgets for 2010-11 are an Official Statistic that are due to be published in September 2010 and will be titled 'Financial reports on Local Authority planned budgets for their education and children's social care functions: 2010-11 (section 251 formerly s52)'. These Official Statistics will also inform how much of the Dedicated Schools Grant has been held centrally by the local authority. In 2009-10 approximately &#163;26.1 billion, excluding funding from the Learning and Skills Council, was budgeted for schools directly as reported by local authorities as at November 2008. This represents approximately 88% of the Dedicated Schools Grant for 2009-10 of &#163;29.6 billion (post recoupment for Academies). Assuming that the proportion of the Dedicated Schools Grant that is passed to schools remains constant, is approximately &#163;27.0 billion would be passed directly to schools in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/3">In addition to the Dedicated Schools Grants there are several grants which are fully passported direct to schools via the local authority. The totals for these grants for financial year 2010-11 are:</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/4" class="indent">School Standards Grant and School Standard Grant (Personalisation) = &#163;1.6 billion;</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/5" class="indent">School Development Grant = &#163;1.9 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/6">In addition, there are some grants where a component of the grant may be held by the local authority if agreed by the Schools Forum but else otherwise are passed to schools:</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/7" class="indent">Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant = &#163;202 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/8" class="indent">School Lunch grant = &#163;76 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/9">Total Devolved Formula Capital grant payable to maintained schools amounts to &#163;600 million in 2010-11, after deducting an advance of &#163;377 million that was made in 2009-10. The equivalent figure for Academies (i.e. net of advance), excluding <phrase class="date" code="">80 September 2010</phrase> openers which have the grant paid to them via their local authorities, is &#163;12.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/10">Academies are funded directly by the Department through the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA). Academy funding includes a school budget share which is based on the principle of equivalency of funding within any particular local authority. In addition, there are start-up grants, funding in lieu of local authority centrally retained budgets for activities that academies are responsible for, a grant for VAT and other grants as paid to maintained schools for which academies are also eligible. Academies are funding on an academic year basis. The financial year 2010-11 cost is not precisely known as academic year 2010-11 allocations are not complete for all academies. However, the initial transfer to the YPLA for grant to open academies for financial 2010-11, as set out in the agency's remit letter, is &#163;1.72 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/11">Until the above-mentioned Official Statistics are published, it is not possible to proportion out the funding that is allocated to schools precisely. However, considering the above estimates, approximately 67% of the Department's planned expenditure on schools of &#163;49.084 billion would be passed to schools directly in 2010-11. This equates to 57% of the total &#163;57.775 billion of the Departmental Expenditure Limit for 2010-11 as reported in the Departmental Annual Report 2009.</p>

In this situation, the old scheme cases in question will also be converted to the new scheme. This is called reactive conversion. In some cases, the partners of non-resident parents or the partners of parents with care may also trigger a reactive conversion.</p>

	<p pid="a.139W.5/1">Charity law is a devolved issue with each independent regulator having separate responsibility for the maintenance of a register of charities based in its territory. In Scotland this is kept by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) and in Northern Ireland it is kept by the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland (CCNI). The information requested for charities in Wales falls within the responsibility of the Charity Commission for England and Wales. I have asked the Commission to reply to these aspects of the question.</p>

	<p pid="a.139W.5/7" class="indent">With this caveat, the Register of Charities as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-08">8 July 2010</phrase> shows that:</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.5/8" class="indent">(a) there are 177 registered charities based in the Parliamentary constituency of Wrexham;</p>

The Digital Communications team supports policy officials and Ministers to engage and inform a broad range of audiences using digital channels which include social media. Currently three individuals are involved as a small part of their total duties in managing the Department's presence on social websites Twitter, Flickr and YouTube. On average the work is that of approximately 0.15 full-time equivalent staff.

	<p pid="a.156W.0/1">I have no plans to evaluate the efficacy or level of mental health care provision in higher education institutions. Universities have duties under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 (as amended) to support disabled staff and students in higher education, including those with mental health conditions. They will have similar duties under the Equality Act 2010, once its provisions start to come into force from October 2010. Universities are subject to the courts in the application of these duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.0/2">There is guidance available to universities on supporting students and staff with mental health conditions from a range of sector and medical bodies, including the heads of University Counselling Services, the Association of Managers of Student Services in Higher Education (AMOSSHE), the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the former Disability Rights Commission and most recently from the UniversitiesUK/Guild HE Working Group for the Promotion of Mental Well-Being in Higher Education.</p>

More recently, the Standard Industry Classification 2003 has been in use and there have been associated changes to the method used to identify traders amongst bankrupts and company liquidations by industry.
