	<p pid=".788W.5/1">A summary report published in August 2001, Fuel Poverty in England 1998, estimated that around 19 per cent. of rural households were in fuel poverty, compared with 15 per cent. of urban households. These figures will be updated in due course with the release of the 2001 English House Condition Survey.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.5/2">The depth of fuel poverty in rural areas may be affected by a number of factors. These include the disproportionate number of households which are off the mains gas network and properties which are considered hard to heat.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.5/3">A working group was established in 2001 to investigate extension of the gas network. There is evidence that lack of access to mains gas, which is currently the cheapest and most efficient fuel for domestic heating, contributes to keeping households in fuel poverty. The Working Group concluded that a full-scale extension of the gas network could not be justified on cost benefit grounds, but that extension to a more limited extent would be justified in certain cases. Work is progressing on identifying priority areas for any possible future extensions of the gas network.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.5/4">My Department recently commissioned a scoping study which is looking at the potential for alternative technologies to help tackle fuel poverty. This could be of particular relevance for rural communities, especially areas without access to the gas network. The study will also consider alternative methods for the treatment of 'hard to heat' homes. The report is expected early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.5/5">The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group, which was set up to advise Government on achieving its goal of ending fuel poverty, is also looking at issues which effect rural areas. It has already considered a paper on households without access to gas and is due to discuss households which are considered to be 'hard to heat'.</p>

	<p pid=".790W.2/2">The Environment Agency has set up the Restoring Sustainable Abstraction Programme to co-ordinate the assessment of the impact of water abstraction upon the environment. The programme brings together work relating to:</p>
	<p pid=".790W.2/3" class="indent">the review of consents required on European designated sites under the Conservation (Habitat &amp;c.) Regulations 1994</p>
	<p pid=".790W.2/4" class="indent">the statutory duty under Section 28G of the Countryside Rights of Way Act 2000 in relation to Sites of Special Scientific Interest</p>
	<p pid=".790W.2/5" class="indent">non-designated sites.</p>
	<p pid=".790W.2/6">The aims of the programme are to identify and investigate sites, both rivers and wetlands, where water abstraction may potentially be causing an impact upon the environment. Where it is demonstrated that such an impact is taking place, steps are taken to identify, justify and develop alternative, more sustainable sources of water.</p>
	<p pid=".790W.2/7">The Agency is working closely with English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales to identify designated sites that should be included in the programme. Sites within the programme are prioritised according to their importance, i.e. the level of designation, and urgency, i.e. the environmental risk posed. The Agency is developing a timetable for progressing investigations of these sites taking into account its available resources.</p>
	<p pid=".790W.2/8">Until the investigation work has been completed there is no definitive list available of all sites which have been, or are threatened with damage as a result of abstraction except for a list of SSSIs where investigations have shown that abstractions are having a detrimental impact. The table details sites where investigations have shown that abstractions are having a significant detrimental impact and remedial action has been taken and completed.</p>

	<p pid=".795W.2/2">The information requested is not currently held in a central, accessible form within the Environment Agency. A requirement has been identified, through the Agency's Restoring Sustainable Abstraction Programme, to store such information centrally. Work is currently in progress to modify existing database systems to allow this.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/3">In seeking to address environmental problems resulting from the effects of abstractions the Agency seeks wherever possible to secure negotiated and agreed solutions that avoid the necessity to use its statutory powers of revocation and the need for compensation. To date it has not used its statutory powers.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/4">The Agency has, however, identified three examples where it has secured environmentally beneficial solutions by making contributory payments. This may not be an exhaustive list.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/5" class="italic">River Worfe</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/6">The then NRA, pursuing its programme of resource recovery, negotiated with the holder of a surface water spray irrigation licence having a major impact on river flows during low flow periods. Agreement was reached to replace the unconstrained licence by a new borehole having significantly less impact on the river. The NRA undertook to construct and test pump the borehole at a cost of about &pound;60,000.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/7" class="italic">Redgrave and Lopham Fen</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/8">A high profile scheme was agreed to rescue this fen from damage by an abstraction by Essex and Suffolk Water. It involved relocating a public water supply borehole away from the fen. Total cost of the project was &pound;3.2 million of which the Agency contributed &pound;0.78 million. The rest came from Essex and Suffolk Water (&pound;1.02 million) and an EC life grant (&pound;1.4 million).</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/9" class="italic">River Mun</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/10">To restore flows in a small north Norfolk river, the Agency persuaded a local farming company to replace a summer surface water licence with a groundwater source. Licensing the borehole involved laying a water main to some isolated properties to prevent derogation of the rights of other abstractors. The Agency paid the &pound;30,000 cost of that.</p>

	<p pid=".796W.3/2">The controls on abstraction in Part II of the Water Resources Act 1991 and the clauses in the draft Water Bill will together be largely sufficient to deliver the obligation under Article 11(3)<i>(e)</i> of the Water Framework Directive. However, there are a number of small, but potentially significant, aspects of the abstraction licensing system that will require further consideration. The Department is currently consulting on what additional measures beyond the proposals in the Water Bill may be needed to fully implement the requirements arising under that Article.</p>

	<p pid=".797W.12/1">As described in the national aviation consultation documents, forecasts of unconstrained passenger demand out to 2030 are the starting point for assessing demand for airport capacity. However, this is not a 'predict and provide' approach: the forecasts only identify what additional capacity would be needed if demand were to be met, either fully or partially, so that the positive and negative aspects of that additional capacity can be appraised so as to reach a view on what, if any, degree of airport expansion is appropriate. The passenger forecasts are long term forecasts, anddepend on key factors influencing demand such as GDP and fares; they do not use aircraft orders to assess supply over shorter periods ahead since the availability of aircraft is not assumed to be a constraint.</p>

	<p pid=".798W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Mr. Greg Knight, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-04">4 December 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".798W.8/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Minister for Transport, John Spellar, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the closure of the northbound carriageway of the M1 motorway at junction 34.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.8/4" class="indent">The Highways Agency is currently carrying out major strengthening of the Tinsley Viaduct which carries the M1 Motorway across the Don Valley. The works cannot be completed without some limited carriageway closures. These take place overnight when traffic levels are low. The northbound carriageway was closed for each night between Monday 18 and <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-23">Saturday 23 November</phrase>. Alternative routes had been agreed with local authorities and were signed and publicised in advance.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.8/5" class="indent">The contractor has been carrying out welding work overnight and this has necessitated closures. Following work on the night of <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-23">Saturday 23 November</phrase>, cracking developed in the structure which, if untreated, would have deteriorated. Work could only be carried out with a complete closure of the road. No work could be undertaken on Sunday night because fog made it impossible to install traffic management safely. On Monday the position, which had been kept under review, began to deteriorate further. Taking into account the fact that delay would prolong the closure the decision was taken to close the carriageway that afternoon. This was done and the carriageway remained closed from 4 pm on Monday to 6.45 am on Wednesday. It closed again briefly later that night to allow clearance of the remaining traffic management.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.8/6" class="indent">In taking the decision the Agency took into account the severe congestion that the closure could cause in the area. Local authorities and the Police were informed of the closure as soon as the decision was taken. They assisted with traffic management using the Urban Traffic Control systems to adjust timings on traffic signals in the area. Local and long distance diversion routes were put in place and the closure was publicised through press, radio and the Agency's own website and information line. The information was updated throughout the time the carriageway was closed. Further works on the northbound carriageway will involve a series of closures starting mid February as part of the strengthening works.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.8/7" class="indent">The Viaduct is expected to re-open fully to three running lanes plus hardshoulder in each direction following completion of the strengthening contract in early 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.8/8" class="indent">If you would like any further information on the works being carried out to the viaduct please contact Simon Diggle, the Project Manager for the works, on 0113 283 5309 or e mail simon.diggle@highways.gsi.gov.uk</p>

	<p pid=".800W.2/1">The primary responsibility for equipping themselves to deal satisfactorily with their responsibilities for transport rests with local authorities themselves. We recognise that there is currently a shortage of personnel qualified in a number of disciplines relevant to local transport. My Department is therefore helping to fund the Transport Planning Skills Initiative, which is examining how more people can be attracted into the transport profession together with questions of staff training and retention. We are also funding the provision of 111 travel plan co-ordinators at 84 local authorities at a cost of &pound;9 million over three years, to promote the widespread adoption of travel plans in order to help tackle congestion. It is important, too, that the most effective use is made of the available expertise. Our Centres of Excellence initiative is designed to disseminate best practice in the preparation and implementation of Local Transport Plans (LTPs). We are funding the authorities responsible for 17 of these plans to undertake a programme of dissemination covering a range of local transport issues.</p>

It concluded that 14 new civil contingency reaction forces should be established from existing volunteer reserve personnel, and some 700 new volunteer reserve posts established to provide improved command, control and planning capabilities. Action on this is in hand.</p>

However, the Ministry of Defence is conducting a review of its estate to determine which are its long term core sites that are to be the focus of future investment. Those sites that are non core will come forward for disposal in the medium to long term. In the meantime, the Department agreed to generate income of &pound;500 million from the disposal of surplus land and property over the next three years.</p>

	<p pid=".817W.6/1">The Urban Battlefield Trainer (URBAT) is a computer system facilitating procedural training in an urban environment up to company level. It is designed to test and practice procedures through the generation of a battle picture, rather than having to deploy men and equipment physically. In particular, it tests headquarters in the timely issue and dissemination of orders, monitoring the effective flow of information and reaction to the unexpected. The current URBAT is located at Copehill Down training village on Salisbury Plain training area and is the only computer training system able to provide the required level of terrain definition to allow urban operations to be exercised effectively. A new system, known as URBAT 2, is currently being procured and should be in service by the end of July 2003. It will significantly enhance the training benefit by making use of different urban terrain mapping and increasing operator participation.</p>

	<p pid=".824W.5/1">In 2002&ndash;03, Staffordshire's average funding per pupil aged 11&ndash;15 is &pound;3,440, and for Birmingham it is &pound;4,230. We do not identify separately the amounts for individual constituencies. The reason for the difference is the higher levels of deprivation in Birmingham as a whole. Funding is distributed to schools and children through local education authorities' own funding formulae: these formulae can be a significant cause of the differences in funding between similar schools in neighbouring authorities, since they often do not take enough account of the needs of deprived children. We have issued guidance to LEAs about their use of deprivation funding in order to persuade them to target funding for deprivation at those children and schools that most need it.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.5/1">For solar photovoltaics there is no specific funding from central Government for training and skills development. However, funding is available through the Department of Trade and Industry's Renewable Energy Programme and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's Supergen Programme to support research and development projects. In addition, the Faraday INREB (Integration of New and Renewable Energy in Buildings) Partnership has a particular focus on training. A UK company is also involved in an EU ALTENER project to develop a training course for PV installers under City &amp; Guilds, and there are a number of other training courses being developed in response to the DTI's Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme (PV MDP). Finally, the DTI is running an Installer Accreditation scheme under the Management Contract for the PV MDP.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.5/2">For Solar Thermal, the DTI has funded two projects under its Renewable Energy R&amp;D Programme. One entitled XThe Creation of a Training Infrastructure for the Installation of Active Solar Systems&quot; (ETSU Report S/P3/248/REP), and the other under the EU ALTENER Programme, entitled XTraining Plumbers to Design and Install Solar Water Heating Systems for Households&quot; (ETSU Report S/P3/272/REP). There is also a network of Solar Clubs around the country, which aim to teach their members the basics of how to install a solar water heating installation for themselves. Finally, it is also the intention that the forthcoming Community and Household Renewables Scheme will also operate an installer accreditation scheme for the installers of small-scale renewable technology installers, including solar water heating systems.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-05">5 March 2001</phrase>, President Bush announced the imposition of increased duties on imports of a wide range of steel products following a safeguard investigation under Section 201 of the US 1974 Trade Act. Based on 2001 figures, 46 per cent. of UK steel exports equivalent to around 215,000 tonnes were covered by the measures. This equates to approximately 2 per cent. of UK producers' total sales of steel industry products. Subsequently the US Authorities announced exclusions resulting in 70 per cent. of UK steel trade with the US being unaffected by the US safeguard action. The Government will continue to take close interest in the US response to further requests from UK companies for exclusions, and will intervene with the US Authorities if necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.8/3">Following the US decision, the EU took the precautionary measure of establishing its own safeguard action to protect against a surge of imports into the EU diverted from the US market. In addition, the EU, together with a number of other WTO members (including China, Japan, Korea, Norway and Switzerland) is challenging the US safeguard measures in the WTO. The Dispute Panel ruling is expected in March 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".848W.2/2">The UK has been working with our EU colleagues on these issues for a number of years, as trade is a matter of community competence. Environmental and animal welfare issues have long been included among the EU's WTO negotiating priorities. At Doha, the EU successfully secured negotiations in the current WTO round to clarify the relationship between the trade clauses in Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and WTO law. In the negotiations we are pushing for a presumption of conformity between WTO rules and specific trade obligations in specific MEAs. This would cover trade measures in existing international MEAs on trade in endangered species, ozone-depleting substances, hazardous waste and chemicals. The Doha mandate also ensures that the issue of farm animal welfare will be taken into account as part of the current agreement on agriculture negotiations.</p>

However, most of these funds are being spent on pay for very small salaries for large numbers of civil servants that provide very limited services to the people of Afghanistan.

According to a report on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November</phrase>, two major health zones remain cut off from a re-supply depot in the capital, Bangui, due to the closure of the main road route on security grounds. The result of this has been a shortage of essential medicines and vaccines (e.g. for tuberculosis, polio and yellow fever) in the regional pharmaceutical depots. UK support to CAR is provided through multilateral agencies such as the European Commission.</p>

The main challenge is therefore the South Somali pastoral ecosystem that has shown itself to have the potential to infect populations in both Kenya and Tanzania.

Saudi Arabia has banned the import of cattle from Somalia, but informal trade, which is much less susceptible to regulation, probably persists across the Red Sea. Efforts are therefore needed to identify and control the persistence of Rinderpest virus at source. To this end DFID and the EC have been working in partnership with the African Union's Bureau for Animal Resources, the EC-funded pan-African Programme for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) programme and the Office International des Epizooties (the O.I.E.&mdash;the world organisation for Animal Health) to assist African countries in Rinderpest eradication, and subsequently in meeting the requirements of the O.I.E. 'Pathway', which leads to international recognition of Rinderpest freedom for the benefit of importing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.3/2">In particular, through its DFID-funded Community Based Animal Health and Participatory Epidemiology (CAPE) initiative AU/IBAR has developed service delivery systems that are capable of delivering mass vaccination in marginal areas such as the Somali pastoral eco-system, even in the presence of conflict, and of maintaining disease surveillance and early warning systems that feed into national systems.</p>

	<p pid=".855W.0/1">Southern Somalia and Northern Kenya together comprise the Somali Xpastoral ecosystem&quot;. Following the successes of recent years in eliminating the virus elsewhere, the Somali ecosystem constitutes what is probably the last reservoir of Rinderpest infection in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.0/2">Through DFID's long-standing involvement in Rinderpest control our understanding of the factors underpinning the disease and its persistence within pastoral ecosystems highlights the importance of several factors. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".855W.0/3" class="indent">The periods of drought which affect both Northern Kenya and South Somalia (forcing herders to migrate further with their livestock when they occur);</p>
	<p pid=".855W.0/4" class="indent">The ecosystem's remoteness and underdevelopment;</p>
	<p pid=".855W.0/5" class="indent">Conflict and civil war, which hamper control and surveillance efforts-particularly in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.0/6">DFID's direct involvement in efforts to eradicate the virus (which comprises financial support to the African Union's Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources and partnerships with EU-funded regional disease control programmes) has therefore been complemented by broader programmes in the fields of sustainable development, of vulnerability management through good governance and of conflict resolution.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.0/7">The fact that the Somali ecosystem is now believed to contain the last remaining foci of the disease underlines the considerable achievements that have been made in the field of Rinderpest eradication in the last fifteen years. The target for global eradication stands at 2010. The indications are that this target is achievable.</p>

	<p pid=".857W.3/1">The UK does not usually intervene directly to address humanitarian crises, but contributes funding to specialist organisations. These contributions are made through responses to the United Nations Consolidated Appeals, to appeals by the International Committee of the Red Cross and from international relief agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.3/2">We contributed &pound;1,350,000, &pound;850,000, and &pound;611,000 for humanitarian work in Eritrea, Burundi and Uganda respectively, in 2002. The 2003 appeals have now been issued and we are giving consideration to our response. Actual support in 2003 will depend on the level of humanitarian needs.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.3/3">Additional funding is provided through core support to international organisations including the UN, and through the European Commission. Nearly 20 per cent. of EC funding is paid for by DFID contributions.</p>

	<p pid=".857W.6/1">I discussed funding of UNHCR when the High Commissioner for Refugees visited London in July. Subsequent meetings have taken place between officials in Geneva and London, where funding of the agency was one of the items under discussion. We provided advice to UNHCR on the availability of funds from our regional programmes in response to local need.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.6/2">We are aware of the immense needs which UNHCR is mandated to address and the financial constraints within which it operates.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.6/3">Our core unearmarked contribution for 2002 is &pound;14 million. In addition, we respond as appropriate to direct appeals from UNHCR for assistance with specific short-term refugee emergency situations and reintegration programmes. In 2002 this assistance amounts to &pound;3.925 million to date. The UK share of EC Development Assistance, including humanitarian, in 2001 was 18.9 per cent. making the UK one of the EC's largest donors. In 2001 therefore, the UK provided &pound;7.9 million for UNHCR through the EC's overall contribution of &pound;41.8 million.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.6/4">I have also recently approved an extra &pound;1 million to fund UNHCR's community services activities in Africa. This will help underpin UNHCR's key protection activities: prevention of sexual and gender based violence, HIV awareness, self-reliance, youth education and capacity building of refugee social support networks.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.6/5">The UK has a strong record of support to UNHCR, both in response to emergency appeals and through longer-term institutional strengthening, focusing on helping the agency improve its management, working partnerships and programming. These partnership principles underpin DFID's Institutional Strategy Paper (ISP) for UNHCR, agreed with the agency in December 2001, and which forms the basis of our funding arrangement.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.2/22" class="italic">National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS)</p>
	<p pid=".866W.2/23">The Home Office counting rules have again been revised as from April 2002, in order to incorporate the new National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), which aims to introduce a greater degree of consistency to the ways in which crime is recorded in different police forces and to take a more victim orientated approach to crime recording. The effect will be to increase significantly the number of crimes in the recorded crime count.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.2/24">Avon and Somerset (from October 2000), Lancashire (from August 2000) and Greater Manchester (from January 2002) introduced the new standard in advance of national implementation, and the recorded crimes in these forces may be significantly affected. West Midlands adopted the Standard in April 1999, and hence the figures given will not be influenced by the Standard.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.2/25">The other SCI forces adopted the Standard in April 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".868W.2/1">For 2002&ndash;03 the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has provided non-governmental organisations, including the National Children's Bureau, Drug Education Practitioners Group and DrugScope, with &pound;100,150 funding for drug education purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.2/2">The Government also issued drug education and prevention funding (&pound;5 million in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;9 million 2002&ndash;03) to primary care trusts (PCTs). All PCTs and social services departments, in partnership with their local Drug Action Team, will use this funding to commission: <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary prevention activity for all young people identified as at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.2/3">The DfES has also committed &pound;15 million to local education authorities to support drug education in schools and this will rise to &pound;17 million in 2003&ndash;04. This increase will improve the quality and coverage of drug, alcohol and tobacco education programmes in schools. In many areas non-governmental organisations will be commissioned to deliver substance misuse education. However this is a local decision and there is no central monitoring of whether funds are used by local education authorities and PCTs to fund non-governmental organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".870W.3/2">Substance misuse education mainly involves harm prevention. However with children of secondary school age and particularly those at greater risk, such as school excludees and young offenders, this is balanced with harm reduction messages. These young people are more likely to be experimenting with illegal drugs and so need more detailed information. The Department for Education and Skills are currently reviewing guidance to schools on drug education and new guidance will be issued by the academic year 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.9/1">We are committed to tackling the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices that keep officers off the streets. Sir David O'Dowd's task force was commissioned to give the Government a police service view of what could be done to tackle the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices which keep police officers off the streets. The task force report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-17">17 September</phrase>, highlighted ways to free up significant amounts of officers' time. A steering group, co-chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office, is taking the task force recommendations forward. This is a vital opportunity to bring about a real difference to the everyday lives of officers on the front line.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.9/2">We have turned around the decline in police numbers that started under the last Government. The investment has been made to deliver a record number of police officers and there are now 5,400 more officers than two years ago. We are on course for our targets of 130,000 officers by March 2003 and 132,500 in 2004. We have also reached agreement on a package of reforms to police pay and conditions of service that is good for the service, for rank and file officers and for the public. We will ensure that officers know and feel that they are valued.</p>

This is being taken forward through a three-year programme which runs to April 2004. Work is being targeted where the risks are highest&mdash;in local prisons, on remand, in the early weeks and months of custody&mdash;within a broad preventative approach. An all-round pro-active approach will encourage a supportive culture in prisons based on good staff-prisoner relationships, a constructive regime and a physically safe environment. Six pilot prisons including Feltham young offender institution are testing the full range of new safer custody policies and standards, and the results of the programme will be subject to independent quantitative and qualitative evaluation.</p>

	<p pid=".882W.2/2">Not all parish and town councils make full use of the existing &pound;3.50 amount, but we are increasing it because it has been in place since 1990, and consultation responses to the XModernising Local Government Finance&quot; green paper have shown that it has been inhibiting expenditure for some councils.</p>

For parish councils, the Audit Commission's 'lighter touch' regime aims to develop a proportionate audit approach as well as a reduction in audit fees for most councils.</p>
	<p pid=".882W.2/4">The exact costs of best value are not known. However, the duty of best value should not have added excessive costs when a council is well organised and managed. Any additional costs should have been offset by gains in economy, efficiency and effectiveness and by the new opportunities provided by innovative service delivery through for example by partnership arrangements. Councils would have been free to plough back the savings made into core and other services.</p>
	<p pid=".882W.2/5">Moreover, the Government announced in the local government white paper XStrong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot; that it will pay a grant of &pound;30,000 per year to Best Value Town and Parish Councils to cover the costs of audit and the corporate costs of carrying out work relating to best value, such as preparation of performance plans and the management of reviews.</p>

	<p pid=".887W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-02">2 December</phrase>, the Government launched a soundings exercise on the level of interest in each English region (outside London) in holding a referendum about establishing an elected regional assembly. We are asking for views, information and evidence from people in each region, including local authorities, MPs, MEPs, regional chambers and others. Responses are requested by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/2">This soundings exercise will inform the Secretary of State's consideration of the level of interest in each English region in holding a referendum about establishing an elected regional assembly. Level of interest will be the primary factor in determining which regions will undergo a local government review by the Boundary Committee. Such a review, which must be carried out in a region before a referendum on establishing elected assemblies can be held, will recommend the most appropriate unitary local government structure for those parts of the region that currently have both a county and district council, should an elected assembly be established for the region.</p>

	<p pid=".894W.9/1">Two large European studies were commissioned in the early 1990s to study the possible health effects of Chernobyl fallout in the European childhood population. The United Kingdom population is included in these studies. The studies are known as the European Childhood Leukaemia-Lymphoma Incidence study (ECUS) and the European Childhood Abnormality Study (EUROCAS). The results produced so far show no health detriment linked to Chernobyl fallout. Results are consistent with current estimates of risk from radiation exposure. However, further work continues and more detailed results are expected in the future. The thyroid cancer research group, which made a valued contribution to the investigation of the increased incidence of thyroid cancer in children in Belarus, Ukraine and the Russian Federation following the Chernobyl accident, is planning a comparative study of childhood thyroid cancer between Britain, Poland and Belarus. Other much smaller studies have been drawn to our attention but the very small number of cases involved makes these studies very difficult to evaluate.</p>

	<p pid=".899W.8/2">Since autumn 2000 these inspections have been undertaken by patient environment action teams (PEATs), who assess hospitals against a range of 18 criteria, including standards of cleanliness at ward level and in common areas.</p>

NHS Estates advisers have been working closely with these hospitals, to ensure that remedial action is taken and appropriate systems put in place to ensure that the improved standards achieved are maintained.</p>

The centre at Estuary Commerce Park in Speke, Garston will replace the existing premises adjacent to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Completion of the construction phase is expected by mid-October 2003, and occupation is anticipated in summer 2004.</p>

The new Liverpool Blood Centre will also house, for the first time, the largest National Blood Service tissue banking facility in the United Kingdom. Research and development facilities at the new centre will support both tissue banking and tissue engineering.</p>

Medicines legislation allows a doctor or dentist to prescribe an unlicensed medicine to meet the special clinical needs of his individual patients, on his direct personal responsibility. Importers of all unlicensed medicines, who are licensed by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), must notify the agency on each occasion they intend importing an unlicensed medicine and there is a legal restriction on the maximum quantity they may import per notification.

The systems for clinical and cost effective use of medicines are covered by the Department's medicines management performance management framework. This framework focuses on secondary care and has been developed recently to strengthen working links with PCTs. We have also commissioned the National Prescribing Centre to produce guidance on good practice in managing controlled drug issues in primary care in the national health service. It is hoped to publish the guide in spring 2003. In addition, we are developing a guide, for use by PCTs and out-of-hours primary care providers, which will contain a minimum list of drugs that patients should be able to access from all such providers during evenings, weekends and bank holidays.</p>

	<p pid=".914W.7/1">The National Audit Office report entitled XTackling pensioner poverty: Encouraging take-up of entitlements&quot;, recognises the good progress the Department has made in helping pensioners to take up their entitlements. The Government are committed to tackling pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.7/2">We have already made substantial progress in taking forward the NAO recommendations, and welcome the contribution the NAO have made to informing the on-going development of take-up strategies and the Pension Service more generally. Our strategies focus on overcoming the barriers to take up and one of our key mechanisms for driving take up is the Pension Service, a new customer focused organisation dedicated to the needs of pensioners. This provides a major opportunity to further enhance the quality of our customer service by actively promoting take up. In addition to processing pension entitlements, staff will be trained to identify possible entitlement to other benefits such as housing benefit and attendance allowance. Local service staff in particular will have a significant role in encouraging take up in local communities, and work in partnership with organisations that deal with older people, as the NAO proposes.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.7/3">We have introduced a range of initiatives designed to encourage take up activity among pensioners: for the minimum income guarantee (MIG) we have undertaken a national advertising campaign, which resulted in almost an additional 140,000 claims with an average gain of &pound;20 per week; reduced the claim form from 40 to 10 pages; introduced a MIG specific leaflet, and we are identifying potential beneficiaries through key events, such as claiming retirement pension.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.7/4">A key priority, for both Government and the Pension Service is the successful take up of the new pension credit which will enhance and replace the MIG. It has been specifically designed to be easy for pensioners to claim and to be less intrusive. The weekly means test will be abolished for the over 65s and be replaced by a statement of their circumstances every five years. Capital rules will be relaxed and the upper capital limit abolished.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.7/5">In addition we have taken this opportunity to align the eligibility rules for housing benefit and council tax benefit with pension credit. DWP staff can now verify information on behalf of the local authority and we will be introducing legislation shortly that will enable local authority staff to do the same for DWP. This means pensioners will in time only need to report their changes in circumstances to one organisation (unless tenancy or dependant related). We are also removing the need for pensioners to re-claim housing benefit every 12 months. We will cut out duplicate claim forms so from April 2003, it will be necessary to complete just one housing and council tax benefit form. These changes are a significant step to simplifying the process and we are examining the scope for introducing further simplifications over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.7/6">Our take up plan for pension credit is extensive and makes use of a range of channels. We will transfer existing MIG recipients to pension credit, ready for payments to be made from October 2003; write to all pensioners not already receiving MIG by June 2004 to alert them to possible pension credit entitlement, supported by a national publicity campaign; work with local partners to help support the communications to pensioners, and tailor marketing and communications activity accordingly. We are setting a demanding PSA target to be paying pension credit to at least 3 million pensioner households by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.7/7">With attendance allowance and disability living allowance (AA/DLA), we are trialling new claim forms to significantly improve the way claims are made. Both claim forms were reduced from 44 pages to 34 in 2001 and we are currently trialling a shorter attendance allowance 16 page form. We are also developing a new claiming process for DLA for working age customers. First tests of the new claim pack started on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-26">26 November</phrase>. The claim form will be personalised and be the minimum size necessary for that individual's needs. If successful this approach will be extended to pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.7/8">We have accepted the NAO's recommendations for making further progress. This demonstrates the importance that the Department attaches to tackling pensioner poverty.</p>
