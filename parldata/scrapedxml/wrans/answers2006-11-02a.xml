	<p pid="a.556W.3/2">The '10 year science and innovation investment framework 2004-14' published in 2004 lays out our policies on science and innovation. We are pursuing a wide range of policies to encourage innovation:</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/3">The technology programme supports collaboration, knowledge transfer and research and development in promising new technologies. The business-led technology strategy board (TSB) ensures that the programme is focused where it can add most value. Since the TSB was established in October 2004:</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/4" class="indent">Over &pound;750 million of R and D activity has been leveraged from &pound;365 million of Government support;</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/5" class="indent">Over 40 specific technology areas have been supported;</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/6" class="indent">Over 500 projects have been approved for funding; and</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/7" class="indent">20 Knowledge transfer networks have been established.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/8">The higher education innovation fund (HEIF) encourages knowledge transfer from universities to business. This takes advantage of the UK's strengths in basic research to stimulate business innovation. It also helps those in academia to better understand, and benefit from, the commercial opportunities of their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/9">The patent office is building on its role as protector of intellectual property rights (IPR) by running a successful programme of activities educating people about innovation and the role IPR plays.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/10">Public procurement spend is worth around &pound;150 billion a year. Initiatives such as the small business research initiative (SBRI) and work by the Office for Government Commerce are helping to make government a more intelligent customer. This stimulates business innovation and increases value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/11">Research and Development tax credits encourage businesses to invest in R and D by providing tax relief on R and D expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.3/12">Skills are a major contributor to improving levels of innovation and productivity. We are therefore investing to raise skills in science, engineering, technology and mathematics, and emphasise the importance of management and leadership skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.560W.0/1">The UK's 25 per cent. derogation from its EU obligation to hold emergency stocks of oil is based on the extent to which UK consumption is supplied by UK production. Our projections are that UK consumption will remain fairly steady in the short to medium term. We expect, partly as a consequence of the new Buzzard field coming fully on-stream, that UK production will rise from current levels in 2007 and 2008, and will then fall, with the UK becoming a net importer of oil on a sustained annual basis by around 2010. A large and growing net import requirement is expected thereafter. It is not clear at what rate production will fall. But it is possible that it will fall fast enough for that proportion of refinery demand and through that of UK consumption which is met by UK production to fall below 25 per cent. We think it prudent to allow for this possibility in the context of our increasing oil stocking obligation, but are keeping the position under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.562W.8/1">Electricity distribution network operators, of which United Utilities is one, must offer terms to connect consumers. These are set out in their guaranteed standards of service. If consumers are not satisfied that their local electricity distribution network operator is meeting these standard terms and conditions they should discuss the matter with the statutory consumer body, energywatch. If energywatch believe the standards have not been met, they can refer the matter to the regulator, Ofgem, for investigation and action. It should also be noted that there is competition in connections so consumers do not have to use incumbent network operators to provide a connection to their property.</p>

For example; promoting opportunities for low carbon technologies; recognising the scale of future investment needed; and, underlining the importance of strong frameworks to support international climate change co-operation. The meeting also starkly illustrated the need for comprehensive global action to combat climate change.</p>

Most other industrial sectors have had to apply for an IPPC permit and comply with the provisions of the IPPC regime sooner than intensive livestock.</p>

This is a political decision for each national Government. The differing practices which are in place make it difficult to make comparisons of the costs to producers across the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.574W.2/2">I am pleased that following the UK calls the EU Commission has now requested those EU countries that are not yet members of the International Whaling Commission to join. I have also urged UK Government colleagues to reassess contacts with the Icelandic Government in order to make our displeasure absolutely plain.</p>

	<p pid="a.577W.3/1">DFID's standard conflict assessment methodology is the Strategic Conflict Assessment (SCA). The SCA is a framework to analyse the implications of conflict for development policy and programming, and vice versa. It is a flexible tool, adaptable to the country context and can be used in conjunction with a range of other assessment tools. The SCA has been in use in its current form since 2001. The framework is outlined in &quot;Conducting Conflict Assessments: Guidance Notes&quot;, which can be found on the DFID website at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/conflict-assess-guidance.pdf">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/conflict-assess-guidance.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.577W.3/2">As set out in the White Paper published in July 2006, conflict will be analysed as part of DFID's new, mandatory governance assessment framework that will be used to shape UK development policy and programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.577W.6/1">The ongoing negotiations on economic partnership agreements (EPAs) between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries have had an effect on the UK's international development strategies. These agreements are due to be finalised by the end of 2007. The Government have responded specifically to the ongoing EPAs negotiations and we published a policy statement in March 2005 on how we think EPAs should be designed if they are to help the ACP countries develop. This policy determines how we will influence the EPA negotiations and assess their outcome. We continue to talk to other EU member states about taking a similar approach and we continue to put pressure on the European Commission to take account of the ACP countries' development interests, most recently at the meeting of trade and development Ministers in Luxemburg on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.577W.6/2">A key outcome from our influencing has been the positive EU Council conclusions on EPAs signed by all member states on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase>. The Commission are obliged to adhere to these conclusions which endorse some of the key elements of the UK Position paper; notably the support for a flexible approach in which ACP countries will open up their markets to a lesser extent and at a slower pace than the EU. We continue to support ACP countries and negotiators in order to ensure that they have access to independent research and technical assistance. We believe this support will help the ACP make informed choices on what sort of trade relationship they want with the EU. The UK Government continue to be in close contact with the ACP in order to understand their needs and concerns. These conclusions also critically acknowledge the right of the ACP to decide the content of their EPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.577W.6/3">This year is a critical year in the shaping of the EPA negotiations as the EU's review of EPAs is in progress. The UK Government are committed to ensuring that this review is meaningful and with the full participation of the ACP. Crucially both the EU and the ACP have agreed that the recommendations of the review will be discussed at a high level and will be taken on board in the 2007 negotiations. As the negotiations progress into 2007, the UK Government will continue monitoring the approach taken by the Commission, as well as listening to the ACP, in order to ensure our 2005 commitments are honoured.</p>

	<p pid="a.578W.2/1">The proportion of bulbs purchased last year of a compact, fluorescent type is approximately 40 per cent. The proportion of fittings is somewhat higher, however, as these bulbs have a longer life expectancy than other types and are therefore purchased less often.</p>

The one building wholly managed by the PCO has not had a specific assessment of its carbon footprint, but is run in accordance with a green procurement policy which seeks to minimise its carbon footprint in a variety of ways. These include the use of energy efficient light bulbs and electrical equipment, minimising energy use and evaluating, as appropriate, the environmental performance of tenderers when relevant to any contracts.</p>

	<p pid="a.592W.6/2">Sure Start Children's Centres are at the heart of the Government's Every Child Matters Programme. They are a key vehicle for providing access to a range of integrated services for pre-school children and their parents. By 2010, there will be 3,500 centres&mdash;one for every community. Good progress is being made on the development of children's centres with over 1,000 centres now supporting families.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.6/3">A range of services are provided in children's centres, with all expected to provide the following core services: early years provision; family support and parental outreach; child and family health services; parental involvement and links to training and support through Jobcentre Plus. The nature of services in each centre will be shaped by local need.</p>

Annualised savings figures to 2050-51 are not available but the capitalised savings over 50 years were estimated at around &pound;13 billion and savings of at least this amount should be delivered through the scheme reforms once they have been finalised and implemented over the next couple of years.</p>

	<p pid="a.596W.3/1">Giving young people the skills and confidence to resist pressure and delay early sex has been an integral part of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy from the start&mdash;both through the national media campaign and in our guidance on sex and relationships education. Data from the independent national evaluation of the strategy show that over the course of the strategy, young people aged 13-17 have become less likely to overestimate the proportion of under 16s having sex and more likely to feel confident to resist pressure from friends. There has been no change in levels of under-age sex since the start of the strategy. The Department has received no representations about this campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.3/2">We are now building on this work, by developing new messages on delay for the national campaign and, through the &quot;Let's Leave it till Later&quot; training programme, giving professionals additional skills to discuss the benefits of delay with younger teenagers. This is part of broader sex and relationships education and training programmes which include information, knowledge and skills to equip young people who are having sex to make safe and responsible choices. The impact of the &quot;Let's Leave it till Later&quot; training programme is being evaluated as part of the larger evaluation of the Young People Development Programme, being piloted by the Department of Health. The report will be produced in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.3/3">It is not possible to separate the costs of the peer pressure and delay messages from the overall cost of the national media campaign. The costs contributed by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit to support the &quot;Let's Leave it till Later&quot; training programme were &pound;16,598 in 2005-06 and &pound;2,546 in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.3/4">There are currently seven members of the Teenage Pregnancy Unit. The campaign has been supported by officials in the Department's Communications Unit which has many other duties. It is the Department's policy not to give details about individual officials in response to parliamentary questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.3/5">A selection of the national campaign materials, including all the current materials on delay, has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.597W.2/1">Local authorities have a statutory duty, where necessary, to assess children with special educational needs (SEN) and draw up statements. In carrying out this duty local authorities must have regard to the guidance in the SEN Code of Practice. The Code advises that a local authority should consider carrying out a statutory assessment with a view to drawing up a statement if a child has not responded to the Code's school-based levels of support, School Action and School Action Plus, and that their needs are such that they cannot be met from the resources normally available to mainstream schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.2/2">Our SEN strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; (2004) set out a long-term programme to improve provision in mainstream schools so that more parents can feel assured that their child's needs are being met without the support of a statement The proper implementation of this strategy does not lead to a reduction of entitlement: children who might previously have been given a statement will continue to have their needs met from improved school provision and those with severe or complex needs who still require statements would continue to be provided with them.</p>

The Government remain committed to improving sporting opportunities for all our young people. Our overall aim, a joint DfES/DCMS public service agreement target, is to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who take part in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport each week to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. Our long-term aim is that, by 2010, we want to offer all children four hours of sport a week. We are well on track to delivering on our commitments and the 2006 target has already been exceeded by 5 percentage points.</p>

	<p pid="a.607W.0/1">The Home Office is funding the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux to provide an advice and assistance service to those who have been released from prison following a successful appeal against conviction. This service, known as the Miscarriages of Justice Support Service, is based at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. It provides advice and assistance to clients on a one-to-one basis in respect of such matters as: obtaining sufficient documentation relating to identity, gaining access to accommodation, social security benefits, local health care services and other mainstream provision. It also assists with practical day-to-day matters, such as opening bank accounts. This service does not extend to family members or legal personal representatives of those who have died prior to the quashing of their convictions. The aim of the service is to provide immediate assistance to those who find themselves suddenly released from custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.0/2">Family members and the legal personal representatives of those who have died prior to the quashing of their conviction can, if an application for compensation under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 is approved, seek financial recompense for the non-pecuniary and pecuniary losses sustained by the deceased. They are able, within their financial claim, to include their own expenses incurred in visiting the deceased while in custody, any campaign costs associated with the case, and legal costs. Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>, legal costs are based on legal assistance help rates.</p>

However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when these data are used.</td> </tr>

Market research commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) from Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) shows that 21 per cent. of respondents who were able to recall the advertising declared that they had already visited their council website as a result of the &quot;Connect to your Council&quot; campaign. This translates into &pound;1.3 million visits to the campaign home page and other local government pages of the Directgov website during the first burst of advertising between May to July 2006, with an increase of 88 per cent. in people accessing council websites from one in 11 of the adult population in England pre-campaign to one in six post campaign. Copies of the Central Office of Information (COI) evaluation report on the impact of the first burst of the campaign are available from the DCLG website.</p>

	<p pid="a.622W.5/19">The sum of the capital streams detailed in this table, &pound;4.772 billion, is greater than the figure of &pound;4.1 billion referred to in previous answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.5/20">The figure of &pound;4.1 billion took into account local authority HRA subsidy surpluses, recycled within the HRA subsidy regime and used in support of certain items. As recycled HRA subsidy surpluses are not direct Exchequer investment, but rather a benefit accruing from investment undertaken by the Exchequer in previous years, they were not included in the total capital investment figure referred to in previous answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.5/21">The table includes the contribution to capital investment made by recycled HRA subsidy, because while this contribution may be deducted easily from the overall total, its exact value cannot be attributed to any one particular funding stream.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.5/22">This investment in the table is a mixture of grant and supported borrowing and it should be noted that capital investment is not the same as capital expenditure. The figures in the table therefore constitute a mixture of direct grant and supported borrowing&mdash;where the Department gives the local authority money to assist them with the interest payments associated with borrowing money.</p>

	<p pid="a.629W.2/1">The right-to-buy scheme (RTB) became available to tenants in October 1980. Local authorities in England report the number of sales, amount of money received and the discount given to Department for Communities and Local Government on a quarterly basis. This return is not statutory, but generally levels of response are greater than 90 per cent.. In order to get a consistent estimate of RTB activity DCLG make estimates for missing LA returns. At the time of request, it is estimated that there had been a total of 1,734,940 right-to-buy sales in England between October 1980 and March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.2/2">Reliable information concerning the money received and discount given on RTB activity is only held from the financial year 1998-99 onwards. In England between March 1998 and March 2006 it is estimated that there have been 408,000 right-to-buy sales raising &pound;20,400 million in capital receipts after discounts worth around &pound;14,300 million given (2005-06 prices). The Housing Act of 1985 allows the Secretary of State to amend RTB discount levels by way of an Order. Full details of recent reductions in discount levels can be viewed on the web:</p>

	<p pid="a.630W.5/1">The planting of trees is a matter for each local authority to consider in the light of local circumstances and taking account of the needs of the local environment. To help guide such decisions, the Department encourages local authorities to develop tree strategies which evaluate the tree resource in their area and set policy objectives for how it should be managed and enhanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.5/2">At the national level, our &quot;Trees in Towns II&quot; research has looked specifically at our urban tree stock. It has assessed local authority policies, resources and practices in tree planting and management as well as the quality and quantity of trees in towns and cities in England. This research identifies changes since the initial survey was undertaken in 1992. The results, which we expect to publish in January 2007, will provide information that local authorities can use to evaluate their own tree policies and practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.5/3">More broadly we have put in place a planning and policy framework to ensure local authorities provide good quality urban parks and green spaces. The recent Public Accounts Committee report (October 2006) on enhancing urban green spaces recognised that good progress had been made, although work needs to continue to sustain and embed quality more widely.</p>

	<p pid="a.633W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your eight questions asking about clerical claims and home visits. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/4" class="indent">Any person requesting to make a clerical claim for a working age benefit can do so by filling in a clerical claim form. When handling such requests Jobcentre Plus staff will advise that other ways of initiating a claim are available and that these might be more convenient. Alternatives include claiming by telephone, which is our preferred channel, and claiming face to face.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/5" class="indent">Our Management Information does not record the number of requests made by our customers to complete clerical claim forms or whether or not a request for a clerical claim has been refused.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/6" class="indent">If a customer is unable to visit a Jobcentre Plus office because of a health condition or a disability, and they are unable to use the telephone or ask a third party to act on their behalf, home visits can be made to help conduct Jobcentre Plus business. Home visits can also be made where there is a suspicion of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/7" class="indent">There are currently six officers deployed on visiting duties covering the Hull and East Riding area including Beverley and Holderness. All requests for visits are carefully considered and where the customer is unable to access other channels for claiming benefit, such as using the telephone or attending a Jobcentre Plus office in person, then a home visit would be arranged. I should stress however that home visits are undertaken by exception, most customers prefer to use the other options available to progress their benefit claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/8" class="indent">We do not record the number of requests for visits and numbers refused. However, I can assure you that all requests for visits are carefully considered. The North East Yorkshire and Hull Jobcentre Plus District that includes the East Riding of Yorkshire has, in the six months up to September 2006, undertaken 4,771 home visits. This includes 790 visits instigated after receipt of a claim form where it was apparent that a visit was required to help progress the claim. Statistics on the number of visits carried out were not kept before April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.639W.6/1">The operation of the War Pension Scheme and the data recorded in the war pension computer system do not allow the question to be answered directly. War pensions are not awarded for individual conditions, but for the total degree of disablement due to service, assessed on a percentage basis. This overall assessment normally takes account of all conditions that are attributable to, or aggravated by, service.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.6/2">Data from the war pension computer system (&quot;WPCS&quot;) indicates that at <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase> there were approximately 44,000 pensions in payment for noise-induced hearing loss with no claim for any other medical condition. There were also some 33,000 pensions in payment in cases where noise induced hearing loss was one of a number of conditions accepted as attributable to service. It is not possible to say in these cases whether the pension included an amount in respect of the hearing loss: noise-induced hearing loss of less than 50 dB is not included in the assessment on which the pension is based if the claim was made after January 1993 and WPCS data do not distinguish between cases where the pension includes an element for noise-induced hearing loss and those where it is excluded. In addition, the data show around a further 30,000 cases with noise-induced hearing loss accepted as attributable to service with an overall assessment below the level that would attract an ongoing pension.</p>

	<p pid="a.640W.0/1">It is not possible to define the number of additional claims for compensation and war disablement pensions if the noise-induced hearing loss compensation threshold was lowered to 44dB or 35db. However, following a series of meeting with officials my predecessor wrote to the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (&quot;RNID&quot;) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March 2006</phrase> informing them that it would cost the MOD in the region of&pound;140 million per year if the Department reduced its noise-induced hearing loss compensation threshold to 35dB. This figure was based on data, for <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>, from the war pension computer system which shows approximately 105,000 cases with an overall assessment of between 1 per cent. and sixty per cent. with NISHL accepted as attributable to service. It does not take account of cases for which there are no records held on the computer system, or any new claims that will be made if the compensation threshold is reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.640W.0/2">All of the research work so far undertaken by the Ministry of Defence into the number of additional claims for compensation and war disablement pensions on the grounds of noise-induced hearing loss has been on the impact of lowering the compensation threshold to 35db.

	<p pid="a.647W.8/1">The information received by the Department did not differentiate acute trusts from primary care trusts. Each strategic health authority (SNA) was asked which of their health and social care systems, as locally defined, had integrated falls services in place by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.647W.8/2">Information on trusts whose falls service provide osteoporosis services is not held centrally. However, an audit of the organisation of services for falls and bone health for older people undertaken earlier this year by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) found that 58 per cent., of specialist falls services have specific referral arrangements to osteoporosis services.</p>
	<p pid="a.647W.8/3">As a consequence of the audit, the RCP has produced an action plan toolkit to support trusts in developing sustainable falls services. Suggested actions include assessment and treatment of patients and use of fracture liaison nurses as recommended in the audit. The RCP is currently developing a national clinical audit of services for falls and bone health in older people for spring 2007 also recommended in the RCP audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.647W.8/4">The RCP audit recommended that falls and bone health should be included in the general practice quality outcome framework. Proposals for osteoporosis were not taken forward for the 2006 GP contract changes because of technical problems with the proposed indicators and the degree of priority attached to other changes to the quality outcomes framework for general practitioners (QOF). As part of the ongoing development of the framework, steps are being taken to review the indicators in the light of emerging evidence, and in the context of a value for money agreement. NHS Employers have appointed Birmingham University for a period of three years to lead an expert panel to inform the ongoing review and development of the QOF.</p>
	<p pid="a.647W.8/5">A New Ambition for Old Age&mdash;Next Steps in Implementing the National Service Framework for Older People, published by the Department in April 2006, describes five components of an integrated falls service. One aim in the development of falls and bone health services is to increase capacity in osteoporosis services in DXA scanning for bone density as a guide to treatment. In 2005-06 &pound;3 million was allocated from a centrally held revenue budget for purchasing of additional scans in strategic health authority's where there are the most pressing short-falls. Capital provision of &pound;17 million has been made available in 2006-07 and 2007-08 to improve NHS capacity through investment in new DXA scanning equipment.</p>

This means that most of the central funding for the NHS has been allocated much earlier in the year than in past years.

Dialogue and co-operation between the two communities at all levels of society will provide the surest foundation for progress towards a comprehensive settlement. To this end, the UK has made financial contributions to the UN Committee for missing persons, and will continue to respond positively to requests for support for other bi-communal activities.

	<p pid="a.661W.0/1">We maintain a dialogue with the Turkish Cypriot community and Turkey on all aspects of the Cyprus problem, including regional trade liberalisation. We encourage the Turkish Cypriot community to make full use of existing opportunities for trade, including exporting goods to the EU via the Green Line and the ports of Limassol and Larnaca. This dialogue continued under the UK presidency of the EU. We do not have details of what representations have been made by subsequent presidencies or the Commission on the implementation of the Green Line Regulation or the use of the ports of Limassol and Larnaca. However, I would endorse the preliminary findings of the World Bank Report on northern Cyprus that the Green Line Regulation alone is not an effective means of promoting exports from northern Cyprus to the EU. Consequently, we continue to support further regional trade liberalisation in promotion of the economic convergence of the two communities and in support of a comprehensive settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.662W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) attaches great importance to all aspects of diversity, including age diversity. The Department already has a good overview of the age profile of our workforce and does not need to carry out an age audit. We are working closely with the trades union side on the implementation of the new age regulations, within the structural constraints of the FCO's workforce planning. As part of our commitment to age diversity, we have abolished the retirement age for the delegated grades below the senior management structure. The retirement age for senior civil servants in all Government Departments is currently set centrally, and has been raised from 60 to 65. We are exploring with the Cabinet Office whether it would be possible to abolish the retirement age for the senior management structure as well. The professional skills needs of older staff are dealt with in the same way as all other officers. Pre-retirement training needs are taken very seriously and a range of training and support is offered by a dedicated team. Anyone working for the FCO can ask to work flexibly. We have published flexible working guidelines for individuals and line managers on our intranet with a link to a flexible working network and an on-line discussion forum for flexible workers.</p>

	<p pid="a.663W.5/1">Article 42 of the Treaty of the EU (the &quot;passerelle&quot;) could be used to change the decision-making arrangements in police and judicial matters, if all member states, including the UK, were to agree. The change could include a move from unanimity, where we have the veto, to qualified majority voting. The European Commission suggested the change as a means of improving decision-making and accountability in the field of police and judicial co-operation.</p>

The Commissioner plays a key role in promoting respect for human rights and ensuring access to human rights for the citizens of Council of Europe member states. His role is fundamental to the core principles of the Council of Europe, which the UK strongly supports. The UK continues to work closely with the Commissioner and seconded an expert to his office from 2001 to 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.5/2">Alvaro Gil-Robles, the first Commissioner, visited33 member states during his tenure, including the UK in 2004. The UK co-operated fully with the Commissioner during this visit, where he met Ministers from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Home Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs, the Attorney-General and had an audience with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. The Commissioner also met representatives from the Crown Prosecution Service, the Commission for Racial Equality, the Prison Service, various Ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland and representatives of several non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.5/3">The UK responded to the recommendations of the Commissioner in a separate annex to his report, which was published in 2005. The UK welcomed the appointment of Thomas Hammarberg in April as a strong successor to Mr. Gil-Robles and will give him full support in his work.</p>

We welcome the progress made so far at the Juba peace talks but many difficult issues remain.

	<p pid="a.667W.3/1">We understand that our EU partners raise their concerns directly with the Israeli government. The UK continues to make representations to the Israeli government regarding the routing of the barrier. While Israel is entitled to take measures to strengthen their security, the routing of the barrier on occupied land is contrary to international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.3/2">We agree with the broad conclusion of the International Court Justice (ICJ), that building a barrier along the current route is unlawful. We supported UN General Assembly Resolution Emergency Session 10/15 which acknowledged the ICJ Advisory Opinion of <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-09">9 July 2004</phrase> on the legal consequences of the construction of the barrier in the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>

	<p pid="a.667W.6/1">We are deeply concerned about human rights in Sri Lanka in general. Officials from our high commission in Colombo visited Jaffna in October. It is clear that the fighting between the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in that area in recent months has had a serious impact on the security of Jaffna and its residents. The strong military presence and actions, such as wide-ranging curfews, are restricting the freedoms of Jaffna's civilian population and contributing to increased tensions. We are seriously concerned at reports of large numbers of arrests, and also reports of abductions and disappearances including those of children who may be being made to participate in fighting in clear breach of established human rights norms. The human rights of all Sri Lankans must be protected. Violations must be investigated fully. Those responsible should be brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/2">We call on the parties to the Sri Lanka conflict to respect the ceasefire agreement, cease hostilities and return to the peace process. We welcome the recent talks in Geneva between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE and encourage both sides to continue to meet in furtherance of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/3">We underline our support for the Norwegian role in the facilitation of the peace process. The only viable route to a long-term resolution of this tragic conflict is through negotiation.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.2/1">We were encouraged by the signing of a cessation of hostilities agreement between the Ugandan Government and the Lord's Resistance Army on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-26">26 August</phrase>. This agreement represented an important step towards achieving a lasting and peaceful settlement to the long-running conflict in northern Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.2/2">But, as the violence in recent days in southern Sudan demonstrates, the talks' process remains extremely fragile. A number of key challenges remain to be addressed if the talks are to succeed and all parties must show restraint and commit fully to the mediation process. The UK has provided &pound;250,000 to the UN fund for support to the mediation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.5/1">We have pressed for continued international attention to Zimbabwe, including through discussion at the UN Security Council. Most recently Jan Egeland, Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, briefed the UN Security Council on Zimbabwe on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-15">15 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/2">There is no UN sanctions regime on Zimbabwe. There is therefore no agreed basis on which collectively to make representations to the Government of Zimbabwe. But some UN members do have their own targeted sanctions on members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals responsible for the country's deterioration. This includes the EU, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada and associated countries. EU targeted sanctions include a travel ban and assets freeze on Mugabe and 126 members of his regime, as well as an arms embargo. We regularly discuss these with the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>
