	<p pid="c.1842W.8/1">The Green Paper set out our proposed measures to significantly reduce the number of people claiming and receiving incapacity benefits.

More precise measures will be established in due course.</p>

We will also identify those people whose illness or disability limits them so severely that it would be unreasonable to expect to engage in work-related activity at that point in time.

This might include use of a text phone, or arrangements for a face-to-face meeting at the local Jobcentre when a fully trained face-to-face First Contact Officer will take the required details from the customer. Jobcentre Plus offices are equipped with induction loops to support our vulnerable customers. Alternatively, the customer could elect to be represented by a third party.</p>

In addition, peregrine falcons, barn owls and red-billed choughs, are protected against disturbance during their breeding season by virtue of being listed on schedule 1. There are signs that the populations of these three species are slowly increasing within the UK, and the current level of protection is therefore considered sufficient to ensure their continued breeding success. The raven is not listed as a bird of conservation concern.</p>

The provisions in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 which banned media identification of sex offence defendants was repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 1988. This was based on the Criminal Law Revision Committee's argument in its 1984 Sexual Offences report which was that there was no reason in principle for defendants in rape cases to be distinguished from those charged with other offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.1861W.5/1">The London Childcare Affordability Pilot programme is jointly funded by the London Development Agency (&pound;22 million) and the DfES (&pound;11 million) and will run from October 2005 to March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.5/2">The pilot is being evaluated carefully so that lessons can be learned about its effectiveness in order to inform thinking about how best to address in future problems of affordability of child care for lower income families. There has been no decision at present to extend funding to other areas. However, we recently announced the allocation of the Transformation Fund to every local authority. This will enable private and voluntary providers to improve levels of qualification among their staff while maintaining affordability for parents.</p>

	<p pid="c.1861W.8/1">CWDC was launched in April 2005 with an overall aim to build the very best work force for children, young people and families. Since its launch, CWDC has been making good progress in building their capacity to deliver on the challenges set out in the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme. As part of this they have recruited a strong and committed board of employer and employee representatives from their sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.8/2">The first products of the council's early work will shortly appear. They will publish this month web-based advice for local planners on local work force strategies in support of their Children and Young People's plans. To complement this they will also offer local planners consultancy assistance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.8/3">With the Training and Development Agency for Schools they are working up proposals for developing professional roles within the early years and child care sector, as part of the implementation of the Government's 10-year child care strategy. These proposals will be published in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.8/4">The council is also taking a leading role in the Children's Workforce Network, a partnership of sector skills councils and similar bodies responsible for work force development across the full range of children's services in early years, education, social care, youth work, playwork, youth justice and health. With partners in the network the council has begun work to review relevant national occupational standards to embed a common core of knowledge and skills for all those working with children, young people and families and to develop an integrated qualifications framework to support service improvement and career opportunities for individual workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.8/5">CWDC is working with other organisations and Government to review recruitment and training and work force roles in social care as part of the recently-established 'Options for Excellence' Board. An initial report is due in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.8/6">CWDC is working with Government on its response to the Children's Workforce Strategy consultation, and will be commissioned to implement major parts of the strategy during 2006&ndash;07. The precise role which CWDC will play in implementing the CWS will be made clear in their Business plan for 2006&ndash;07 which is currently being developed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1862W.2/17">CAP did not operate on the basis of area allocations; referrals were made in relation to individual children.

	<p pid="c.1862W.2/18">During the lifetime of CAP, a total of 24 referrals were made in relation to children living in Gloucestershire. 20 of these received support geared to their individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1862W.2/19">Information on application rates by area was contained in the independent evaluation of CAP, work undertaken by University College London in conjunction with the University of York. The report was published in October 2004 as DfES Research Report 580 and it confirmed that CAP had positive benefits for the children being assisted and those working with them.</p>

	<p pid="c.1865W.3/1">We do not currently have any plans to revise the EMA criteria to include young people who are required to be in compulsory education. The purpose of the education maintenance allowance (EMA), is to provide an incentive to engage young people aged 16 to 18 in learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1865W.3/2">EMA is not based on the academic level a pupil reaches. It is targeted at those who have reached the end of their compulsory education, who have the option of dropping out of learning. People under the age of 16 are required to be in compulsory education.</p>

	<p pid="c.1867W.2/12">The statutory categorisation of Serious Weaknesses was introduced in September 1997 and that of Inadequate 6th Form in September 2001; underachieving was an Ofsted administrative category.

	<p pid="c.1867W.5/1">Pupils nationally have made excellent progress since 1997. At Key Stage 2 there has been a 16 percentage point improvement in English and a 13 percentage point improvement in mathematics up to 2005. The improvement in the proportion of 15-year-olds achieving five A*-C grades at GCSE and equivalents has been 11 percentage points. At Key Stage 3, there have been improvements in the core subjects of English, mathematics, science and ICT. The 2005 provisional results show increases of 17, 14, 10, and 19 percentage points respectively since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.5/2">These improvements flow directly from the success of our National Strategies. At primary level the introduction of the daily literacy and mathematics hours mean that compared with 1997, 84,000 more 11-year-olds left school in 2005 with the necessary basic skills in reading, writing and numeracy. In the four years since the introduction of the Key Stage 3 strategy, now extended to the Secondary National Strategy, the model of support and challenge for teachers has been very effective. The Strategy has made great gains in improving the life chances of 14-year-olds&mdash;the greatest improvements have been in the areas of highest deprivation. Last year's results mean that approximately 103,000 more 14-year-olds achieved the target level for their age in English and 86,000 more did so in mathematics, than in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.5/3">The proportion of 11 and 14-year-old pupils achieving the expected levels in English and mathematics and the GCSE and equivalent achievements of young people, in 1997 and the latest available year, in the Hendon constituency are available on the 'In Your Area' website at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/inyourarea/">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/inyourarea/</a>. 2005 figures are not yet available at constituency level for 14-year-olds but will be published on the 'In Your Area' website shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.1872W.2/109">We believe that more people with the potential to benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so. Higher education leads to a range of benefits, not only higher earnings but reduced crime, better health, and wider social capital benefits. The new student support arrangements offer a better deal for students from poorer backgrounds. We have reintroduced grants for those from low income households; we have ended up front fees; and we have introduced the Office for Fair Access so that universities have agreements on outreach and funding help that they will offer poorer students. &pound;300 million is being offered in bursaries and other financial support. Alongside this, the Government and its partners support the Aimhigher programme, which enables partnerships of schools, colleges and universities to design and deliver a range of aspiration and attainment raising activities to enable young people from backgrounds currently under-represented in higher education to be able and willing to go on to HE. We are also determined to improve educational attainment so that more people are in a position to benefit from HE. Our proposals in the Schools White Paper, which is now the basis for The Education and Inspections Bill 2006, will help ensure that every young person has the opportunity to reach their potential, including, where appropriate, university education.</p>

	<p pid="c.1881W.6/1">Trusts will help create a long term, stable and sustainable relationship bringing in partners to support the school's governance and strategic direction with clear aims and outcomes agreed at the outset. A school can decide whether it wants to acquire a trust and whom they might want to work with. It will be easier to use the Power to Innovate, with the potential for flexibilities to be agreed centrally and made available to all schools supported by the trust.</p>
	<p pid="c.1881W.6/2">Specialist schools, such as Wolstanton High School and Sir Thomas Boughey High School, could join a network of schools working collaboratively to help raise standards and share best practice in a specialist subject. Schools will benefit from the different perspectives, experience and skills of different partners to provide opportunities for greater efficiency or workforce development. For example, they may like to work with a university or training provider as part of a trust to gain access to additional educational expertise or create links between staff and students that raise aspirations and motivate schools students.</p>

	<p pid="c.1883W.8/1">Lord Donaldson said in his report Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas&quot; that the Scilly Isles were an obvious candidate for MEHRA status. However he made it clear that the actual decision on which areas would be MEHRAs must be founded on criteria, based on both shipping patterns and environmental importance. Lord Donaldson did not prejudge the outcome of this process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/2">Lord Donaldson also said that there may be a case for an Area to be Avoided (ATBA) or ATBAs, although he appreciated there is a need for the approaches to ports to be left unobstructed. Again, Lord Donaldson did not prejudge the outcome of these deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/3">Building on Lord Donaldson's report, the Department for Transport and the Department of the Environment (now Defra) worked closely with Devolved Administrations and statutory nature conservation advisors to develop the process for identifying MEHRAs through a robust and objective methodology. This included a parallel assessment of pollution from shipping risk and environmental sensitivity. Other environmental protection measures already in place at each location were also taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/4">Lord Donaldson's recommendation that the criteria should be set in such a way that not more than about a tenth of the UK coastline qualifies was also taken into account. Consequently, in accordance with this principle and the methodology, only those areas which scored highly both in terms of environmental sensitivity and in terms of risk from shipping qualified as MEHRAs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/5">The environmental sensitivity for the Isles of Scilly was not in question in this assessment. This is already acknowledged through existing protective measures that reduce the risks to such an extent that all the qualifying criteria for MEHRA status are not met.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/6">The proposal for an ATBA for the Isles of Scilly was discussed in detail at two UK Safety of Navigation (UKSON) Committee meetings. They decided that there was no evidence that existing routeing measures were ineffective and an ATBA would not necessarily enhance the measures currently in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/7">There are three traffic separation schemes, with associated inshore traffic zones, which have been adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in close proximity to the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/8" class="indent">(1) West of the Scilly Isles</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/9" class="indent">(2) South of the Scilly Isles</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/10" class="indent">(3) Off Land's End, between Seven Stones and Longships.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/11">There is also an IMO-adopted Recommendation on Navigation off the Isles of Scilly which advises laden tankers over 10,000 gross tonnage using the traffic separation scheme between Land's End and the Isles of Scilly to keep at least three miles seaward of Wolf Rock and further advises such vessels not to use the scheme in restricted visibility or other adverse weather.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/12">Additionally, an IMO-adopted voluntary reporting scheme recommends that laden tankers using the Isles of Scilly route to report to Falmouth Coastguard when at least one hour from the Estimated Time of Arrival of entering the route and on final departure.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/13">If, despite the routeing measures which are in place, a maritime incident occurs in the waters around Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, there are a number of safeguards in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/14" class="indent">A dedicated, Government-funded emergency towing vessel is on stand-by 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ready to respond to shipping incidents in the South Western approaches.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/15" class="indent">The Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP), provides overall command and control of operations during marine emergencies. The powers of direction invested in SOSREP are extensive and, as well as being an international first for the UK, the SOSREP role has proved very successful in a number of shipping incidents.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/16" class="indent">The UK has a well developed National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations, which would be implemented in the event of a significant maritime incident (and it is worth noting that Cornwall county council has its own coastal counter pollution contingency plan which complements the National Contingency Plan).</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.8/17" class="indent">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is well prepared to respond to a marine pollution incident. Counter pollution resources are stored on the Isles of Scilly and at Falmouth for response to small incidents. In the event of a larger incident, appropriate equipment from the major UK Counter Pollution stockpiles at Milford Haven, Huddersfield and Perth would be mobilised, and a sizeable stockpile of oil spill dispersants is located at Saltash. All counter pollution resources are maintained by private contractors, and strict contractual stipulations are in place for mobilisation anywhere within the UK within pre-determined timescales.</p>

The CPA was dissolved on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>, and despite a search of its records, the United States Government have not been able to trace receipt of this letter or any action taken as a result of it.</p>

Diplomatic status is conferred on high commissioners of Commonwealth countries as representatives of sovereign states. BOTs are not sovereign states and their representatives are not, therefore, entitled to diplomatic status. As a courtesy, they are listed in the London Diplomatic List, a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) publication, and, where they meet certain criteria, BOTs receive partial rating relief on their offices and residences based in London. Representatives of BOTs are also often invited by the FCO to attend official events to which high commissioners and ambassadors are invited, and they have full access to FCO officials.</p>

To ensure the widest possible participation in such a treaty, we believe this initiative should be taken forward through a UN based process. We are working with international partners to build support for the launch of such a process. In 2005, we secured EU and Commonwealth support. In 2006, we are continuing to build support, with the aim of securing the start of a UN process at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1904W.8/1">Iran's longest range in-service missile is believed to be the Shahab-3, which entered into service in 2003. It has a claimed range of 1,300 km, with a 750 kg warhead. This range would enable Iran to target Israel, Turkey and Cyprus, as well as large parts of Saudi Arabia. Iran has ambitions to extend the range of its missiles and develop longer range missile systems, which would give it the capability to target a number of European countries.</p>

But the barrier's route should be on or behind the Green Line, and not on occupied territory. Construction of the barrier on Palestinian land is illegal. The route is particularly damaging around East Jerusalem, as it risks cutting the city off from the West Bank and dividing the West Bank in two.</p>

	<p pid="c.1909W.2/1">The Business Case for Prism predicted &pound;10 million per annum savings by the end of the programme (January 2010). The Programme is aiming to ensure the full benefits of Prism are realised and has scheduled a 'Gateway 5 Review' by the Office of Government Commerce for the end of 2006. This will provide an independent assessment of the cost effectiveness of Prism.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.2/2">Prism brings major changes, it is not merely a new IT system. It establishes new processes and reinforces adherence to existing processes. This is a significant challenge, particularly for staff using Prism each day, including management officers, accountants and buyers. Their workload certainly increases during the first months of using the system. For many, this has been exacerbated by Prism's poor performance, particularly its speed. A concerted effort to improve this is beginning to pay dividends for a significant number of Posts. But many using satellite links continue to face slow performance. Despite this, our experience is that, once Posts get to grips with Prism, workloads start to return to normal. Posts with most Prism experience are beginning to see tangible benefits from the changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.2/3">The Prism Business Plan identified the potential to move staff from 'back office' to 'front line' functions throughout the network. 'Hub and spoke' pilots will take place in several countries during financial year 2006&ndash;07 to investigate providing 'shared services' from 'hub' Posts. Proceeding with 'hub and spoke' will need to be justified by a rigorous business/benefits case, validated through the pilots. It is too early to identify how this will affect staff numbers. Prism has not impacted staff numbers overseas to date.</p>

	<p pid="c.1916W.14/2">However, based on early feedback from licensing authorities, and in particular the Department's work with the 10 scrutiny councils, we estimate the overall level of appeals under the new regime is small and less than 1 per cent. of all applications. The number of appeals specifically against a refusal to grant a licence by a local licensing authority will be even smaller.</p>

	<p pid="c.1917W.2/1">As stated in the answer to the previous question, there is no express provision in the Licensing Act 2003 or the councillors code of conduct which precludes a councillor who has made representations on his own behalf from attending and speaking at a licensing committee on that application either as a resident or as a representative of other residents. However, in the planning case of Richardson and Orme <i>v</i>. North Yorkshire county council and others [2003 EWCA Civ 1860], the Court of Appeal confirmed that it is a consequence of the code that, in circumstances where a councillor has a prejudicial interest in a matter, he is required to withdraw from the committee meeting at which that matter is discussed. This would not preclude the councillor from giving written representations to the committee or asking a colleague to speak on his behalf to it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1920W.9/1">Cultural and sporting tourism are vital elements of the UK's domestic and inbound tourism offers, and are prominent in the marketing and promotional material of organisations which support British tourism at national, regional and local levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1920W.9/2">At national level, cultural and sporting events are central to the work of VisitBritain, both in overseas markets, and in marketing England domestically under the guidance of the England Marketing Advisory Board. A wide range of cultural events are promoted in this way. VisitBritain estimates that 1.6 million overseas visitors to Britain either watched or participated in a sporting event in 2002, spending &pound;1.1 billion during their stays, and the high profile of sport in VisitBritain's marketing work reflects that economic importance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1920W.9/3">The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in 2012, and the wide range of cultural events which will precede them, will of course provide further opportunities for the British tourism industry.

	<p pid="c.1923W.3/1">Through DFID support, the Government of Afghanistan's National Programmes will extend their reach in Helmand. Those programmes that are already active in the province are only active in certain districts. The National programmes operate by engaging implementing partners to deliver their programmes on the ground. As we have not yet identified which of these National Programmes we will support, it is not possible to identify the implementing partners we will be indirectly supporting. However, the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAG) and Mercy Corps are ready to start work under the Microfinance Investment Services Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA). BRAG is also an implementing partner for the National Solidarity Programme in Helmand. It is possible DFID will fund both of these programmes through its planned rural development programme in Helmand.</p>

At a minimum these security arrangements will match those provided by other Government Departments involved in the civilian deployment to Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="c.1923W.6/2">For all staff working in Afghanistan, DFID already has stringent security procedures in place. All DFID staff must comply with these at all times. Any staff deployed to Helmand would also be subject to these procedures. These include mandatory hostile environment training; briefing packs prior to arrival containing security advice and details of evacuation procedures; professional security briefing on arrival in Afghanistan; protected accommodation; armoured vehicles with armed protection; provision of close protection for medium and high risk movements; and a location notification system which tracks all staff movement 24 hours per day. In the event of an emergency, DFID also has access to International Security Assistance Force and Coalition forces military assistance. An on-going risk assessment is in place to ensure that these procedures continue to be both appropriate and adequate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1924W.8/1">DFID is currently funding non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Iraq through two principal mechanisms: the Political Participation Fund and the Civil Society Fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.1924W.8/2">The &pound;5 million Iraq Civil Society Fund (CSF) supports projects that strengthen the capacity of Iraqi civil society organisations through partnerships with international NGOs. Projects funded include building women's leadership capacity, training for Iraqi trade union leaders, developing child rights, social work training and education about the risks of mines. Support has been given to Christian Aid, Save the Children (UK), Mines Advisory Group (MAG), Help Age International, Women for Women International, Salvation Army, International Centre for Trade Union Rights, UNISON and the Women's National Commission. These partners have, in turn, supported a range of Iraqi partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1924W.8/3">The &pound;7.5 million Political Participation Fund (PPF) provides grants to grass-roots Iraqi civil society organisations to enable potentially marginalised groups to participate in the political process. Projects funded include an NGO conference, human rights conference attended by Ann Clwyd MP, campaign to encourage women to register for the elections, media, elections training, and campaigns and workshops on the constitution and referendum. Under the PPF, the international NGOs we have supported are AMAR, Arab Gulf Studies Centre, Institute of War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), and the Irish Human Rights Network.</p>
	<p pid="c.1924W.8/4">We are also providing funding directly to:</p>
	<p pid="c.1924W.8/5" class="indent">BBC World Service Trust, to strengthen independent TV and radio broadcasting in southern Iraq</p>
	<p pid="c.1924W.8/6" class="indent">ILAC, to support development of the Iraqi justice sector</p>
	<p pid="c.1924W.8/7">Prior to 2004, DFID provided long term project support to AMAR, ACORN, CARE, Christian Aid, and Save the Children (UK) for their work in Iraq. Immediately after the conflict in April 2003, we provided emergency humanitarian support through ACTED, AMAR, CARE, 4RS, GOAL, Help Age International, International Medical Corps (IMC), MedAir, Merlin, Mines Advisory Group (MAG), Muslim Hands, People in Need Foundation, Save the Children (UK), Solidarities, and War Child.

	<p pid="c.1924W.8/60">As PPA funds are unearmarked, we cannot directly attribute funding to specific activities or countries.

	<p pid="c.1926W.2/1">Supporting African leadership on conflict prevention, management, and peace building is the key to long-term success in improving peace and security in Africa. The African Union (AU)'s Peace and Security Council (PSC) protocol provides the framework for the African Union's work in this area. The 15-member PSC provides political direction and oversight to the AU's work on peace and security. The AU has agreed a Common Africa Defence and Security Policy and has produced a Strategic Plan and Budget (agreed in July and December 2004 respectively) that sets out the priorities in the peace and security agenda until 2007. Key elements include: establishing a Panel of the Wise (PW) of eminent Africans to engage in preventive diplomacy and mediation; an Africa Standby Force (ASF) to give the PSC the ability to undertake peace support operations; and a Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) to inform and advise the PSC on preventive action. The Africa Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) will support AU member states in setting and applying standards to strengthen the links between development, governance and peace and security. The AU is already playing a key role in addressing conflicts on the continent&mdash;as evidenced by its work in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Comoros, the Cote d'lvoire, Togo and Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="c.1926W.2/2">UK funds and activities have focused on supporting four priority areas essential for putting this system into place&mdash;support to the Conflict Management Centre in the Peace and Security Directorate of the AU Commission, help in operationalising the Africa Standby Force, funding and technical support to AU peace support operations, and support to the development of the AU's Continental Early Warning System. We have also provided financial and practical support to the African Union mission in Darfur.</p>

	<p pid="c.1930W.0/1">DFID has provided assistance to those affected by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident through our share of the nuclear safety component of the European Community's (EC) Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS) programme. This provides assistance to 12 countries in Eastern Europe and central Asia (in 2005 the UK's share of EC external assistance was 17.06 per cent.). The 2005 programme includes &euro;17.9 million for Ukraine. Its main aim is to attain the highest level of nuclear safety, including the management of the Chernobyl site. In addition the programme includes &euro;1.5 million for restarting previous agriculture activities and creating new jobs for those in the areas affected by the accident.</p>
	<p pid="c.1930W.0/2">DFID has not provided bilateral support for this specific purpose. However, other UK Government Departments have provided assistance bilaterally, as well as through the European Community, to the Government of Ukraine and to neighbouring countries to help to address the health and other problems experienced by families as a consequence of the accident at Chernobyl. Details of this assistance can be found in The Global Partnership&mdash;Progress during 2005 on the UK's programmes to address nuclear, chemical and biological legacies in the Former Soviet Union (URN 05/373)&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.1931W.11/3">In addition to helicopters, DFID channelled a further &pound;10.8 million through United Nations agencies in Pakistan and provided experts and other support to the UN to help fill critical gaps in their capacity, including vehicles and equipment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1931W.11/4">DFID also helped the transportation of relief supplies for the UK Disasters Emergency Committee by providing 78 relief flights.</p>

	<p pid="c.1932W.2/1">Promoting commercial competitiveness of small-scale farmers is critical to boosting growth and poverty reduction in Africa. Action is needed in three key areas: improving policies and public spending in support of small-scale farming; developing the business environment and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, so that markets function more effectively for small farmers; and improving the productivity of agriculture and access to markets. DFID supports programmes in all these areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1932W.2/2">For example, in Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana and Nigeria, we are helping governments to improve agricultural policy and public spending. This will help ensure that government and donor funds are more effectively used for agricultural development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1932W.2/3">DFID supports a range of programmes to develop the business environment which help improve commercial competitiveness of small-scale farmers. We are providing $30 million to the Investment Climate Facility as an important part of this. DFID has helped improve rural infrastructure in several countries including Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, bringing farmers closer to markets.</p>
	<p pid="c.1932W.2/4">DFID also supports the Business Linkages Challenge Fund, which for example, provided a grant of &pound;290,000 to the Great Lakes Cotton Company and Clark Cotton in Malawi (which drew in a private sector contribution of &pound;1,319,000) enabling them to set up new and sustained business relationships with more than 180,000 smallholder farmers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1932W.2/5">DFID has been at the forefront of pushing for a fairer world trading system and for an ambitious, development-focused outcome of the Doha Development Round of WorldTrade Organisation (WTO) negotiations. Ending cotton subsidies would increase world prices by between 10 and 30 per cent. bringing benefit to many small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa. DFID has provided trade negotiation support to the group of Least Developed Countries (LDC) and its Chair (Zambia). DFID is also working with major UK, European and Southern African food retailers, small producer organisations and standard setting bodies to find ways of improving African producers' access to high value export markets.</p>
	<p pid="c.1932W.2/6">DFID support to agricultural research and development in Africa through international and sub-regional research organisations is another important contribution to boosting agricultural productivity and increasing the gains to small-scale farmers from their investments. Some &pound;140 million is being provided for this over the next five years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1933W.2/2">The FTI has clearly helped additional resources to flow into FTI countries.

We have increased our support to the FTI to &pound;50 million over the next three years and the United States Government have announced US$62 million for education in FTI countries in Africa.

	<p pid="c.1934W.0/1">The Government recognise the devastating effect that the uncontrolled proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) has on developing countries. Preventing the illicit trade in SALW is crucial to dealing with the problem. Furthermore, most illegally-held arms begin their lives as legal exports. In combating the illicit trade it is therefore vital to regulate the licit trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/2">Over the last two years, DFID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD), under the SALW strategy of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP), have supported the following work:</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/3" class="indent">Research into the effects of armed violence and arms availability on poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/4" class="indent">Building political consensus for the development of tighter controls on government-authorised transfers of SALW.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/5">The research found the impact of armed violence and arms availability on development to be complex and multi-faceted. It is clear that the global arms trade tends to divert resources away from economic growth and development and that irresponsible arms transfers increase human insecurity and the risk of violent conflict.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/6">Armed violence has had negative impacts in terms of displacement, damage to education, health, and agriculture, and the impoverishment of large sections of communities and populations. For example:</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/7" class="indent">In almost all the internal conflicts examined, gross domestic product (GDP) declined under the impact of armed violence;</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/8" class="indent">High levels of armed violence in cities exacerbate economic inequality and social exclusion;</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/9" class="indent">Armed violence creates cycles of insecurity that are hard to break, and which have long-term poverty implications;</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/10" class="indent">In situations where armed violence persists, an alternative economy develops. Such patterns, including trafficking in drugs, conflict minerals and arms are difficult to reverse.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/11" class="indent">High levels of armed violence damage good governance and democracy by strengthening the hand of criminal elements and corrupt politicians.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.0/12">The UK has been working to build support for stronger controls on the transfers of SALW. We have built support from the ground up, through regional workshops and bilateral consultations. Supported by a growing number of states and civil society organisations, we are pushing for agreement on commonly accepted standards to guide transfers of SALW. We are doing so within the framework of the UN Programme of Action (PoA) on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms, which is due to be reviewed this summer. We also support calls for a negotiated, legally-binding Arms Trade Treaty, covering all conventional weapons.</p>

	<p pid="c.1934W.3/1">DFID recognises the importance of skilled attendants at birth to prevent deaths and injury of mothers and children. The 2004 DFID strategy Reducing Maternal Deaths: Evidence and Action highlights that skilled attendants can only work effectively within a functioning health service with a proper network of services and referrals that is accessible to all women. Therefore, DFID's approach is to support country Governments in their efforts to develop their overall health services including access to skilled attendants for women giving birth.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.3/2">The UK invests substantially in helping countries in sub-Saharan Africa develop their health services; for example, we support international groups such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), provide direct support to country Government's overall and health budgets, and fund some targeted projects. We also fund a lot of operational research.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.3/3">In addition to supporting Government health plans, DFID also invests in programmes tackling specific issues. The shortage of health care workers in many African countries is a barrier to improving access to skilled birth attendants. In Malawi, where the shortage is particularly severe, we are supporting the Government's ambitious plans to tackle the problem. DFID is providing &pound;100 million to the Malawian health sector&mdash;&pound;55 million of which is earmarked for the emergency human resources programme which aims to improve recruitment and retention of health workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.3/4">DFID is committed to a year on year increase in spending on maternal health. DFID's bilateral expenditure (excluding spend through general poverty reduction budget support) on programmes marked as contributing towards improving maternal health has increased by 34 per cent. over the last three years (and by 41 per cent. if reproductive health services which contribute to reducing maternal mortality are included).</p>

	<p pid="c.1935W.2/1">The average spend on health in many developing countries in Africa is well below the $35&ndash;40 per capita that the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend is necessary for essential health services. That is why the UK Presidencies of the G8 and EU last year focused on increasing the amount of aid provided to support African plans for poverty reduction, including for improving health services. G8 countries committed to provide an additional $25 billion by 2010 and to support the removal of health user fees where countries wish to do so. African countries, for their part, committed to increase domestic resources channelled to development and develop long-term plans, including for health.</p>

	<p pid="c.1936W.2/1">HIV/AIDS is a serious problem and DFID is working hard with African country Governments and international agencies to tackle it. In 2004, Taking Action: The UK Government's Strategy for Tackling HIV and AIDS in the Developing World&quot; was launched. An interim evaluation of implementation of the strategy is underway but results are not yet available. During 2006, reports will be produced, including a mapping of UK Government programmes on HIV and AIDS, a working paper on reaching women, children and vulnerable groups, and country case studies. This interim evaluation will provide preliminary indications of progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.2/2">In Sierra Leone, DFID's focus is on improving governance and security, both of which impact on the causes and effects of HIV and AIDS. In addition, DFID helps organisations in Sierra Leone to raise awareness in young people about HIV and AIDS issues and improve access to condoms. Annual reviews show that knowledge of HIV and AIDS among young people is impressive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.2/3">In the broader Mano River region, DFID does not have full development programmes in either Guinea or Liberia, but does provide humanitarian assistance to both these countries. However, both countries have accessed funding through the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM)&mdash;$9.6million to Guinea and $7.6 million to Liberia. DFID has committed &pound;359 million until 2008 to GFATM and supports the secretariat in the development of performance measures to better demonstrate its results and improve its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.2/4">DFID is continuing to support improvements to funding and international co-ordination of HIV and AIDS control. For example, we have doubled our financing to the Joint United Nations programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to support progress on the Global Task Team and are co-chairing the Global Steering Committee on Scaling Up towards Universal Access which will be of benefit to all poor countries including those in West Africa. DFID has committed to spending &pound;1.5 billion to support AIDS work between 2005 and 2008.</p>

The total cost to DFID was &pound;5.6 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;2.7 million in 2004&ndash;05. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-29">29 June 2004</phrase>, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has managed life support provision centrally for all UK Departments working in Iraq. This life support includes security support contracts, as well as other costs such as vehicles, building work, food and accommodation for UK personnel. Each Department then reimburses the FCO for its share of the cost. DFID's share of these life support costs is estimated at &pound;23 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;28 million in 2005&ndash;06. Without the close protection provided by private security companies, it would be impossible for DFID staff and contractors to carry out much of our work in Iraq; for example, visiting Ministries and projects outside the secure compounds in Baghdad and Basra.</p>

	<p pid="c.1937W.5/1">In the last quarter of 2005, DFID provided both financial and technical assistance to the National AIDS Secretariat to undertake a review of the HIV/AIDS response in Lesotho. That report is not yet public, but the information provided as follows is taken from it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1937W.5/2">Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) started in Lesotho in 2002. There are now 15 sites across the country. The Government run 11 of those sites and the Christian Health Association of Lesotho (CHAL) manages four. By September 2005, there were 3,448 people receiving treatment. The private sector does provide treatment, but there is no reliable data available. There is similarly no data for the number of children receiving treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1937W.5/3">Services are provided free through the public sector, though there is a charge of 10 Maluti (roughly equivalent to &pound;1.00) for registration. There is significant demand for care and no apparent stigma or discrimination limiting uptake of services. Overall financing for the ART programme is relatively secure, primarily through resources provided by the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria.</p>
	<p pid="c.1937W.5/4">Major challenges to increasing access to treatment include the generally weak health infrastructure (per capita public health expenditure is in the region of &pound;16.00) and a shortage of skilled health personnel in key elements of the ART programme. The World Bank and Development Co-operation Ireland are working to address these issues through their support to the Department of Health.</p>

	<p pid="c.1938W.5/1">In 2004&ndash;05, the UK provided a total of &pound;36 million in bilateral assistance to countries in the Mano River Region. This comprised &pound;27 million to Sierra Leone, &pound;8.4 million to Liberia, and &pound;200,000 to Guinea. The UK also provides assistance through multilateral agencies (European Commission, World Bank and UN agencies) to these countries. For 2003 (the most recent year for which data is available) the UK's share of this contribution through these agencies totalled &pound;15.8 million (&pound;6.3 million to Sierra Leone, &pound;1.7 million to Liberia, and &pound;7.8 million to Guinea).</p>
	<p pid="c.1938W.5/2">Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and are eligible for debt relief through the HIPC Initiative. Sierra Leone and Guinea are currently receiving interim debt relief and are progressing towards HIPC Completion Point, when they would receive irrevocable debt stock cancellation. Liberia is in arrears in its payments to the World Bank and has yet to receive interim debt relief because progress under the HIPC Initiative has been hampered to date by conflict and governance concerns. We anticipate that Liberia will start to make more rapid progress through HIPC under its new government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1938W.5/3">Because Sierra Leone has established a track-record of macroeconomic stability under its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and is implementing a full poverty reduction strategy it is expected to reach Completion Point by the end of 2006. Guinea is also making good progress on its IMF Staff Monitored Programme and could reach Completion Point in late 2006 or early 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1940W.5/1">Since 1999 the UK, through the cross-Whitehall (the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP), managed by DFID, has provided in the region of &pound;8 million of support to the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF), the Ministry of Defence (MOD), and the Office of National Security (ONS) through the Sierra Leone Security Sector Reform Project (SILSEP).</p>
	<p pid="c.1940W.5/2">The SILSEP has been complemented by a parallel programme of support to the Sierra Leone Police (SLP) through the Commonwealth Community Safety and Security Project (CCSSP). This project has carried out extensive police reform since August 2000. This has resulted in the re-establishment of a more effective and accountable civilian police service which has improved safety and security, and respect for the rights of people, especially the poor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1940W.5/3">Confirmation of the effectiveness of the UK's intervention in Sierra Leone was the decision by the UN Security Council to withdraw the UN Peacekeeping Force (UNAMSIL) at the end of 2005. This decision was made on the basis that the SLP and the RSLAF were able to assume responsibility for protecting the country from threats to internal and external security. This is an endorsement of the progress made in reforming both institutions. No security problems have been reported since UNAMSIL's withdrawal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1940W.5/4">The SILSEP and the CCSSP are subject to DFID's standard internal performance management processes, which include annual and end of project reviews. The most recent assessment of the SILSEP programme undertaken in October 2005, concluded that the project continues to be successful and recommended that enhanced ownership should continue to be transferred to the institutions themselves, but that greater participation of civil society institutions on security related matters should be encouraged.</p>

	<p pid="c.1941W.5/1">There is currently little reliable data on enrolment rates for primary and secondary education in Sierra Leone. The following gives some indication of the situation:</p>
	<p pid="c.1941W.5/2">According to Ministry of Education data, 1,156,841 children are in primary school. This represents 135 per cent. of the primary age group (six to 12 years). It exceeds the group population because it includes many older pupils who have returned to school, having missed the opportunity during the civil war. It is estimated that 375,000 children of primary school age are not attending school.</p>

	<p pid="c.1942W.2/1">DFID provides most of its support to Africa to 16 focus countries, as outlined in its public service agreement with the Treasury. It is committed to helping country Governments strengthen their health services. Health worker shortages are a complex issue, and go beyond migration and international recruitment. There are both pull factors that attract workers away from where they are needed and push factors that motivate them to leave. That is why DFID is not only working closely with African countries but also with the UK Department of Health on both sides of this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.1942W.2/2">The UK is the only developed country to implement systematic policies that explicitly prevent the targeting of developing countries in the international recruitment of health care professionals. DFID worked closely with the Department of Health to draw up a list of countries, which includes all the sub-Saharan African countries, from which the NHS does not actively recruit. In addition, the Department of Health has brokered a groundbreaking agreement for this code to apply to major players in the UK independent health care sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.1942W.2/3">A shortage of workers is a symptom of a health service in crisis. Health workers leave their jobs because of a lack of housing and schools in underserved areas and because of a lack of opportunity for professional career development. This is coupled with poor pay and working conditions which prevent them from doing the jobs they have been trained for, by failing, for example, to provide the required drugs and equipment. All this is exacerbated by HIV/AIDS. Workloads are heavier and health-workers themselves are dying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1942W.2/4">The UK invests substantially in health, supporting African country Governments to strengthen their health services and systems. We use a variety of means to do this, either through support to international agencies, direct support to Government budgets, by pooling our funds with other donors or through projects. This is complemented by operational research. For example, in Malawi, where the shortage of health workers is particularly severe, we provide &pound;100 million support for the health sector of which &pound;55 million is earmarked for the Emergency Human Resources programme. This programme focuses on improving recruitment and retention through salary increases for health workers, expanding training capacity; doubling the number of nurses and tripling the number of doctors in training; and using international volunteer physicians and nurse tutors while more Malawians are being trained. The programme is also bolstering human resources planning and management capacity in Malawi's Ministry of Health.</p>

	<p pid="c.1943W.3/1">Across the whole of Darfur, there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance. The priority is to provide help and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives. In the South of Sudan the humanitarian situation remains fragile. Pockets of instability, noticeably in the Upper Nile, Eastern and Western Equatoria, have resulted in continued internal displacement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1943W.3/2">Although the massive humanitarian effort in Darfur has had a positive impact on malnutrition and mortality rates, the region remains highly dependant on food aid. Instability, fighting and banditry in South and West Darfur, particularly along the border zone with Chad, is severely hampering humanitarian agencies operating in those areas. Violence and attacks on humanitarian agencies' staff and assets has lead to a reduction in presence, and total withdrawals in some areas, by both the UN and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid="c.1943W.3/3">The UK is the second largest donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &pound;96 million since the crisis started in September 2003. These funds have been channelled through both UN agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and have meant that thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic health care. DFID have committed a further &pound;67 million to humanitarian relief in Sudan in 2006&ndash;07. As part of this commitment, the UK is providing &pound;40 million to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), a pioneering multi-donor fund, administered by the UN humanitarian co-ordinator. This new mechanism will help enable the UN to react more quickly and more flexible to both identified and unforeseen needs, not only in Darfur but across all of Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="c.1943W.3/4">In addition to funding vital NGO humanitarian programmes in the South, the UK is providing financial support to an emergency response fund for the South to deal with emergencies, such as the cholera outbreak. For longer term recovery and development, the UK is establishing the &pound;10 million service delivery fund which we hope will be able to move quickly to support the basic provision of education, health, and water and sanitation. This will act as a bridge to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund while it develops projects for funding to meet longer term development needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1944W.2/1">We are using two multilateral instruments to ensure that our aid assistance achieves national coverage. Firstly, we have allocated &pound;40 million to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This fund is managed by the UN humanitarian co-ordinator, allowing him to fund humanitarian priorities across the whole of Sudan (in 2006 almost 42 per cent. of the CHF was allocated to the South). Secondly, we pledged at the 2005 Oslo donors' conference, a contribution of &pound;47 million to the two World Bank managed Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTF) (&pound;23.5 million each). MDTF-National covers the war-affected areas of the North and the three transition zones of Abyei, Upper Nile, and Nuba Mountains; and the MDTF-South is for South Sudan. We have also established a &pound;17.2 million Basic Services Fund which we are using to support non-governmental organisations to provide essential services in education, health and water/sanitation in the most deprived areas of South Sudan before the MDTF-South comes on stream.</p>
	<p pid="c.1944W.2/2">Finally, we are turning our attention to the East of Sudan (which has some of the poorest human development indicators in the country) and we have started a &pound;2 million Chronic Poverty Fund, concentrating on Red sea state.</p>

Provision of reserves for ISAF is the responsibility of NATO. Under current arrangements, ISAF can be reinforced 'over the horizon' by elements of the NATO strategic reserve force (SRF), and although the NATO response force (NRF), which is under UK leadership until July, does not act as a reserve as one of its routine missions, it too could be called upon in extremis to provide support. Theatre level reserves should be provided by allies through the NATO force generation process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1948W.0/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase>, a total of 103 British Forces personnel have died while serving on Operation TELIC since the start of the campaign in March 2003. Of these, 79 are classed as killed in action&mdash;including as a result of hostile action&mdash;and 24 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents, or have not yet been officially assigned a cause of death, pending the outcome of an investigation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.0/3">Centrally available records show that some 230 UK personnel have been treated at UK medical facilities in theatre for wounds received as a result of hostile action between March 2003 and January 2006 <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.0/4" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Before October 2004, we only have centrally held records for the Shaibah UK Field Hospital. The figure does not include, for example, UK casualties of hostile action who were treated either by other UK Field Hospitals (early stages of operation only&mdash;for which unit records are not held centrally) or by coalition partners, or those with more minor injuries who did not receive Field Hospital treatment. From October 2004, the figure relates to all those wounded who were treated in any of the UK medical facilities in the UK-led Multi-National Division South East MND(SE) area. This figure excludes any personnel who subsequently died.</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.0/5">Our Notification of Casualty reporting records also allow us to give a figure for those categorised in theatre as Very Seriously Ill/Injured/Wounded (VSI), meaning that their life was imminently endangered. Some 40 personnel were categorised as VSI as a result of injury or wounds, however caused, in Iraq between March 2003 and January 2006 <sup>2</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.0/6" class="indent"><sup>2</sup> The VSI figure excludes any personnel who subsequently died in theatre.</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.0/7">Separate records show that between February 2003 and January 2006 up to 4,000 military and civilian personnel (including a few Iraqis) have been medically evacuated from theatre. The great majority of cases were due to illness or accidental injury and not as a result of hostile action.</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.0/8">The Ministry of Defence intends to publish casualty figures for Iraq on the MOD website in the next few weeks, identifying the number of personnel categorised as Seriously Injured&quot; and Very Seriously Injured&quot;. The figures will be updated regularly.</p>

	<p pid="c.1956W.12/1">The Government's strategy for the Thames Gateway, Creating Sustainable Communities: Delivering the Thames Gateway&quot; (March 2005) recognises the importance that culture plays in bringing people together socially, so that they form mixed and integrated communities. The Government believe that communities with culture at their core are often more vibrant and ultimately more attractive places to live.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/2">The Thames Gateway Programme Fund has already been used for a number of cultural projects across the Gateway including:</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/3" class="indent">&pound;1.45 million for the refurbishment of the Thameside library and theatre complex in Grays;</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/4" class="indent">&pound;1.75 million for the creation of the award winning Old Laban dance centre in Lewisham;</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/5" class="indent">&pound;100,000 for the refurbishment of The Broadway arts venue and training facility in Barking;</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/6" class="indent">The acquisition of a former factory sports club, in Gravesend, and its transformation into a sport, social and cultural asset for the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/7" class="indent">Over &pound;20 million of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's funding is going into the regeneration of Dartford town centre. This is helping to provide real impetus to the wider regeneration across the town. Although not being funded by ODPM, this complements the construction of a new stadium, not only as a multi sports community facility but to support the return of Dartford Football Club to the town centre and the adjacent Leigh technical college is to be rebuilt as an academy school specialising in sport, enterprise and business. These developments are all on the new Fastrack route providing for enhanced accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/8" class="indent">Heritage sites in Chatham, Fort Amherst and in Gravesend, Old Town Hall, have also been in receipt of ODPM funding towards preservation and development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/9">Sport England provide the strategic lead for sport in England and are responsible for delivering the Government's sporting objectives. As part of this objective, they help local authorities plan for the provision of sporting facilities including playing pitches, golf courses and other sports requiring green areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/10">One major project that Sport England are doing in partnership with the Thames Gateway Strategy and delivery divisions of ODPM is the Thames Gateway North Kent Cultural Framework and Toolkit. The project, funded to the tune of &pound;60,000 by the Thames Gateway delivery unit, is to develop a framework for culture in the area to set a consistent context for cultural planning in Thames Gateway North Kent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/11">The toolkit will bring together in one place the analytical tools used by the various cultural agencies, such as Sport England's planning contributions toolkit, to help local authorities in particular to deliver cultural facilities through the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/12">It is further hoped that the local regeneration partnerships will incorporate this thinking into their planning processes, with ODPM approval, so that a consistent approach to cultural provision is embedded in the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1956W.12/13">Finally, the 2012 games will leave a legacy of world class sporting facilities for both elite and community use. The facilities will comprise a 25,000 seat stadium, an aquatic centre with two 50m pools and diving facilities, a hockey centre, a velodrome and BMX area, and a multisports arena.</p>

	<p pid="c.1961W.0/1">Controlled drugs are classified under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 according to their comparative harmfulness. The overall aim of the drug strategy is to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs. It focuses on the most dangerous drugs (i.e. class A), the most damaged communities and those who cause most harm to themselves and others.</p>
	<p pid="c.1961W.0/2">The Drug Harm Index (DHI) (measuring the harm from illegal drugs using the Drug Harm Index. Home Office Online Report 24/05), which has been developed to monitor the public service agreement (PSA) target to reduce harm caused by illegal drugs&quot; agreed in the 2004 Spending Review, incorporates the harms that individuals and society suffer due to drug-related crime, the health impact of drug use and dealing on communities. A high level description of how harm reduction is measured is given in the supporting PSA Technical Note SR04&mdash;PSA four, which is available in the Library. As a measure of the overall impact of the drug strategy the DHI shows a 9 per cent. reduction in the harms caused by drug misuse between 2002 and 2003 (i.e. the latest complete data available).</p>
	<p pid="c.1961W.0/3">By identifying the most dangerous drugs, the classification system provides a focus for efforts and resources to be targeted in the most effective way. However, it is the drugs strategy, and underpinning evidence, which drives the reduction of drug-related harms rather than the classification system itself.</p>

	<p pid="c.1962W.2/1">I am clear from discussions with my opposite numbers internationally that a number of other countries, including the United States are likely to move to using 13 biometrics in due course, based on face fingerprints and iris biometrics. The use of multiple biometrics has been accepted in principle in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Blueprint for machine readable travel documents which has been accepted by the 188 ICAO contracting states and includes the face as the primary mandatory biometric and iris or fingerprints as secondary and optional biometrics.</p>
	<p pid="c.1962W.2/2">The United States already has one of the leading biometric systems to identify visitors, the US VISIT&quot; system. When announced in April 2003, it was made clear that it would use biometrics which could include facial image, fingerprints and iris images. Although it currently requires all foreign visitors to the United States to enrol facial image and two index fingerprints on entry, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security said in July 2005 that, in the future, first-time visitors to the United States will be enrolled in the US VISIT&quot; system by submitting 10 fingerprints. 10 fingerprint biometrics will also be used in the US in the Registered Traveller Program&quot; which has piloted the use of fingerprint and iris biometrics along the lines of our own Iris Recognition Immigration System (IRIS) to allow for fast track immigration clearance of registered passengers.</p>

The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.</p>

	<p pid="c.1983W.2/1">The Government have only introduced reduced rates where they offer the best-targeted and most efficient support for our social objectives. The VAT reduced rate for the renovation and repair of private dwellings is one of a number of reduced rates introduced into EU legislation on an experimental basis whose objective is to create employment opportunities by stimulating demand through lower prices. The Government have always chosen not to participate, as we believe that our employment objectives are better targeted through measures such as the welfare to work strategy and new deal, which have contributed to the 2.3 million rise in employment since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="c.1988W.5/1">A wide range of organisations such as KPMG and the World Economic Forum produce international competitiveness rankings, based on a variety of criteria. In addition, the Department produces an annual update of the Productivity and Competitiveness Indicators, which benchmark UK performance against the US, France and Germany. These look at performance on the Government's five key drivers of productivity, and, overall, give reason for optimism regarding UK productivity performance. But the real measures of the competitiveness of an economy is how well it is performing. On the basis the UK is doing well. GDP has grown for 54 consecutive quarters, the longest sustained expansion on record; the UK's employment rate is the highest among the G7 economies (bar Canada); and we are enjoying the longest period of sustained low inflation since the 1960s.</p>

	<p pid="c.1988W.8/1">The matter raised is the responsibility of the Regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which is accountable to Parliament rather than to Ministers. Accordingly, I have asked the chief executive of Ofcom to consider the issues raised by this question and both reply directly to the hon. Member and to provide any appropriate advice to Ministers. Copies of the chief executive's letter will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.1993W.0/1">Analysis of the overall effects of changes in fuel prices and incomes, excluding consideration of energy efficiency improvements, suggests that the total number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty is likely to rise by around one million households in England between 2003 and 2006, with a proportionate increase in the devolved Administrations. This is based on a range of price and income assumptions underlying the Energy Review consultation document published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1993W.0/2">Work on the best way to tackle fuel poverty in the light of rising energy prices is being taken forward in the context of the Energy Review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1993W.0/3">A household is said to be fuel poor if it needs to spend more than 10 per cent. of its income on all fuel use and to heat the home to an adequate standard of warmth. A vulnerable household is one containing children or someone who is elderly, or sick or disabled.</p>

	<p pid="c.1996W.9/1">The Small Business Service uses VAT registration and de-registration data to estimate the failure rate of businesses. Businesses can be tracked from the time that they first register for VAT until the time they de-register. VAT data covers businesses of all sizes, although the majority of businesses which register for the first time are small.</p>
	<p pid="c.1996W.9/2">8 per cent. of UK businesses registering for VAT in 2003 had de-registered within one year. These data are available at <a href="http://www.sbs.gov.uk/survival">www.sbs.gov.uk/survival</a>. Figures for 2004 will be available in winter 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="c.1996W.9/3">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have failed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2004. Failure rates based on VAT data will therefore only provide an indication of true failure rates of small businesses.</p>

The Redundant Building Grant provided financial assistance to a large number of private enterprises within de minimus State Aid regulations to assist with the refurbishment of redundant agricultural buildings.

	<p pid="c.2007W.2/1">I am told by the South West of England Regional Development Agency that it does not hold information on jobs created by county. As a strategic organisation many of the activities in which it is involved operate at regional level, or across county, or unitary, boundaries. The Agency reports on a range of outputs that are directly attributable to its investment in support of projects and activities across the region, one of which is jobs created or safeguarded. The figures for jobs created/safeguarded for the last five years are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.2007W.5/1">Since its introduction in April 2003, Statutory Adoption Pay has been paid at the same standard rate and for the same length of time as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) and Maternity Allowance (MA). We intend to continue the existing approach as we increase both the standard rate and the payment period. The higher rate of SMP available to women for the first six weeks after the birth recognises the period of compulsory maternity leave, which is for health and safety reasons. The Work and Families Bill will enable us to meet our commitment to extend the payment period of SMP, MA and SAP from the current 26 weeks to 39 weeks from April 2007, with an ambition to extend to one year by the end of this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.2012W.2/1">The Cabinet Office is currently working with the Carbon Trust to improve its energy management practices and identify likely areas for potential energy savings. As part of this, in August 2005 the Carbon Trust undertook an initial energy audit across a number of key buildings operated by the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Office will shortly be signing up to the Carbon Trust's Carbon Management Programme (CTCMP) where a further and more in-depth energy audit will be undertaken. Both audits will assist the Cabinet Office in establishing a credible energy efficiency strategy.</p>

By 2008, we will have invested over &pound;1 billion in services and support for carers. We have also supported legislation that gives carers rights to an assessment of their own needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/2">In addition, in our recent White Paper, we have proposed a new deal for carers to improve support for them through a range of measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/3">We will update and extend the Prime Minister's 1999 strategy for carers and encourage councils and primary care trusts to nominate leads for carers' services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/4">We will establish a helpline to offer advice to carers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/5">In each council's area, we will ensure that a short-term, home-based respite support to carers in crisis or emergency situations is established.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/6">We will allocate specific funding for the creation of an expert carers programme which will provide training for carers to develop the skills they need to take greater control over their own health and the health of those in their care.</p>

	<p pid="c.2030W.5/2">The NHS now has an operating standard of six months for in-patient treatment. The Department routinely monitors performance against this standard and the relevant data is available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.performance.doh.gov.uk/waitingtimes/index.htm">www.performance.doh.gov.uk/waitingtimes/index.htm</a>.</p>

Data published earlier this month for end January 2006 showed that this figure had fallen to just 74. However, any breaches of the waiting time standards are unacceptable and the Department will continue to work closely to support the small number of NHS organisations where patients are waiting over six months.</p>

Colleges will continue to deliver, and build upon, the services they provide to learners and businesses in their local areas, as well as contributing to a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the provision of skills across Northern Ireland. Every effort is being made to ensure that new governance arrangements will be representative of each of the amalgamated institutions, so that the strengths and facilities of all colleges and campuses in their areas are used to maximum effect both locally and further afield.</p>

	<p pid="c.2036W.0/1">The Western Education and Library Board (WELB) is taking a number of steps to encourage eligible pupils to take up their entitlement to free school meals. These include: promotional activities (such as drawing attention to availability in schools' Admission Arrangements booklets, and reminding school Principals of the need to encourage uptake); partnership activities (such as working closely with the Social Security Agency (SSA) Western District to raise the profile of free school meals, and influencing strategies to facilitate the identification and targeting of existing claimants who have failed to take up their entitlement); and making it easier to take up entitlement by reducing the bureaucracy associated with making an application (including allowing rural low-income families to apply for free school meals directly to the Board. The Board, rather than the family, then verifies benefit entitlement with the relevant Social Security Office.)</p>

	<p pid="c.2036W.3/1">An estimate of the number of heroin addicts in Northern Ireland is not available. However, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) maintains several databases that record the number of registered addicts and the uptake of treatment for problem drug use across Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.2036W.3/2">The Northern Ireland Addicts Index Database holds information on all those persons registered in concurrence with the Misuse of Drugs (Notification of and Supply to Addicts) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 1973. The 2005 Statistical Bulletin reported that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>, a total of 168 persons were recorded as addicted to heroin. DHSSPS also maintains the Northern Ireland Substitute Prescribing Database, which holds information on persons receiving substitute prescribing treatment for opiate dependence. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase>, a total of 249 people were recorded as in contact with substitute prescribing services where the main problem drug was heroin. DHSSPS also maintains the Northern Ireland Drug Misuse Database, which holds information relating to problem drug users presenting to treatment services. In 2004&ndash;05 a total of 237 persons reported where their main problem drug was heroin.</p>
	<p pid="c.2036W.3/3">It is important to note that problem drug use and dependence does not constitute addiction and that although there will be an overlap between the three databases, there will be a proportion of heroin addicts that may never be in contact with treatment services. In recognition of this issue, DHSSPS has already commissioned a research study (to include information from the Criminal Justice System) to produce a reliable estimate of problem heroin use in Northern Ireland. It is anticipated that that report will be published, via the DHSSPS website, in April of this year. A similar study conducted in 2000&ndash;01 indicated that there were approximately 800 problem heroin users in Northern Ireland during that period.</p>
