These companies either made losses or had no taxable profits after deductions.</p>
	<p pid="a.497W.8/2">These deductions include losses brought forward from earlier years and carried back from later years and group relief surrendered by companies within the same group.</p>
	<p pid="a.497W.8/3">Group and loss relief policies remain broadly unchanged since the inception of the CT regime in 1965. Group and loss relief are important elements of the CT regime which ensure that companies with similar profits over their life cycle but different patterns of profits and losses over the years, pay broadly the same amounts of tax overall and recognises the economic reality that grouped companies are part of a wider whole. This is balanced, however, with the need for a pragmatic approach to protect tax revenues.</p>

	<p pid="a.501W.5/2">Cases involving sums of this order are likely to involve big business. HMRC estimates the tax under consideration in any case involving big business before starting inquiries. That estimate is made without considering the likelihood of success in the case or examining the facts or how the law applies in specific circumstances. If an investigation is started, then the tax under consideration is kept under review and will usually change as the case progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.5/3">The tax ultimately considered to be at risk is usually the amount for which the case is settled. HMRC are not able to identify any cases settled by agreement for &#163;10 million or &#163;100 million below the amount of tax at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.509W.8/1">It is too early to say what potential savings may accrue in this area from the Strategic Defence and Security Review, but since the commitment to reduce spend on professional services relates to a range of services bought in from the private sector, for example on areas such as consultancy through to specialist technical support, it is unlikely to generate any direct redundancies in the defence workforce. It is not possible to assess any associated redundancies in the private sector. Savings will come both from reduced use of professional services, particularly consultancy, and from getting better rates for the work, including through working with the centralised procurement arrangements being established by the Efficiency and Reform Group to optimise economies of scale.</p>

	<p pid="a.526W.0/1">Pursuant to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-02">2 February 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-02-02.819"><i> Official Report</i>, column 819W</phrase>, and the Westminster Hall debate on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-15">15 February 2011</phrase>, tourism is a devolved matter and the operation of the quality schemes in each of the home countries is a matter for their respective Governments. As made clear in the Government's Tourism Policy published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-04">4 March</phrase>, we do not intend to abolish the rating schemes in England, but given the number of participants in the schemes in recent years, particularly in the guest accommodation sector, the Government believe a different approach needs to be considered in order to help drive up quality. We strongly believe that both the tourism industry and consumers should take more responsibility for quality assessment. This includes tracking changes in trends in quality, if the information is commercially useful to them or to their customers; if it isn't then there's no point in Government doing it instead.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/2">The wide and growing popularity of websites offering feedback from customers is clear from industry figures on their usage. Their content is not regulated any more closely than any other part of the web, and we have no plans to do so. Web users make their own judgments about the quality and accuracy of any information they find, and rapidly switch to alternative sites if they offer something better.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/3">The Government will continue to give encouragement to any rating schemes or customer websites which improve the quality of information which visitors can use.</p>

	<p pid="a.526W.3/3">The 1998 Belfast/Good Friday agreement contained the obligation to extend the Irish language channel TG4 to audiences in Northern Ireland. In February 2010, the UK and Irish Government signed a memorandum of understanding designed to ensure co-operation over digital switchover and the provision of Irish language services in Northern Ireland in a digital form. Since then considerable progress has been made in making arrangements with the Irish authorities for the broadcasting of TG4, an Irish language television service, in digital form in Northern Ireland to coincide with digital switchover in the latter part of 2012.</p>

In the applicant relationship to child categories &quot;father&quot; may be an adoptive parent or a natural parent, and &quot;other&quot; includes any relationship (e.g. mother, aunt or uncle) and &quot;unknown&quot; reflects cases where no relationship was specified or where the relationship was unclear because there was more than one relationship specified for the case.  4. The figures exclude applications made in Family Proceedings Courts (FPCs). This is because, during the period considered, not all FPCs were using FamilyMan and information on applicant relationships to children was not available for all FPCs. In 2009 FPCs represented about 26% of private law contact order applications.  5. The figures also exclude section 8 contact order applications made in public law (child protection) cases.  6. The overall totals for each year may differ slightly from previously published figures as FamilyMan is a live system and the data used to produce these figures was a more recent extract than that used to produce the earlier published figures. This means that the figures will take into account changes made to data held on FamilyMan since previously published statistics was extracted.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.545W.5/1">A Family Justice Review is currently under way looking at the workings of the family justice system with a view to implementing significant reform. The review panel, comprising experts from across the field of family justice, will make recommendations for reform in two core areas: the promotion of informed settlement and agreement; and management of the family justice system overall. Recommendations will focus on ensuring that the interests of the child are paramount in any decision affecting them, unnecessary delay is avoided and conflict between individuals is minimised as far as possible. An interim report is expected shortly and a final report is due in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.5/2">Pending the outcome of the review, in public law proceedings an interim &quot;system-wide approach&quot; has been adopted with the aim of reducing unnecessary delay. The approach comprises efforts focussed around local solutions and initiatives, and is being taken forward by a network of newly established &quot;local performance improvement groups&quot;. A National Performance Partnership has also been established to collate best practice and take a strategic approach to improving performance and reducing delay. Ministry of Justice and Department for Education officials are working closely with system agencies (Her Majesty's Courts Service, CAFCASS, Legal Services Commission and local authorities) as well as with the President of the Family Division to identify and share best practice to reduce delay and improve performance in public law proceedings. To support these efforts, Her Majesty's Court Service allocated an additional 4,000 county court sitting days over the course of 2010-11 to create extra capacity in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.5/3">In relation to private law disputes, the President of the Family Division issued a revised Practice Direction in April 2010 setting out the principles to be followed. A key feature is the requirement to list a first hearing within four weeks, and no later than six weeks, from the issue of proceedings. At the first hearing, the court will identify the issues and make decisions about the timetabling and next stages in the case. These decisions are informed by a short report from CAFCASS setting out the result of initial safeguarding checks with the local authority and police to ensure that any decisions made at the first hearing are safe for the child and parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.546W.2/1">The civil service guidelines do not apply to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons (HMCI Prisons), since the appointment is not within the civil service. However, it is the policy of the Ministry of Justice to include in HMCI Prisons' terms of appointment a provision that restricts the political activities of the office holder. That is to say, HMCI Prisons must not engage in national political activities such as adoption as a candidate, holding office in a party political organisation, or canvassing on behalf of a parliamentary candidate or political party. Permission may be sought to take part in local political activities or to engage in matters of local political controversy. Under schedule 1 of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, the serving Chief Inspector is not permitted to stand as a Member of Parliament; under the Scottish Parliament (Disqualification) Order 2010 the Chief Inspector is also prohibited from standing as a member of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.0/1">The current criteria for receipt of disability living allowance broadly rely on a disabled individual having prescribed levels of care or mobility needs. Entitlement to the three rates of the care component is established by an individual having care needs at a prescribed level. For example, someone with who has care needs on a frequent or prolonged basis both day and night may be entitled to the highest rate care component. Entitlement to the mobility component does not work on a similar basis: the lower rate is available to people who require guidance or supervision when out of doors in unfamiliar places; and entitlement to the higher rate is, with some exceptions, available to people who, by virtue of a physical disability, are unable or virtually unable to walk. These entitlement criteria have remained unchanged over the last five years. Further details on the entitlement criteria are available on the Directgov website</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/DisabilityLivingAllowance/index.htm">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/DisabilityLivingAllowance/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.570W.0/3">From April entitlement to the higher rate mobility component will extended to people who have been certified as blind or severely visually impaired by an ophthalmologist and have a prescribed degree of visual impairment.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.0/4">Awards of disability living allowance can currently be decided on the basis of self-reporting of need, and although medical evidence is sought for certain awards, it is not mandatory. The current system lacks consistency in the way it supports disabled people with similar needs; and decision making on awarding the benefit can be subjective. That is why from 2013 we will replace disability living allowance for people of working age with personal independence payment, a new, more transparent benefit with an objective assessment of individual need. Support through personal independence payment will be focussed on those who have the most barriers to overcome to live independently. The detailed criteria that will be used in the new assessment to determine eligibility are currently being developed and are being informed by the consultation which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-18">18 February</phrase>. The Government are considering the feedback from this consultation exercise and will publish their response shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.3/1">We are considering the most appropriate delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken on the detail of its operation, including how it will apply to existing DLA recipients. We believe that advice from a suitably trained and approved individual, for example a health care professional, will be an important part of ensuring that the assessment is more objective and consistent. In most cases, we expect this to involve a face-to-face consultation to enable an in-depth look at an individual's circumstances. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We agree with many of the points raised in the National Autistic Society's recent report on DLA reform, 'Who benefits?', and we are looking closely at how these recommendations can be incorporated into its design. To ensure that we get this reform right, we are keen to continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.2/1">Personal independence payment will replace disability living allowance for working-age (16-64) adults from 2013 and the new objective assessment is being designed to gather information about adult needs. We want to build on the experience of developing an assessment and applying it to new and existing claimants of working-age to inform our decisions about the arrangements for children. Therefore we will not consider extending personal independence payment to new claims from children or to children already receiving DLA, until we have had an opportunity to consider the effectiveness of the new arrangements for working age people.</p>

The Department for Education plan to test the approach starting this year and we will look at the findings of the pathfinders to explore whether the single assessment process might also be used to support claims for the disability living allowance and personal independence payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.572W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking about the steps taken to ensure that those with variable mental health conditions are not penalised for missing a Work-Focussed Interview (WFI).</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/4" class="indent">This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/5" class="indent">We have in place a range of safeguards to ensure that vulnerable customers (including those with a mental health condition) are fully aware of the requirement to participate in a WFI. In particular, safeguard procedures for customers claiming Employment and Support Allowance include:</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/6" class="indent">advising the customer at the point of claim about the requirement to undergo, and the purpose of, the work-focussed interview;</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/7" class="indent">notifying the customer (in writing) of the date, time and place of the work-focused interview and asking them to get in touch if they cannot make it;</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/8" class="indent">contacting the customer (by telephone) before each work-focused interview to remind them that it is due;</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/9" class="indent">considering the context of each work-focused interview whether the interview should be waived or deferred;</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/10" class="indent">offering them a more convenient location or a home visit where appropriate, and encouraging advocacy support if needed;</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/11" class="indent">identifying any relevant issues from medical evidence where available, that might impact on attendance;</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/12" class="indent">visiting those customers with whom there has been no verbal contact prior to the work-focused interview; and</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/13" class="indent">visiting every customer, with a representative if appropriate, where it is known that the customer has a stated mental health condition or learning disability before a sanction is imposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/14" class="indent">By following the steps above, we ensure that we will contact the customer by telephone two days before the interview is scheduled to take place, to make sure that the appointment is appropriate. If it becomes clear from the customer or their advocate, at this point or during the WFI itself, that the agreed timing of the WFI is inappropriate for the customer's particular circumstances at that time, the WFI may be postponed to a later date. If it is clear that the presence of a carer is important, we would seek to arrange the WFI around the carer's availability.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/15" class="indent">For lone parents claiming income support, where there is evidence to believe that the customer falls into a vulnerable group, a home visit is always considered before a formal decision is made that they have failed to attend the work-focused interview.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/16" class="indent">Before sanctions are considered (for any benefit) the customer will be invited to show good cause, and there is a right of appeal against the decision to apply a sanction. Factors considered by the Decision Maker in establishing whether the customer had good cause include whether the person may have misunderstood the requirement to take part in an interview because of their varying mental health condition, and whether the person was suffering from a disability that made it impracticable for them to attend.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/17" class="indent">If a customer has failed to attend an appointment, or has committed another act or omission that warrants a sanction, then the Jobcentre Plus Decision Maker will consider all the available evidence before applying a sanction. This can of course include, but is not limited to, whether the failure was caused by a fluctuation in their health condition.</p>

Support through personal independence payment will be focused on those with the most need. The detailed design of the new assessment is currently being undertaken with the support of a group of independent specialists in health, social care and disability, including disabled people. This design will also be, informed by feedback from the public consultation which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-18">18 February 2011</phrase>. I am, therefore, unable at this time to comment on the details of how the new assessment will impact on people with specific health conditions or impairments. We are committed to ensuring that it reflects the needs of all individuals effectively. We recognise that the current assessment criteria for disability living allowance can favour physical impairments and our proposals are that personal independence payment needs to improve the support provided to disabled people with mental, intellectual, cognitive and development impairments, including autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

	<p pid="a.576W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions has several programmes aimed at achieving the Big Society goals of catalysing social action, decentralising power and opening up public services. In October 2010 the Department introduced two new initiatives, Work Clubs and Work Together, which form part of a new range of back-to-work support being made available to jobseekers to get Britain working. Work Clubs are designed to be locally led and delivered, moving away from centrally-determined support, while Work Together seeks to promote the benefits of volunteering and raise customer awareness of local opportunities. Both initiatives fit with the Government's Big Society concept in that they encourage people to play an active role within their communities and support unemployed people in the locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.5/2">With respect to benefits, the Government are introducing universal credit from 2013 to replace six separate benefits. This will reduce bureaucracy and make the system easier to navigate, but also place a greater emphasis on personal responsibility for finding employment. In addition, a number of Right to Control trailblazers across England are testing how disabled people can be given more choice and control over the funding they are eligible for, including funding to help them move into work. These trailblazers will help develop ways to create a more personalised service, pushing decision-making down to the lowest level. To replace Social Fund community care grants and crisis loans for general living expenses, locally-delivered systems of support will be provided. This will be delivered by local authorities in England and the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales. The new assistance will provide more relevant and better targeted support which can be aligned with existing provision at a local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.5/3">As part of its Big Society ambition for older people, the Department is working in partnership with the Community Development Foundation to provide &#163;1 million to fund 'Active at 60', a project that will help older people who are most at risk of loneliness and social isolation. Each local community organisation within the selected areas will recruit at least one Active at 60 Community Agent who will volunteer their time to help motivate, encourage and organise people within their own communities to become more active, physically, socially and mentally.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.5/4">The Department is also working to develop older people's democratic involvement in their communities. These local networks will be linked through the English Forums on Ageing to the UK Advisory Forum on Ageing. The English Forums on Ageing also provide a channel of influence for older people on local delivery decisions and the aim is to build on these relationships to enable older people to take up the opportunities introduced in the Localism Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.5/5">More generally, the Government's local agenda is leading Jobcentre Plus to look for ways to better utilise the expertise of front-line staff, who will be given more freedom to tailor and coordinate services in ways that best meet the needs of their community. The Department is committed to ensure that staff have the flexibility to work in real partnerships at the local level; and to respond to local and customers' needs, including looking at the scope for closer working with partners in the co-ordination, location and design of services. This approach to worklessness balances a national benefit system with a range of other support delivered through different channels-the Government's own delivery organisations, private providers, other public sector organisations and the voluntary and community sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.580W.2/1">DECC already ensures that estimates of power generation costs commissioned by the department estimate carbon costs and generation costs separately. The following information is an example of cost information from the last such study, by Mott MacDonald. DECC is currently undertaking an update of these cost estimates which will include the same level of detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.2/2">The following table is taken from Mott MacDonald (2010) and gives levelised cost estimates (average generation cost per megawatt-hour) for new build plants in the main large-scale electricity generation technologies in the UK, including both fossil fuel and low carbon plant, at current engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract prices. This demonstrates how the cost estimates are separated into component parts. The report and data sets DECC hold break this down further still.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.2/3">It should be noted that for the purposes of presentation, the table only gives either 'FOAK' (first-of-a-kind) prices or 'NOAK' (nth-of-a-kind) prices for each technology. The full report can be accessed via this link:</p>

	<p pid="a.581W.2/1">I have not met the Icelandic Minister but my officials have had discussions with Icelandic power companies about the possibility of building an electricity interconnector between Iceland and Great Britain. At the Prime Minister's UK-Nordic-Baltic summit in January this year, which was attended by the Icelandic Prime Minister, it was agreed that the countries concerned should cooperate in areas of mutual interest, including ways of accelerating the low-carbon transition. This is an example of a project which could be of benefit to both the UK and Iceland. However, there are a number of regulatory, technical, legal and commercial issues which would need to be explored before any decision can be made by any potential developers on the viability of such a project. We will be taking forward any legal and regulatory issues which fall to Government with the appropriate Icelandic parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.586W.5/1">The UK is working to eliminate discards through targeting the principal reasons for discarding. We continue to take action domestically-working with our fishing industry to increase the selectivity of fishing gears and improve the utilisation of unavoidable catches. We are also trialling a system of catch quotas to reduce discards and better control fishing mortality.</p>

	<p pid="a.590W.6/1">The Government are taking forward a range of action to encourage participation in local democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-07">7 December</phrase> we launched a call for talented community champions to consider standing as local councillors in the upcoming local elections. We highlighted by a press notice on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-13">13 February</phrase> that there were just 50 days left for people to sign up as candidates in the elections. And throughout the year Government have supported the Local Government Leadership's website, where details about becoming a councillor can be found:</p>

	<p pid="a.590W.6/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-23">23 February</phrase> we wrote to principal local authorities to emphasise the importance of their giving citizens the opportunity to access and experience their local democracy using modern communication methods; so they can blog, tweet and film during proceedings and disseminate their recordings or comments via social media networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.6/6">Our Localism Bill, which completed its Committee stage on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March</phrase>, includes provisions that will give residents the power to instigate local referendums on any local issue, and to approve or veto in a referendum excessive council tax increases, and establishes a Neighbourhood Planning regime giving the whole neighbourhood a say, through a referendum, on whether proposals are acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.6/7">We have recently approved a further year's funding for the Participatory Budgeting Unit, a third sector organisation, to provide advice and guidance on Participatory Budgeting, which gives people a direct say over how part of a local budget is spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.6/8">We have continued to support Take Part, an active citizenship and leadership learning programme aimed at increasing the skills', knowledge and confidence of individuals to have more of a say in their local area.

	<p pid="a.591W.2/1">The Department's goal is to put individuals and groups in the driving seat in their communities, with government playing an enabling role in building a big society.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/2">A key plank of this strategy will be delivered through the Localism Bill, which will introduce new Community Rights. The Community Right to Buy will give community organisations a better chance to bid to take over assets and facilities that are important to them to save them for community use.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/3">The Community Right to Challenge will hand the initiative to voluntary and community bodies with good ideas about how services could be run better or more cost effectively, ensure these ideas get a. fair hearing, and give them the time they need to organise themselves and develop their ideas to be able to bid to run the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/4">Local authorities will be required to maintain a list of public and private assets of community value. When the owner of a listed asset wants to sell it a window of opportunity will come into effect to give communities more time to develop a bid and raise the necessary capital. They will then be in a better position to bid to buy the asset when it comes on the market at the end of the window of opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/5">The new provision will help local communities to save important community assets, tackle social need and build up resources and employment in their neighbourhood in more innovative, enterprising and cost-effective ways. In particular, it will give communities the chance to save facilities threatened with closure that are important to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/6">The Department has also extended funding for the Asset Transfer Unit enabling it to continue to offer practical support to communities who want to take on community assets such as youth centres, libraries, museums and former town halls for the benefit of local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/7">We will provide support to help community organisations take advantage of their new rights. We are currently consulting on the detail of both rights-including the support which would be most helpful. These consultation documents can be viewed on the DCLG website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.592W.2/1">Integration and positive relations between different populations are integral parts of the big society. As the Prime Minister set out in his recent speech in Munich, integration is fostered by meaningful and active participation in society, which is achieved by shifting the balance of power away from the state and towards the people, and by initiatives such as the National Citizen Service. DCLG also recently awarded the Church Urban Fund &#163;5 million to promote interaction in local communities between people of different faiths, through a new programme called Near Neighbours. DCLG are considering what additional, specific activities are needed to improve integration and overcome divisions in communities. We are working to develop a cross-government approach by May 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.592W.5/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government's Estate Strategy focuses on reducing the size and cost of its estate through the surrender of facilities at appropriate lease break/end opportunities, through the consolidation and collocation of business operations and by maximising space efficiency by further implementing flexible working practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.5/2">An example of our Strategy in action is where we are working to reduce the cost and size of the Government Offices for the Regions estate, in advance of their abolition on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. This work will reduce the size of that estate from 14 buildings currently to 10 buildings by the end of 2011-12 and down to seven by the end of the spending review period. The retained buildings will be used by a range of Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.5/3">The Government announced in spending review 2010 that as a first step to introducing a more co-ordinated approach to property management in the central civil office estate it would set up, through the Government Property Unit, Property Vehicles for the Central London and Bristol office estates from 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.5/4">Property Vehicles will be responsible for managing a more co-ordinated Government-wide approach to property. They will manage the estate strategically, achieving more efficient use of the property assets, as well as work with Departments to reduce their estates and maximise the commercial potential of their property portfolios.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.5/5">Furthermore the Government announced this month a new system of National Property Controls across the central civil estate. These controls require Departments to adopt a common, disciplined commercial approach to the use of the estate. These build on the success of the Lease Moratorium introduced in May 2010, which to-date has reduced property costs by around &#163;50 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.5/6">The Department is co-operating fully with both these Government Property Unit led initiatives in order to drive down the size of the Department's estate.</p>

The Department issues no separate requirement regarding the number of pupils required for academy status and each application is considered separately. Collaboration with other schools is encouraged for all types of academy, either as part of a formal partnership or joining an existing academy trust with a proven track record of school improvement. This may be particularly attractive to small schools wishing to share resources. In general, head teachers and school governors will be best placed to know what will work for their school.</p>

	<p pid="a.598W.6/1">The Early Intervention Grant is an un-ring-fenced and un-hypothecated grant. Local authorities are therefore free to decide, taking into account the views of their communities, how best to use it, including developing their own payment by results systems at a local level. The Department has as yet not published proposals for results-based payments and will work with a small number of local authorities to trial new approaches.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.6/2">The Secretary of State for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40593" name="Michael Gove">the right hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, announced indicative allocations for the Early Intervention Grant on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-13">13 December 2010</phrase> for 2011-12 and 2012-13. Final allocations for 2011-12 will be announced before the beginning of the new financial year. Similarly, it is expected that final allocations for 2012-13 will be announced in March 2012. Indicative allocations for 2013-14 have not been announced and no date has been set although they are likely to be published as part of the local government settlement in December 2012, with final allocations being announced in the following March.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.6/3">The Early Intervention Grant (EIG) did not exist-in 2010-11. However, funding within the grant in 2011-12 has been allocated in a transparent way with a focus on disadvantage, prevention and a premium on early years. Most of the EIG has been allocated using the Department's existing early years formula, with the remainder allocated according to a youth services formula. A notional 2010-11 baseline for each authority based on an aggregation of 2010-11 predecessor grants was created and a floor was applied to the 2011-12 allocations so that no authority loses more than 12.9% compared to their 2010-11 baseline. Half of the authorities sit on this 12.9% floor and so it is not possible to name 20 local authorities who have had the greatest reduction in the level of their EIG allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.6/4">The new Early Intervention Grant will provide a substantial funding stream to enable local authorities to act more strategically and target investment early, where it will have greatest impact. The grant provides local authorities with funding to support early intervention and preventative programmes. Funding for the grant has been provided as part of the DFE spending review settlement. Further additional funding of &#163;10 million from the Home Office to go into the Early Intervention Grant was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-02">2 February 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.605W.0/1">It is important for primary and secondary schools to work closely together, particularly at the transition point between primary and secondary, to ensure children who are struggling are getting the help they need. But getting the fundamentals of literacy and numeracy right early on is crucial to a child's success in secondary education and throughout their adult life.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.0/2">We are committed to raising standards in literacy, and ensuring that no child gets left behind at school. As set out in our White Paper, one of the ways we aim to achieve this goal is by strengthening the use of systematic synthetic phonics in the teaching of reading. We are introducing a new phonics screening check for children in Year 1, which will help to ensure that six-year-old children have grasped the essential phonics that underpin good reading as well as identify the children who need extra help so they are given support by their school to improve their reading skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.612W.2/1">The spending review confirmed that all three and four-year-olds will continue to receive 15 hours of free early education per week, delivered more flexibly. Funding for free early education places for 3 and 4-year-olds is provided through the dedicated schools grant (DSG), which supports the majority of education provision for children aged 3-16. Local authorities, in consultation with their Schools Forum, decide how best to distribute 3-16 funding across their locality. As such, funding allocations for local authorities are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.2/2">Local authorities report on financial expenditure through returns required under section 251 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. From April 2010, about half of LAs were pathfinders for the Early Years Single Funding Formula (EYSFF), a new method for LAs to fund providers of free early education. From April 2011, every LA will be operating the EYSFF. Bolton LA were an EYSFF pathfinder. Where a local authority was a pathfinder for the early years single funding formula in 2010-11, the detail of their formula can be found in their section 251 statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.2/3">Because of the way section 251 operated previously, it is not possible to obtain complete data on free early education spend for non-pathfinders. From section 251 data, Bolton budgeted to spend &#163;8.2 million in 2010-11, and this was allocated through a formula to early years settings. Budget statements for 2011-12 have not yet been completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.613W.5/1">The Teenage Pregnancy Independent Advisory Group (TPIAG) was set up in 2000, to monitor the previous Administration's 10 year Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. It is an advisory non-departmental public body (NDPB) whose work was scheduled to come to an end in 2010 and the group has had no responsibility for implementation of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. There was, therefore, no need to undertake an impact assessment on its abolition. TPIAG published its final report on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.5/2">While TPIAG was not responsible for the delivery of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, it did produce regular reports, with recommendations on how the Strategy could be improved. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Group for their reports and recommendations on both preventing teenage pregnancies and improving support for teenage parents and their children. The Group's expert input has made an important contribution to the understanding of the measures needed to reduce teenage pregnancies, which have fallen by 18.1% between 1998 and 2009 (the latest year for which data are available), to the point where in 2009, the under-18 conception rate was at its lowest level for nearly 30 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.5/1">Analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) shows that young women from less well off backgrounds are more likely to have been pregnant and, in particular, more likely to have become mothers, by the age of 18 than those from more affluent backgrounds. The survey found that while 13% of females interviewed were eligible for free school meals in Year 11, this group made up 22% of those who became pregnant by age 18, and 32% of those whose first pregnancy resulted in them having the baby. Females with parents from higher or lower, professional occupational backgrounds made up 45% of the survey population at age 18, but only 28% of those who became pregnant by the age of 18 and an even smaller proportion, 12%, of those who went on to have a baby.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.5/2">Rates of both teenage pregnancy and teenage motherhood are higher in areas with higher levels of deprivation. Teenage pregnancy rates in the 10% most deprived wards are four times higher than in the 10% least deprived. This association is even stronger when it comes to teenage motherhood, where the rate of births to under-18s in the most deprived 10% of wards is nine times higher than in the 10% least deprived. High rates of teenage pregnancy are mainly concentrated in deprived urban areas. However, teenage pregnancy 'hotspots' (wards with rates over 60 under-18 conceptions per 1,000 females aged 15-17) are found in virtually every local authority in England, including in some rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.615W.5/1">The national Drug Strategy published in December 2010, set out Government's ambition for preventing drug and alcohol misuse among young people. In it, we committed to ensure that school staff have the information, advice and the power to provide accurate information on drugs and alcohol through drug education and targeted information via the FRANK service; to tackle problem behaviour in schools, with wider powers of search and confiscation; and to work with local voluntary organisations, the police and others to prevent drug or alcohol misuse. We will make sure that other professionals working with young people also have access to the information they need to raise awareness of these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.5/2">Furthermore, through the Early Intervention Grant we are giving local authorities in England more freedoms and flexibilities to maintain and focus on essential frontline services and to invest in early intervention and prevention to protect the most vulnerable, including those young people at risk of substance misuse.</p>

	<p pid="a.618W.6/1">The Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework is intended to provide an overarching picture of social care at the national level, reflecting the common outcomes which matter to people receiving services and their carers. Outcome measures are not intended to focus on any one disability exclusively, but reflect more holistic outcomes as far as possible to give a broader overview, with more detailed information available for further analysis. Outcomes for people with autism should be included in the framework to the extent that these high-level measures are relevant for autism.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.6/2">The 2011-12 Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework is based upon existing national data collections, since changes to data requirements cannot be made in the short-term.

The &#163;70 million growth money for 2010-11 was shared between SHAs on a weighted capitation basis and allocated by them to PCTs in their region, in the light of local circumstances and decisions to start new services. Some PCTs have chosen to add funding to their allocations in order to enhance their local services and others have struggled to find the full amount in their baselines but the detail of this is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.2/4">Across the country in the quarter between October and December 2010 91,527 people entered IAPT treatment, 64,230 completed it, 22,369 moved to recovery with many more showing significant improvement in their symptoms and remaining in treatment across the end of this period. A total of 4,238 people treated came off sick pay or benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.630W.5/1">The Government announced in the spending review, that to ensure spending in the national health service is focused on priorities, some programmes announced by the previous Government but not yet implemented will not be taken forward. This includes extending free prescriptions to all those with long term conditions. We are continuing to explore options for reforming the current prescription charging arrangements, taking into account the financial context. In particular, we are examining the implications of the introduction of universal credit in relation to those current benefits that entitle the recipient of that benefit to free prescriptions. We are also looking at the implications of state pension age changes. We will make announcements about how these changes will be implemented in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.633W.2/1">In response to the global food, fuel and financial crises in 2009, the Department for International Development (DFID) has been providing support through the World Bank to help developing countries and the poorest in those countries that are vulnerable to shocks. Between 2009-10 and 2010-11 DFID has provided &#163;2 million to the World Bank's Rapid Social Response Multi-Donor Programme which supports strengthening of social protection systems in developing countries. DFID has also provided &#163;200 million over the same period to enable the setting up of a 'Crisis Response Window' (CRW) that is supporting low income countries affected by the crises.

We are also working to improve cash transfer delivery systems to make them more responsive to food price rises. For example in Ethiopia, people can receive their transfer as food rather than cash if they cannot afford local food prices. In some countries such as Mozambique we are supporting the development of public works programmes that can be scaled up when food prices rise sharply. In response to global crises-including food price spikes-DFID has contributed &#163;2 million to the World Bank's Rapid Social Response Multi-Donor Programme, which provides technical assistance to help strengthen social protection systems.

	<p pid="a.634W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is currently finalising a comprehensive Evidence Paper on Cash Transfers that has drawn on expertise inside and outside of DFID. The paper concludes that cash transfers can be a highly effective way to reach the poorest and help them lift themselves out of extreme poverty, The paper will be published in the next two weeks on DFID's Research4Development website. Findings from the paper have already fed into the discussions that Ministers have had as part of the recent Bilateral Aid Review. Coming out of that review, DFID has committed to helping more than six million of the world's poorest to escape extreme poverty-through cash transfers.</p>

	<p pid="a.636W.5/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions asking:</p>

	<p pid="a.636W.5/7" class="indent">The UK Statistics Authority proposed looking at alternatives to the traditional census and this work is being taken forward by the National Statistician through the Beyond 2011 programme. Proposals will be made in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.5/8" class="indent">The Beyond 2011 programme is currently at the early initiation stages, launching in April 2011, and it will look at the full range of options for providing census-type information.

	<p pid="a.636W.5/9" class="indent">Users will be widely consulted as part of a Beyond 2011 consultation which will take place later in 2011. There are likely to be open web based consultations, road shows and a system of advisory committees and user groups as happened during the review to determine the need for the 2011 Census. These events will provide ample opportunity to contribute to all aspects of the Beyond 2011 debate, including for central and local government, Parliament and the wider public.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.5/10" class="indent">There will be many considerations in coming to a decision in 2014 about our future approach, most notably meeting our legal obligations, accuracy and costs. It is too early to provide answers at this point on these issues but they are central to the work that is being undertaken. Data security, ethics and other risks will also be carefully considered in the assessment of future options, as they are for the traditional census.</p>

	<p pid="a.637W.8/1">There are no plans to have such discussions with the Charity Commission. Charity trustees are under a duty to act in their charity's best interests, but are free to make decisions relating to their charity if made properly and within the law. This is the cornerstone of charities' independence. The Charity Commission's role is to ensure transparency so that the public, in its various capacities as taxpayer, donor and beneficiary, can hold trustees to account on such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.637W.8/2">The Charity Commission can intervene only in cases where there is a serious risk of significant harm to or abuse of a charity, its assets, beneficiaries or reputation, and where it considers intervention is necessary and proportionate. Otherwise the Charity Commission is precluded by statute from intervening in the administration of a charity, including decisions about redundancy payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.2/1">There are no plans to have such discussions with the Charity Commission. The Charity Commission has an important and well-known role in promoting public trust and confidence in charities as the independent registrar and regulator of charities in England and Wales. As a non-ministerial department it is independent of Government and its independence from ministerial direction or control is set out in statute, and is an essential feature as it needs to be politically impartial in its decision making. The recent review of public bodies also reached this conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.638W.2/2">The Charity Commission adheres to the Civil Service Code, including the requirement for impartiality-acting solely according to the merits of the case and with political impartiality.</p>

	<p pid="a.653W.0/2">As the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (Mr Hague), has made clear, the Government are committed to promoting human rights around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/3">Our high commissions and embassies have a responsibility to monitor and raise human rights in their host countries. They routinely raise our concerns with other governments and where possible, take action on individual cases where persecution or discrimination has occurred and lobby for changes in discriminatory practices and laws. The Government are in close cooperation with our EU and international partners to improve human rights across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/4">In June 2010, we raised our concerns with the Libyan Government about reports of human rights abuses at migrant detention centres and the temporary closure of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees office in Tripoli. We also raised on numerous occasions during last year a number of individual cases, including that of a British national who was held in incommunicado detention in Libya for five months until August 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-21">21 February 2011</phrase>, the Permanent Under-Secretary, Simon Fraser, summoned the Libyan ambassador to underline the Government's grave concerns about the recent violence in Libya and Britain's clear condemnation of the unacceptable use of force against protestors in Libya. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-16">16 March 2011</phrase>, the Permanent Under-Secretary called the ambassador to the Foreign Office to emphasise the UK's profound concern about the Libyan regime's ongoing attacks on civilians stating that perpetrators of such violence will be held to account. He also expressed concern about the continued harassment and detention of journalists in Libya.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/6">We have also raised our concerns about human rights in Libya in international fora. In November 2010, we made a statement at Libya's Universal Periodic Review in which we raised a number of concerns, including freedom of expression, arbitrary detention and the incidence of torture. In response to serious human rights violations in Libya in February 2011, the UK drove through a UN Security Council resolution, which was passed with unanimous support and, as well as imposing sanctions, referred Libya to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. We also led on Human Rights Council resolution 15/2 that mandated a Commission of Inquiry to investigate alleged violations of international human rights law in Libya and played a key role in Libya's suspension from the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/7">In Egypt, we have raised human rights issues on a number of occasions, including during the UK-Egypt Strategic Dialogue in January 2011, with the Egyptian Assistant Minister for Human Rights in June and September 2010, during the electoral period in November and December 2010, and throughout the recent revolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/8">Discussions on human rights form part of the Annual Strategic Dialogue between the UK and Algeria as well as a core component of the EU Association Agreement and discussions within the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/9">The issue of human rights formed a core component of both the EU Association Agreement and Advanced Status negotiations with the previous Tunisian Government. The issue has been an integral part of discussions with the present Government, both here in London and in Tunisia, as they implement a series of reforms in their move towards an open democratic society.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/10">Discussions on human rights form a core component of the EU Association Agreement with Morocco. Senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials have also raised human rights issues regularly with our Moroccan counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/11">In Bahrain our ambassador has raised repeatedly with the Government of Bahrain since June 2010 the need to investigate transparently allegations of abuse of detainees; the need to respect freedom of expression; and the dismissal of the Board of the Bahrain Human Rights Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/12">Embassy officials in Riyadh met the President of the Saudi Human Rights Commission in June 2010 and January 2011 to discuss human rights. The UK supported EU officials in November 2010 in raising the case of a Sri Lankan national sentenced to death. Our embassy raises human rights as part of their regular meetings with the Saudi Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.0/13">Our ambassador in Sana'a and senior visiting officials raised concerns about media restrictions with the Yemeni Government in February this year. In September and December 2010 the UK participated in EU demarches concerning freedom of expression and the death penalty. Human rights form part of the agreed deliverables for the Friends of Yemen group in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-27">27 September 2010</phrase>. With reports of human rights violations during recent protests we have voiced our concerns directly to senior Yemeni ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.655W.6/1">We have repeatedly urged Iran to work with the international community to build a stable and secure future for the region. Unfortunately Iran's current behaviour, including support for militant groups throughout the region, is at odds with its claim to support stability. We are deeply concerned by the latest evidence that Iran continues to supply the Taliban with weaponry.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.6/2">We remain gravely concerned by Iran's nuclear programme, which is a serious source of instability in the Middle East. We remain committed to a diplomatic solution but Iran must show it is serious about addressing international concerns or face increasing international isolation and pressure.</p>

	<p pid="a.655W.9/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office administration costs for 2009-10 and 2010-11 is found in the following table. 2010-11 figures contain actual and forecast expenditure. 2011-12 details cannot be provided as we are still finalising budgets. Programme expenditure by country, some of which is paid directly from the UK but spent by project implementers in the countries where we run projects, is not held centrally and therefore could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.660W.0/1">The recent meeting of Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council considered two items of particular relevance. It took note of the annual report on progress towards equality between women and men 2010. This report acknowledges areas where progress has been made, both at national and European level. This report was for information only and no action is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.0/2">The Council also adopted Council Conclusions on the European Pact for Gender Equality (2011-2020). This Pact reaffirmed the Council's intention to make progress on gender equality, particularly with regard to closing the gender gaps in employment and social protection; promoting better work-life balance for women and men; and combating all forms of violence against women. The Government are already taking comprehensive action in these areas, such as voluntary pay reporting and our Violence Against Women Action Plan. We are therefore not required to take additional action to implement the Gender Pact, and the additional implementation costs arising from the pact are nil.</p>

	<p pid="a.662W.0/1">The Equality Impact Assessment published alongside &quot;Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; (November 2010) found that, at the aggregate level, there are unlikely to be disproportionate impacts on protected groups. A separate assessment of how the changes may affect English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) learners is currently being carried out by this Department, and I expect to be able to publish the assessment in due course. At the local level, colleges and training organisations are best placed to work with their communities to identify particularly vulnerable learners as a part of their business planning and local engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.0/2">In the 2009/10 academic year, 1,310 adult learners in Brighton and Hove local education authority participated in Government-funded ESOL courses; 700 were in receipt of full Government funding from the Adult Learner Responsive funding stream. From August, full Government funding will be provided for unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or in the Employment and Support Allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group, and this will include ESOL courses where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.0/3">Eligibility for full or part public funded ESOL provision is set out in the Skills Funding Agency's learner eligibility criteria, which is based on a person's ordinary residence. For funding purposes, the agency regards an ordinarily resident any person who habitually, normally and lawfully resides from choice and for a settled purpose in England. Full learner eligibility guidance can be found on the Skills Funding Agency and YPLA website:</p>

	<p pid="a.662W.0/5">As autonomous bodies, further education (FE) colleges and training providers are responsible for their fees policies. We have introduced increased freedoms and flexibilities for FE colleges and providers providing them with increased flexibility to respond to the needs of their communities.</p>
