But we must use caution when looking at problem gambling rates for individual activities; problem gamblers tend to gamble using many activities and the Prevalence Survey does not provide evidence or proof about which activities cause or exacerbate problem gambling. We will be watching closely the outcome of the current machines research which will address these questions, among other things.</p>

The Prevalence Study is not the only research that examines this area and I am pleased that the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board's research programme continues to focus on projects that will, over time, help target regulatory controls, education and treatment based on a robust evidence base. We need to know much more about problem gambling if we are to target future regulation, enforcement and prevention effectively.

Member for South West Surrey (Mr Hunt)</phrase>, has considered the application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) to Tote staff. Whether TUPE. applies depends on the legal employer of the employee in question. For these purposes, Tote Group employees fall into two groups: (i) employees of the Horserace Totalisator Board; and (ii) employees of the Horserace Totalisator Board's subsidiaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.5/2">For employees employed by the Horserace Totalisator Board, TUPE will apply, together with the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004, to transfer them to the successor company.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.5/3">For employees employed by subsidiaries of the Horserace Totalisator Board, such as Tote Credit Ltd and Tote Bookmakers Ltd, TUPE will not be needed. The reason for this is that their legal employer won't change at all&#8212;it will move from the Horserace Totalisator Board to the successor company along with the staff&#8212;so their existing employment contracts will be unaffected.</p>

A lot will depend on how the market develops and whether innovative or attractive services are developed for the technology. However experience of other technologies used for similar applications within unlicensed spectrum may provide an example. The nearest analogy to unlicensed white space devices would be Wi-Fi where there are over 4 million hot spots in the UK and many more customer devices that connect to them.</p>

This was agreed as part of the new European Semester. However, the Commission was advised that the document must be regarded as a draft until parliamentary scrutiny procedures are completed. This has been established practice in recent years where parliamentary debates on the Government's economic and budgetary assessment have not taken place at the time of submitting the Convergence Programme to the EU (a debate did not take place in the other place/House until <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="a.355W.9/4">The UK's Convergence Programme itself does not require Parliament's approval. Due to the provisions of section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 it must be based upon an assessment of the economic and budgetary position which has been reported to Parliament by the Government for its approval. This year that assessment comprised the 2011 Budget report and the OBR's &#8216;Economic and fiscal outlook&#8217;&#8212;as set out in the 2011 Budget report itself. These documents were deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase> for subsequent approval. The Budget report and associated documents are routinely debated and approved by the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.355W.9/5">The Government take Parliament's involvement in this process very seriously. That is why, during negotiations on the new European Semester, the Government secured an exemption from the requirement to send draft budgetary plans to the Commission. The UK will continue to send our Budget&#8212;in the form of the Convergence Programme&#8212;only once it has been presented to Parliament by the Chancellor.</p>

The meeting took place before the formation of the coalition Government and was attended by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, who consulted opposition parties. The Chancellor of the Exchequer cautioned against committing the UK to proposals that have a lasting effect on the UK's public finances. However, he made it clear that given <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.357W.0/3">&#8220;Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may grant, under certain conditions, Community financial assistance to the Member State concerned.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.357W.0/5">The Government have secured agreement at the December European Council that the EFSM will cease to exist in 2013 at the latest, that Article 122(2) TFEU will not be used for the purpose of ensuring the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, and that only euro area member states will be required to contribute to the permanent European Stability Mechanism.</p>

Ministers have encouraged Coastguard Agency staff across the UK to share their views on proposals for modernising Her Majesty's Coastguard with the Transport Select Committee. The Committee has received written views and a number of submissions setting out alternative proposals from serving staff. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has facilitated opportunities for the Committee to meet operational coastguards at the Coastguard Centres at Falmouth, Clyde and Stornoway, and coastguards from other centres were encouraged to attend those sessions. Ministers have also proposed that members of the PCS Union can give formal evidence to the Committee in their capacity as union representatives. The Scotland Office has offered assistance to the Committee with arranging visits in Scotland, should this be required.</p>

	<p pid="a.365W.2/1">HS2 Ltd estimate that, based on trip origin data, the North West could experience around 23% of the &#163;22 billion benefits of the initial London-West Midlands phase of a new high speed network. The full &#8220;Y&#8221; shaped high speed rail network, proposed by Government, which would include a direct high speed link to Manchester, has the potential to generate even more significant overall benefits worth &#163;44 billion over the appraisal period, but no assessment has currently been made of the proportions accruing to specific regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.2/2">In addition to these monetised benefits, a national high speed rail network would have the potential to bring significant strategic economic benefits to the North West through supporting regeneration, job creation, and long-term economic growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.369W.3/1">The UK Apiculture Programme for the period 2010-13 was submitted to the European Commission for approval in April 2010. This programme provides partial reimbursement of up to 50% of member states' own expenditure. Beekeeping stakeholders, including the Bee Farmers' Association which represents commercial beekeepers, were consulted on the 2010-13 programme before submission to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.3/2">In England, the Apiculture Programme focuses on helping beekeepers through the provision of technical advice via inspection visits and a comprehensive training and education programme for all beekeepers, both professional and amateur. The programme in England is implemented by the National Bee Unit, part of the Food and Environment Research Agency, where the expenditure on this was &#163;252,000 in 2008, &#163;254,000 in 2009 and &#163;268,000 in 2010 from the UK allocations. The devolved Administrations have their own programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.3/3">The European Commission has increased its funding to the programme for 2010-13, and as a result member states' allocations have increased. England's allocation is around &#163;465,000 for each year of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.2/1">No such assessment has been made. However, all farm animals, in whatever system they are kept, are protected by comprehensive animal welfare legislation which requires some of the highest standards of animal welfare in the world. In England, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal. The Act also contains a duty of care to animals; this means that anyone responsible for an animal must take reasonable steps to make sure the animal's needs are met. These general requirements are supplemented by more detailed ones for pigs in the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007, which lay down requirements in respect of general welfare, inspection, housing and feeding for all farmed animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/2">There is also a Code of Recommendations for Livestock: Pigs, published on the DEFRA website, which farmers are required by law to have access to, and be familiar with, which encourages high standards of husbandry.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/3">It is also important to recognise that poor welfare may occur in both intensive and extensive systems. The most significant influence on the welfare of livestock is the stock-keeper, not the system in which is it reared.</p>

	<p pid="a.386W.6/1">High Level Waste is a by-product from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and arises in the UK initially as a radioactive liquid. Sellafield Ltd continues to use vitrification technology to condition liquid HLW into a form that can be passively stored for many decades until transported to a Geological Disposal Facility. The total radioactive content for all HLW in stock is about 80,000,000 TBq which is about 95% of the total radioactive content of all wastes in the UK Radioactive Waste Inventory. Approximately 50% of the total HLW inventory in stock has been conditioned.</p>

Spent fuel is expected to be stored until it can be disposed of. Should proposals for new build reprocessing come forward in the future, they would need to be considered on their merits at the time and the Government would expect to consult on them.</p>

Threats to safety are identified through regular safety inspections, a joint air safety assurance audit was carried out on the task force joint aviation group in February, and discussions between the front-line helicopter users, the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff for Capability's Staff, and Defence Equipment and Support. These threats are assessed and where possible mitigation is then put in place through new equipment, training, tactics or procedures to ensure that the risk to life cannot practically be reduced further.

Pre-deployment training will also highlight the cultural sensitivities for that country.</p>

	<p pid="a.394W.12/1">The Localism Bill provides important new opportunities for communities to expand provision of allotments; the number of which have fallen by 17% since 1996 against a rise in waiting list numbers from four people waiting for every 100 plots in 1996 to 57 per 100 plots last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.12/2">There are a number of measures in the Localism Bill that will enable local people who are interested in food growing and cultivation to play a bigger role in planning, designing, managing and maintaining community green spaces for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.12/3">New &#8220;Neighbourhood Planning&#8221; provisions in the Bill will provide communities with a means to boost the amount of space for food growing with powers to protect existing allotments and identify new plots. A referendum at the end of the process ensures communities have the final say on whether a neighbourhood development plan or development order comes into force in their area. 17 communities are currently trialling Neighbourhood Planning, including in Bermondsey where the community is looking at open spaces around council estates being used to provide allotments as part of their neighbourhood plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.12/4">The &#8220;Community Right to Challenge&#8221; will give voluntary and community groups the right to express an interest in taking over the running of a local authority service. This will make it easier for local groups with good ideas to put them forward and drive improvement in local services, which will include the management of allotments.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.12/5">Through the &#8220;Community Right to Buy&#8221; provisions in the Bill, the Department is seeking to require local authorities, to maintain a list of land and buildings identified by local people as assets that are of value to them and to give community groups a fair chance to prepare a bid and secure the funding to buy them if they come up for sale on the open market. These facilities could include green spaces from community gardens and parks, to orchards and allotments, and are not restricted to publicly owned land.</p>

Surveys of registration activity were carried out in late 2007 and late 2009, and the following data are estimated by scaling up for non-responding authorities. Values relate to the number of applications received or determined (as the case may be) in the specified year, and do not indicate the outcome relating to applications received in a particular year. Data collected in 2007 on the time taken to process similar applications under the Commons Registration Act 1965 showed an average period of 16 months among those authorities providing an answer.</p>

The aim is to maximise the opportunity for families to take responsibility for how they leave the country and to avoid the need for their departure to be enforced by the UK Border Agency. Most elements of this new process were rolled out nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase>. All families with children that remain unlawfully in the UK could potentially go through this new returns process. The number of families who go through the different stages of the new process will depend on the decisions they take about their departure so is difficult to predict accurately, but we hope that most will take the chance to leave at the earlier assisted or required return stages. This new approach will not apply to children who are unaccompanied.</p>

	<p pid="a.421W.5/1">Since 2009 the Metropolitan Police Service has seconded an officer to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in Jamaica, in order to assist the Jamaicans in relation to capacity building projects and training; and to undertake police inquiries that emanate from UK based operations. These involve investigation into serious crimes: murder, firearms, drug trafficking and money laundering.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.5/2">Since August 2010, there has been one Metropolitan Police Service officer conducting financial inquiries in tandem with SOCA officers and assisting Jamaica's capacity capabilities. No other forces have officers assigned to Jamaica.</p>

A copy has already been placed in the Library. To support earlier diagnosis of cancer the Government have committed over &#163;450 million over the next four years, which includes provision for the funding of awareness activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.3/2">The focus of future campaign work will be determined by evaluation of current cancer awareness activity, including &#163;9 million to support 59 local projects focusing on breast, bowel and lung cancer and &#163;1.75 million to trial a national bowel cancer campaign in two regions. However, we know that all the 5,000 lives cannot be saved by tackling these common cancers alone, and we are considering how we might extend the previous campaigns to cover other cancers, including bladder cancer.</p>

	<p pid="a.426W.5/1">Mammography screening is regarded as the gold standard for breast screening. This has been determined through rigorous clinical trials and is supported and promoted by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.5/2">However, like other screening tests, it is not perfect, and we know that some cancers, such as invasive lobular carcinoma, may be more difficult to detect with a mammogram than other types of breast cancer. This is why we encourage all women to be breast aware, check for any changes and report any changes to their general practitioner as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.5/3">The Department has commissioned no research into the effectiveness of ultrasound breast screening in addition to mammography screening for women with dense breasts. Mammography is the only screening modality that has proven to reduce the mortality from breast cancer. Digital mammography has been shown to be more effective for younger women and women with dense breasts, and we are in the process of digitising the national health service breast screening programme (NHS BSP) in England. By the end of May 2011, 83% of local programmes will have at least one digital machine and 35% will be fully digital.</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.2/1">The NHS Information Centre for health and social care does not hold the information in the form requested. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card Scheme provides for voluntary reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by healthcare professionals and members of the public. The scheme is run by the MHRA and Commission for Human Medicines and collects ADR reports from across the whole United Kingdom for all medicines, including herbal products. There is also a legal obligation for pharmaceutical companies to report all serious ADRs for their products that they are aware of.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/2">As the scheme is voluntary, it is recognised that not all ADRs are reported. Data collected through the Yellow Card Scheme does not represent all patients who have suffered an adverse reaction to a medicine. Therefore it is not possible to provide the number of people who were admitted and treated in hospital as a result of a taking a natural remedy or licensed drug.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/3">The following table provides a breakdown of the total number of UK spontaneous suspected ADR reports received by the MHRA during the last five years where the reporter has stated that the ADR resulted in or prolonged hospitalisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.2/15">Natural remedies can include homeopathic remedies, flower remedies, vitamins, food substances and a number of other unlicensed medicines. Suspected ADRs are recorded according to the active drug substance and reports for natural remedies are not specifically identified as such. Without knowing the exact name of the natural remedy, the data can not be extracted.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/16">It is important to note that the reporting of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean it is related to the drug. The MHRA ask reporters to send them &#8216;suspicions' of ADRs: however, these are not proven. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease being treated.</p>

The review report, &#8216;Achieving Age Equality in Health and Social Care&#8217;, made recommendations on how the health and social care sector could end age discrimination and promote age equality in the light of the provisions in the Equality Act 2010. These have formed the basis of the Governments plans to implement the ban on age discrimination in health and social care from April 2012 as set out in &#8216;Equality Act 2010: banning age discrimination in services, public functions and associations, a consultation on proposed exceptions to the ban&#8217; which was published by the Government Equalities Office on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-03">3 March 2011</phrase>. This consultation, which reflects the Government's intention of introducing no exceptions to the ban in health and social care services, ends on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-25">25 May 2011</phrase>. Having no exceptions to the ban means that from April 2012 any use of age in decision-making in health and social care services will need to be objectively justified.</p>

This will work in 23 country programmes and support over nine million children in primary school, at least half of which will be girls, and put at least 700,000 girls into secondary education by 2014. Ms Bachelet agreed that educating girls was crucial and explained how UN Women will work closely in partnership with other UN organisations like UNICEF and UNESCO to improve girls&#8217; education.</p>

However, DFID supports the Partnership for African Fisheries (PAF) which aims to improve the contribution of fisheries to African economic growth and food security. A key objective of the partnership will be the development and eventual implementation of a Comprehensive African Fisheries Reform Strategy. The PAF and the World Bank have both promoted the idea of &#8216;rights-based&#8217; fisheries management, of which tradable permits are one possible approach.</p>

Reports indicate that over 14,000 prisoners have been released but we think that only 47 were political prisoners, who were anyway nearing the end of their sentences. We also understand that over 300 death sentences were commuted and note that no death sentences have been carried out in Burma for over 20 years. The UK made clear in a closed session of the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase> that the amnesty falls far short of the demands and expectations of the international community, which has repeatedly called for the release of all of Burma's over 2,000 political prisoners. Burmese law criminalises basic civil and political rights and the Burmese authorities have frequently denied the existence of prisoners of conscience claiming that all have been guilty of criminal offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.447W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Consular Directorate holds four contracts which allow contractors to store personal data of UK citizens overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.5/2">(i) FedEx Express to deliver legalised documents to customers overseas (who may or may not be a British National). This contract allows Fedex Express to store personal data of customers requiring this service. The data are held in Memphis, USA and under the terms of the contract Fedex Express are required to observe all data protection provisions, including only holding the data as long as is reasonably necessary. There are approximately 250 customers who use this service per week and as of <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-16">16 May 2011</phrase>, there were 1,750 people who had their data stored by Fedex Express under this contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.447W.5/4">(iii) Teleperformance to provide a call-centre service to respond to inquiries on our Travel Advice. Some callers to this service may request to be sent one of our travel advice leaflets. In these cases, Teleperformance will take a name and address from that caller and will use it to send out the requested leaflet. This data is stored in the UK, in line with the Data Protection Act 1998. During a consular crisis the contract we have with Teleperformance is sometimes extended to include crisis related calls. At such times the contractor briefly stores personal data of British citizens who may be overseas and transfers this to the FCO to provide crisis related assistance. Teleperformance does not archive this data.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.5/5">(iv) Snap Survey. In June 2011, Consular Directorate will launch a customer satisfaction survey, using software provided under license from SnapSurveys.com, Respondents to the survey (who may or may not be a British National) can submit contact details if they would like Consular Directorate to get in touch with them to give further customer feedback. This data is stored by Snap, in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998, in the UK. There is currently no data stored under this contract.</p>

Earlier this month officials attended Security Council Reform Workshops in Doha and Rome. At these meetings the UK encouraged all member states to engage constructively in the process of reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.450W.9/1">The focus of the UK is encouraging the ruling party and the official opposition in Yemen to reach agreement on peaceful transition. The Government recognise the urgency with which a political settlement in Yemen must be reached to avoid further violence and a deepening economic crisis. To this end we have actively engaged our international partners, including the EU, to encourage unified and strong messaging to the Government of Yemen and the parliamentary opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.9/2">I welcome the support given by Baroness Ashton, the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission. In light of reports that both the ruling party and the opposition agreed to the Gulf Co-operation Council transition plan she issued an EU declaration on behalf of the 27 member states urging all parties to move quickly to finalise the plan. Our officials have been working intensively alongside EU missions in Sana'a and European capitals to garner support for the latest initiative. My officials will continue to liaise with our EU counterparts to maintain the momentum of recent progress towards a democratic, peaceful and inclusive transitional process.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.9/3">After the visit to Yemen in April by the UN Special Adviser, Jamal Benomar, when he met a wide range of Yemeni, UK and EU officials, the UN Security Council discussed Yemen for the first time since the political crisis began. Mr Benomar returned to Yemen in early May, and again met UK colleagues. Further meetings with senior colleagues are expected during Mr Benomar's forthcoming trip to the UK. The international community is becoming increasingly focussed on Yemen, and I welcome the intensification of all our efforts to see a quick and peaceful resolution to the current situation.</p>

The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund will, in addition, allow schools, colleges and training providers to award bursaries to students in ways that best fit local needs and circumstances.

	<p pid="a.466W.14/2">The January 2010 school censuses allow an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In maintained schools and academies in the Crewe and Nantwich constituency in January 2010 there were 2,135 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;918,050. In addition to this there were eight pupils known to be eligible for the Service child premium, paid at a lower rate of &#163;200 per pupil, which would give rise to a further &#163;1,600. However, these are estimates only and are based on data for January 2010. It is not possible to determine the number of parliamentary constituency pupils recorded on the alternative provision census or recorded as looked after as they are both local authority, rather than establishment level, returns.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.8/1">We recognise that badly-designed regulation and red tape can stifle enterprise and business growth and have set out a clear aim&#8212;to leave office having reduced the overall burden of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.8/2">The coalition agreement set out an ambitious agenda for dealing with the burden of red tape on businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.8/3">In September, the Government introduced the One-in, One-out rule for new regulations so a new regulatory burden cannot be introduced without identifying another to be removed first. In December, we introduced a new approach to transposing EU directives, to end 'gold plating' and ensure they are not transposed in such a way that they disadvantage UK businesses relative to their EU competitors. In March we introduced sunset clauses in new regulations which impose a cost on businesses to ensure they remain relevant and are fit-for-purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.8/4">Last year, we launched a series of formal reviews in areas which impose a particular burden on business, such as the Lord Young review of health and safety laws and the ongoing employment law review.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.8/5">In &#8216;The Plan for Growth', published alongside the Budget 2011, as part of a package of measures to improve the UK's regulatory environment, the Government announced that micro-businesses (those with fewer than 10 employees) would be exempt from all new domestic regulation for three years. We also decided not to extend the right to request time to train to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), potentially saving SMEs approximately &#163;350 million and not to bring forward the dual discrimination provision, saving business up to &#163;3 million per year.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.8/8">which asks the public and businesses to identify regulations that need to be amended or removed. Every few weeks regulations affecting one specific sector or industry will be published on the website. There is also the opportunity to comment on cross-cutting areas of regulation, such as employment law.</p>

These relationships help deliver a more highly skilled work force, more effective use of our research base, and support for innovation and economic growth in key sectors. For example:</p>

	<p pid="a.474W.0/4">The Technology Strategy Board (TSB) are establishing a network of Technology and Innovation Centres (TICs) to help commercialise the outputs of our world-class research base and further bridge the gap between universities and businesses. TICs will allow businesses to access equipment and expertise that would otherwise be out of reach, help them access new funding streams, and point towards the potential of emerging technologies. TICs will receive &#163;200 million in the current spending review period. The first will focus on high-value manufacturing, and TSB will run competitions in 2011-12 and 2012-13 to create an elite network of six to eight such TICs.</p>

	<p pid="a.474W.3/9">Improving information for students is a key part of our future plans for higher education. The Higher Education Funding Council for England has consulted on proposals that higher education institutions should publish, from September 2012, a standard set of 17 key information items, for each course, on their websites. The information is based on what research shows that students want: information about costs, previous student satisfaction, employment outcomes and number of contact hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.3/10">The coalition Government are committed to improving the quality of careers advice for everyone, including students. We will establish the national careers service in England from April 2012 which will provide independent and expert advice to help young people and adults progress in learning and careers. Advisers in the service will have access to clear information about higher education courses and sources of funding.</p>
