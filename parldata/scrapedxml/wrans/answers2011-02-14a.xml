We welcome Guatemala's adoption of the bilateral Partial Scope Trade Agreement, which will facilitate trade between the two countries and which has quickly delivered an increase in agricultural exports from Belize to Guatemala.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.0/1">We are concerned with the current impasse in talks and see an urgent need for progress. Since December 2010, we have been engaged energetically with the parties, the US and the EU. During my visit in mid-January, I spoke with President Abbas and urged him to find a way to return to talks. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs met Israeli Foreign Minister Lieberman when he visited the UK and stressed that the window for peace in the middle east is closing, and the continued occupation is eroding Israeli security and international support for Israel. The Secretary of State has also spoken regularly with Secretary Clinton and EU Ministers on next steps in the peace process. We will continue these efforts over the next six months.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.3/2">The British Government have been involved in a programme to build the capacity of the Palestinian security forces for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.3/3">Currently the UK provides direct budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority (PA) as part of our commitment to Prime Minister Fayyad's state building agenda. Part of his agenda is the reform of the Palestinian Security forces. A condition of our memorandum of understanding is that the PA must make progress on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.3/4">In addition we offer support through the Middle East and North Africa Conflict Pool (MENA CP)-a tri-departmental programme funded jointly by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Department for International Development (DfID). Approximately two thirds of the MENA CP budget for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories focuses on improving the performance of the Palestinian security sector through a combination of support to the United States' Security Co-ordinator (USSC) and to the European policing and rule of law missions in the West Bank. The MENA CP support to the Palestinian Authority security forces is designed to enhance the forces' professionalism and build their capability to improve their performance against internationally recognised human rights standards and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.3/5">In recent years, UK programme funds have helped provide technical advice on governance, leadership and human rights issues to the Palestinian Security Sector, including the Civil Police, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.3/6">The UK condemns any abuse of human rights. We take allegations of human rights abuses extremely seriously and are studying recent allegations of mistreatment by the Palestinian Authority security forces carefully. I raised the issue of human rights abuses when I met Prime Minister Fayyad on his recent visit to the region and asked for a concrete assurance that allegations would be investigated and appropriate actions taken. Prime Minister Fayyad gave this, noting that the PA was addressing this issue not just as a result of international pressure, but because he had a deep personal conviction that human rights should be respected and at the heart of a future Palestinian state.</p>

	<p pid="a.509W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The British Government welcomes Friday's announcement by Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and Quartet Envoy Tony Blair. As Tony Blair said, the practical implementation of these measures will be key. We continue to encourage the Government of Israel to enable Gaza exports this year to attain the levels of 2007. We strongly echo Tony Blair's call for an end to all attacks on Israel from Gaza. We will continue to work with the Quartet Representative, the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to re-open Gaza for business. The British Government believes that a strong economy in the Occupied Territories is key to promoting peace, stability and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.509W.2/5" class="indent">More broadly, the continued occupation is hampering peace, economic prosperity and stability in the region. This is not in the interests of either the Israelis or the Palestinians. The window for peace in the Middle East is closing and, as the Quartet statement yesterday made clear, it is imperative the parties return to talks urgently to achieve a two state solution.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.514W.2/2"><i> </i>The Department's key programme to tackle drug-related crime is the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP). A national programme across England and Wales, DIP is fully embedded within Leeds and is the main route for ensuring drug misusing adult offenders access treatment and support to reduce their offending. Research published by the Home Office in November 2007 found the overall volume of offending of a cohort of 7,727 individuals was 26% lower following identification through a positive DIP drug test in police custody. Around half the cohort showed a decline in offending of around 79% in the following six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.2/3">Local information on drug related offending in Leeds showed that proven offending in 2009-10 by a cohort of class A drug misusing offenders was 23% lower than predicted for that cohort, given their offending history.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.2/4">The Government will be enabling local areas to invest significantly in 2011-12 to support the management of drug-misusing offenders. Funding to support the Drug Interventions Programme and the management of drug misusing offenders is around &#163;125 million in 2011-12. Building on this, the police and other local partners in Leeds are delivering an integrated offender management approach to target and manage priority and problematic offenders to reduce crime, including drug related crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.516W.3/1">When Faryadi Sarwar Zardad was convicted of conspiracy to torture and conspiracy to take hostages and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in July 2005, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) estimated that the investigation had cost approximately &#163;1 million, including salary costs of the detectives involved in the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.3/2">The MPS has a group of officers within the Counter Terrorism Command (CTC) who are the first point of contact for any allegations of war crimes received. These officers carry out this work alongside other duties. CTC officers follow guidelines on the investigation and prosecution of allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and torture; the guidelines were revised and agreed with the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.3/3">When assessing allegations, officers work to secure corroborating evidence available in this country and abroad to meet the threshold for the CPS to advise whether charges should be brought. Even where a suspect is present in the UK, there is rarely enough corroborating evidence available in this country to meet the charging threshold. In such cases, onward referrals to other agencies, such as to the UK Border Agency, may be considered.</p>

The programme was announced in July and is led by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) and the Local Government Association. They are supporting over 30 authorities participating in the programme to explore options that will help them to deliver the front line services communities want and need more efficiently. Learning from the 10 pilot projects will be shared widely to support non-participating authorities to deliver their services more efficiently too. In addition to the FLP the MLA promotes best practice and supports local authorities to develop their library services. Arts Council England will assume responsibility for the library service improvement and development agenda, following the abolition of the MLA.</p>

	<p pid="a.531W.9/2">Over 85% of claimants under the 2010 single payment scheme were paid in the opening month of the payment window. The remaining payments are being made as soon as the Rural Payments Agency completes the regulatory checks on the claims concerned. There have been no specific discussions in relation to sugar beet growers. Any cases of hardship among those, whether beet growers or farmers, awaiting payment, will be considered under well-established procedures operated by the agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.8/1">The key conditions for the Department for International Development (DFID) guarantee of commercial lending to the Turks and Caicos Islands Government (TCIG) are that the TCIG strengthens its capacity and systems to manage its public finances, and achieves a fiscal surplus in the financial year ending March 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.8/2">These are continuing, not only initial, conditions. Further conditions are not needed because the UK Government currently intends to retain sufficient financial control over public finances in order to ensure that TCIG emerges from its financial crisis as soon as possible, and that the loan guarantee arrangement is no longer needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.535W.6/1">I have today announced the publication of the Framework for the Government's Affordable Homes Programme for 2011-15. The programme is designed to support the delivery of up to 150,000 affordable homes through a new investment model which is giving greater flexibilities to social housing providers on the use of assets combined with investment of almost &#163;4.5 billion over the next four years. The Framework document invites bids from providers who are interested in participating.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.6/2">Affordable Rent will be the principal element of the new programme. Affordable Rent homes will be made available to tenants at up to a maximum of 80% of market rent and allocated in the same way as social housing is at present. There is flexibility within the programme for providers to include provision of affordable home ownership, through both shared ownership and equity loans, to meet the needs and priorities of local communities such as Peterborough where this also offers value for money and increases housing supply.</p>

	<p pid="a.536W.2/5" class="indent">The Audit Commission has received a total of 32 invoices from Kinnarps (UK) Ltd in respect of furniture purchases in the last 12 months. Kinnarps were awarded a contract to supply office furniture following a full tendering process. The contract was awarded in July 2007 and expires in July 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.536W.2/6" class="indent">In March 2010, our Leeds office moved to new premises, making an important contribution to saving money and reducing the Commission's carbon footprint. All storage and the majority of meeting room furniture was existing re-used furniture as it was still fit for purpose. Some seating was re-used but reupholstered. Other seating was replaced where meeting rooms would also be used as working areas and would need fully adjustable operator chairs. Some other new office furniture was purchased. This was predominantly 'bench style' desks with a much smaller footprint than the desks that were in our previous office and IT sundries. Personal lockers were also purchased to support new ways of working where individuals share desks. It was partly the investment in smaller footprint furniture that allowed us to reduce the overall size of the office from 13,000 sq ft to 8,000 sq ft. The projected overall saving, as a result of this relocation to a smaller office (including any new furniture purchased), was in approximately &#163;750,000 over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.536W.2/7" class="indent">In addition, the Commission spent some &#163;14,000 replacing furniture at our Gateshead office damaged by flooding from the floor above. The costs were met in full by the insurer of the tenants on the floor above.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.8/15">At the spending review, the Government set an AME margin, which reaches &#163;4 billion by 2014-15. The previous Government always had an AME margin and therefore, to provide a consistent comparison for implied DEL savings, the table .is based on the assumption that the previous Government would also have set an AME margin of &#163;4 billion by 2014-15. The cuts implied in 'policy inherited by the Government' are therefore made up of &#163;52 billion (including &#163;44 billion DEL savings) as set out in table 1.1 of the June Budget, plus &#163;4 billion of further DEL savings that we assumed the previous Government would have made to fund the AME margin. This gives a gross figure for policy inherited by the Government of &#163;56 billion. Total cuts by 2014-15, which include both the previous Government's cuts as well as this Government's cuts, as shown in the table 1.3, are &#163;81 billion, which is net of the AME margin.</p>

	<p pid="a.557W.0/2">Food served in restaurants and cafes has always been taxable at the standard rate as a supply of catering. In 1984 this was extended to include hot take-away food (including toasted sandwiches) in order to bring it into line with that of restaurant meals.</p>

	<p pid="a.558W.8/3" class="indent">Your recent Parliamentary Question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.8/4" class="indent">Ofsted inspections are conducted by Her Majesty's Inspectors who are employed directly by Ofsted, and by additional Inspectors employed by Ofsted's inspection service providers (CfBT, Tribal, Serco and Prospects), The training and performance monitoring of inspectors, including Her Majesty's Inspectors, is the responsibility of Ofsted and its contracted inspection service providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.8/5" class="indentitalic"> Training for inspectors</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.8/6" class="indent">All new inspectors are provided with comprehensive induction, which includes a programme of shadowing inspections. Newly appointed Her Majesty's Inspectors serve a nine month probationary period before their appointment is confirmed. All additional inspectors are authorised as competent to inspect only after direct, first hand observation of their work by experienced Her Majesty's Inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.8/7" class="indent">Following the induction period, all inspectors are provided with high quality training in the areas they inspect, which includes regular sessions on understanding and applying inspection frameworks. In addition, Her Majesty's Inspectors attend specialist training events (up to six days a year) and technical workshops (three days a year). They are also allocated personal development days, which they are required to use to keep abreast of current developments and to help meet the development objectives set out in their personal development plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.8/8" class="indentitalic"> Monitoring inspector performance</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.8/9" class="indent">Her Majesty's Inspectors benefit from a robust system of performance management. Regular reviews of performance draw on direct observation of practice, reviews of the evidence they gather, the scrutiny of inspection reports, and school and other provider responses to post-inspection questionnaires. Together, this evidence contributes to mid and end-of-year performance reviews. As a part of their contractual obligations, similar arrangements apply to the inspection service providers' additional inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.8/10" class="indent">The range of work undertaken by the individual inspection service providers for Ofsted, including the performance of their additional inspectors, is monitored by Ofsted's senior managers at monthly Contract Management Board meetings. The work of all the providers is also scrutinised at quarterly National Programme Board meetings.</p>

	<p pid="a.564W.0/1">An extension of gangmaster licensing to the construction or other sectors would impose new inspection and fee burdens on businesses and entail additional costs for Government. It can be an appropriate response to particular problems in particular sectors, but should be considered only when certain conditions have been met. These conditions include: evidence that existing regulation is inadequate; evidence of significant abuses of employment rights; and confidence that a licensing system would be a proportionate and effective way of tackling the problem areas. Any licensing scheme must also be practicable, enforceable and affordable. The Government are not persuaded that these conditions are met for the construction sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/2">The workplace rights compliance and enforcement review is concerned primarily with the employment rights and related protections that are enforced by Government bodies and agencies. The relevant bodies and agencies are HM Revenue and Customs (for National Minimum Wage enforcement), the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate (EAS), the Gangmaster Licensing Authority and the Health and Safety Executive (in its capacity as the main enforcement body for the 48 hour average working week and other aspects of the Working Time regulations).</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/3">The first phase of the compliance and enforcement review is being carried out internally within Government. Meetings with business and trade associations and trade unions have not yet been arranged.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/4">In carrying out the review BIS will, where necessary, use the Government's standard impact assessment methodology in quantifying burdens on businesses arising from the activity of enforcement and licensing bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/5">Information about impact assessment methodology is set out in documents published by the Better Regulation Executive, including: &quot;Impact Assessment Guidance&quot; and the &quot;Impact Assessment (IA) Toolkit&quot; available from:</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk">www.bis.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/7">The EAS has implemented the recommendations in the Hampton Implementation Review report, including the development of a risk-based process for determining inspection priorities. The compliance and enforcement review will examine whether the current powers and penalties available to the EAS and the other enforcement bodies are fit for purpose, and whether they need to be strengthened or modified.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/8">BIS has allocated ACAS &#163;47.839 million for 2011-12. Allocations for the remaining three years of the comprehensive spending review period have not yet been determined. The EAS is funded from BIS's administration budget. Allocations have not yet been made for the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/9">Telephone inquiries about the National Minimum Wage and complaints of abuse are handled by the Pay and Work Rights line which provides a single point of contact for queries about all the government-enforced workplace rights. BIS has allocated funding of &#163;0.9 million for the helpline for 2011-12. Allocations for the remaining three years of the spending review period have not yet been determined.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.2/1">The Green Investment Bank (GIB) will tackle financing issues affecting green infrastructure. There are currently no plans for it to provide venture capital. The Government already support the development of new technology based businesses through a range of early stage venture capital funds, for example the Enterprise Capital Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/2">We are, however, looking to build a GIB capable of targeting the UK's infrastructure challenges for the long term. Evidence suggests an early GIB priority could be financing for the low carbon power sector (given our 2020 targets). We might then look to grow the GIB into other areas as further evidence and funding becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.2/1">I have not met the Board of Deputies for British Jews. However, I accepted an invitation from the hon. Member for Bassetlaw to meet him and a range of Jewish community organisations, in October last year, to discuss the treatment of Jewish students in higher education. The organisations concerned were the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students and the meeting also involved Universities UK and the Equality Challenge Unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.2/2">There is no place for racism of any form, such as anti-Semitism, in higher education. Universities have the primary responsibility for ensuring that their students are not subject to threatening or abusive behaviour on campus and have access to a strong legislative framework and guidance to help them deal effectively with instances of intolerance, racism and harassment in their institutions. Universities also hold the responsibility to communicate with their students and staff about what steps they take to tackle intolerance and anti-Semitism.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.2/3">Decisions about external speakers must rest with universities themselves. In this area universities are bound by the law both in protecting freedom of speech on campus, even if that free expression is controversial, and protecting students and staff against harassment or violence. Universities have access to guidance from both Government and the sector itself on promoting good campus relations, which draw out the considerations institutions need to give to free expression on campus and to addressing illegal behaviour. Institutions also take advice about external speakers from their local police forces when needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.584W.11/13">The tribunal received an unexpectedly high volume of managed migration appeals during 2009-10 and this has had a significant impact on waiting times in most appeal categories over the last 18 months. This surge of work has now been cleared and waiting times are beginning to improve. We expect this to be evident when we publish our Quarter 3 statistics at the end of March. I will ensure that a copy of those statistics is sent to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.11/14">We are working closely with the United Kingdom Border Agency to improve workflow communications between Departments to speed up the overall process, including exploring increased use of technology to modernise the system. We are looking specifically at how we might further speed up the system, including avoiding unnecessary postponements and adjournments, and to minimise abuse of the system. Finally, we are working together to improve the forecasting of appeal volumes to ensure that the end to end system is better able to manage peaks of work and their impact on waiting times.</p>

	<p pid="a.589W.3/1">Young adults sentenced to detention in a young offender institution (DYOI) are detained in young offender institutions (YOIs) as required by section 98 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. These are normally self-contained but in some instances are situated within an adult prison with which they share the majority of their facilities. Whatever the location, young adults detained in YOIs have separate sleeping accommodation and are always managed in accordance with the YOI rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.3/2">Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 is currently being considered in the context of the reform of sentencing and penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.3/3">It is not possible to provide the information requested in the final three of the hon. Member's questions precisely in the format requested. Information is therefore provided on the basis of the predominant function of each establishment. Consequently, where a young adult is shown as being located in a prison whose predominant function is to hold adult prisoners, this will frequently be in a self-contained young adult unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.3/4">Table 1 shows the number and proportion of 18 to 20-year-olds under immediate custodial sentence that were received into an establishment whose predominant function was to hold adult prisoners in England and Wales in 2007-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.3/5">Table 2 shows the number and proportion of 18 to 20-year-olds under immediate custodial sentence that were located in establishments whose predominant function was to hold adult prisoners in England and Wales as at the last day of January 2011 (I have assumed that the hon. Member means January 2011 rather than January 2010).</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.3/6">Table 3 shows the occupancy rate of establishments whose predominant function was a young offender institution (excluding those YOIs where places are commissioned exclusively by the Youth Justice Board) in England and Wales on the last day of June 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p>

The Government have already committed to implementing contribution increases in a progressive way so that higher earners pay higher rates than lower earners.

	<p pid="a.597W.3/1">The Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme rules set out the calculation of pensions payable to members on retirement. A copy of the rules can be found in the Library of the House and also on the civil service website. The pensions of classic and premium members are based on final salary and pensions at retirement are the same regardless of the index used for uprating. nuvos members have their pensions based on their salary in each and every year of their career, and each year's pension is uprated in line with inflation. It is therefore not possible to calculate nuvos pensions solely on the basis of salary at retirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.599W.8/2">In July 2010 the NHS Medical Director issued guidance to strategic health authorities which makes clear that arrangements for the distribution of the &#163;50 million of additional cancer drugs funding made available in this financial year should support timely decision-making, bearing in mind the 31-day cancer treatment standard. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.600W.5/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what the annual mortality rate from (a) cancer and (b) heart attacks was for each year since 1995. (40872)</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.5/5" class="indent">The table attached provides age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 population, where the underlying cause of death was (a) cancer and (b) heart attacks, in England and Wales, for 1995 to 2009 (the latest year available).</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.5/6" class="indent">In England and Wales, causes of death are coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The introduction of ICD-10 in 2001 had a significant effect on mortality rates for some diseases, causing a discontinuity in mortality trends for these causes of death. However ONS practice is not to adjust the historical numbers of deaths shown in PQ answers. More information on this issue can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.6/1">The Health and Social Care Bill would provide concurrent powers for Monitor, alongside the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), to apply the Competition Act 1998 within the health care sector. Monitor would be obliged to consider any complaint from an interested party alleging an infringement under the Act and would have concurrent powers under the Act to investigate and take enforcement action. Further guidance on prohibitions of anti-competitive behaviour and investigations and enforcement action under the Competition Act 1998 is published on the OFT website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.6/3">In addition, the Health and Social Care Bill would provide that the Secretary of State may make regulations, subject to parliamentary resolution, to impose requirements on commissioners of national health service services in relation to procurement, patient choice or competition (see clause 63). Such regulations may also confer power for Monitor to investigate and take certain enforcement action regarding a failure by a commissioner to comply with a requirement imposed by the regulations (see clause 64).</p>

	<p pid="a.609W.3/1">Commissioning consortia will be responsible for the provision of health care to homeless and unregistered populations in their geographical area. As is currently the situation with primary care trusts, in future, subject to passage of the Health and Social Bill, a general practitioner (GP) consortium will be the responsible commissioner for any patients registered with its constituent practices, even if they live elsewhere. A wider choice of GP practice will mean that some consortia patients may live beyond their boundaries.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.2/1">Currently over 17 million people have joined the organ donor register in the United Kingdom and there are a range of ongoing activities to promote organ donation. In autumn 2009, NHS Blood and Transplant launched a UK-wide public awareness campaign to encourage more people to join the organ donor register and to discuss their wishes in relation to organ donation with family members. NHS Blood and Transplant also work in partnerships with the national health service, commercial and third sector organisations to support local events around the country or national initiatives such as joining the register when registering with a doctor. From July 2011 we are running a pilot whereby all applicants applying for a driving licence online will be required to answer a question about organ donation. It is hoped that by ensuring applicants spend time reading the question and considering their response, a higher number of people will join the organ donor register. We will evaluate this pilot, and if it is successful in increasing the number of people on the organ donor register, we will consider rolling it out across other areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.2/1">The White Paper 'Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS' describes the Government's vision to create a more autonomous and accountable national health service.

	<p pid="a.617W.2/2">'Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer', published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, discusses how commissioners can be supported to commission cancer services, including ovarian cancer services, in the reformed NHS. A significant amount of cancer care is best commissioned for populations covering one and a half to two million and, where population size requirements mean that a single GP consortium is too small to commission a particular service, then GP consortia will wish to work collaboratively. GP consortia will be able to decide whether they wish to identify a lead consortium for commissioning more specialised cancer services or to do so through commissioning support organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/3">In addition, health and well-being boards in every upper-tier local authority will provide a mechanism for bringing together local NHS, public health and social care commissioners. This could provide a forum for the development of cross-cutting commissioning approaches to improve cancer services.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/4">The Department and the National Cancer Action Team have previously provided commissioners with a range of commissioning guidance and support, such as 'the Cancer Commissioning Toolkit' and the 'Cancer Commissioning Guidance'. Going forward, this guidance will be developed to reflect what works best in supporting pathfinder GP consortia. In 2011, we will also develop a cancer commissioning support pack to enable commissioners to access in one place the key information they will need to discharge their functions effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.619W.8/1">Public Health England will be responsible for immunisation as one means of preventing infectious disease. It will be responsible for the national immunisation schedule and setting standards as advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and will fund the delivery of immunisation programmes via two routes: local authorities and the NHS Commissioning Board. We propose that local authorities should be responsible for commissioning immunisation programmes primarily delivered through schools, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine and the teenage booster (against tetanus, diphtheria and polio) from a range of providers. Local authorities will also work closely with Public Health England, the national health service and local partners to ensure coordination of any immunisation response during a public health incident. Given the existing contractual arrangements in primary care commissioning for other immunisation programmes, we propose that Public Health England transfers funds from the public health budget to the NHS Commissioning Board to allow them to commission the remaining programmes. This will include the childhood, seasonal flu and pneumococcal (for older people) vaccination programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.8/2">The NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for commissioning a service for the whole population. For programmes where general practitioners (GPs) are not preferred providers, or where individual GPs opt out or are decommissioned from providing a service, the NHS Commissioning Board will commission alternative providers as appropriate (for example community pharmacies).</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.8/3">The NHS will continue to commission targeted neonatal Hepatitis B and BCG vaccination provision, funded by Public Health England. Referral and opportunistic vaccination of those at clinical risk, for example intravenous drug users requiring Hepatitis B vaccination, or mothers needing post partum measles mumps and rubella vaccination, will also continue to be funded and commissioned by the NHS (including through existing primary care commissioning arrangements).</p>

The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-05">5 May 2010</phrase>. There were two proposals; firstly an Employers' Liability Tracing Office, that would manage a database of employers' liability policies.

	<p pid="a.622W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-13">13 January</phrase>, the Government published a Green Paper, &quot;Strengthening families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child maintenance&quot; outlining proposals to reform the child maintenance system.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.3/2">The proposals aim to tackle the current situation, where it is estimated that there are over 3 million children in separated families, but just under 50% benefit from child maintenance. Research suggests that around half of the parents who use the Child Support Agency would be likely to make a family-based arrangement, if they had the right support. The Government aim to do this by providing more integrated support to encourage people to make family-based arrangements, which are more flexible and collaborative and are better for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.3/3">For those who cannot make family-based arrangements, there is and will continue to be, a statutory child maintenance service. This is currently delivered by the Child Support Agency, part of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.3/4">The Commission have confirmed that, in order to improve the collection rate within the statutory service, the Child Support Agency is increasing the use of tough enforcement measures, including deducting money directly from bank accounts and seizing property and other assets. It can also apply to the courts to have culpable parents disqualified from driving and even sent to prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.3/5">The Child Support Agency has also taken a number of steps to enhance the way it recovers arrears. This includes re-deploying over 400 members of staff into pursuing historic arrears; and when a non-resident parent misses a payment and legal action is appropriate, ensuring that this commences within 12 weeks.</p>

The chartered status of librarians employed by the Department during the same period is not held centrally. It would incur disproportionate cost to examine 11 years' worth of staff records to establish exact numbers. However, information on the chartered status of all librarians in membership of the Chartered Institute of Librarians and Information Professionals (CILIP), the professional body which awards chartership following qualification and evidence of professional development, is publicly available and published in the &quot;CILIP yearbook 2010&quot;, Facet Publishing, 2010.

	<p pid="a.628W.5/1">Data are not available for all years since 1981. Available data are given in the following tables. Estimates of the distribution of equivalised household disposable incomes are available in the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series. This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. These data are at a household level.</p>

FES figures are for the United Kingdom, FRS figures are for Great Britain up to 2001-02, and for the United Kingdom from 2002-03. The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years. FES figures are two combined calendar years from 1990-91 to 1992-93 and two financial years combined for 1993-95.  5. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.  6. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living, equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalisation factors.  7. Median incomes have been provided rather than mean incomes because the income distribution is skewed with some outliers with high incomes. 8. Weekly incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling.  9. Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost and an After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they are.  <i> Source:</i>  Households Below Average Income, DWP.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.644W.11/1">Iran is constructing a 40 megawatt heavy water reactor near Arak. Iran says this reactor, also known as the IR-40, is primarily intended for medical purposes. This type of reactor could also be used for plutonium production, and the UN has assessed the heavy water research reactor programme as proliferation sensitive. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that construction is continuing in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions (most recently UNSCR 1929 of 2010), which require that Iran suspend its proliferation sensitive uranium enrichment and heavy water-related projects. The UK continues to implement all UN Security Council resolutions relating to Iran and shares the concerns of the IAEA.</p>
