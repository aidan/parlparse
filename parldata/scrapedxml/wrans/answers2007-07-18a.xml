	<p pid="a.362W.6/1">The Government's energy strategy outlined in our Energy White Paper (EWP) demonstrates that we firmly believe it is vital that we keep all our options open, including the various opportunities and technologies that tidal power has to offer us.</p>
	<p pid="a.362W.6/2">Wales is supremely well placed to harness the benefits of tidal and wave power because we have such an extensive coastline. However, we are some way off from drawing final conclusions. That is why the Government are working with the Welsh Assembly Government, the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), the South West Regional Development Agency and other key interested parties to look strategically at the tidal resource in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.362W.6/3">As our EWP states, the SDC launched a study, the purpose of which is to consider whether the impact of climate change justifies the potential costs and benefits of all tidal technologies including the barrage and tidal lagoons, and their public acceptability. The SDC aim to publish the report this towards the end of the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.362W.6/4">The work that the SDC is undertaking will not be the only study on tidal technologies. Further detailed studies will need to be conducted, and that these will also include for example, assessments on the environmental impact and the EU Birds and Habitats Directive. So the SDC study will by no means be the last word, but a progressive next step.</p>

	<p pid="a.382W.5/1">The total administrative burden from the 362 DEFRA regulations which, as of May 2005 imposed such a burden, was assessed to be &pound;527.8 million per annum. This represents the Department's administrative burden baseline. In our Simplification Plan &quot;Maximising Outcomes, Minimising Burdens&quot;, which was published in December 2006 and is available from the Library, administrative reductions of around &pound;159 million were identified. This represents a reduction of 30 per cent. on the baseline. Progress since then will be reported in our 2007 plan which is due for publication in the autumn. However, the Department is progressing well toward meeting its net administrative burden reduction target of 25 per cent. by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.5/2">The cross-Government administrative burden measurement exercise, which identified the baseline administrative burden, was carried out by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) on behalf of the Cabinet Office. The exercise used an internationally agreed model, recommended to the Government by business. As the first UK Government to take this radical approach to managing the regulatory burden, there is no comparable data before 2005 when the exercise was carried out.</p>

	<p pid="a.383W.2/1">The Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) has tested a limited number of digital radios. The average energy needed to operate by those radios tested was around 8.5 watts. A typical traditional analogue radio requires 2 watts.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.2/2">The Energy Saving Trust (EST) recently tested four televisions to estimate the energy consumed by listening to digital radio via a television and set-top box receiver. These tests indicated that listening to digital radio in this way required between 60 and 183 watts. The actual energy used varied according to the type of television, the screen size and whether the screen was on or the display was black. Black screen display is only available for BBC radio channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.2/3">'Screen blanking', which allows the selected radio station to be received in audio only, can reduce the energy consumption to around 25 watts. Although not yet widely available, we expect this technology to become more common in the near future.</p>

The UK is one of the countries in the international arena leading the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, following the recommendations of the 2006 High Seas Task Force report, &quot;Closing the Net&quot;. Together with international partners we have made progress on key projects aimed at exposing illegal activities, deterring them and improving enforcement action against those responsible.</p>

A revised RIA is being prepared to assess present day costs, but the 2005 estimates indicated there would be an annual saving to the industry in the order of around &pound;2.8 million a year if double tagging, as provided for by the regulation, was introduced. Double tagging was not introduced at the time because of traceability issues and because it was not supported by industry.</p>

It identified that compliance with the derogated rules on sheep identification and movement reporting by the industry remained inadequate. The European Commission made it very clear that they would not propose an extension to the UK derogation from double tagging. With the agreement of sheep industry stakeholders, the application for the derogation was withdrawn. Not to have done so might have compromised the outcome of forthcoming negotiations on the electronic identification of sheep.</p>

	<p pid="a.389W.6/2">The Biometrics Centre of Expertise (BCE) was created two years ago and is a part of the Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB). Its work includes following developments in fingerprint, iris and face recognition technologies. The BCE provide advice to Government Departments (such as UKVisas, Border and Immigration Agency (including eBorders), IPS) running biometric programmes, several of which have included testing as part of the procurement and implementation phases.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.6/3">The BCE also maintain strong relationships with academia, industry and foreign governments which have conducted biometric testing. The BCE have not specifically commissioned biometric testing in relation to fingerprint, iris or face recognition however, the team has part funded the MTIT (Minutiae Template Interoperability Testing) project&mdash;a European project under the Sixth Framework programme (STREP)&mdash;which had a substantial testing component.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.6/4">In policing, the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) took over responsibility from PITO for the IDENT1 national finger and palm print system for the UK police service from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. As part of the supplier selection process for IDENT1 in 2004, PITO undertook extensive operational accuracy benchmarks of the two shortlisted suppliers' proposals. As a result of those tests, the NPIA is able to give assurance to the police service that IDENT1 search accuracy represents the state of the art for large scale biometric systems, in a law enforcement environment, and that it is fully capable of meeting the police requirements for both forensic identification and for the ongoing identity management of offenders, based on their fingerprints.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.6/5">The matching performance of IDENT1 is routinely monitored and assessed by Northrop Grumman (the system integrator responsible for delivering the service) to ensure that it continues to meet the operational requirements of the UK police service.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.6/6">The NPIA has undertaken no tests recently on iris or face, but are evaluating the potential for face recognition technologies for policing and plan to undertake some tests shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.390W.5/1">The Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre, which was launched in April 2006, works across the UK and maximises international links to deliver a holistic approach to tackling child sex abuse wherever and whenever it happens, in particular, from those who use the internet and other new technologies in the sexual exploitation of children. It combines police powers with the dedicated expertise of business sectors, government, specialist charities and other interested organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/2">CEOP Centre's report abuse mechanism allows members of the public to report potentially illegal activity (such as allegations of sexual grooming) direct to law enforcement. To date, over 750,000 children across the UK have been educated on how to use this reporting mechanism. The Home Secretary's Task Force has set up a working group which includes representatives from social network providers, CEOP and children's charities, to look at the range of safety issues for children caused by the development and growth of social networking sites and develop good practice guidelines. We hope to publish this soon. One of the key areas under discussion is the means by which the public can make reports about potentially illegal activity to CEOP when they are online. One of the largest providers of Instant Messaging (IM) services in the UK has embedded the report abuse mechanism into its IM.</p>

	<p pid="a.396W.9/33">The RN criterion for personnel being reported as AWOL is that Commanding Officers must ensure missing persons/absentees are reported to Naval Provost Marshal (East) within a period of 24 hours. The Army maintains a central record through those incidents reported to the Royal Military Police which occur when an individual has been absent for seven days. Absences for less than seven days are only recorded at unit level and not held centrally. The RAF figures show the records of incidents of AWOL reported regardless of timescale.</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.9/34">Differences in figures for individual years compared to previous answers occur because personnel may have been wrongly reported as AWOL in the first instance, or conversely they may have subsequently been found to have been AWOL and the records rectified later.</p>

	<p pid="a.399W.6/2">As a matter of policy MOD does not endorse or sponsor any commercial insurance scheme. The MOD, therefore, leaves the decision on whether to take out personal insurance to the individual as individual needs vary and personal insurance is a complex issue which is increasingly regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The MOD does, however, provide significant financial benefits for attributable death and injury during service. These were improved under the 2005 Armed Forces Pension scheme and Compensation scheme introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.6/3">There are two main life insurance schemes available to Service personnel that cover all risks including war and terrorism. Both provide cover to all personnel, regardless of whether they are low or high risk to the insurer. One of these schemes, PAX (which provides personal accident and life cover) is risk blind as the premium is set at a flat rate for all. Whilst premiums under the other scheme, Service Life insurance (SLI), take account of age and smoking history and therefore are not risk-blind, they are not loaded for high risk activities and are therefore comparable to those paid by civilians.</p>

	<p pid="a.406W.5/1">We are deeply concerned at the increasing use of capital punishment in Iran. Last year Iran executed more people than any other country in the world except China (whose population is over 15 times the size). Many of the most basic standards in the application of capital punishment are absent and executions are often carried out in public. Iran is one of a tiny handful of countries that continues to execute juvenile offenders. This abhorrent practice is a clear breach of Iran's international human rights commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and runs contrary to the moratorium on juvenile executions that Iran announced in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.5/2">We received reports that a man and a woman, Jafar Kiani and Mokarrameh Ebrahimi, were due to be stoned to death for adultery in Qazvin province in June. The EU presidency made representations to the Iranian authorities, and the executions were halted. We were very disturbed to hear confirmation from the Iranian Judiciary, that Mr. Kiani was subsequently executed by stoning on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase>. The Head of Iran's Judiciary announced a moratorium on stonings in 2002 and although stoning sentences continue to be handed down by judges, this is the first confirmed report of a sentence being carried out in recent years. The EU presidency issued an immediate statement, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase>, condemning the sentence, which is in clear violation of international laws, and called on Iran to stop the execution of Ms Ebrahimi. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also issued a statement of concern on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase>. We are also concerned by the recent announcement by a Judiciary spokesperson that Iran intends to hang 20 criminals imminently.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.5/3">We remain strongly opposed to the death penalty in all its forms and consider stoning to be a cruel and inhuman punishment. We will continue to urge Iran to uphold its international human rights obligations, to implement fully the moratoria on stonings and juvenile executions and to introduce them into law, as recommended in the UN General Assembly Resolution on Human Rights in Iran adopted in December 2006, in order to abolish these punishments completely.</p>

	<p pid="a.407W.5/1">We received reports in June that Jafar Kiani and his partner Mokarrameh Ebrahimi were due to be executed imminently by stoning for adultery. The EU presidency immediately made representations to the Iranian authorities, on behalf of all EU partners, in Tehran and Berlin on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-20">20 June</phrase>. The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Judiciary gave assurances that the moratorium on stoning, announced in 2002, was still in place and the executions would be halted.</p>
	<p pid="a.407W.5/2">We were therefore extremely shocked to hear confirmation from the Iranian Judiciary that Jafar Kiani was subsequently stoned to death on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase>, despite these assurances. Although stoning sentences continue to be handed down by judges, this is the first confirmed report of a sentence being carried out in recent years. Mr. Kiani's execution violates both Iran's declared moratorium on stoning and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a party. The ICCPR states that &quot;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty, the sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&quot; and that &quot;no-one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;. The stoning of Mr. Kiani violates both these principles.</p>

I called in the Iranian ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-16">16 July</phrase> to protest this execution. I restated our fundamental opposition to the death sentence in all circumstances and urged the authorities to uphold the moratorium and to ensure that it is applied in the case of Ms Ebrahimi.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.2/1">In relation to question 150348, ContactPoint will be available to all local authorities in England by the end of 2008. By that time the system will have also been made available to our National Partners&mdash;Barnardo's, NSPCC, NCH, the Children's Society, KIDS, Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service&mdash;who will work with us in implementing the system and who will grant access and manage users in their organisations when it is operational. ContactPoint will be deployed initially in April 2008 to 17 Early Adopter authorities and Barnardo's, the Early Adopter National Partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/2">In relation to question 150349, we estimate that there will be some 330,000 ContactPoint users working in education, health, social care, youth justice and the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/3">In relation to question 150350, we are working closely with all local authorities and National Partners to ensure their readiness for deployment in 2008. They provide regular reports on their progress to the Department, through an online tool&mdash;the local authority readiness assessment (LARA) system. Departmental officials also provide significant support to each authority and National Partner, in particular through a team of 11 regional coordinators who offer one to one support and bi-monthly networking and update opportunities. Local authorities and National Partners have also been provided with a range of tools and other support and guidance materials. Progress towards readiness to receive access to ContactPoint is on track.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/4">In relation to question 150351, we spent &pound;28.4 million in 2006-07 and a further &pound;11.2 million in the first three months of 2007-08. The total costs for implementing the system are estimated at &pound;224 million. This includes the costs of adapting systems that will supply the data to ContactPoint and adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners they can access ContactPoint from their own systems.

Both documents benefited from revisions made in the light of comments from a range of groups, including local authorities themselves, representative organisations and child care providers. Our guidance emphasises the importance of local authorities&mdash;whose job it is to facilitate and support child care in their areas&mdash;establishing the needs of their different community groups and working to meet them.</p>

Primary and special schools returned fixed period and permanent exclusion data through the census for the first time in May 2007. No data on fixed period or reason for exclusion were collected from primary or special schools for 2005/06. The data collected in May 2007 relate to exclusions occurring in the previous autumn term, therefore data will be available for the 2006/07 academic year.</p>

	<p pid="a.421W.3/1">Information on the quality, availability and uptake of school meals is not held centrally. However, data from the school census shows the proportion taking free school meals as at January 2007 was 13.1 per cent. in maintained nursery and primary schools and 9.6 per cent. in maintained secondary schools. This compares with 13.3 per cent. and 9.9 per cent. respectively for January 2006. Figures for earlier years cannot be provided due to time constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/2">Also, figures from the School Food Trust's 2006 annual survey of school meals take-up in England showed that take-up of school meals in 2005-06 was 42.3 per cent. in primary schools and 42.7 per cent. in secondary schools. Findings from the 2007 survey will be available in August.</p>

	<p pid="a.427W.2/1">Supporting families from Black and minority ethnic families is a key priority for Sure Start local programmes and children's centres. The Department of Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) allocates grant funding to local authorities and decisions on spending this are taken locally. However we encourage them to take positive steps to provide services specially targeted to meet the needs of Black and minority ethnic families.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.2/2">A comprehensive national evaluation of the Sure Start programme is being carried out on behalf of DCSF by the Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck, University of London. This looks extensively at the experience of ethnic minority communities in Sure Start local programmes and specifically includes an assessment of the impact of Sure Start local programmes on child, family and parental outcomes from which impacts for children and families from different ethnic minority groups can be identified. The national evaluation uses the 2001 census ethnic group classification with results generally focusing on the following groups: White, Mixed Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean, Black African and Other. An early assessment of the impact of Sure Start local programmes on children, families and communities published in November 2005 found no significant differences in outcomes for children and families from different ethnic minority groups. The next phase of the longitudinal study of impacts is due to be published in spring 2008 and will include an assessment of impacts of the Sure Start programme for different ethnic minority groups. In addition, a focused study on how Sure Start Local Programmes worked with Black and minority ethnic groups that identifies good practice in working with BME groups has also been carried out as part of the national evaluation and is available on the DCSF website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.427W.2/4">The revised practice guidance for local authorities and Sure Start children's centres, published last November, took account of the findings in the focused study report and gave advice about how to engage and support families from Black and minority ethnic communities. We also issued late last year a performance management framework to help local authorities and children's centres judge how well their services were meeting and improving outcomes for families. This included specific advice about monitoring access and outcomes of Black and minority ethnic families. In addition, 'Together for Children', the consortium appointed to support local authorities during the children's centre roll-out, have produced a toolkit which features advice and case studies on reaching families at greatest risk of social exclusion, including Black and minority ethnic families.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.2/5">My officials are in contact with their counterparts at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) about how Sure Start children's centres provide support to minority ethnic communities and DCLG are also represented on the steering group for the national evaluation of Sure Start. My Department has received no representations from ethnic minority groups on the Sure Start scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.2/1">There is a comprehensive national level evaluation of Sure Start in place, which began in January 2001 and will run until 2008. To date, 24 reports have been published, including four published at the end of June. These can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.surestart.gov.uk/research/evaluations/ness/nesspublications/">http://www.surestart.gov.uk/research/evaluations/ness/nesspublications/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/3">Each element of the evaluation explores how effective Sure Start local programmes (SSLPs) are and provides examples of good practice and understanding that can feed into the future development of children's centres. A number of these studies focus on a specific aspect of work, for example, outreach and home visiting or maternity services, others take a more overarching view such as the reports &quot;Understanding Variations in Effectiveness amongst SSLPs&quot; and &quot;Changes in the Characteristics of SSLP Areas between 2000/01 and 2004/05&quot; that were published last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/4">These studies found that SSLPs were most effective when they implemented the programme well across all areas and that particularly important factors were having robust structures for governance and leadership, a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, and empowerment of providers and users of services. They also found that there had been improvements in Sure Start local programme areas between 2001 and 2005, such as a reduction in the number of children living in workless households that was larger than that for England as a whole, though such changes cannot be directly linked to the work of the Sure Start programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/5">Early findings from the evaluation's Impact Study were published in November 2005 and showed that SSLPs had had some positive impacts on parenting and child outcomes, but that more needed to be done to reach the most disadvantaged groups. A fuller assessment of the impact of Sure Start based on a longitudinal study of children at age three years will be published in spring 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.429W.3/1">According to the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA)<sup>(1)</sup>, the following has been contributed to the humanitarian effort in Afghanistan over the last three years:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.429W.3/4"> <td></td> <td><i> US</i><i>  $</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.429W.3/10">Prior to 2003, the majority of DFID aid to Afghanistan was focused on immediate reconstruction and humanitarian needs. In 2003-04, the focus shifted to long- term developmental programmes in support of the government of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.429W.3/11">DFID still retains some limited capacity to respond to humanitarian crises. For example, in 2006-07 the UK committed the following humanitarian aid to Afghanistan: &pound;1 million for drought mitigation; &pound;1.2 million to support HALO Trust's de-mining programme; and &pound;30,000 to provide food and other essential items like soap and blankets for 3,000 internally displaced families in Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="a.429W.3/12">Security concerns present difficulties for NGOs and development workers wishing to operate in some areas, particularly the south. This is why the presence of NATO forces, and British troops in Helmand, are essential to create the conditions in which humanitarian aid can be delivered more effectively. The vast majority of Afghans want to see a peaceful, prosperous, democratic country. We will continue to support them.</p>

	<p pid="a.430W.0/1">Climate change will affect the availability of water through levels of rainfall increasing (around the equator and in higher latitudes), decreasing (in mid-latitudes), becoming more variable from year to year and being more extreme (excessive rainfall in wet seasons and longer and more pronounced droughts in dry seasons). This will make provision of water in developing countries, where access to clean water is already extremely low and management of water for agriculture and other activities is weak, even harder.</p>
	<p pid="a.430W.0/2">The UK is already committed to helping developing countries increase access to clean water. We are doubling funding available for water and sanitation in Africa to &pound;91 million by 2007-08 and then doubling it again to &pound;200 million a year by 2010-11. We have issued a Global Call to Action, calling for increased money for water and sanitation, for it to be spent more effectively and for the right structures to be in place to make this happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.430W.0/3">We are also working to help developing countries take account of the impact of climate change on their ability to provide access to water. The new &pound;800 million Environment Transformation Fund, announced in the last budget, will provide funds for developing countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, including on water. As the largest donor to the UN's Special Adaptation Funds, at &pound;20 million, we are already helping developing countries take account of adaptation in their planning. We are improving access to relevant climate data for developing countries to plan on the basis of likely water availability. We are funding research into the best local responses to climate change, including to water supply problems, through our &pound;24 million support to African research institutions, and will do the same in Asia and Latin America. We are making sure our own investments, including in the water sector, take account of the impact of climate change, as part of our on-going climate risk assessment exercise in Bangladesh, China, India and Kenya. And the impact of climate change will be central to our new water resource management strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.430W.0/4">In the longer term, the Government are working to minimise the impact of climate change on developing countries by achieving a post-Kyoto deal which stabilises greenhouse gas emissions below a dangerous level.</p>

	<p pid="a.433W.11/1">If we are to tackle re-offending effectively, we need a flexible approach which brings together all those with a contribution to make. We need to be able to commission services at national, regional and local level according to need. Contestability will enable specialist, low-volume, high-cost services to be commissioned at a national or regional level, where that makes sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.11/2">But it also enables the local lead provider to continue to act as provider and commissioner. Lead providers will concentrate on delivering core offender management, while commissioning much of the interventions work from local providers. Provided their performance meets the requirements, the lead provider in a probation area will be the probation trust.</p>

	<p pid="a.434W.11/1">The Prime Minister and I published the Green Paper, 'The Governance of Britain', on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-03">3 July</phrase>. A range of reforms have already been introduced, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/2" class="indent">appointment of regional Ministers;</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/3" class="indent">publication of the proposed legislative programme, accompanied by the Prime Minister's statement to the House;</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/4" class="indent">revocation of legislation allowing special advisers to give orders to civil servants;</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/5" class="indent">publication of a revised ministerial code;</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/6" class="indent">creation of the National Security Council; and</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/7" class="indent">commitment of the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for Defence to neither add nor subtract names from the final Honours List passed to HM the Queen.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/8">In the coming weeks, we intend to publish a consultation paper on the role of the Attorney-General, to launch the Goldsmith Review of Citizenship, to set up a Youth Citizenship Commission and to finalise arrangements for regional select committees. In the longer term, it is proposed to introduce a Constitutional Reform Bill to Parliament in the next Session, to complete the voting systems review and to begin work on engaging with the British people on a statement of values. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in his statement to the House:</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/9" class="indent">&quot;As we focus on the challenges that we face...our starting point should be to discuss together and then...agree and set down the values, founded in liberty, which define our citizenship and help to define our country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.11/10">Finally, while we do not envisage further devolution of powers from the UK Parliament to national assemblies, the Green Paper makes it clear that the Government remains committed to enhancing democracy by devolving more power directly to the people. In line with this we are to consult on a range of measures to fully engage local people in local decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.2/1">In September 2004, the Government published a strategy which directed Approved Premises in England and Wales to be used primarily to supervise certain high risk of serious harm offenders on release from custody into the community.

	<p pid="a.436W.2/2">Approved Premises provide for enhanced supervision of offenders and are, therefore, a valuable public protection resource. Such supervision would be much more difficult to provide if offenders were dispersed into less suitable accommodation in the community.</p>

The codes selected are listed as follows:<br/>  Stroke&mdash;ICD-8 430-438; ICD-9 430-438; ICD-10 I60-I69<br/> All circulatory diseases&mdash;ICD-8 390-444.1, 444.4-458.9, 782; ICD-9 390-459; ICD-10 I00-I99<br/> Cancer (all malignant neoplasms)&mdash;ICD-8 140-207; ICD-9 140-208; ICD-10 C00-C97<br/> Between 1984 and 1992, a different interpretation of the World Health Organization selection Rule 3 was used to select the underlying cause of death in England and Wales, to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period, and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications for 1984 and 1993-94 (notes 1 and 2) . The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution. Articles specifically examining the effects of the change in classification for circulatory disease and cancer trends were published in Health Statistics Quarterly 22 and Health Statistics Quarterly 23 (notes 3 and 4). More information about these changes, as well as the results of the study, can be found on the National Statistics website at www.statistics.gov.uk/icd10mortality.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Data are for deaths registered in each calendar year between 1977 and 1992, and occurrences of death in each calendar year from 1993 onwards.<br/> <i> Notes:</i><br/> 1.

	<p pid="a.442W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question about the number of people who entered the UK in the last ten years and who are in employment. (150245)</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/4" class="indent">For the three month period ending March 2007 there were 1.5 million overseas born people in employment who had entered the UK in the last ten years. This figure includes those who were children when they arrived.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/5" class="indent">When interpreting this figure, it is important to bear in mind that the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas for the following reasons :-</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/6" class="indent">The LFS sample covers people living in private households, those in National Health Service (NHS) accommodation, and students living in halls of residence who have a UK-resident parent. Students living in halls of residence who do not have a UK-resident parent are not covered by the sample.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/7" class="indent">The LFS does not cover people living in other types of communal establishment (such as hostels, hotels, boarding houses, or mobile home sites).</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/8" class="indent">Individuals living at sampled addresses are generally included in the survey only if they regard the address as their main residence. Those who have been living at the address for less than six months are not eligible to take part in the survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/9" class="indent">The survey results are weighted to estimates of the 'usually resident' UK population living in private households, NHS accommodation and student halls of residence. The population figures cover long-term international migrants (people who change their country of usual residence for 12 months or more). They do not include people moving to the UK for less than 12 months, nor do they exclude from the usually resident population people moving out of the UK for less than 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/10" class="indent">The LFS estimates at this detailed level are only consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003 and they do not incorporate the more recent population estimates that are used in the headline labour market series.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.0/11" class="indent">Estimates are taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.457W.5/1">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex neuro developmental disorder characterised by core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are outside the range of normal for the developmental stage of the person and cause impairment in functioning and was first described in 1902. Diagnosis is based on recognising these behavioural traits and making a judgment as to whether they are outside the range of normal. The traits are present in people without ADHD, and lie along a continuum. There is no diagnostic test as yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.5/2">ADHD is similar to other conditions where there is not yet a biological marker and symptoms are on a continuum, such as blood pressure and height. There is evidence of genetic and environmental components to the aetiology of ADHD and it is highly heritable but the inheritance is complex and likely to be due to a combination of genes acting together. Molecular genetics shows the relationship between various markers of ADHD and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter genes.</p>

	<p pid="a.467W.8/1">The statement was based on a combination of available data but also knowledge about the way in which we know national health service organisations have previously been able to mask the existence, or extent, of deficits prior to the transparency we have brought in.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.8/2">We know, from audited summarised accounts, that in 11 out of the last 20 years the NHS recorded a bottom line net deficit, ending 2005-06 with a net deficit of &pound;547 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.8/3">We also know that, throughout this time, a number of factors may have worked to mask the existence or extent of the deficit. For example, prior to 2001-02, when the NHS operated under a cash financing regime based on annual allocations and in-year cash injections, the payment of bills could be delayed to deliver in-year spending controls and manage the financial outturn. Following the introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting rules, the NHS developed the practice of using capital resources to support current revenue expenditure and were allowed to move money round the system by way of brokerage and other forms of support.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.8/4">On this basis, it is reasonable to conclude that the NHS has been in underlying deficit for the last 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.8/5">However, the introduction of a stronger, fairer and more transparent financial regime, coupled with a renewed emphasis on performance management, has enabled the NHS to end 2006-07 in its strongest financial position for many years, to tackle underlying deficits, and to establish a firm and sustainable financial position for 2007-08 and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.2/1">The national health service Chief Executive was not referring to individual people. The point he was making was that because the deficits we were facing last year had built up over a number of years, it follows that both the NHS and the Department as a whole had not taken enough action at the appropriate times to stop this build up.</p>
