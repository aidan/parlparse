	<p pid=".2W.3/2">Recommendations are based on the results of the recent selection round. Advertisements in the national and legal press in July 2003 invited applications for appointment to the High Court. In addition, the senior judiciary were invited to nominate candidates. A wide consultation exercise sought evidence from senior judges and others to the extent to which all candidates met the criteria. This evidence was assessed by independent sifters and moderated by senior civil servants who then submitted advice to the Lord Chancellor and senior judiciary on the degree to which candidates met the criteria for appointment. After discussing that advice with the senior judiciary, the Lord Chancellor decided on a list of candidates considered to be appointable to the High Court.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.3/3">Individual recommendations about appointment to the High Court are made by the Lord Chancellor, after consulting the senior judiciary, from those classified as appointable and having regard to the specific needs of the High Court at the relevant time.</p>

The manner in which the Commission does so will be for it to determine, subject to the overriding criterion that selection must be on merit, and subject to any guidance which the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs may issue, for example, in requiring the Commission to seek to expand the pool of candidates from which a selection may be made.</p>

	<p pid=".5W.12/1">The BBC, as licensing authority, monitors the handling of complaints received by TV Licensing. Complaints are dealt with in the first instance by TV Licensing's customer relations team; there is an avenue of appeal first to the Head of Customer Relations and then to the Customer Services Director. If a complaint remains unresolved, the case is referred to the BBC for review. These procedures are additional to any right to seek legal redress through the courts in respect of any alleged unlawful action. The BBC considers that it adheres to all relevant UK legislation and codes of practice and requires its agent TV Licensing to do likewise.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.18/1">Science and technology has a key role to play in the UK's transition to smaller, but technically advanced, network enabled forces and the UK's war on terror. The Ministry of Defence remains committed to ensuring science feeds into both its policy-making work on future capabilities and also into the defence equipment programme. The MOD has historically invested considerable sums in technological research for defence purposes and the science and technology budget has remained stable over the last three years.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.18/2">The MOD science and technology programme has been aligned with defence policy and the capability strategies that flow from it for some considerable time. The MOD is now managing its research programme by outputs to ensure science and technology is focussed on meeting policy and its high level customer needs. Major customers for science and technology in the MOD outline their requirements, which align with MOD's priorities and high level needs, and a detailed research programme is designed to deliver these strategies. This approach is designed to draw together Government, industrial and university sectors in new partnerships, such as Defence Technology Centres, while at the same   time maximising the opportunities for wider commercial exploitation from MOD investments.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of the average earnings of central government employees in the areas requested (where available) are taken from the 2003 New Earnings Survey (NES) and are shown in the attached table. These are provided for full-time employees on adult rates of pay who were in the same job for the year covered by the survey. This is the standard definition used for NES tables. The NES does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work. Area figures are provided according to location of workplaces.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.2/5" class="indent">Owing to the small NES samples sizes for Newport and Bristol, estimates of the average earnings of central government employees cannot be provided for these areas.

These are South East Wales TEC region and Western TEC region respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.2/6" class="indent">The NES, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in Great Britain. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

	<p pid=".23W.2/1">The legal position on the use of local labour clauses in public contracts is covered in the European Commission's 2001 Interpretative Communication on the Community law applicable to public procurement and the possibilities for integrating social considerations into public procurement (COM(2001)566 final). That document, which takes account of relevant European Court of Justice cases, makes it clear that social and employment clauses must be compatible with Community law&mdash;particular, such clauses must not discriminate directly or indirectly against tenderers from other Member States.

Bursaries are available for students attending six residential colleges and for those on specialist courses at colleges of agriculture, horticulture, art and design.

The situation is being monitored through the DWP Hardest to Help Delivery Plan, and DfES and DWP are working together to streamline the arrangements for supporting those in learning.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.8/2">Local authorities have duties placed on them by the Children Act 1989 and the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 to continue to care for children beyond their 16th birthdays, either as 'eligible' children who remain in care or as 'relevant' children who have left care but still receive their support from the local authority. Section 55 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 does not affect the support that is provided to these or any other children. There are no implications arising from section 55 for the continuing local authority care of any unaccompanied asylum seeker child.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.8/3">The duties of local authorities are also extended by   the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 to include planning for and where necessary supporting young people who are no longer children, having passed their 18th birthdays. Care leavers aged 18 or over (up to 21 or, in some circumstances, 24) are defined in the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 as &quot;former relevant children&quot;. The access to leaving care support from responsible local authorities for &quot;former relevant children&quot; who were unaccompanied asylum seeking children is not affected by section 55.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.8/4">In order to provide additional support to local authorities with responsibilities for former unaccompanied asylum seeking children, I have announced an additional &pound;17 million funding for 2004/05, to be directed towards those local authorities with the greatest responsibilities for such young people. The arrangements are set out in Local Authority Circular LAC (2004) 6 (formerly numbered (2004) 1). I have placed a copy of this circular in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.8/5">When an unaccompanied asylum seeker child is approaching their 18th birthday the person may apply for support to the National Asylum Support Service (NASS), provided they are not eligible for DWP benefits and they have an outstanding asylum claim. Each case is considered on its merits, taking account of the age and other relevant circumstances of the young person. If support was refused under section 55, the person would in most cases continue to be supported by the responsible local authority. In the small minority of cases where such support is not available, NASS will provide support if it is necessary to avoid a breach of   Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

We have no plans to make further changes. The over under-fives sub-block is currently worth some &pound;2.6 billion. It is for individual local authorities to determine, in the light of local consultation, what proportion of the overall resources should be delegated to schools and the rate at which private, voluntary and independent providers should be funded for delivering a free nursery education place. According to the latest available (January 2003) data some 50 per cent. of three year olds and 23 per cent. of four year olds take up their free entitlement with private, voluntary and independent providers.</p>

	<p pid=".40W.2/2">The National Minimum Standards for fostering services clearly require that: 'Each foster carer receives an allowance and agreed expenses, which cover the full cost of caring for each child or young person placed with him or her.' Additionally some foster carers may receive a fee payment.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/3">The Choice Protects Programme is supported by a &pound;113 million grant over three years. In 2004&ndash;05 this amounts to &pound;30 million for local authorities. This money can be used to improve payments for foster carers.</p>

	<p pid=".42W.2/1">During the first four years of their courses medical students have the same student support as any other eligible higher education students; and pay the same contributions to fees. The Government have made a number of proposals to safeguard access to higher education for those from low income families. Around three in ten students will receive means tested maintenance grants of &pound;2,700, and over half will be eligible for full or partial grants, as well as bursaries and other support from universities under arrangements agreed by the Office of Fair Access.</p>
	<p pid=".42W.2/2">Fees for English domiciled medical students in years 5 and 6 are currently paid by the Department of Health. These students also qualify for means tested NHS bursaries in their fifth and subsequent years of study. Department of Health Ministers have indicated that they will, if necessary, take measures to ensure that any increase in the level of tuition fees will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students on health professional courses, including medicine.</p>
	<p pid=".42W.2/3">Under our proposals, arrangements for repayment of non means tested fee loans will, for all graduates, be heavily subsidised: graduates will repay their loans at zero real rate of interest and only when their income exceeds &pound;15,000 per year. Repayments will then be made at a rate of 9 per cent. of income above &pound;15,000. According to Graduate Prospects, GPs can expect to earn in excess of &pound;46,000 a year at the start of their careers. This compares very favourably with the salaries of other newly qualified graduates.</p>
	<p pid=".42W.2/4">The Gateways to the Professions Review under Sir Alan Langlands will look at how the public sector and the professions, including medicine, can sustain and improve recruitment opportunities for graduates, especially those who do not qualify for the full &pound;3,000 grant and bursary support. It will report by mid-2005.</p>

	<p pid=".45W.5/1">My Department has supported many projects in these areas since June 1997. In respect of schools and further education, the following programmes have been instigated:</p>
	<p pid=".45W.5/2" class="indent">The Music Standards Fund was established in 1999 to protect and expand LEA music services. Approximately &pound;270 million will have been invested by the end of the financial year 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.5/3" class="indent">13 &quot;Wider Opportunities&quot; pilots in music have been undertaken; in March 2004 I announced &pound;1.5 million investment to help LEAs develop their own pilots.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.5/4" class="indent">The Music and Dance (Aided pupil) Scheme began in 1981. The Department has spent a total of &pound;79.914 million on the Scheme from 1997&ndash;98 to 2003&ndash;04. A new complementary national grants scheme for exceptionally talented children will be piloted from September 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.5/5" class="indent">181 of the 259 designated specialist arts colleges since June 1997 have a performing arts (music, dance and drama) or music focus. Specialist schools receive a one-off capital grant of &pound;100,000 and additional recurrent funding of &pound;126 per pupil per year for each of the four years covered by their specialist school development plans.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.5/6" class="indent">The Dance and Drama Awards, for post-16 students, have cost &pound;55 million since they were announced in 1998, with a further &pound;15 million allocated for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.5/7" class="indent">Dance is one of six areas of activity within the National Curriculum programme of study for physical education. Between April 2003 and September 2006, we are investing over &pound;459 million to transform PE and school sport.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.8/1">A child attending a pupil referral unit (PRU) because he or she has been permanently excluded from school should receive a suitable full time education appropriate to their age and Key Stage. So too, where possible, should pupils subject to fixed term exclusions of 15 days or more. DfEE Circular 11/99 suggests that 20 hours or more constitute appropriate full time education. All local education authorities confirmed that all permanently excluded pupils were in receipt of suitable full time education in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.8/2">The average hours received could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. PRUs also provide a valuable service, with other institutions, for young people. However, the time that pupils spend at the PRU each day will vary according to their needs. Such pupils might include dual registered pupils (i.e. remaining on their school roll and attending the PRU for specific educational modules e.g. additional basic skills tuition or anger management), sick children, respite for children who have been bullied, and teenage mothers.</p>

	<p pid=".50W.3/1">Student Finance Direct retains the role of LEAs, which receive and assess applications from students, and the Student Loans Company (SLC), which pays them. They will both now be supported by a new IT system to carry out those functions.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.3/2">My officials and the SLC, which is in the lead in developing and implementing the new system, have taken a number of steps to help LEAs with the transition. They have sought LEA views on, and involved LEA staff directly in, the design and implementation of the new system. Most importantly, following the principles recommended in the report by Ian McCartney MP, &quot;Successful IT: Modernising Government in Action&quot;, the system was piloted in six LEAs in 2003. The lessons learned have been fed into the system that will be used nationally this year. The SLC will have appropriate contingency arrangements in place to deal with any problems.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.2/1">Most of the Department's initiatives since June 1997 have involved elements of continuing professional development for teachers. More than &pound;1 billion has been made available in this period to support professional development through national initiatives, such as the Literacy and Numeracy Strategies, Excellence in Cities, Beacon schools and the Key Stage 3 strategy, but it is not possible to disaggregate the precise amounts that have been spent on professional development as many of the initiatives allow schools to decide how the money should be spent. There have however been a number of initiatives that have been specifically for the individual professional development of teachers. A list of these is provided in the following table. In addition, the National College for School Leadership has introduced a number of programmes to transform the quality of leadership in schools.</p>

The principal congestions points are, however, the main junctions at Arundel and at the nearby Crossbush junction. The agency has recently installed traffic signals to improve the operation of the Crossbush junction. It is envisaged that additional road capacity will be required in the Arundel area, but the exact nature of this provision is under consideration and the agency will report back in the summer.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.8/1">The Air Travel Trust Fund (ATTF) is currently &pound;9.6 million in deficit but has overdraft facilities guaranteed by the Government. In the event of any failure passengers would not therefore lose out. It is not possible to predict how the deficit will change over the next few years. As soon as parliamentary time permits, we will introduce a Bill to enable the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to levy a charge on the industry to eliminate the deficit and make provision for future calls on the fund.The Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme protects air travellers against insolvency of tour organisers. In the event of a company failure, the cost of refunds and repatriations is met by the bond, and if it is insufficient then ATTF provides the remaining funds required.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/2">Companies holding ATOLs may sell any type of air ticket, but the CAA does not collect data on the type of ticket sold. In 2003 ATOL holders made 23 million sales of package holidays and flights on charter airlines without accommodation, and 5 million sales of flights on scheduled airlines, making a total of 28 million protected tickets.</p>

However the Home Office and Customs are taking forward a programme to install radiation detection equipment at points of entry into the UK (including airports, seaports and the Channel Tunnel). Under this initiative Customs Officers, who are responsible for detecting and deterring illicit import and export of radioactive materials, have received specialist training in operating the equipment and the incident response procedures.</p>

	<p pid=".59W.5/5">As required by the ISPS code each port will detail how it is going to achieve access control to its restricted areas, and this may include subjecting vehicles (including lorries), persons and their possessions to checks and searches. In addition ports will be required to formalise pass systems to help prevent unauthorised access to these operational areas of the port. Access control and how to maintain pass systems are covered in the PFSO training courses and security instructi9ons that have been issued to industry.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.2/1">The Energy Bill includes provisions that will enable the proposed Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to treat, store and dispose of hazardous material, including Low Level Waste (LLW), Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) and High Level Waste (HLW), at designated sites for which it is responsible and also in designated circumstances. In carrying out its functions, the NDA will be required to have particular regard for Government policy. Radioactive waste management policy is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the devolved Administrations. The Government's independent body, the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), is receiving policy options for the long-term management of higher-level radioactive wastes. CoRWM will report its recommendations to Ministers, who will decide the long-term policy and the arrangements for its implementation. The NDA could be given responsibilities in this regard. Clause 3 of the Energy Bill provides that, should Ministers so decide.</p>

	<p pid=".72W.3/1">The Government's plans for elected regional assemblies in the English regions and their relationship with the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are set out in the White Paper &quot;Your Region, Your Choice&quot;. In regions which choose to have elected regional assemblies the RDA will become accountable to the assembly but will retain its present day-to-day operational independence. In appointing the RDA Board members the assembly will be required to ensure that the Chair and at least half the Board have had recent or current experience of running a business. Business will therefore continue to be at the heart of the   decision-making process for regional economic development.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.3/2">As now, regional business will be able to contribute to the formation and delivery of the regional economic strategy. A key role of the elected assembly will be to improve the region's sustainable economic performance by ensuring the region's economic development strategy is integrated with policies and strategies on related issues such as skills, planning, housing and transport. This will enable business to benefit from better targeted policies.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.3/3">Moreover, business will be able to help shape the assembly's work on this and more generally through the arrangements that will be put in place for stakeholder involvement. Elected assemblies will be required actively to involve stakeholders in their work&mdash;which could include scrutiny, policy development, consultation and implementation. As a key stakeholder, regional business will therefore have a range of opportunities to influence issues which affect them.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.3/4">A draft of the Bill to establish elected regional assemblies, including their structures, powers and functions, will be published before the first referendums are held.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.8/1">For security reasons, we do not reveal information on the quantities of nuclear material held in specific locations (Exemption 1a), information whose disclosure would harm national security or defence (Code of Practice on Access to Government Information). Records exist to show the quantities of nuclear material in spent magnox fuel received at the B30 plant. Material leaving the plant is similarly recorded, and equipment to enable Euratom safeguards verification of fuel rods shipped from the plant was in operation between 1993 and 1998 when such shipments ceased. Information therefore exists on the quantities of waste materials now in the plant but the condition of these materials and the need to minimise radiation exposure means that the activities that can be performed at present to verify this information (including in the course of Euratom safeguards inspections) are limited. Appropriate measurement and verification of the material will however take place as material is removed during the decommissioning of B30.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.3/1">There are a number of reasons to explain why some people whose asylum applications were unsuccessful in 2003 have not yet been removed. The removal of a person is complex and several factors have to be taken into account before we are able to effect removal. These factors include assessing the various factors relating to an individual's removal and overcoming various barriers to removal, such as documentation issues and a lack of co-operation from receiving countries.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.3/2">Every effort is made to remove people as quickly as possible after refusal or the exhaustion of appeal rights. And we are taking action to overcome these obstacles. We have negotiated four new returns agreements in the last seven months, and are progressively extending biometrics in visas for countries where we know there is a problem. In the Asylum and Immigration Bill We are proposing penalties of up to two years for those who destroy their documents or won't cooperate with redocumentation, simplifying the appeals process to stop people lodging multiple appeals to frustrate removal, and encouraging voluntary removal by ending benefits for those whose claims have failed.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.3/3">We are also expanding detention space available and increasing investment in the enforcement capability of the Immigration Service with staffing increased from 1,677 in April 2002 to 2,463 in November 2003. We remain committed to making every effort remove and detect those people who have no right to be here.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.3/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-29">29 February 2004</phrase>, there are 30,933 applications that are over three weeks old and are currently being processed by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). This represents approximately four days' work for the Bureau. Approximately 60,000 other applications are over three weeks old and with the customer. This figure is not included in the total because the Bureau is unable to process these applications on the basis that it is awaiting further information from the applicant. In many cases, the Bureau will not receive information from the applicant and the application is suspended, pending withdrawal.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.3/2">Information is not available to provide the breakdown by sector sought by the hon Member for Winchester. Disclosure applications are processed in the order in which they are received and no sector is given priority over any other. The CRB computer system was not designed to capture information in the format requested, because there was no anticipated need to do so. Although the business sector of the Registered Body that countersigns the application is recorded on receipt, this is to enable the Bureau to undertake trend analysis. Any conclusions based on this would not be expected to provide the hon. Member for Winchester with the information he seeks, because it would not evaluate the performance of one sector against another during processing.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.3/3">Overall, the Criminal Records Bureau has been achieving and in some cases exceeding its public service standards since last June. The Agency is issuing 83.76 per cent. of allDisclosures within three weeks and 91&ndash;92 per cent. within public service standards.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.6/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) does not provide applicant details to the police during the matching process and the answer to the hon. Member for Winchester's question is none. The Bureau uses an extract of the Police National Computer (PNC) to compare the personal details that have been provided by the applicant against existing PNC records. From <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-29">29 February 2004</phrase>, the CRB has matched 193 Disclosure applicants to conviction information held on PNC, which have subsequently been found to be incorrect. The total number of applications processed by CRB during the same period is 2.66 million.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.6/2">In some circumstances, applicants' details are similar and sometimes identical to people who have a criminal record. There are cases where an individual has given an applicant's personal details to police following criminal activity in an effort to avoid having a police record. The Disclosure itself informs applicants of a process whereby they can challenge or &quot;dispute&quot; the information presented on their Disclosure. The CRB will then liaise with the police to ensure the correct details are recorded. In some circumstances, where it is impossible to dissociate a person from a conviction record, the applicant is asked to undergo fingerprinting for elimination purposes.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.3/1">Marketing the National Workplace Initiative has been a priority for the last six months within phase 2 (September 2003 to March 2004) of the workplace initiative. Phase 2 has focused on providing key business tools to help employers develop robust drug and alcohol workplace policies based on best practice, and to raise awareness on substance misuse. The key tools have been employer guidelines, employee leaflets and providing marketing and substance misuse training to DAT nominated business trainers to enhance the way they engage with businesses. Other marketing tools include rolling out the West Sussex DAT 'E-online training tool' as a National Initiative and creating a business focused website at <a href="http://www.businessengagement.com">www.businessengagement.com</a>. Overall these marketing initiatives will lead to greater awareness of the National Workplace Initiative and will encourage more employers to write a workplace policy. The budget set aside for marketing was &pound;100,000 and this has covered all the printing and production costs of 15,000 employer guidelines, plus the costs of building a website and rolling out the West Sussex DAT training tool.</p>

The Immigration Service's Mobile Freight Search Team (MFST) is regularly deployed at Immingham when intelligence analysis suggests that this is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.5/3">Such operations are undertaken by a team of four or five immigration officers from the MFST who are specialists in freight search techniques and who are assisted by one or more Humberside officers who have local intelligence and operational knowledge. MFST and Humberside immigration staff continue to work closely with Immingham carriers to improve checking systems in Belgium and Holland and so reduce the risk of the port being targeted by potential illegal immigrants. The programme to install freight screening and detection equipment overseas provides for deployment at feeder ports serving UK Channel and North Sea ports including Immingham.</p>

	<p pid=".106W.8/2">The Prison Service recognises that the imprisonment of a parent can have a significant impact on their children. The training programme for new prison officers includes a module to raise awareness of the needs of such children. The Prison Service is also developing a pilot partnership programme with the Lankelly Foundation and the Ormiston Children and Families Trust, to offer a comprehensive package of services and support to the families of prisoners. This work will take place in prisons, as well as in the wider community, and will include work with other agencies such as education, health and social services.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.8/3">Specific projects include: development of and improvements to visitors' centres; creation of family liaison officer posts within prisons; training for local staff who come into contact with families; community support services; enhanced children's visits programmes; support for alternative contact for children who do not visit; family awareness programmes; parenting from prison courses; post-release support; information to families; and research.</p>

	<p pid=".107W.0/1">Since September 11, all police forces have been able to bid for additional funding for various counter terrorist activities, including the protection of vulnerable sites. Given the nature of the funding, publicity is not being given to the activities it covers or what has been allocated to individual forces. The hon. Member can be assured that North Yorkshire have been receiving financial assistance for the Government for security policing at RAF Fylingdales and Menwith Hill.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.0/2">In addition to this the force has been provided with special grants totalling &pound;1.1 million between 2001 and 2004, as a contribution to the extra cost of policing protests at Menwith Hill and Fylingdales.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.0/3">Most police forces will have to police royal visits. We would therefore normally expect that they meet the extra cost from their own budget and general reserves.</p>

	<p pid=".111W.2/1">The internal review of the strategic oversight and management of the public sector prison industries in England and Wales (2003) was fully accepted by the Prison Service Management Board. While none of the review's 44 recommendations contained a specific recommendation that the prison working day should be increased the text did note that ideally industrial workshops should operate standard working hours of around 36 hours per week. The review also noted that operational demands and restrictions precluded this from being achieved across the prison estate.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.2/2">There are currently over 300 industry workshops which operate for an average 26 hours per week. This contributes nearly 13,000,000 hours of purposeful activity for prisoners a year.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.2/3">The Prison Service is committed, wherever possible, to extending the working day for prisoners. For example a plastics workshop at HMP Ranby operates for 96 hours per week, employing prisoners on three shifts (including a night shift). The Prison Service has to strike a balance between allowing more prisoners to access places and enabling individual prisoners to work a longer day.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.2/4">The Prison Service are exploring the possibility of developing Service Level Agreements with prisons that will stipulate the number of operating hours a workshop will open, the number of prisoners employed and the    qualifications offered alongside a target for achievement. This will help both to establish a minimum period each workshop should open and improve performance.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-04-19.164399.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-04-19.111W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/917" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="111W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040419/text/40419w32.htm#40419w32.html_spnew11">
	<p pid=".111W.5/1">The Prison Service Management Board fully accepted the recommendations contained in the internal review of the strategic oversight and management of the public sector prison industries in England and Wales (2003). While none of the reviews 44 recommendations contained a specific recommendation that prison work should try and reflect the same kind of working week as outside the review did note that wherever possible the prison regime should try and reflect the same kind of working week as that found outside.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.5/2">There are several aspects to reflecting the working week on the outside including not only extending the working day where possible but also setting and maintaining reasonable production levels. In addition it is important to have part-time working to accommodate prisoner learning. In addition there are other models for bridging the gap between prisons and the community&mdash;the work with National Grid Transco is a good example of using the time prisoners spend in prison essentially for training followed by actual work in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.5/3">It is not practical, as the review acknowledged, to fix a figure on the number of hours a workshop should be open&mdash;as different categories of establishment have different operational demands. However the Prison Service is committed, wherever possible and subject to operational constraints, to extending the working day for prisoners. There are examples in the Prison Service where this has been achieved. As part of implementing the review's recommendations the Prison Service is also seeking to improve production levels where needed as well as encouraging more demanding and creative work where it is possible to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.5/4">Linking work and education for the large number of unskilled prisoners with numeracy and literacy difficulties as well as with poor or non-existent work histories is a key part of enhancing the working week. In many instances key skills have been embedded into practical training courses in prisons' workshops. Using &pound;7.36 million of the Offenders Learning and Skills Unit's recent Capital Modernisation Fund, from Learning to Earning, 77 classrooms adjacent to workshops have been constructed to support the integration of key skills   into training programmes. Additionally these classrooms are increasingly able to support the wider key skills&mdash;Working with Others, Problem Solving, Improving Own Learning and Performance. All three wider key skills relate to the work ethic. The value placed on these skills by employers is evident from their inclusion in Modern Apprenticeship frameworks in mainstream vocational training.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.8/1">The aim of prison industries is to occupy prisoners in out of cell activity and wherever possible to help them gain skills, qualifications and work experience to improve their employment prospects on release.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/2">At the same time the Prison Service is a significant consumer of a large range of products and there are sound economic reasons for producing for internal consumption. In producing for the internal market there are significant opportunities for industrial workshops to provide both specific and generic work skills for prisoners. Additionally there are opportunities for growth within a number of the internal industries. There will be an increasing demand for items such as cell furniture, clothing items and other engineering work. As long as industries meets the standards that are required externally there will also be opportunities to manufacture and supply to other organisations items such as office furniture.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/3">Producing efficiently and effectively for consumption within the Prison Service does not mean an exclusive focus on the internal market and where possible prisons should build relationships with local employers to meet specific skills shortages. The Prison Service is also working with a number of partners, in both the voluntary and private sectors to develop work opportunities within prisons and for prisoners after release.</p>

	<p pid=".119W.2/1">There are currently no plans to create a National Strategy on Violence Against Women and there is no requirement within the Beijing Platform for Action for us to do so. We are, however, developing a range of policies in this area:In June last year we published the consultation paper, &quot;Safety and Justice&quot;, which set out the Government's strategy to tackle domestic violence in England and Wales. It set out proposals under three key headings: prevention; protection; and justice and support. And it included proposals for non-legislative as well as legislative measures, which now form part of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, which was introduced into the House of Lords in December last year.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is investing &pound;18.9 million this year in refuges in England, which will mean 273 units of new or improved accommodation over the next three years. There will be a further &pound;7 to &pound;9 million in each of the next two years.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.2/3">The ODPM contributed &pound;1 million over three years, matched by &pound;1 million from Comic Relief, towards the development of a single national 24-hour freephone helpline for victims of domestic violence and the UK 'refuges online system', which provides immediate access to information on refuge accommodation and specialist services across the UK. These were launched in December last year. The Home Office is contributing &pound;1 million towards promoting the new helpline.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.2/4">On sexual offences, the Government are concerned about the low rate of convictions for reported rape. Issues surrounding consent are central to establishing whether a sexual offence has taken place. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduces a test of reasonableness into the law on consent. It applies largely to England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.2/5">We are also supporting the development of Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCS) throughout England and Wales. SARCs are 'one stop' locations where victims of sexual assault can receive care and counselling while, at the same time, having the opportunity to assist the police investigation into alleged offences. SARCs will be considered as part of a wider strategy to improve services for victims of sexual offences. The Government are also considering options for the development of a national rape helpline. We are in discussion with the Scottish Executive, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Office to consider how this will best serve victims of sexual offences nationally.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.2/6">And finally, The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-03">3 March</phrase> this year, reinforces existing legislation criminalising the offence and increases the maximum penalty for performing and procuring female genital mutilation from five to 14 years imprisonment. It applies to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.2/1">The significant increase in the female prison population, and the wider consequences of this in terms of disruption to their families, particularly their children, supports the need to respond specifically to the needs and characteristics of women offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/2">The Women's Offending Reduction Programme (The Programme), published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March 2004</phrase>, is a three-year programme of work that aims to promote a more specific and joined up response to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/3">In order to reduce the number of women in custody and increase the potential for diversion the Programme will focus on improving sentencers' confidence in community disposals that offer appropriate packages and interventions and are better tailored to meet the particular needs of women offenders. The Programme includes, for example, the development of women specific community-based interventions such as the 'Real Women' offending behaviour programme.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/4">Two key target groups are women with mental health problems and women with substance misuse problems. The Programme will operate in tandem with the Department of Health's Women's Mental Health Strategy and the National Drugs Strategy so that women offenders can access appropriate treatment in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/5">For women who do need to be held in custody, resettlement is a vital element of the Programme. More effective re-integration into the community for women prisoners on release should have a positive impact on re-offending rates. The implementation of the Women's Estate resettlement strategy will ensure that good family ties are maintained to minimise the impact on children separated from their mothers, and necessary local community links are made to meet the range of women's resettlement needs.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/6">The Programme's priorities contribute to the wider Home Office aims of reducing offending and re-offending and will also reflect and support the objectives of the new National Offender Management Service that will come into operation in June 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.5/2">There are no targets for the number of work permits issued by the Home Office, although the Sectors Based Scheme within these arrangements is subject to a quota. The work permit system is designed to be flexible and responsive to the needs of employers and the economy. The overall number of work permits issued will depend on the number of applications made by employers and whether individual applications meet the criteria for the issuing of permits.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.5/3">Work Permits (UK) does make internal planning assumptions about expected volumes of applications (on a financial, not calendar, year basis), in order to allocate resources to process applications. Work Permits (UK)'s planning assumption for 2003&ndash;04 is that it will receive 175,000 work permit applications (including extension applications). The current planning assumption for 2004&ndash;05 is 183,000. These figures do not include applications under the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme applications, which Work Permits (UK) also administers.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.5/4">These planning assumptions are informed by monitoring trends in volumes of applications and consultation with stakeholders, including other Government Departments on labour market conditions.</p>

There is access to toilet and sanitary facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".122W.8/2">The Prison Service does not provide other fixtures or facilities in special accommodation when used for the temporary confinement of juveniles, having regard to the fact that the young person's refractory or violent behaviour may result in damage to themselves or property; and the fact that the confinement is only temporary and must cease as soon as the refractory or violent behaviour has ended.</p>

This determines whether the young person is at risk of self-injury and whether normal clothing presents a hazard to his/her health.

However, permission may be granted on a case-by-case basis, if the risk assessment demonstrates the benefits would outweigh the risks.</p>

Chardon has been assessed on this basis and found to meet the performance standards set to indicate a clear improvement in value for cultivation and use. The evidence for this is that in National List trials, Chardon's results met the improvement standards for several important characteristics. Animal feeding studies are not required for this assessment.</p>

Lead partners for the action plans will report on progress towards the targets in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".130W.0/3">In October 2002 the Government published &quot;Working with the grain of nature&quot;: a biodiversity strategy for England <sup>1</sup> . The strategy aims to facilitate implementation of the UKBAP in England and to ensure that the implications for biodiversity as a whole are considered as an integral part of other key policies. It sets out a series of actions that will be undertaken by Government and their partners to make biodiversity a fundamental consideration in agriculture, water, woodlands, urban and the marine and coastal environment and in people's everyday lives.</p>
	<p pid=".130W.0/4">Action undertaken as part of the strategy and the UKBAP will contribute to achieving the target adopted by EU Ministers to halt biodiversity loss by 2010. In addition, we have put in place a range of other biodiversity and sustainable development measures including our extensive network of protected sites and the development of agri-environment schemes. We have set challenging PSA targets to bring into favourable condition by 2010 95 per cent. of all nationally important wildlife sites; and to reverse the long term decline in the number of farmland birds by 2020.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.0/1">TB incidents in Scotland occur sporadically and tend to be geographically scattered across the country. They are generally associated with the introduction of infected cattle from Ireland or parts of England and Wales where TB is endemic. In contrast, most TB incidents in England occur in a number of traditional &quot;TB hotspots&quot; or endemic areas, thus showing a high degree of geographical clustering. Reactor numbers per incident and the proportion of confirmed incidents in Scotland are lower than in the endemic TB areas of England. This tends to make TB incidents in Scotland quicker to resolve by testing and removal of infected animals. Recurrent and chronic TB incidents are much more common in the endemically affected areas of England.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.6/1">The 20 per cent. figure is the average annual increase in the number of TB reactors slaughtered for the period 1990 to 2001. The average number of herd breakdowns over the same period is 18 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.6/2">In countries where there is no significant wildlife reservoir, cattle controls based on regular tuberculin testing, culling, movement restrictions (including tracing and contiguous testing) and slaughterhouse checks have been effective in controlling the disease. In many European Union countries, TB incidents in cattle herds are at a very low level.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.6/3">In some parts of Great Britain, however, current cattle control measures are not proving effective in controlling the disease. It is not possible at present to quantify those elements of local disease spread that are due to wildlife as opposed to cattle spread, or to other factors.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.6/4">The randomised badger culling trial, together with the related road traffic accident survey of badger carcases, and spoligotyping of Mycobacterium bovis strains, will provide further data on how the disease is spread. The TB99 epidemiological questionnaire has been designed to assess factors that might predispose herds to a TB breakdown, and their relative importance. The results of   analyses of data collected up to 2002 should be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.0/1">The UK is currently negotiating with other European Union Member States a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases. This Regulation is a key part of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme. It will put in place a legislative framework to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), which are powerful greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.0/2">The Regulation will introduce specific measures related to the containment, use and recovery of fluorinated gases, together with a general obligation to take all abatement measures that are technically feasible and cost-effective. In addition the Regulation will provide for restrictions on the placing on the market of some products and equipment that contain fluorinated gases, and a reporting regime for producers, importers and exporters.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.3/1">A 2003 report commissioned by Defra indicated that emissions of hydrocarbons (MFC 134a) rose steadily from 1995&ndash;2000, from approximately 140 tonnes in 1995 to approximately 600 tonnes in 2000. This rise was due to the rapid growth of MFC-based mobile air conditioning (MAC) systems in new passenger vehicles from 10 per cent. in 1990 to 50 per cent. in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.3/2">The report forecast that MFC based MAC systems would be fitted to approximately 75 per cent. of new cars by 2010, and associated emissions would continue to rise to a peak of approximately 1,270 tonnes of MFC 134a in 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.3/3">The proposed new EC Regulation on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases includes provisions which would lead to a phase out from 2009 of air conditioning systems with fluorinated gases with a global warming potential higher than 150.</p>

	<p pid=".146W.2/1">The UK's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&ndash;12. (The base year is 1990 for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and 1995 for fluorinated compounds.)</p>
	<p pid=".146W.2/2">UK emissions in 2002, the most recent year for which final data are available, were 15.3 per cent. below the base year level. Provisional estimates made by my Department suggest that in 2003 UK emissions were between 14 and 15 per cent. below those in the base year. The increase on the previous year was linked to greater consumption of coal relative to natural gas for electricity generation. We believe on the basis of projections, including the effects of policies under the UK Climate Change programme, that the downward trend in emissions will be resumed, and that the Kyoto target will be met.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.2/3">The European Community's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent.below the base year level. In 2001, the last year for which data is available, EC emissions had decreased by 2.3 per cent. from the base year level.</p>

	<p pid=".147W.0/1">West Sussex County Council's scheme promoting re-usable nappies was included in the Municipal Waste Management Strategies Guidance published by the then DETR in 2001. West Sussex estimated that the cost of disposing of nappies to them was between &pound;280,000 and &pound;430,000 per annum.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.0/2">The Strategy Unit in its report &quot;Waste Not Want Not&quot; estimated that in 2000&ndash;01 nappies comprised around 2 per cent. of household waste, equivalent to 350,000 tonnes.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.0/3">Medical and related scientific studies show a wide range for the production of urine and faeces from children of different ages and these figures are currently being investigated as part of the Environment Agency study on the life cycle impacts of disposable and reusable nappy systems which will report in the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.0/4">Properly regulated landfill is a proven method of dealing with waste safely and can be relied on if alternative methods of dealing with waste are not provided. Our view is that good waste management practice adequately regulated can and does cope with disposable nappies.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.0/5">Following the publication of the Strategy Unit report &quot;Waste Not Want Not&quot; the Government accepted the recommendation that the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) should take forward (as part of an overall waste minimisation initiative) work on supporting re-usable nappies through the provision of support for new businesses and information to parents. The details of the programme are still being worked up.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.0/6">The aim of the WRAP programme is to achieve an average diversion of 225 kg/yr per participating household. WRAP'S target is to convert 155,000 households to re-usable nappies by end of fiscal year 2006. This is an ambitious target and if achieved would create a reduction in household waste of 35,000 tonnes.</p>

	<p pid=".147W.3/1">For a waste to be classified as &quot;hazardous&quot;, it must normally be listed as such in the European Waste Catalogue. Nappies are not listed as hazardous. It is open to member states to determine that other wastes are hazardous where these display one or more of the hazardous properties specified in the Hazardous Waste Directive at above the thresholds the directive specifies. Waste such as nappies would be considered under property H9 (infectious). However, to be considered hazardous there would need to be a high risk that infectious substances were present in the waste at a concentration above that naturally encountered. Since the source population for household waste is healthy, the risk of infection is very low and nappies do not therefore meet the criteria necessary for a &quot;hazardous&quot; classification.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.5/1">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, has welcomed the recommendation by the Food Standards Agency that the Over Thirty Month (OTM) rule could be replaced with a system of testing OTM animals for the food chain. UK Rural Affairs Ministers have decided that animals born before August 1996 should not be allowed back into the food chain because of difficulties associated with tracing and culling the cohorts of cases born before this date.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.0/1">The Thames Barrier is closed to protect London from high water levels in the River Thames resulting from tidal surge conditions in combination with high freshwater flows in the river following rainfall over the Thames catchment. The Barrier closures may be characterised as predominantly tidal-influenced (T) or predominantly rainfall/fluvial-influenced (F). Over the last 10 years the Thames Barrier has been closed to prevent flooding during the winter flood season (generally October to April) on 67 occasions as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".154W.0/12">Forecasting the frequency of closure of the Thames Barrier in the future depends on two principal factors:</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/13"><i>(a)</i> The impacts of climate change on sea and river levels&mdash;based on the climate change scenarios currently available; and</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/14"><i>(b)</i> The extent to which these levels may be reduced by other flood risk management measures used within the Thames Estuary in conjunction with operation of the Thames Barrier.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/15">Depending on the balance of factors described above, The Environment Agency's early studies indicate estimated frequency of closures as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/16" class="indent">2010: 10&mdash;20 closures per year</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/17" class="indent">2020: 20&mdash;35 closures per year</p>

	<p pid=".154W.0/20">The lower figure for each year indicates the best predicted outcome based on lowest climate change scenario impacts and maximum use of flood management mitigation measures implemented from 2030 (shown by *). The higher figure for each year indicates the worst potential outcome based on maximum climate change predicted impacts with no additional flood management mitigation measures implemented from 2030.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/21">The Environment Agency is currently planning for the future of flood risk management within the Thames Estuary and has for this purpose established a project called Thames Estuary 2100 based at the Thames Barrier. The purpose of the project is to produce a flood risk management plan for the tidal part of the Thames Estuary covering the next 100 years.</p>

	<p pid=".159W.0/2">Under the proposals put forward in the most recent consultation paper on the WEEE Directive, local authorities would be able to bid into a ring-fenced retailer fund to upgrade their facilities to collect separately WEEE. The level of this funding (initially set at &pound;5 million per annum for years 2005&ndash;10, with a review in 2008) was determined by a study carried out by consultants on behalf of Defra.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.2/1">The Environmental Change Network (ECN) is the UK's long-term integrated monitoring network designed to aid in the detection, interpretation and forecasting of environmental changes resulting from natural and human causes. It is a multi-agency initiative which currently consists of a network of 54 terrestrial and freshwater sites making regular measurements on the main drivers of change and ecosystem responses.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/2">Annual water flow from ECN's 14 river sites in England is shown in the following table. The data are incomplete for the requested period because: (i) some river sites did not begin monitoring until after 1994; (ii) equipment faults sometimes resulted in too few data points to allow estimation of annual means; and (iii) some data towards the end of the period have not yet been incorporated in the ECN database.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.5/1">Since the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat has set water companies annual leakage targets. This has helped to achieve a significant reduction in leakage, from 4,505 Megalitres per day in 1996&ndash;97 to 3,623 Megalitres per day in 2002&ndash;03. Most companies are now at their economic level of leakage which is the level at which it would cost more to further reduce leakage than to supply additional water from other sources. The Director General of Water Services publishes leakage data annually in the 'Security of Supply, Leakage and the Efficient Use of Water' reports, copies of which are   available in the Library of the House. The Government's approach to demand management was confirmed by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State in March 2004 in her Principal Guidance to the Director-General of Water Services.</p>

To date, the MHRA has received 386 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) via the Internet.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.2/2">A working group of the CSM and its Subcommittee on Pharmacovigilance (SCOP) was formed to advise on strategies for electronic reporting and the criteria for evaluation of its contribution to pharmacovigilance. The working group proposed a questionnaire for electronic reporters to obtain their opinions on the usefulness of the electronic yellow card. A one-year evaluation has been carried out to assess the impact of, and the nature and quality of, information received on electronic yellow cards in comparison with the paper counterparts.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.2/3">Electronic reports were comparable with paper reports with respect to the proportion of serious ADRs reported and reports associated with new, intensively monitored drugs. In general, there was little difference in the quality of core information (patient, reporter, suspect drug and reaction details) provided via electronic and paper yellow cards. A significant proportion (93 per cent.) of electronic reporters intend to continue reporting via the Internet. The working group and the MHRA are currently assessing method's to promote and increase the awareness and usability of the electronic yellow card amongst health professionals.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.2/4">A new website providing rapid and direct access to the electronic yellow card is at <a href="http://www.yellowcard.gov.uk">www.yellowcard.gov.uk</a>. This was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-19">19 February 2004</phrase> and the working group MHRA are in the process of linking this with other health-related websites. The findings from the evaluation will be presented to CSM for consideration and to inform future enhancements to the electronic yellow card.</p>

	<p pid=".167W.2/1">Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the yellow card scheme. Approximately 20,000 reports of ADRs are reported to the MHRA/CSM through this scheme each year, of which approximately 3 per cent. report a suspected ADR with a fatal outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.2/2">There are five regional monitoring centres (RMCs) that act locally on behalf of the CSM to collect reports of ADRs and to stimulate ADR reporting through local initiatives. These are Mersey, Wales, Northern, West Midlands and Scotland, which was established in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.2/3">The attached tables contain the total number of suspected ADR reports and ADR reports with a fatal outcome received via the yellow card scheme from 1997 to 2003 inclusive. The figures are broken down by age groups: 16 years and under, 17 to 59 years and 60 years and above. Included in the tables are the numbers of suspected ADR reports and reports with a fatal outcome received from the five RMCs. A breakdown of ADR data by health authority is not available, as this information is not collected as part of the yellow card scheme. Data from the yellow card scheme cannot be used to measure the frequency of an ADR in a particular region or health authority, as spontaneous ADR reporting is associated with an unknown and variable degree of under-reporting.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.2/4">It is important to note that the submission of a suspected ADR report does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Additionally, the use of medicines may vary between different age groups. Use of medicines in the elderly, for example, is higher than in other age groups and elderly patients are more likely to be using combinations of medicines.</p>

	<p pid=".171W.5/19">It is important to note that the submission of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships, including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.5/20">The number of reports received via the yellow card scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs for a number of reasons, as this scheme is associated with an unknown and variable level of under-reporting. Reporting through the yellow card scheme has been low for products used in self-medication as health professionals may not be aware of their use. ADR reporting rates may be influenced by the seriousness of reactions, their ease of recognition, extent of use of a particular drug and promotion and publicity about a drug. Data from the yellow card scheme cannot be used as a basis for determining the incidence of an ADR as neither the total number of reactions occurring, nor the number of patients using the drug is known.</p>

These controls are designed to verify compliance with food safety standards, and such illegal imports cannot legally be sold in the UK.</p>

Although these pilots were initiated prior to dentistry being brought into the NPfIT, the outcomes of these pilots will feed directly into the future requirements for dental IT systems.</p>

	<p pid=".194W.0/1">Laboratory reports of antibody to hepatitis C in England, between 1992 (when national surveillance began) and 2003 are available on the Health protection Agency's website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics/az/hepatitisc/datalabregion.htm">http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics/ az/hepatitis c/data lab region.htm</a> The majority of cases of acute hepatitis C infection do not result in symptoms and therefore new infections are not usually identified. These laboratory reports do not distinguish between new (incident) and past infections and represent newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis C.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/2">Studies suggest that about 0.5 per cent. of the general population in England (250,000 people) has been infected with hepatitis C. The number of cumulative laboratory reports is lower than the estimate for the overall population prevalence and suggests that the majority of hepatitis C infections have not been diagnosed.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.0/1">Since paroxetine (Seroxat) was authorised in 1990, its safety has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Government's independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The CSM has considered the safety of Seroxat on a number of occasions in response to the receipt of new data in relation to the issues of suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/2">The CSM's expert working group on the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established in May 2003 to review the current available evidence relating to the safety of SSRIs, including paroxetine. The CSM's expert working group comprises the following members whose areas of expertise include   psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, epidemiology, statistics and general practice:</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/3" class="indent">Professor Ian V. D. Weller</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/4" class="indent">Professor Deborah Ashby</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/5" class="indent">Mr. Richard Brook (resigned in March 2004)</p>

	<p pid=".196W.0/15" class="indent">Dr. Morris Zwi</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/16">Members of the Medicines Act advisory committees such as the CSM and its working groups are required to follow a code of practice relating to declarations of interests in the pharmaceutical industry. The code is rigorously followed at each meeting to ensure the integrity of the advice given to the Licensing Authority by those committees. None of the members of the CSM's expert working group have a personal interest in GlaxoSmithKline or any of the other companies which hold marketing authorisations for SSRIs.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/17">To date the expert group has met nine times and has   completed the most comprehensive review yet undertaken of the safety of SSRIs in paediatric use. An interim report, which provides information on the key evidence considered by the group up to July 2003 and the action that has been taken as a result of the group's advice, was published on the MHRA/CSM website in September 2003. The expert group is now focused on completing its task of reviewing all the data related to the use of paroxetine and the related drugs in adults, specifically focusing on suicidal behaviour, withdrawal reactions and the dosage recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/18">As part of the ongoing in-depth review, the expert group has recently re-evaluated the original dose finding studies carried out for the licensing of paroxetine. The expert group initially reviewed one of the dose finding studies for paroxetine in October 2003. On the advice of the expert group, the manufacturer was then asked to   provide data to justify the current dosing recommendations for all indications as part of the European review of the risks and benefits of paroxetine. The expert group reviewed the completed data set at their meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-27">27 February 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/19">This review confirmed that, as stated in the product information provided to prescribers, the recommended daily dose is 20mg, with the exception of obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder, for which the recommended daily dose is 40gm.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/20">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-10">10 March 2004</phrase>, the CSM confirmed the advice of its expert group and advised that public communication was necessary on the basis of the re-evaluation of clinical trial data and the evidence of prescribing outside of the recommendations in the summary of product characteristics. Ministers accepted the CSM's advice and a communication underlining the recommended daily doses for paroxetine was issued to health professionals on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/21">The CSM's current advise is that the balance of risks and benefits of this medicine in the licensed indications is favourable and, on this basis, there are no plans to restrict its use in new patients.</p>

	<p pid=".197W.2/1">Patients with mental health difficulties benefit along with other patients from the reduction in delay in assessment and treatment the four-hour target requires. Concerns were expressed last year by clinicians about the minority of patients who clinically need more than four hours in accident and emergency (A&amp;E). In response to this the final December 2004 target was adjusted at the end of 2003 to a minimum operating standard of 98 per cent. This gives all trusts up to 2 per cent. headroom to manage clinical exceptions and other patients still in A&amp;E after four hours. The number of patients with mental health difficulties who clinically need more than four hours in A&amp;E is very small.</p>

	<p pid=".202W.2/1">There was no spending on the National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) in 2001 nor 2002. The three year expenditure programme started in April 2003 but there has been no local expenditure on the National Programme by primary care trusts and national health service trusts in the last year. The expenditure projection over the three years from April 2003 is shown in the following table and is centrally funded.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.2/2">In addition to this central funding, the NHS spends its own resources on information technology, mainly for existing IT systems. In 2003&ndash;04, it is estimated that the NHS will spend around &pound;880 million. About 70 per cent. of this amount will be spent by NHS trusts with the remainder spent by primary care trusts and strategic health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.2/3">As the NPfIT is implemented over the years ahead, an increasing proportion of the existing NHS IT spend will become available to be spent on additional services under the national programme contracts as trusts make local choices. However, it is too soon to accurately predict the proportion.</p>

	<p pid=".202W.5/2">The National Programme for Information Technology has awarded a number of contracts to local service providers (LSPs) who act as prime contractors to deliver the elements of the NPfIT in a geographical area. It is the primary responsibility of the LSPs to work with a range of other suppliers to deliver the solutions that the NHS needs. This will include working with EMIS and other primary care system providers to ensure that the systems in use across the NHS conform to the national standards required and can be upgraded to integrate with new national applications as they come on line.</p>

	<p pid=".204W.5/21">The decrease in the number of national health service beds in some sectors reflects service improvements away from in-patient stays. We are aiming to deliver as many services as possible in the most low tech and local environment with more support in peoples' homes and the community. More procedures are taking place in out-patients and community settings which used to require hospital admission. At the same time, more consultations and treatments are taking place outside hospitals in the community and being delivered by different groups of staff. General practitioners are starting to offer treatments and consultations, which were once only done by hospital consultants. Similarly, there is an increase in the range of work undertaken by nurses. Many of the changes in the way services are delivered have been supported by the Modernisation Agency and through collaboration and learning between different parts of the NHS. This redesign of services has allowed the NHS to treat more patients and offer more convenient services.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.5/22">The NHS Plan did, however, recognise a need for more general and acute beds and set a target of 2,100 extra by 2004. The latest available statistics for 2002&ndash;03 showed that general and acute beds increased by 1,600 to 136,679 over the previous three years. This represents over three quarters of the target set out in the NHS Plan. This is the first time general and acute bed numbers have increased in three consecutive years since records began in 1960.</p>

For patients wishing to register with a National Health Service dentist for routine dental care there were, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March 2004</phrase>, four dental practices in the city accepting new NHS patients. There were also three dental practices accepting NHS orthodontic patients, although there are waiting times for these appointments. The PCT has also put in place arrangements to ensure that the more complex orthodontic cases are treated at Southampton General Hospital, which has 1.5 whole time equivalent orthodontic consultants. Southampton also has one personal dental service site in operation&mdash;the Southampton and South West Hampshire Dental Access Centre&mdash;which sees an average of 815 patients each month.</p>
	<p pid=".205W.2/3">We have provided new investment totalling &pound;90 million to NHS dentistry over the last year. &pound;59 million will support access, and strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been advised of their shares and are working with their PCTs to address access issues. Hampshire and the Isle of Wight SHA has been allocated &pound;1.64 million, and Southampton City PCT will receive a share of this to support its action plan to improve access to NHS dentistry in Southampton. Additionally, the PCT funds a local dental helpline, which provides information on where NHS dentistry, including orthodontics, is available locally, either for urgent or routine treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.9/1">During recent years the national health service has purchased a range of operations from the private sector under the 'Concordat' arrangement. These have largely been less complex procedures, mainly in ophthalmology, general surgery and orthopaedics. Information is not held centrally on which operations have been commissioned under the Concordat this year, but is available for 2002&ndash;03. An analysis has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.9/2">To ensure that waiting time targets are met, patient choice increased and value for money improved, the NHS will be making much greater, but more structured use of the independent sector from next year. This will be done under the aegis of the independent treatment centre programme. The procedures purchased will be diagnostic and less complex surgical procedures (such as cataract treatment, hernia repairs, primary hip and knee replacement, arthroscopies, endoscopies), mainly in general surgery, ophthalmology and orthopaedics.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.9/3">When fully operational, we expect the independent sector treatment centre programme to treat 250,000 patients per annum across a range of simple and day care procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.9/4">In addition to this main programme, the Department is also currently negotiating a supplementary procurement (announced in July 2003) of an extra 125,000 operations for the NHS over the next five years, principally for additional orthopaedic operations. Two services are already working: a treatment centre at Daventry (cataracts) and the mobile cataract treatment service provided by Netcare.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.8/2">The Patient Experience Definition articulates the entirety of the desired experience from a patient perspective when using NHS services. Traditionally service delivery has focused on the physical aspects of patient care and has given much less emphasis to patients' emotional needs. The research has clearly identified that for patients a good emotional experience is critical to their overall satisfaction with the NHS. The definition enables both the Department and the NHS to have a more complete understanding of the patient experience when developing and delivering patient-centred services in the future.</p>

This publication explains that such groups have a short-term focus and when their work comes to an end they are disbanded. These groups are usually created to give expert advice to the Government on a specific issue and are usually expected to remain in operation for less than two years. They are not separate statutory bodies. As such, they have no capacity to employ staff or hold assets in their own right, and rely on secretariat and other support from the Department and sometimes other interested bodies. They will not normally have any formal separate budget allocated to them, and accountability for expenditure will remain with the body to whom any funding is allocated. A number of those listed have completed their work and no longer exist.</p>

The National Institute for Mental Health in England has established a small group comprising of organisations which provide support to people bereaved by suicide to consider what further support and information can be provided to this vulnerable group. No formal assessment of models of suicide bereavement support in other countries has been undertaken by the Department, but the bereavement group has considered some as part of its work. The Department has commissioned the York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination to undertake a review of evidence regarding interventions to help people bereaved by suicide. Its findings will inform the work of the bereavement group.</p>

Following publication of revised guidance to Departments on sustainable timber procurement in January 2004, the Department has revised its standard Invitation to Tender to ensure that all tenderers are aware of and comply with the policy. In addition, the Department's facilities management team monitors all purchases of timber and timber products to ensure that they meet the requirements of the policy.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.8/3"><i>Health Authorities:</i> The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (NHSPASA) is actively implementing a timber compliance strategy within the National Health Service (NHS). For example, NHSPASA is working with all the suppliers on the national NHS contract for furniture to implement the Government's timber procurement policy within the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.8/4">This will ensure that the source of timber can be audited and monitored to make sure that it is from a sustainable and legal supply. Suppliers' progress is monitored on an ongoing basis, and updated information is available to the NHS on the NHSPAPSA's website.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.8/5"><i>Meat Hygiene Service (MHS):</i> The MHS is an executive agency of the Food Standards Agency and as such is not covered by the Department's sustainable development policy. However, the MHS procurement strategy states that:</p>
	<p pid=".226W.8/6" class="indent">&quot;the MHS will ensure that sound environmental policies are incorporated into its procurement process so that costs and benefits associated with 'green' procurement are always considered&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.8/7"><i>Medicines &amp; Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA):</i> The policies of the central Department also apply to, and have been adopted by MHRA.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.8/8"><i>NHS Estates:</i> The policies of the central Department have been adopted by NHS Estates. Any purchase of   furniture would require the supplier to give undertakings as to the source of materials used. Any purchase of new furniture would require the supplier to give undertakings as to the source of the material used.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.8/9"><i>NHS Pensions Agency:</i> Purchases of timber are made via the Agency's facilities management contractor, who endeavours to ensure that the products are purchased from legitimate timber merchants. Actual purchases are monitored and reported within the framework for sustainable development on the Government Estate.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.2/17">There has been significant growth in the number of community service nurses other than health visitors and district nurses. Since 1997 there has been an increase of 11,974(61.9 per cent.) in such nurses.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.2/18">These figures reflect that changing nature of the nursing workforce and the increasing skill mix in community nursing teams.

	<p pid=".228W.5/1">All independent sector providers that expressed an interest in response to advertisements in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities were asked to complete and return a pre-qualification questionnaire. Detailed analysis of the information in the questionnaire enabled the selection of a group of short-listed bidders based on their financial standing and ability to deliver high quality clinical services. This group was invited to submit bids for the contracts to manage and run the proposed new treatment centres. The subsequent selection of the preferred bidders followed careful evaluation of the submitted bids. The   evaluation criteria included clinical quality, infrastructure, information management and technology, human resources, legal, financial, speed of mobilisation and delivery, and value for money. There was a structured scoring mechanism against each of these criteria and total scores assessed between bidders.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.5/2">The national implementation team co-ordinated the evaluation of submitted bids. Bids were evaluated and ranked by specialist teams consisting of members of the national implementation team, their advisers and local national health service sponsors and experts.

	<p pid=".230W.2/1">The possibility of urine based drug therapies providing a route for human-to-human transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other diseases has been considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and at a European level by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP). There is no evidence of human-to-human infection of CJD caused by urine based drug therapy and epidemiological evidence does not suggest a risk for urine-derived medicinal products from patients with sporadic CJD. However, as a precautionary measure, the CSM has advised that urine from a country with one or more cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD) should not be used as a source of human urine to produce medicinal products for the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.2/2">All UK medicinal products are manufactured in accordance with European regulatory guidelines and it is a requirement that all urinary derived products use validated manufacturing process which are capable of providing assurance that the risk of viral infectivity is   minimised. These requirements are assessed by the   Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority for all urinary derived products. Bacterial infection should not be an issue, as these products are for injection and are therefore required to be sterile.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.0/1">The two European Court of Justice decisions have raised particular problems for the National Health Service by ruling that residential on-call work, even if the doctor is resting or sleeping, has to be counted as work and also by stipulating that compensatory rest has to be taken immediately. This has made compliance with the Working Time Directive for doctors in training from August 2004 more difficult given the substantial reliance on resident on-call rotas to provide round the clock cover in acute services. These difficulties are most apparent in small isolated hospitals and some specialities.</p>

The analysis indicates that local councils have met the requirements required by &quot;No Secrets&quot; and that considerable progress has been made towards improving co-ordination between agencies when dealing with adult abuse cases.</p>

	<p pid=".247W.15/1">In the United Kingdom, the yellow card scheme allows health professionals to report suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on a voluntary basis to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). There is a legal requirement for companies to report suspected ADRs to their drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.15/2">All voluntary reporting systems suffer from under-reporting. The proportion of suspected adverse drug reactions, which are reported, is very variable. Under reporting is thought to occur less frequently with newly identified, serious and unlabelled reactions (those reactions which are not yet included in the product information).</p>
	<p pid=".247W.15/3">Studies in UK hospitals (Smith et al 1996) and general practice settings (Martin et al 1998, Heeley et al 2001) have estimated that around five to ten per cent. of all suspected adverse drug reactions experienced by patients are reported to CSM and MHRA through the yellow card scheme. The study in general practice carried out by Heeley et al (2001) combined serious and non-serious ADRs in this estimate of under reporting of ADRs. This study also provided a breakdown of the estimates of under-reporting of reactions classified as serious or non-serious and labelled or unlabelled, and estimated that general practitioners report between 30 and 50 per cent. of serious unlabelled adverse reactions to CSM and MHRA via the yellow card scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.15/4">Under-reporting does not necessarily detract from the ability of drug safety monitoring systems to identify new and important drug safety hazards. The MHRA and CSM are continually working to increase the quality and quantity of reports received via the Yellow Card Scheme in order to increase the potential for rapid identification of new drug safety hazards.</p>

	<p pid=".255W.2/3">If annual dental examinations were made free to all adults in England, patient charge revenue would be reduced by around &pound;65 million per annum. Under the present dental payment system for general dental services, the total cost would be increased if the change stimulated demand for more dental examinations and these also led to some additional NHS dental treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".255W.2/4">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has recently produced draft guidance for consultation, which proposes that the interval between dental examinations for patients should be tailored to meet their needs on the basis of an assessment of disease levels and risk of dental disease. If accepted, we would expect the new contractual arrangements for dentists which are currently under discussion with the profession to reflect this approach which is aimed towards care tailored to the clinical needs of patients. Under the new contract proposals, the link between treatments and payments will be abolished. Instead, dentists will be paid a guaranteed annual income for an agreed level of NHS commitment and will be free to decide treatments for their patients on the basis of clinical need, including the frequency of dental examinations.</p>

The NHS will ensure that the care home either receives continence products free of charge, or will make a payment to the care home for continence provision. Guidance issued to primary care trusts in September 2001 and March 2003 was consulted upon with a wide range of stakeholders, including care homes providing nursing care. The guidance stresses the importance of the NHS consulting local providers about continence provision to ensure that, as far as possible, the arrangements meet their needs concerning delivery and storage.</p>

	<p pid=".263W.5/1">All authorised insulins, whether human insulin or animal insulin, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in people with diabetes mellitus. As part of the licensing approval process for any medicinal product, including insulins, the applicant has to provide evidence that the product meets appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy. This will include clinical trial data in patients with diabetes. Findings from the Cochrane review, which compared the effects of synthetic human insulin and natural animal insulin in diabetic patients from 1996 to 2002 and was subsequently updated in 2003, indicate that both human and animal insulins are equally effective. The decision to use one or other of the insulin rests with the physician in consultation with the patient.</p>

	<p pid=".268W.0/1">It is not possible to estimate precisely the level of savings from expanding either financial services or human resources (HR) as these depend on a number of factors. The level of savings at each trust will depend on the age of their existing information technology systems, their cost base and number and type of staff they employ, how their services are delivered at the moment and the volume of transactions that are undertaken. The speed of any roll-out will also dictate the level of savings and is equally dependent on similar local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".268W.6/1">If an adult British citizen approaches a council with social services responsibilities for help, the council should determine whether the person is ordinarily resident in its area or in urgent need. If so, the council should carry out a community care assessment if it believes that the individual adult's needs are such that s/he may be provided with community care services. If, on the basis of a community care assessment, the individual is deemed eligible for community care services, the council should provide those services and, thereafter, review both needs and services at frequent intervals. This process applies to all adult British citizens whether they are destitute or not. In some situations, a council may have to provide substantial help, including residential accommodation, if a destitute British citizen is returning to, or arriving in, the United Kingdom and cannot access benefits and housing immediately.</p>

	<p pid=".274W.2/1">The Community Legal Service (CLS) aims to improve access to quality legal and advice services for all. Regional Legal Service Committees and CLS Partnerships are responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of legal and advice services in their area and through an analysis of local legal needs, can ensure that resources are more effectively targeted to those most in need. A number of initiatives have been put in place to improve access to advice, including the Just Ask! website. A national telephone advice service will be available nationally from summer 2004 following a successful pilot. CLS leaflets provide information on legal rights and details of local service providers can be found in the CLS Directory, available at a number of public locations and online. The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee's current inquiry into the adequacy of civil legal aid provision is considering access to civil legal and advice services. An independent review is also evaluating the effectiveness of the CLS and is due to report in late April 2004.</p>

The regulations work on the principle of opt-out rules on unsolicited direct marketing by phone; it is a breach of the regulations to make an unsolicited direct marketing call to any subscriber who has either told that caller not to ring, or who has been registered on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) for at least 28 days. Currently only individual subscribers have the right to register on the TPS but in response to a Government consultation undertaken last year this will be opened to corporate subscribers also as of <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-25">25 June 2004</phrase>.</p>

Based upon sample analyses, it is estimated that 5 per cent. of prescription items are partly paid-for by pre-payment certificates (PPCs), which allow the patient to obtain as many prescription items as necessary during the four or 12 month validity of the certificate for a set fee. Consequently, about 89 per cent. of Health Service prescription items are dispensed free of charge to patients. Estimated figures for the latter two categories are calculated as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".291W.5/3" class="indent">You tabled a Parliamentary Question asking for what reasons Royal Mail has been denied permission to erect a post box at Lansdowne Road, Newtownards. As the issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.5/4" class="indent">I understand that Royal Mail submitted a written request on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-07">7 January 2004</phrase> seeking permission to locate a post box at Lansdowne Road, Newtownards. The proposed location of the box was shown to be 5 metres from the junction of Lansdowne Road and Ten Acre (a side road leading to houses occupied mainly by elderly people).</p>
	<p pid=".291W.5/5" class="indent">Following discussions with the Traffic Police, our local Section Engineer replied to Royal Mail on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-16">16 January 2004</phrase> indicating that the proposed location was not suitable due to concerns that vehicles stopping so close to the junction to post mail would have compromised traffic safety. However, it was suggested that if the box could be located a minimum of 15 metres from the junction, at the back of the footway, this would be acceptable. This distance ties in with the minimum length of waiting restriction commonly marked on the ground at road junctions to reinforce current law (i.e. it is an offence to park a vehicle within 15 metres of a junction regardless of whether the road is marked with double yellow lines).</p>
	<p pid=".291W.5/6" class="indent">It would appear that Royal Mail has somehow misinterpreted the content of our reply, which clearly indicates that Roads Service would grant approval for an alternative location close to that initially proposed. I have asked our Section Engineer to contact the Royal Mail to clarify the position so that the post-box can be provided as soon as possible.</p>

The Department has not issued guidelines or carried out a medical assessment on this matter. There are no plans to introduce, as standard practice, the provision of personal lockers for school children. The Department's School Building Handbook provides for either cloakroom space or moveable lockers in schools. It is, however, a matter for school authorities to decide what provision should be made at a particular school. Also, parents have a responsibility to protect the health and welfare of their children by ensuring that only essential materials are carried in schoolbags. Similarly, pupils are also responsible for making decisions as to the books and learning materials they need to carry to and from school each day.</p>

	<p pid=".293W.2/1">The Health and Safety Executive in Great Britain has published guidance for operators and customers of solaria. Included in that advice is that people under 16 years old should not use sunbeds and that a limit of 20 sessions per year should be observed. This advice was developed after consultation with leading experts, is equally applicable to the Northern Ireland situation and is referred to by Health and Safety Inspectors here as illustrating good practice.

Students in higher education who satisfy residency requirements and whose family incomes are less than &pound;20,970 do not pay anything towards their tuition fees. Likewise, Traveller students have the same access to student loans as other students. Where family income is under &pound;20,000, they are eligible to receive non-refundable bursaries of up to &pound;2,000 thereby reducing the amount of student loan they need to borrow. Supplementary grants such as Disabled Students' Allowance and childcare grants are also available.</p>

	<p pid=".296W.0/1">It is not possible to estimate the financial cost without incurring disproportionate costs. Any costs incurred for example in extra overtime payments to staff, would be offset by the savings made on staff salaries. The Department's businesses routinely move work around locations in order to optimise their services. Our information technology enables this to be done without incurring extra costs. There was no significant movement of work during the strike action. Our contingency arrangements allowed us to minimise the disruption to services to the most vulnerable members of society for whom the Department's services exist.</p>

	<p pid=".298W.2/1">The Performance and Development system was developed with input from staff, managers and Trade Unions, and in line with Cabinet Office recommendations. It was supported by independent consultants who researched and advised on best practice in both public and private sectors. The system provides a fair and objective assessment of performance against that of people at the same level doing similar work, a stronger focus on personal development, and more regular feedback, all of which is intended to improve motivation and performance.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.2/2">This is only the end of the first year of the system, it is therefore too early to have tangible evidence of the results on motivation and performance.

	<p pid=".298W.5/1">The Performance and Development System (PDS) replaced seven legacy systems. Most of the features of PDS are not new, and existed in previous legacy arrangements. These have not been costed previously, all good employers have appraisal arrangements in line with Investors in People standards. While there have been additional costs this year, as there would be in any organisation introducing a new policy these have not been excessive, around 2&ndash;3 hours for each member of staff. We expect this investment in performance management and training (mostly using e-learning) to result in improved performance.</p>

	<p pid=".309W.5/1">Five schemes are currently under development. Of these two have received provisional approval from my Department. They are:</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/2" class="indent">Midland Metro extension&mdash;Birmingham to Five Ways and Wednesbury to Brierley Hill (estimated total cost &pound;227 million; expected construction start 2005 and expected completion 2008); and</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/3" class="indent">Merseytram Line 1 (estimated total cost &pound;225 million; expected construction start 2005 and expected completion 2007).</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/4">Three schemes have received approval but the estimated cost subsequently increased. The value for money of the schemes therefore needs to be reappraised. They are:</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/5" class="indent">Manchester Metrolink Phase 3;</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/6" class="indent">South Hampshire Rapid Transit System; and</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/7" class="indent">Leeds Supertram.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/8">Bids have also been received for Merseytram Line 2 and extensions to the Nottingham Express Transit. The Department is also in discussions with promoters about further extensions to the Midland Metro, Sheffield Supertram, Tyne and Wear Metro, Merseytram, Manchester Metrolink.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/9">Currently the Department's approach to the assessment of appraisals of light rail schemes includes:</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/10" class="indent">Promoters of major local transport schemes submit their bids for central funds as part of their Local Transport Plan (LTP).</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/11" class="indent">The business case supporting the bid should be written in accordance with the Department's New Approach to Appraisal (NATA), details of which can be found on the Department's appraisal website: <a href="http://www.webtag.org.uk">www.webtag.org.uk</a>. NATA involves assessing the impact of the proposal against the Government's five objectives for transport: economy, safety, integration, accessibility, and the environment. The NATA approach includes the analysis of both monetised and non-monetised costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/12" class="indent">The Department's officials examine the case presented for funding, including the benefits, costs, risks, affordability and public acceptability. This usually requires a period of dialogue with the promoters in addition to the information submitted through the written business case.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/13" class="indent">The Department issues guidance to promoters of schemes to help them prepare a business case that meets the Department's requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/14" class="indent">A pre-procurement business case is needed to secure Provision View for funding, which is dependent on the necessary statutory powers being obtained, and the scheme design or costs not changing substantially as a result of further work to obtain powers and the procurement process.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/15" class="indent">Once statutory powers have been obtained and tender received from bidders an updated business case is needed if details of the scheme have changed to secure Full Approval for scheme funding.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.5/16">The Department leaves the choice of procurement method to the promoter of a scheme, although on larger schemes it will usually consult with the promoter on the approach being taken from an early stage. Promoters may present a case for PFI or capital funding via the same business case process. Capital funding for public transport schemes is usually split between section 56 grant and borrowing approvals.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.5/1">The Department of Transport commissioned TRL in the early 1990s to undertake two trials to investigate the effectiveness of using 'Chevron' guidance markings on the road surface to encourage motorists to maintain a safe distance from one another. The research showed that they were effective in reducing vehicles following too closely. The chevron markings and their associated signs are prescribed in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002.</p>

However, the Director of Civil Nuclear Security publishes an annual report on the state of security in the civil nuclear industry and the effectiveness of security regulation, and meets me to discuss this. His next report is due this summer.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.5/1">The DTI provides the UK Governor to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and through membership of the IAEA Board of Governors the UK takes a full part in considering the implementation and development of IAEA safeguards. Since weaknesses in the then existing system of safeguards were exposed in the early 1990s, I am advised the IAEA has developed new and powerful safeguards measures, in particular to strengthen its ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities in non-nuclear weapon states. Such measures include those specified in the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards agreements, approved by the Board of Governors in May 1997. The UK has fully supported the work of the IAEA in this regard and our assessment continues to be that its safeguards verification activities are the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and that a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement in combination with an additional protocol thereto, should be considered the new verification standard for non-nuclear weapon states under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

	<p pid=".321W.2/20">The decision on whether and how to investigate alleged criminal offences is an operational matter for the relevant chief officer of police. The decision will take account of national and local policing priorities as well as the resources available.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/21">We have recently boosted the resources available to police to tackle fraud. In the recent Green Paper on &quot;Policing, Building Safer Communities Together&quot;, we signalled our intention that some forces should develop expertise in certain specialist types of investigation and play a lead role in those areas. The City of London Police will become the first such lead force tackling fraud. The Home Office and the Corporation of London have each agreed to contribute &pound;1 million per year towards the cost of an expanded City of London Police fraud squad. The Home Office will also meet capital start-up costs of the new unit.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/22">This arrangement will allow the City of London Police to significantly expand its fraud squad enabling it to take a lead role in the investigation of fraud in London and the south east.

The Home Office has also recently launched a website to combat internet fraud. The 'e-tailing mini site' forms part of the Crime Reduction website and provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves when using the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/24">The Home Office is also represented on an APACS led Steering Group which aims to tackle 'Card Not Present' (CNP) fraud. This includes fraud over the internet. We support practical measures being introduced by the industry to increase levels of security for internet transactions. These include Address Verification Services (AVS), Card Security Code (CSC), Mastercard Secure Code and Verified by Visa. There is also a manual (&quot;Spot &amp; Stop Card Fraud Retailer Pack&quot;) resulting from the CNP Steering Group's Work which aims to educate merchants on the dangers of CNP fraud and the steps which can be taken to prevent it.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/25">We are about to publish, jointly with APACS, a leaflet for members of the public to raise awareness about safe credit card use. The leaflet will include a section on using cards safely over the internet. Supplies of the leaflet are being sent to all police forces in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/26">The Home Office does not operate any specific support schemes for repeat victims of credit card fraud, however the schemes outlined above to tackle CNP fraud are already making a significant impact in preventing this type of fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".322W.2/1">There were 132,734 offences recorded in the Humberside police force area in 2002&ndash;03 which was an increase over the previous year. However, figures were affected by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) which Humberside adopted in April 2002. For total crime in this force, the Home Office estimated the NCRS had a 9 per cent. impact for 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/2">NCRS was introduced across England and Wales in April 2002. Broadly, the NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of crimes recorded by the police. Therefore, following the introduction of the Standard, numbers of recorded crimes are not directly comparable with previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".327W.5/2">The Investigation Support Section of the Prison Service Professional Standards Unit monitors all incidents in the prison service that result in formal investigations being commissioned. The main categories of investigations that record unprofessional behaviour of staff towards prisoners are racist abuse, inappropriate treatment of prisoners and assault on prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".327W.5/3">Monthly reports are prepared for Governors and Area Managers that include, for each prison; numbers of investigations carried out, categories of investigations, overdue investigations and emerging themes.</p>
	<p pid=".327W.5/4">Wormwood Scrubs operates systems to ensure that any complaints of mistreatment from prisoners are referred to the Deputy Governor, who decides whether to commission a full investigation under the Prison Service Code of Discipline or conduct a simple inquiry for more minor issues. The Race Relations co-ordinator also reviews data from a wide range of sources to establish if any ethnic minority group is disproportionately represented. For the last three years, the number of complaints from prisoners within the above categories that resulted in investigations being commissioned at Wormwood Scrubs were:</p>

	<p pid=".329W.7/1">Extractives industries (including diamonds and uranium) should be the engines of growth and development in countries endowed with significant mineral resources, but too often the sector is associated with conflicts and corruption that derail progress towards sustainable development and poverty reduction. We believe that companies are responsible for not acting in a way that impairs the human rights of their employees or of those on whom their activities have an impact, and should act in a way that promotes their enjoyment of human rights. We also believe companies should act in a way which contributes to environmental progress with a view to achieving sustainable development. For that reason, we are actively engaged in initiatives to improve governance, including environmental and social management of the sector, while recognising that regulation of these industries is the responsibility of the host governments concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.7/2">For example, the Government is a founding participant in the process to develop and promote the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights in the extractives sector. The Voluntary Principles are designed to provide practical guidance that will strengthen human rights safeguards in company security arrangements. The Government also actively promote the UN Global Compact and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, both of which promote principles of business behaviour designed to ensure respect for human rights and protection of the environment.</p>

Many of these have now closed, having registered voters in their particular area. Voters are currently registering at 83 offices in these 8 regional centres.

	<p pid=".331W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-24">24 September 2002</phrase> the Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice for Cyprus read as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/2">&quot;Most visits to Cyprus are trouble-free.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/3" class="italic">Safety and security</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/4">Crimes against tourists are rare. Visitors should, however, safeguard passports, money and other valuables by using hotel safety deposit boxes.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/5">Be aware of strong seas and undertows. Always heed warning signs and swim only from approved beaches.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/6">Travellers are not generally at risk in Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/7" class="italic">Terrorism</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/8">There have been a number of car bombs in the Limassol area and Nicosia over the past few years. Although the perpetrators have not been identified, these activities are restricted for the most part to in-fighting amongst the criminal fraternity.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/9" class="italic">Local laws and customs</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/10">Cyprus has a strict zero tolerance policy towards drugs. Being caught in possession of any type of narcotic will usually lead to a prison sentence or a hefty fine.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/11">Driving standards in Cyprus are poor. Seat belts and crash helmets must be worn. You could be fined up to C&pound;500 if you are caught not wearing a seat belt.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/12">It is illegal to work in Cyprus without a work permit. Obtaining such a permit is the responsibility of the prospective employer. People caught working without a valid permit have received custodial sentences and large fines. Carefully check any suggested contract.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/13">When hiring a car, moped, boat, jet ski or other vehicle, you should check that it is road or sea worthy and that there is appropriate insurance cover, and safety equipment. Observe safety rules.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/14">Do not try to make fraudulent claims on your insurance policy. The police investigate such claims and prosecute tourists for this offence. Prison sentences and heavy fines have been imposed.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/15" class="italic">Entry requirements</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/16">A British passport holder does not need a visa prior to travelling to Cyprus. A tourist will be permitted to enter for a maximum period of three months.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/17" class="italic">Health</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/18">Cyprus and the UK do not have reciprocal health agreements and therefore all health care has to be paid for. As Cyprus is not a member of the European Union, the form E111 is not recognised. Adequate health insurance should be taken out prior to travelling to Cyprus, as hospital fees can be expensive. You will not normally be allowed to leave Cyprus if you have not settled your medical bill.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/19" class="italic">Visits to North Cyprus</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/20">The British Government does not recognise the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;. Visitors arriving in the north should not attempt to cross into the south. If they do, they are liable to arrest and possible imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/21">It is possible to travel to the north of Cyprus from the south by crossing at the United Nations-controlled Ledra Palace checkpoint in Nicosia. But tourists may only cross between 0800&ndash;1300 and must return by 1700 the same day. You may not take a hire car through the checkpoint, although it is possible to hire one once you have crossed into the north. Goods bought in the north may be confiscated at the checkpoint on return to the south.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/22" class="italic">Buying property</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/23">The non-recognition of the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot; and the possibility of a future political settlement in Cyprus could have implications for those considering buying property in the north. Before purchasing a property you are advised to apprise yourself fully of the situation and to seek legal advice.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/24" class="italic">General</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/25">Time-share operatives tout for business in Cyprus, especially in the Paphos area. Before signing a contract, you should read the small print very carefully. Under Cyprus law, you are entitled to a 15-day cooling off period, during which, if you change your mind, you should receive a full refund.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/26">We strongly recommend that all travellers abroad take out adequate comprehensive insurance.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/27" class="italic">Contact details</p>

The UK has not been asked for any extra-budgetary funds following this mission. The UK already contributes over &pound;11 million a year to UNESCO's regular budget, making us the fourth largest contributor.</p>
	<p pid=".335W.5/2">Within Kosovo, the UN mission in Kosovo is responsible for applying those provisions of the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property applicable outside of recognised armed conflict. Recent events in Kosovo give this responsibility even greater pertinence. 1 will visit Kosovo this week and I will make the point that that part of Europe's history deserves our special attention and protection. The UK's continued commitment to the Convention was made clear at the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in December 2003, where we co-signed a pledge supporting the 1954 Hague Convention with the Government of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.2/1">The Uzbek authorities have yet to conclude their investigations into the terrorist attacks in late March. Their preliminary findings appear to suggest that the perpetrators received training in camps outside Uzbekistan, and may have been influenced by the radical Islamist propaganda of Hizb ut-Tahrir. However, while we believe that this is certainly a possibility, we have yet to see convincing evidence that Hizb ut-Tahrir as an organisation advocates violence or terrorism. Nor are we aware of any co-operation between it and Al Qaeda.</p>
	<p pid=".337W.2/2">We strongly believe that a proportionate response is necessary in combating terrorism in order to avoid alienating wider sections of the population, and that permitting free expression of religious belief is the best means of combating the attractiveness to some of the more radical and extremist ideologies.</p>
	<p pid=".337W.2/3">In a press release issued on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March</phrase>, 1 stated that &quot;We condemn these appalling acts of violence and send our condolences to the families of those innocent victims. Terrorism is a menace which we face in common with countries around the world, and must combat in common. At the same time it is necessary to ensure that our responses are measured and proportionate, so that the disease is isolated and eliminated rather than faced with conditions where it is possible to spread further.&quot;We remain willing to receive additional information from the Uzbek authorities as their investigations continue, particularly concerning the alleged role of Hizb ut-Tahrir.</p>

This meant that some reservists did not know they were being paid or how much they were being paid. Late or non-delivery of pay statements was attributable to delays in the administrative process of taking the reservist on strength at the Theatre unit.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.3/3">This issue was identified during the Op Telic lessons identified process and action is in hand to improve the administrative systems in use. We have witnessed a significant improvement in the administrative process of taking the reservist on strength as units move into permanent infrastructure and improved communication links. In the main members of the TA called out for Op Telic 4 are now joining their respective units in their peacetime locations and administrative procedures are now being completed prior to deployment which minimises the shortcomings experienced with IT in Theatre.</p>

From this point ODPM used the Royal Coat of Arms and the words Office of the Deputy Prime Minister as the main part of its corporate identity and incurred no 'design' costs as such.

	<p pid=".346W.3/19">The SCO for DFGs is paid to local authorities to contribute towards 60 per cent. of local authority expenditure incurred on mandatory DFGs up to the limit of the allocation made to each local authority at the beginning of the financial year. Local authorities must find, from their own capital resources, funding for the remaining 40 per cent. of total DFG expenditure, 100 per cent. of any excess expenditure on mandatory DFGs above the allocation limit and any discretionary expenditure incurred by them in carrying out housing adaptations for disabled people. As DFG is a mandatory grant for eligible applicants, local authorities must make adequate financial provision within their budgets to meet these expenditure demands.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.3/20">Local authorities are asked to submit to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister every year, in the Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix to their Housing Investment Programme, their planned expenditure on mandatory DFG.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.3/21">The allocation of the national budget of SCG for DFGs to each region is made on the basis of a formula. This formula comprises indices constructed according to the number of people in each region in receipt of disability living allowance and attendance allowance and also an adjustment for the regional differences in building costs. These indices are updated annually. The allocation according to the formula is limited to the total amount that the authorities in each region have said they need to cover 60 per cent. of their planned expenditure on DFGs. If the formula allocates more than this amount the residual sum is reallocated to other regions in proportion to their need. For the 2004&ndash;05 allocations, a further damping mechanism was used to ensure that no region had a cut of more than 2 per cent. in its allocation compared with the previous year.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.3/22">Once the regional allocation of SCG has been established the allocation to individual local authorities is made by the Government Offices in each Region. 80 per cent. of the regional total is allocated using the same indices of need as for the regional allocation. The remaining 20 per cent. is allocated entirely at the discretion of the Government Office who can take into account any relevant local evidence of need and policy performance including an assessment of an authority's housing strategy and the role played by housing adaptations.</p>

The Government is in discussions with the Local Government Association on these matters and although licensing should be self financing it is proposed to set aside &pound;13 million to meet local authorities' start-up costs.</p>

	<p pid=".353W.6/1">The Housing Act 1996 made a range of provisions concerning the social rented sector (including the role of the Housing Corporation and tackling anti-social behaviour). It also covered the private rented sector (including the registration of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), and the creation of a system whereby Assured Shorthold Tenancies became the standard form of letting in the Private Rented Sector), leasehold reform and homelessness. No comprehensive assessment of the impact of the Act has been carried out. However its effects can be assessed from data provided by the Survey of English Housing. For example this has shown the proportion of households renting privately remaining static at around 10 per cent. of the housing market.</p>

	<p pid=".362W.3/1">The Tower Hamlets Housing Action Trust (HAT) has completed its work on budget (including &pound; 123 million of Government assistance) and one year ahead of its original completion target of March 2005. It has exceeded its original objectives for the building of new homes or the improvement of existing ones to the highest standards; ensuring effective, sensitive and responsive maintenance and management of homes; promoting diversity of tenure within the HAT's estates; and improving the economic, social and environmental conditions of the area, including improved jobs opportunities, youth and community facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.3/2">Nearly 1,000 new homes have been built. Only one tower block, and one sheltered housing scheme, are to remain&mdash;both of which will have been extensively refurbished by the end of the HAT programme.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.3/3">The high level of resident involvement has remained core to the HAT's ethos throughout its life. This included tenant involvement in the actual design of homes. The recent Quality of Life Survey showed that 60 per cent. of residents feel that levels of crime have gone down and community spirit and neighbourliness have risen.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.3/4">The HAT has also delivered, in partnership with the Bow People's Trust (BPT) and Old Ford Housing Association&mdash;and many other local agencies&mdash;a range of community and economic development initiatives to tackle the problems of social exclusion in the area. These initiatives include the Tower Hamlets Credit Union in Roman Road; the regeneration of the Roman Road Market; Growing Concerns&mdash;a community gardening project; a Construction Training Initiative for ethnic communities; a range of services for the elderly and support to local schools. A large area of open space is also being provided in the HAT area and a new Youth Centre will soon be built.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.3/5">The HAT has encouraged its successor organisations to continue its vision and ensure that the gains made locally in neighbourhood renewal are sustainable and beneficial to the whole community for the long term. To this end, the HAT has awarded an endowment of some &pound;3 million which will be used exclusively in the local area through the &quot;Action for Bow&quot; Trust Fund.</p>

It is estimated to contain some 2 per cent. of the land area of the south-east but over 17 per cent. of its currently available supply of previously developed land. In the period 1997&ndash;2000 an estimated 80 per cent. of new dwellings in the gateway were built on previously developed land, which is above the national target of 60 per cent. and the gateway strategy aims to at least maintain this trend. Detailed allocation of land for new development will be undertaken through the statutory plan-making process by local planning authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".373W.3/1">By 2004&ndash;05, financial support for children through tax credits, child benefit and other benefits will have increased by &pound;10.4 billion in real terms from its 1997 level, a rise of 72 per cent. The 2003 pre-Budget report announced a significant increase in the child element of child tax credit&mdash;up &pound;180 to &pound;1,625 a year from April 2004. Both the child element of child tax credit and child benefit are already paid in respect of each child in a household, according to income. The baby addition to the family element of child tax credit is intended to recognise the costs on the family of responsibility for a baby and as such is payable per family rather than per child. This and other structural design features of child tax credit will be kept under review, particularly in the light of the Government's commitment of halving child poverty by 2010.</p>

The published volume is available in the House of Commons Library and also on the National Statistics website at:<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/themejpopulation/PT115.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/themejpopulation/PT115.pdf</a>Information on how many dependent children live with (1) a parent who has never married, (2) a widowed parent, (3) a divorced parent or (4) a separated parent is not currently available from the 2001 Census for England and Wales. However, an analysis, based on results from the General Household Survey for Great Britain in 2000, estimated that, of all dependent children living in families: 9.1 per cent. were living with a never-married lone mother; 0.7 per cent. with a widowed lone mother; 7.1 per cent. with a divorced lone mother; and 5.1 per cent. with a separated lone mother. Corresponding estimates were not made for the proportions of all dependent children living in families who were living in lone father families, because of small sample numbers. Overall, 2.6 per cent. of all dependent children living in families were living in lone father families. These estimates are not comparable with those from the 2001 Census, since they relate to a different time, and cover the whole of Great Britain rather than England and Wales.The full results, published in an article in Population Trends 109, are available in the House of Commons Library and may also be seen on the National Statistics website at:<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme</a>   population/PT109.pdf</p>

	<p pid=".382W.2/4" class="indent">The ONS was created in 1995 from the merger of three smaller organisations. The new organisation inherited:</p>
	<p pid=".382W.2/5" class="indent">Different computer systems that are not fully compatible with each other and which are gradually becoming out-of-date and difficult to support.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.2/6" class="indent">Different statistical tools requiring a large quantity of software licenses and support.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.2/7" class="indent">Different methodologies and practices.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.2/8" class="indent">The objective of the Modernisation Programme is to relocate these disparate systems into a robust, shared and enduring technical environment, supported by an agreed set of common statistical tools and methods. Where necessary, this process will involve the redesign of statistical systems to ensure that the quality, accessibility and efficiency benefits are optimised. This will increase the value of ONS's statistics and also improve the service it can offer to customers.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.2/9" class="indent">In the Spending Review 2002, Her Majesty's Treasury allocated &pound;75 million over the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. Completion of the work package associated with this funding is therefore expected in 2006, although it is likely that further modernisation activity will take place in later years. The &pound;75million allocation included &pound;5million for 2003&ndash;04 to begin work, and undertake detailed planning and preparation, which has been done.</p>

In practice, a part of the calculation is a 'location factor' applied to the build costs. In the 2000 rating lists in England and Wales the highest location factor is 31.8 per cent. greater than the lowest. An addition of 5 per cent. is made to public conveniences in urban areas; this does not apply to rural public conveniences.</p>

All of these types of degradation cause a decline in the productivity of the land, reducing potential yields and posing a potential threat to the rural livelihoods of poor people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".388W.5/3">Existing estimates of the current global extent and severity of the problem of land degradation should be considered indicative at best: land degradation is something that cannot be easily monitored and measured. Responding to the need for a global overview of land degradation, the Global Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD), published in 1992, became the first comprehensive soil degradation overview on a world scale. Soil degradation is considered to be a good indicator for measuring land degradation.</p>
	<p pid=".388W.5/4">GLASOD is limited, however, and the need for more objective, qualitative approaches, using nationally-based data rather than global or regional figures, is widely recognised. New international initiatives are underway to develop national data acquisition on land degradation, using GIS (Geographic Information Systems), remote sensing and local assessments.</p>

	<p pid=".391W.5/1">The Government of the DRC recognises that there should be better management of natural resources, including forests, so as better to contribute to national development and poverty reduction. DFID plans to support the strengthening of natural resource governance in the DRC, including forestry. As a first step we are currently supporting an analysis of the governance framework for natural resource extraction and options for improvements. In the meantime the Government is receiving assistance in the forestry sector from the World Bank, and DFID officials have been in dialogue with the Bank about this work. There is a possibility that DFID will provide assistance in this area to support the Bank's programme.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.5/2">Commercial logging needs to bring real benefits to the population of the DRC, and the interests of the large number of forest-dependent poor people in DRC should not be prejudiced by logging activities. With World Bank encouragement the Government of the DRC has put a moratorium on new forestry concessions until appropriate regulations are in place to govern the process. The World Bank is also supporting a review of previously allocated concessions, to ensure they meet the new forest code which includes provisions to ensure the rights of local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.5/3">DFID is also supporting the involvement of civil society in Central African countries to follow up on the Africa Forest Law Enforcement and Governance Conference that took place last year. In addition, the EU aims to develop partnership agreements with individual countries under its Action Plan to strengthen forest governance in the Central African region.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.5/1">These projects are being implemented by the European Commission under their MEDA (&quot;M&eacute;sures d'Accompagnement&quot;) programme, which is the principal financial instrument of the European Union for providing technical and financial support to accompany the reform of economic and social structures in Mediterranean partner countries. DFID is involved through having attributed to our budget the UK's contribution to MEDA, (which in 2002 amounted to around 19 per cent. of the total), and through our being consulted by the EC as it develops its individual country strategies and spending proposals. Implementation of individual projects (including procurement) is the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.5/2">When considering Commission funding proposals, DFID takes a wide range of factors into consideration, including likely impact, cost-effectiveness and value for money. Many of the 2002 projects are still in the early stages of implementation. An assessment of the projects, and production of final spending figures, will only be possible once they have been completed.</p>

	<p pid=".398W.0/1">Good governance and economic growth are crucial requirements for poverty reduction in Africa. Our experience and research shows that broad based economic growth and poverty reduction can only be sustained where there is effective government. Investment is vital for growth and businesses will only invest if they feel confident that they will benefit from successful investment and perceive the risks of expropriation to be low. The priorities for improving the business environment will depend on country context.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.0/2">DFID has not made any country specific assessment of the relationship between good governance and economic productivity in either Guinea or Senegal. Our assistance to both these countries is mainly through multilateral channels such as the EC and World Bank. In Senegal our assistance through these channels amounted to &pound;13 million in 2001. In Guinea we are closely in touch with the EC who are starting negotiations with Guinea on necessary governance reforms, as a condition of resumption of EC assistance. There is a clear connection between such reforms and economic development.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.8/1">The number of international NGOs present in much of Iraq has been low for some months because of security concerns. However, some continue to operate using Iraqi or Arabic staff, and there are a large number of emerging Iraqi NGOs and more international NGOs are present in Kurdish areas. After the handover of sovereignty, and with the return of the UN, it is possible that international NGOs might increase their presence, but this will mainly depend on the security situation.</p>

DFID's staff in Nairobi also maintain a close dialogue with the Kenyan Government on these issues.

	<p pid=".404W.9/1">DFID's primary concern is poverty reduction and helping to bring about sustainable development for more than one billion people who are trying to live on less than one dollar a day. While bushmeat is an important source of food and livelihoods for many poor people, particularly those living in or close to forests, the bulk of bushmeat harvesting is not traded across national boundaries and less than 1 per cent. of the harvest is thought to comprise endangered species. DFID is concerned that the steady decline in the supply of bushmeat is having a negative impact on the livelihoods of poor people.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.9/2">The Government has set up an Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group on International Biodiversity to ensure that our response to biodiversity issues, including bushmeat, is as effective as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.0/1">The Government and our EU partners are seriously concerned about the new restrictions placed on the entry of humanitarian goods and services to Gaza, and have made strong representations to the Israeli Government to ease the situation. While DFID respects Israel's legitimate security needs, it is essential that these are addressed in a manner which minimises interference with the work of international organisations, humanitarian bodies and diplomats. 600,000 Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip are dependent on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's food aid programme. This programme has been suspended as a consequence of current Israeli restrictions. Until the situation is resolved it will cause further suffering for communities struggling to cope with prolonged economic hardship.</p>

	<p pid=".408W.2/1">All spending by the European Community is subject to rigorous review, evaluation and audit procedures. The European Court of Auditors is responsible for appropriate audit of EC programmes, including programmes in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".408W.2/2">Concerns about the exchange rate used by the European Commission were raised in a report of the European Court of Auditors. DFID's understanding is that those concerns were limited to part of the spending of the European Development Fund (EOF) that was converted into Zimbabwe dollars during 2002. Humanitarian aid, which is largely funded from the EU budget rather than the EOF, was therefore not affected. Humanitarian aid is in any case very largely used to procure food and other goods outside Zimbabwe and would not be converted into Zimbabwe dollars. The European Commission's view is that use of any other exchange rate would have contravened either Zimbabwean law or the EC's international obligations.</p>
