	<p pid=".469W.3/1">Capital expenditure by London Underground Ltd. (LUL), financed by its own borrowing, would increase public sector net borrowing. It would not increase general Government net borrowing because LUL is a public corporation: these are outside general Government but inside the public sector.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.3/2">In accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, capital invested in London Underground (LUL) by the private sector would not count as public expenditure, and would not be included in the public sector net borrowing, if LUL's accountants and auditors judged that the assets should be off LUL's balance sheet. If the accountants judged it was on balance sheet then it would count as public expenditure and be included in public sector net borrowing. The PPP saves &pound;2 billion of public money over the first 15 years of the contracts, in comparison to funding the same projects through conventional public investment. The plans will mean &pound;16 billion of investment over the next 15 years.</p>

	<p pid=".472W.5/1">The FSA already draw the attention of annuitants to the advantages of the open market option in their explanatory material for those buying a pension annuity.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.5/2">In addition, the FSA has consulted recently on proposals that firms should be obliged to tell their personal pensions customers, at an appropriate time before their retirement, that their annuities can be bought from a different provider firm. This proposal is designed to ensure that consumers are made aware of their right to shop around to get the best annuity deal on offer to suit their circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.5/3">The FSA's consultation process (which started in August 2001) recently closed. The FSA plans to publish the results of the exercise, with its decisions on next steps, shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.5/4">The Association of British Insurers (ABI) issued, also in August 2001, a &quot;Statement of Good Practice for Pension Maturities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.5/5">The ABI standards give further detail about how in practice provider firms offering pension saving and income products should communicate with their customers. The guidelines should ensure that customers are more aware of the choices available to them when they begin their retirement, and are thus able to make more educated choices.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.5/6">The Modernising Annuities consultation paper published by the Inland Revenue and Department for Work and Pensions in February 2002 also explains how exercising the open market option can help pensioners get better value from their pension savings. It discusses how those benefits might be more widely understood, and whether there are any further steps that might be taken to encourage people to use the open market option. The Government are keen that those with an interest think creatively about this and other ways that the annuities market might be made to work better, and would encourage those with views to submit responses to the consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".475W.0/1">As part of Spending Review 2000, the Government decided to make available up to &pound;12 million over the three years 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 for assistance to Russia with chemical weapon demilitarisation and biological non-proliferation projects. We have given priority to assistance with chemical weapons destruction, where we plan to support the provision of infrastructure which is needed for the construction and operation of the major chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye. An essential pre-requisite to allow this work to proceed was negotiation of a legally-binding agreement with the Russian Federation. Following extensive negotiations, I signed the agreement in London on <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase> on behalf of the Government. Dr. Pak, Director-General of the Russian Munitions Agency, signed on behalf of the Russian Federation. We hope to conclude negotiations shortly on the necessary Implementation Arrangement which will allow our first project to proceed in the near future, subject to agreement of contract. Our first project will be to provide a water supply for the destruction facility, which will also benefit the local population. As a result of the need first to complete these sets of negotiations, it has not yet been possible to start implementation of assistance projects. Expenditure of some &pound;250K has been incurred to date on setting up the assistance programme.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.0/2">Verification of the destruction of chemical weapons in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention is the responsibility of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in the Hague. There are no agreed provisions for the verification of biological weapons.</p>

	<p pid=".483W.5/1">The Commission originally proposed large cuts for a wide range of total allowable catches, in many cases going further than science would justify. At the December Fisheries Council, after lengthy negotiations, we achieved an outcome which closely followed the scientific advice. This did not avoid severe measures where they were justified but met the UK's criticisms of what the Commission had proposed.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.5/1">We are broadly on track to meet our policy objectives for carbon monoxide, benzene, 1,3 butadiene, lead and sulphur dioxide, but we will need to do more to meet our targets for nitrogen dioxide, particles and ozone. Emissions of most pollutants have fallen over the last decade, and levels of air pollution are falling steadily in most urban areas of the UK. The headline air quality indicator, which gives the total number of days of poor air quality recorded each year through our national monitoring network, shows a steady reduction in the total number of days of poor urban air quality from 59 days in 1993 (when the dataset began) to 21 days in 2001. The pattern in rural areas is less clear since the main pollutant in rural areas is ozone, which is strongly influenced by the weather and by emissions of ozone precursors in continental Europe.</p>

	<p pid=".492W.5/2">In Great Britain, there are already legal requirements to fit top-speed limiters to goods vehicles, buses and coaches weighing more than 7.5 tonnes maximum permitted weight. These measures are more extensive than is currently required by existing European Union law. A proposal currently under consideration by the European Parliament and the Council Ministers would extend the European requirement to buses and coaches with more than eight passenger seats irrespective of weight, and to goods vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes maximum permitted weight. We are not convinced that the safety and environmental consequences of fitting limiters to lighter vehicles would be beneficial&mdash;bunching of vehicles could cause added congestion and create safety hazards&mdash;and voted against the proposal when it was considered by the Transport Council in December last. The proposal is, however, likely to be adopted later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".497W.5/5">The criteria are set out in the Department's Guidance 0580/2001: &quot;The Protection of School Playing Fields and Land for City Academies&quot;. The criteria enable the Secretary of State to take into account the team game playing field provision at other local schools. This is to ensure that where there are surplus fields at one school, other local schools are given the opportunity to use those surplus fields. As part of the schools' needs criterion, applicants are asked to say what impact the proposed disposal will have on the curriculum, and to demonstrate clearly how the curriculum will continue to be met if consent is given.</p>

Sustained closures continue to restrict the free movement of people and essential supplies between the Occupied Territories and Israel and other countries, as well as within the Occupied Territories. The suffocation of the Palestinian economy, growing unemployment and the disruption of public service and normal social activity in the territories can only fuel hatred and violence. The lifting of closures form part of the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee report. We have expressed our serious concerns to the Israeli Government on political, legal and humanitarian grounds, and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".512W.6/20">The purpose of each instrument is described in its explanatory note.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/21">There are no separately identifiable costs for the following statutory instruments to public funds, businesses or individuals, but I expect it to be minimal in each case:</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/22" class="indent">SI 2001/1400</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/23" class="indent">SI 2001/1456</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/24" class="indent">SI 2001/2478</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/25" class="indent">SI 2001/2748</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/26" class="indent">SI 2001/3504</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/27" class="indent">SI 2001/1748</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/28" class="indent">SI 2001/1750</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/29" class="indent">SI 2001/2817.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.6/30">Most of the costs of implementing the remaining instruments are not separately identifiable and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Voting devices for blind voters introduced by SI 2001/497 were provided centrally for the UK parliamentary election in Scotland in 2001 at a cost of &pound;46,300. Other costs incurred by returning officers under SI 2001/497 and SI 2001/1399 can be reclaimed through the relevant Returning Officers' Charges Order. No extra provision has been made within the local government public expenditure plans for electoral registration officers implementing the new measures introduced by SI 2001/497, SI 2001/1749 and SI 2001/1399.</p>

The Prison Service monitors young offender institutions and other establishments by means of some 60 performance standards. Independent Boards of Visitors are present in all establishments, whose members have a right to visit all parts of the establishment at any time of day or night. Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons inspects establishments on a regular cycle and also makes unannounced visits. Prisoners and young offenders may make complaints to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. An operational area manager at Assistant Director level was appointed on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>, specifically to oversee the juvenile estate. A unit in Prison Service headquarters disseminates information about the Human Rights Act and monitors challenges under the Act. All these activities take account of human rights among other matters but the costs cannot be separately identified.</p>

Violent crime recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of real changes in the level of victimisation.</p>

	<p pid=".517W.5/2">It is already Home Office policy to encourage the publication of the findings of research licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, which assesses and advises on licence applications made under the 1986 Act, uses a range of resources to keep abreast of developments and results in research. The scientific community also maintains and uses databases to the same end.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.5/3">However, the establishment of a mandatory central database for this purpose would be problematic. There would, in particular, be significant difficulties in ensuring the completeness and quality of the data and in ensuring that intellectual or commercial confidentiality were not compromised.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.5/4">We believe that there is scope for further reducing the risk of duplication in the use of animals in scientific procedures by encouraging companies to share data. To this end, in August 2000, we announced an inter- departmental concordat on data sharing to enable Government Departments to reduce the duplication of tests on animals. The concordat commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourage data sharing between clients and thereby reduce animal tests. Progress in implementing the concordat will be reviewed in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.5/5">Moreover, there are a number of international and national initiatives to encourage data sharing. Most recent European directives under which regulatory work is done provide for the sharing of data. International assessment programmes have well-established and effective methods for data sharing, ensuring mutual acceptance of data and dissemination of information on chemicals. This also extends to dissemination of data to developing countries.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.2/2">The use of alternatives is widely encouraged and the use of animals in regulated procedures is prohibited by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in cases where a scientifically valid non-animal alternative is available. Any lack of progress in research into alternatives is more often due to the limitations of science rather than inadequate funding.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/3">Most work on alternatives is neither done by Government nor with Government money, as industry spends many millions of pounds each year on the search for and development of alternatives. None the less, every year the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee a budget for research aimed at developing or promoting the use of alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used, or refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering. Details of completed research projects are published in the annual report of the Animal Procedures Committee, which is available from The Stationery Office. The amount made available to the Committee for 2001&ndash;02 for this specific purpose has increased to &pound;280,000.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/4">This is not the only money spent by the Government on the development of alternatives, as other Departments are also active in this area. Indeed, it is estimated that the total spent by the United Kingdom Government is in the region of &pound;2 million each year. To take this further on an international level, we will continue to support the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) through contributions to the European Union.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.5/1">No formal assessment of the effect of the working time directive has been undertaken but it forms part of the Department's drive to reduce long-hours working by its staff. The Home Office is committed to achieving a proper work life balance for all staff as one part of its plans for greater diversity. Guidance to staff issued in November 2001 highlighted the requirements of the directive and emphasised the importance the Department places upon ensuring that employees are not required to work excessively long hours and the steps that managers should be taking to reduce them. Standard terms and conditions for staff employed by the Home Office are well within the limits set by the Working Time Regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.5/2">Centrally held records show that 83 Home Office staff have signed voluntary waivers, indicating that they have agreed to work in excess of 48 hours per week, averaged over a 17 week period. Records of staff signing these waivers in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and the Home Office agencies are not currently available centrally though the information is held locally.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.2/1">The Council Document referred to reports on the achievements of the Tampere action plan, when Heads of State and Government agreed, at Tampere in October 1999, to an ambitious programme of measures, which amplify and supplement the Amsterdam Treaty obligations but serve also to support the Treaty goal of creating an &quot;area of freedom, security and justice&quot;. One of the areas for action is the Union-wide fight against international organised crime. The Police Chiefs Task Force (PCTF) was established to redress the problem that there was no forum in which senior police officers could decide to launch police operations against organised crime on the basis of Europol analyses.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.2/2">The task force has met on four occasions. Work still needs to be done to ensure that it focuses on the planning and execution of actual law enforcement operations at Union level, though these operations need not involve all member states. We also need to ensure that the task force is adequately supported, and that it has a defined place within the institutional architecture of the European Union. This could mean it having a similar role and status to the existing working groups, such as that on Police Co-operation and Europol. The possibility that Europol, as well as providing intelligence could also provide a secretariat, serving both the Europol Management Board and the PCTF is being examined.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.2/1">Paragraph 40 of the conclusions of the Laeken Council identifies areas in which further work is needed in order to progress towards a common European Union immigration and asylum policy. It was agreed at the Tampere Council in October 1999 that measures to ensure the fair treatment of third country nationals, including measures to tackle discrimination and racism and xenophobia, should form part of such a policy. Key developments in implementing the Tampere Conclusions in this respect have included the adoption by the Council of two equal treatment directives in June 2000 and November 2000 respectively and the adoption of a Council Decision in November 2000 on a Community Action Programme (2001&ndash;06) to support member states' efforts in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/2">The Community Action Programme will explore practical ways of overcoming the barriers created by discrimination in many areas of everyday life by comparing and contrasting experiences in different parts of the European Union. The programme will work with national, local and regional bodies, social partners, non-governmental organisations, universities and research institutes, national statistical offices and the media on issues such as equality in public administration and the media, equal participation in political, economic and social life; equal access to housing, transport, culture, leisure, sport etc., and the monitoring and mainstreaming of anti-discrimination policies.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/3">The Council has also recently started to consider a Commission proposal for a Framework Decision on combating racist crime.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.5/1">The Laeken European Council concluded that holding more frequent meetings of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Ministers would help to overcome delays in implementing the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999. The Government attach great importance to the implementation of the Tampere European Council's conclusions and support more frequent meetings of JHA ministers provided that such meetings are focused on resolving obstacles to agreement on key measures in the Tampere programme. We also consider that two-day JHA Council meetings should be the exception rather than the rule.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.5/2">The legislative work programme agreed at the Tampere European Council is substantial. Measures under negotiation in the Council are subject to scrutiny by Parliament, and some will require domestic legislation to implement. The increasing volume of justice and home affairs business at European Union level will have implications of our Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".521W.2/1">The Commission Green Paper on Criminal Law protection of financial interests of the Community and the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor was published in December 2001. Its purpose is to launch a wide-ranging public debate about the possible creation of a European Public Prosecutor, responsible for investigating and prosecuting cases of fraud against the Community budget. Member states have been asked to provide responses to the paper by <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-01">1 June 2002</phrase>, and the Commission intends to hold a public hearing for interested parties in 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".521W.5/1">Council Document 11896&ndash;01 contains a proposal to amend Article 40.1 and 40.7 of the Schengen Convention. It is currently under negotiation within the Justice and Home Affairs Council and has been deposited for scrutiny by the European Scrutiny Committees of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".521W.5/2">The purpose of the proposed amendments is to remove existing restrictions to the operation of cross-border surveillance between participating member states. The proposal would amend Article 40.1 to allow cross-border surveillance not only of the person suspected of having taken part in an extraditable criminal offence but also of other persons in the context of the criminal investigation. Article 40.7 would be amended to extend the list of extraditable offences for which cross-border surveillance may be carried out. Adoption of the proposal will be subject to unanimity. The United Kingdom (UK) broadly supports the amendment. Implementation in the UK will be subject to the requirements of Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) and practical operation will be subject to UK police control.</p>
	<p pid=".521W.5/3">The terms in which the UK will participate in certain areas of the Schengen Convention are set out in the council decision of <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-29">29 May 2000</phrase> (2000/365/EC). The UK will participate in Article 40 of the Schengen Convention and under the terms of Article 8 of the decision of <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-29">29 May 2000</phrase>, the UK is participating in the adoption of the amendment.

	<p pid=".522W.2/2">The Immigration Acts do not at present provide for adverse inferences to be drawn from behaviour such as absconding or escaping from a removal centre. However, in the case of persons who were held pending removal, their removal could of course proceed once they are apprehended. Individuals who have outstanding applications or appeals would be detained pending the outcome of those matters. In the case of individuals who remain at large, the consideration of any outstanding asylum applications would proceed on the basis of the information available and this could well result in refusal. Similarly, appellants who fail to attend the hearing of their appeals would damage their chances at appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/3">Under the new arrangements set out in the White Paper, &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain&quot;, all asylum seekers will be expected to comply fully with the more managed systems that are being put in place. If they do not do so, it will adversely affect the credibility of their claim for asylum and will increase the chances of their claim being refused.</p>

These indicate the type of each property, but do not record information about the occupiers of those properties. Sporting properties are identified by a number of categories, including bowling greens, clubhouses, cricket grounds/pitches, pavilions, golf courses, polo grounds, sports grounds, tennis courts/clubs, football grounds, football pitches, rugby union grounds. However, the rating lists do not show whether or not the occupiers of those properties are non-profit making sports bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.6/3">The proposals on rate relief for voluntary sports clubs in the White Paper &quot;Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot;, follow consultation in the Green Paper, &quot;Modernising Local Government Finances&quot;, which was published in September 2000. They are based on discussions with sports representative bodies and representations from many individual sports clubs. The White Paper proposals also take account of the decision of the Charity Commission, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-30">30 November 2001</phrase>, to recognise community amateur sports clubs for charitable status. Both the White Paper proposals on rates and the Charity Commission announcement took account of evidence proved by the sports bodies and other sports clubs.</p>

	<p pid=".531W.3/1">Employer Direct is a new service that enables employers to notify job vacancies to the Department using a unique telephone number. It provides a more efficient and effective service, available for longer hours than previously when employers notified vacancies through their local jobcentres.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.3/2">Employer Direct is still under development. However, evidence from an earlier pilot suggests that it does attract more vacancies and that the information collected about those vacancies is more comprehensive and clear, thus presenting unemployed people with a wider and better choice of job vacancies. The Department began to collect statistics about the number of calls to Employer Direct in March 2001. Since then, over 875,000 calls have been received by this telephone helpline (figures correct to the end of December 2001).</p>

	<p pid=".531W.6/1">Public toilets have not traditionally been a feature in Jobcentres and Benefits Agency offices. However staff are sympathetic to the needs of customers, especially those with children, and can and do make staff toilets available where possible. This position has been reviewed with the introduction of the Jobcentre Plus Pathfinder offices, and the generic design includes the provision of toilets for both disabled and able-bodied customers. However, space limitations in the 56 recently completed Pathfinder offices has meant that the provision of toilets has not been possible in most sites.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.6/2">The new Jobcentre Plus design and layout is being evaluated and we will endeavour to ensure that the provision of toilets becomes a more prominent and consistent feature.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.6/3">The presence of children in Jobcentre/Jobcentre Plus offices has been an increasing consideration in their design over recent years, especially since the introduction of the new deal for lone parents. All public Employment Service offices have acknowledged this presence in the design of furniture components with rounded edges and concealed cable management arrangements. Child facilities have not traditionally been a feature in Benefits Agency offices.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.6/4">However the introduction of Jobcentre Plus has allowed for this need to be further addressed. Many of the Pathfinders have children's play tables installed both in waiting areas and adjacent to the parent adviser desks. These allow for parents and guardians to participate in interviews with less distraction while still keeping a close eye on the children. Customer waiting times have been reduced by arranging timed appointments for advisory interviews.</p>

	<p pid=".535W.0/1">Housing benefit and council tax benefit (HB/CTB) are income-related benefits and entitlement is calculated by looking at an individual's circumstances and income. HB/CTB claims from people who are joint tenants are treated in the same way as any other HB/CTB claim. It is a long-standing principle of the benefits system that where a person is a member of a married couple, or of an unmarried couple who are living together as husband and wife, the income and circumstances of their partner are taken into account when considering income-related benefit entitlement.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.2/1">In autumn 2000 a substantial package of measures to help carers was announced. This amounts to over &pound;500 million of extra support in the first three years covered by the announcement.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/2">It includes a number of improvements to the main carer benefits aimed in particular at helping older and poorer carers, as well as helping carers to keep in touch with work by making part-time employment more worthwhile financially.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/3">The package also included measures to remove the barrier that prevents people aged 65 or over from claiming invalid care allowance; ensure entitlement to ICA will continue for up to eight weeks after the death of the disabled person; and rename ICA as &quot;carer's allowance&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".541W.2/1">The national service framework for older people was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-27">27 March 2001</phrase>. It sets new national standards and service models of care across health and social services for all older people whether they live at home, in residential care or are being cared for in hospital. The NSF recognises the role of chiropody/ podiatry services in that:</p>
	<p pid=".541W.2/2" class="indent">chiropody/podiatry is a service which is important to older people as it assists in maintaining mobility and independence. There is concern that ageism/age discrimination may take the form of low overall levels of provision to this care group.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.2/3" class="indent">specialised falls services which are established should include chiropodists/podiatrists.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.2/4" class="indent">specialist mental health services for older people should have agreed working and referral arrangements with chiropodists and podiatrists. and it sets a performance measure for numbers/rates of people aged 75+ who access chiropody/podiatry services.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.2/5">We published standards for the diabetes NSF in December 2001. The delivery strategy will follow in summer 2002, with the 10-year implementation programme to begin in April 2003. Milestones for delivery, including workforce, will be based on the available resources. The strategy will be informed by the work of the long-term conditions care group workforce team, which will be taking a national view of the workforce implications of the standards and intervention. The workforce team has a podiatrist in its membership to ensure consideration of chiropody/podiatry requirements and contribute to these care groups.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.2/6">Podiatrists have been members of the external reference groups for both these NSFs.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.2/1">In the NHS Plan we announced new investment in intermediate care and associated services rising to &pound;900 million a year by 2003&ndash;04. In addition, we shall be targeting additional resources, rising to &pound;360 million a year by 2003&ndash;04, to tackle the anomalies and inequities of the present funding system for long-term care. These include free nursing care in nursing homes for current self-funders which was introduced from October 2001. This will benefit around 42,000 people by around &pound;5,000 p.a. A system of deferred payments has been introduced to avoid people having to sell their homes when they first enter residential care. Since April last year, the value of a property has been disregarded for 12 weeks when undertaking the residential care means test. In addition, the Government have established a new independent national body, the National Care Standards Commission, which will regulate social care services, and private and voluntary healthcare from April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/2">The Government do not accept the royal commission's recommendation that all personal care should be provided free of charge. It would cost more than &pound;1 billion a year to make all forms of personal care free. Spending money in this way would not help improve the quality and range of services for users of long-term care nor would it help achieve stability for providers, which are our priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.8/1">Patient surveys identify ready access to primary care as a key issue and the NHS Plan sets a target that by 2004 all patients will be able to see a primary care professional within 24 hours or a GP within 48 hours if they choose to do so. From September 2001 we have been using quarterly telephone surveys of GP practices to monitor progress towards delivery of this target. The results of these surveys indicate that on a national basis the interim milestone for March 2002 of 60 per cent. compliance will be achieved. Detailed and reliable data are not available in all the formats requested, but surveys to date do also suggest that the milestone will be achieved within the Leeds health area.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.8/2">Further progress towards the target will be supported in 2002&ndash;03 by an earmarked increase of &pound;83.5 million in the PCT Primary Care Access Fund to &pound;168 million and by expanding the capacity of the National Primary Care Development Team.</p>

	<p pid=".549W.2/3">72 local councils submitted their local multi-agency codes of practice to the Department of Health by the <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-31">31 October 2001</phrase> deadline.

	<p pid=".549W.2/4">The Department has no immediate plans for a formal review of the implementation of the &quot;No Secrets&quot; guidance but the matter will be considered when the findings of the analysis of local codes of practice are available.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/5">The Department publicised the &quot;No Secrets&quot; guidance through a series of six, one-day workshops in Leeds and London, from November 2000 through to March 2001. The workshops encouraged representatives from all statutory agencies to discuss issues such as reporting and referral systems for inter-agency working. A number of local councils have publicised the launch of their multi-agency codes of practice. &quot;No Secrets&quot; requires local councils to develop local reporting and referral systems for inter-agency working in their codes of practice.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.2/1">Many factors affect the safety of food including chemical, radiological and microbiological contamination. Nutrition and other issues may also affect whether an individual is following a safe diet. Research on food safety is therefore correspondingly diverse both in the nature of the research and its funding. Direct Government funding of the research is through the research councils and the Food Standards Agency while other funds are also available through the academic funding system. In addition, the food industry itself funds food safety research either directly or through industrial levies or in LINK schemes with, for example, DEFRA.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.8/12" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".550W.8/13">1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.8/14">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.8/15">3. The expenditure is the total spent on commissioning healthcare by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of drugs expenditure in 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.8/16">4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&ndash;01 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.8/17">5. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialties which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also distort the figures so the results are therefore not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".551W.2/2">The recent Audit Commission report on day surgery showed that in some trusts minor procedures are often treated in day surgery units while they could be carried out in treatment rooms or out-patient departments. This leads to surgery patients having to wait longer for their operations or having them as in-patients. As part of the day surgery strategy, Professor Darzi will be looking to ensure that day case procedures are undertaken in day surgery units.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.2/3">General practitioners already carry out minor procedures in their surgeries, but there is the potential for more to be undertaken. Providing these services in the community gives patients better access to treatment, and reduces the time they would have to wait for the procedure. For these reasons the NHS plan provides that by 2004 there will be up to 1,000 specialist GPs taking referrals from fellow GPs for conditions in certain specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology. The Department is working with the Royal College of General Practitioners in developing this initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".552W.2/3">The Institute for Environment and Health undertook a study for the Health and Safety Executive in 1998. Copies of the report &quot;Chrysotile and its substitutes: a critical evaluation&quot; is available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.2/4">The report stated that white asbestos at high enough exposures could cause asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. It also confirmed that this type was often contaminated with other higher risk types such as blue brown asbestos. It judged three substitutes to be less harmful, polyvinyl alcohol, aramid and cellulose. The report recognised that exposure to white asbestos will arise from asbestos-containing materials in buildings. While it indicated that exposure would be lower than in manufacturing, it was a persistent problem that would remain for many years to come. It therefore recommended wherever practicable the safer substitutes should be used.</p>

	<p pid=".553W.3/1">We welcome the report &quot;Reinvigorating Democracy? Mayoral Referendums in 2001&quot; which the Electoral Commission published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-01">1 February 2002</phrase>. We said in the recent Local Government White Paper, &quot;Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot; that we would learn from the lessons of the first round of mayoral referendums, in order to refine and improve the process. The Electoral Commission's report is an important contribution to that work.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/2">The Government share the Commission's view of the importance of electors understanding fully what they are voting on and having unbiased, factual information on the issues surrounding the introduction of executive arrangements involving a directly-elected mayor.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/3">It was following the recommendations of the Fifth Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life that we made provision in the Local Authorities (Conduct of Referendums) (England) Regulations 2001, which were approved by Parliament, to prohibit councils from undertaking proactive information campaigns within 28 days of a referendum. We note the Commission's conclusion that this may be preventing full information reaching electors on the issues, in the circumstances of mayoral referendums where often there are no well- defined &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; campaign groups.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/4">Accordingly we will be reviewing with the Electoral Commission and others, whether this prohibition should be relaxed. Any relaxation would need to include safeguards to maintain strict impartiality. The Electoral Commission has suggested that the text of such material be cleared with them in advance. We welcome that the Electoral Commission are considering how they might provide electors in authorities holding mayoral referendums with factual and impartial material, pending the outcome of the review of the 28-day prohibition.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/5">We believe that the involvement by the Electoral Commission will meet the concerns of some, which were noted in the Commission's report, that the current wording of the referendum question, that Parliament had approved, could not be relied upon to guarantee a result which fairly and accurately reflected local electors' views. Accordingly we see no grounds for Government intervention to seek to postpone any referendum that local authorities are, or will be, planning to hold, including those as a result of a petition by electors.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/6">We believe that the current question specified in regulations, developed following extensive consultation, is fair and clear. Nevertheless, we are pleased to accept the Electoral Commission's invitation to work with them to see if the text of the referendum question itself can be improved so that all will be satisfied that it is clear and free from any potential bias. We recognise that while we are actively working with the Commission on possible changes to the question and the rules on the provision of information, it may be perceived as wrong for Government to take any decision on whether or not to direct the holding of a referendum. We do not therefore intend to take any more decisions until after we have completed this work. We expect to complete the work by summer 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/7">We had indicated that the Secretary of State was minded to direct mayoral referendums in Bradford and Birmingham on the grounds that councils in these areas have not had due regard to the outcome of the consultation they have been required to carry out. The Secretary of State remains so minded but has decided to await the outcome of our further work with the Commission before coming to final decisions on whether or not to use his powers of direction in these cases. My Department is writing to these councils setting out in full our position on directing them to hold a referendum, in the light of the representation we have received.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/8">We also welcome the other suggestions the Electoral Commission makes for councils to improve how referendums are run. My Department will help promulgate these suggestions to councils through the regular contacts it holds with authorities holding mayoral ballots.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.3/9">In short, the Commission's report is an important contribution to our refining and improving the process of mayoral elections which are at the heart of our policy that people should be able to choose how they are governed locally.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.9/1">The South West Regional Assembly is a voluntary body. It has not statutory duties and determines its own functions. However, I understand that its top priorities for the next two years are to:</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/2" class="indent">further develop its role as the voice of the South West;</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/3" class="indent">continue to identify present and future needs of the region; and</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/4" class="indent">encourage and promote integrated policy-making for the delivery of regional objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/5">The Secretary of State in approving the Regional Planning Guidance (RPG10) recognised the Regional Assembly as the Regional Planning Body for the South West. The Regional Assembly is therefore responsible for implementation, monitoring and reviews of RPG. I understand that the Regional Assembly is also taking forward the Regional Sustainable Development Framework, which it signed up to in December 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/6">The purposes of Regional Development Agencies are set out in s.4 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998:</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/7" class="indent">to further the economic development and regeneration of their area;</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/8" class="indent">to promote business efficiency, investment and competitiveness in their area;</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/9" class="indent">to promote employment in their area;</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/10" class="indent">to enhance the development and application of skills relevant to employment in their area; and</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/11" class="indent">to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom, where it is relevant to their area to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/12">The Government Office for the South West manages spending programmes in the region on behalf of a range of Government Departments, carries out certain regulatory functions, sponsors the Regional Development Agency and provides a regional perspective which helps inform the development of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/13">The functions of local authorities are set out in many different pieces of legislation and are summarised, for example, on the website of the Local Government Information Unit <a href="http://www.lgiu.gov.uk">www.lgiu.gov.uk</a>. In summary:</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/14" class="indent">counties provide the following services: education, libraries, social services, trading standards, waste disposal, highways and transport, strategic land use planning.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/15" class="indent">districts provide the following services: housing, parks, sports, arts and entertainment, land use planning permission, environmental health, waste collection and recycling, street cleaning, council tax collection, council tax and housing benefits, electoral registration and administration.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/16" class="indent">unitary authorities are responsible for all the functions carried out by a county and district where there are two tiers of local government.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.8/1">The Assembly is a voluntary, non- statutory body. As such, it does not exercise any statutory powers or duties, and does not need specific statutory authority to carry out the activities determined by its members. However, the Assembly could not take an effective role in scrutinising the activities of the regional development agency for the South West unless the agency was required to play its part. Accordingly, provisions in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 allow the Secretary of State to designate a chamber for the region (which is the Assembly), and to direct the agency to have regard to the chamber's views and to consult it about the exercise of specified functions.</p>
