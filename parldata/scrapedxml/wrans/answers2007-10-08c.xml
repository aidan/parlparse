In relation to grants, once an agreement has been made and payment schedules agreed to, public sector organisations should honour these in the same way as they would any commercial or contractual arrangements.

	<p pid="c.3W.5/1">The types of training delivered by the Fire Service College and the Emergency Planning College reflect their differing but complementary missions. The Fire Service College focuses on specialist training at the operational (bronze), tactical (silver) and strategic (gold) levels, and over 90 per cent. of its students are from the fire and rescue service. As officers progress through the levels, they receive increasing exposure to multi-agency operations. In contrast, the Emergency Planning College's courses bring together all the many services and organisations involved in multi-agency working at the strategic (gold) level in large-scale emergencies, including non-blue light scenarios such as influenza. As a result, fire and rescue service students comprise less than 10 per cent. of the Emergency Planning College's intake.</p>
	<p pid="c.3W.5/2">In order to maximise the UK's resilience to emergencies the Emergency Planning College and Fire Service College collaborate to ensure that their training programmes are consistent with their responsibilities, meet their respective customers' requirements and achieve synergy. The overall co-ordination is effected through periodic meetings at senior and middle management levels of the major providers of multi-agency training, including the Fire Service and Emergency Planning Colleges and the National Policing Improvement Agency.</p>

The decision on the content of the user agreement in relation to how the system dealt with ballot papers, including auto-adjudication, was the responsibility of returning officers and the e-counting provider.

	<p pid="c.8W.6/1">In 2003 the European Commission undertook an impact assessment of the proposed reform of the European Union (EU) internal sugar market (this was formally adopted by the Agricultural Council in February 2006). In May 2006 DEFRA undertook a comprehensive regulatory impact assessment of the reform. This assessment looked at the potential impact of the reform on all stakeholders including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries that supply sugar to the EU market under a preferential trade agreement. In addition DFID has commissioned a number of independent studies looking at the impacts of the reform on the sugar industry in developing countries, with particular emphasis on the least developed countries (LDC's).</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.6/2">The assessments and studies all suggest that the reform will present challenges for the ACP countries who will see the value of their preference decline. They also show that the reform will provide impetus for some of the ACP countries to move their economies away from large scale dependency on sugar and thereby provide long term economic benefit in the form of efficiency gains. However the assessment also suggests the ACP countries will need financial assistance to help them diversify their economies and adapt to the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.6/3">In response to these assessments DFID successfully lobbied the Commission to provide transitional assistance for the ACP countries. As a result of the lobbying the EU has earmarked around &euro;1.244 billion between 2007 and 2013. Allocation of these funds is based on a national Sugar Action Plan submitted independently by the ACP countries. DFID has provided technical and financial support to a number of ACP countries to draw up their individual plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.16W.2/4">One of the strategy's key measures already announced ahead of formal publication is the development, by a multi-agency steering group involving victims' group Nexus, of Northern Ireland's first sexual assault referral centre. The SARC will build on the valuable services currently available in police child abuse and rape inquiry suites to deliver a more coordinated response to the needs of victims by providing immediate medical aftercare and individual counselling and other support services while also facilitating the preservation of forensic evidence to assist in the successful prosecution of offenders.</p>

It will also include those who consider social housing as their preferred choice, or one of a number of housing options.</p>

	<p pid="c.26W.0/2">The Gloucestershire tri-service centre will not be broken up. The centre will continue to house staff from all three emergency services and support tri-service working after the control room of the fire and rescue service is moved to the South West Regional Control Centre. The Government are committed to creating a new national network of nine resilient regional control centres which will enhance the ability of the Fire and Rescue Service to respond to major incidents and natural disasters in a co-ordinated, efficient and effective manner. We believe that the public will be better protected by this approach. The new Regional Control Centres will however build on the valuable lessons learnt on joint working from the tri-service pilots, including the recent experience of dealing with flooding in Gloucestershire.</p>

	<p pid="c.40W.5/1">On a provisional estimate, 9 per cent. of all new dwellings in England in 2005 were built in flood risk areas. A more robust estimate for 2004 shows that 10 per cent. of all new dwellings in England were built in flood risk areas during that year. The following table gives a breakdown by Government office region of the percentage of new dwellings built in flood risk areas for the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.40W.5/2">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development. Flood risk areas account for about 10 per cent. of land in England, including parts of major cities, and around 10 per cent. of the population already live in flood risk areas. The Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The Government published planning policy statement (PPS25) in December 2006 to strengthen and clarify earlier policy on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.40W.5/3">PPS25 ensures that flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. In particular, more vulnerable development, such as housing, should not be permitted in high risk areas unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the need for the development outweighs the risk, and it will be safe, without increasing flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.40W.5/4">The definition of high flood risk areas and floodplain used by Communities and Local Government is the high risk zone mapped by the Environment Agency as being at a probability of flooding, excluding the presence of flood defences, of at least a one in 100 each year for river flooding and at least a one in 200 for coastal flooding. This is the basis for the definition of 'high risk areas' in PPS25.</p>

	<p pid="c.52W.11/1">In 2007-08 216 local authorities (LAs) in England did not have their bid for Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) funding in full. Despite substantially increasing the Government funding available for the national DFG programme, from &pound;57 million in 1997 to &pound;126 million in 2007-08, there is still considerable demand for the grant.</p>
	<p pid="c.52W.11/2">The national budget is divided up between the regions using a formula which takes into account data from the English House Condition Survey on the number of disabled people in each region living in unsuitable housing and a regional building cost index.</p>
	<p pid="c.52W.11/3">Government offices (GOs) are responsible for overseeing the allocation of DFG resources. In order to assist the GOs in this process the department supplied them with the LA bid for DFG funds and a local needs indicator, which is the number of individuals in each LA in receipt of either disability living allowance or attendance allowance. The GOs take these factors into account and balance them with any local data or information which they think is relevant in order to allocate DFG resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.55W.2/2">Planning Policy Statement 3: 'Housing' (PPS3) published in November 2006 introduced a new and less restrictive approach to the supply of land for housing, in order to help us achieve the step change in delivery we need to provide an increase in the supply of new homes.

It is no longer appropriate therefore to require them to refer larger greenfield sites to the Secretary of State as the Greenfield Land Direction did, and to keep this requirement in place would mean that it takes longer to make decisions on planning applications which could delay the delivery of necessary new housing on suitable sites.</p>

	<p pid="c.56W.0/1">Yes. Power generation infrastructure, including electricity sub-stations is included in PPS25, table D2 Flood Risk Vulnerability Classification. They are defined as 'essential infrastructure' as it is acknowledged that power stations and grid and primary substations may need to be located in flood risk areas. This is because power stations often need a ready supply of water and sub-stations need to be located near to the communities they supply. The PPS25 sequential test will ensure that they are located in low risk areas where possible, but where there are no alternative lower risk locations for this type of development then the exception test will ensure that they are safe.</p>

	<p pid="c.66W.2/1">The minimum age of entry into the UK armed forces is 16 years. The services provide challenging and constructive training and employment to many young people and enable them to learn valuable transferable skills. In financial year 2006-07, 30 per cent. of all new recruits were under 18 years of age.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/2">No young person under the age of 18 years may join the armed forces unless the application is accompanied by the formal written consent of his or her parents or guardian. Throughout the recruit selection process, the staffs at the Armed Forces Careers Offices (AFCO) provide comprehensive written and verbal guidance to all potential recruits, in particular those under 18 years of age and their parents or guardians, regarding their terms and conditions of service, the commitments that they would be undertaking, and their rights to discharge.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/3">Defence policy is that service personnel under the age of 18 are not to be deployed on any operations outside of the UK that would result in them becoming engaged in, or exposed to, hostilities. In addition, in line with UN policy service personnel under 18 are not to be deployed on UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

	<p pid="c.74W.5/1">I expect the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO) to participate fully in the further work identified in the Government response. This includes the provision of information to HM Treasury's economic study. The study, which is being conducted by Cambridge University, aims to provide cost and benefit information for possible alternative models of supply and charging for public sector information by Trading Funds. The completed study is due to be submitted to Government in mid November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.74W.5/2">The UKHO will also, if requested by DBERR and HMT, provide input to their work on the economics of information pricing.</p>
	<p pid="c.74W.5/3">The recommendations included in the market study report will be used to inform licensing policy following completion of the review of the UKHO's structure and ownership. I expect to announce the outcome of the review early in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.79W.0/1">In 2006 the Department commissioned the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to evaluate evidence submitted by the British Air Lines Pilots Association (BALPA) in relation to cabin air &quot;fume events&quot;. The COT received information from oil companies, airlines, engine manufacturers, independent scientific experts and pressure groups. The COT reported on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-20">20 September 2007</phrase>. Its report is published on its website:</p>

	<p pid="c.79W.0/3">The Committee on Toxicity considered that it was not possible to conclude whether cabin air exposures (either general or following incidents) cause ill-health in commercial aircraft crews. It recommended further work, in particular, and as a priority, to ascertain whether substances in the cabin environment could potentially be harmful to health. COT considered that this work should be designed to detect any potentially harmful substances, rather than focus on named substances.</p>
	<p pid="c.79W.0/4">In keeping with its commitment to promoting healthy flying, the Department accepts this priority. Through the Aviation Health Working Group, it has recently made preparations for such a study by testing equipment which may be capable of capturing substances released during oil and hydraulic fluid fume incidents. Once effective equipment has been identified it is intended to sample around 1,000 flights using more than one sampling device, more than one laboratory to analyse the results, and an independent project manager from the academic world.</p>

	<p pid="c.85W.5/1">The aerodrome conducted an immediate investigation into the incident that occurred on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-08">8 August 2007</phrase> and the report was presented to the CAA. The investigation revealed that the First Choice aircraft (airbus A320) that had arrived from Reus (Spain) was unable to access the main aircraft parking area due to congestion. In agreement with Air Traffic Control (ATC) the aircraft was initially held on a taxiway until space became available. While holding on the taxiway, the main aircraft wheels sank into the taxiway surface.</p>
	<p pid="c.85W.5/2">The report concluded that the aircraft should not have been held on that taxiway, as the taxiway was not designed to accept the weight of the A320 aircraft. The aerodrome operator subsequently issued an operating instruction that prevents aircraft of this size using that taxiway in the future. They have also commissioned a review of the pavement strength for the main runway and other paved surfaces. The United Kingdom Aeronautical Information Package (UKAIP) entry for the aerodrome has also been amended to reflect the pavement values for the aerodrome surfaces. They have also instigated a review of the equivalent commercial information available to pilots.</p>
	<p pid="c.85W.5/3">The aerodrome is also planning a new extension to the aircraft parking area in 2008 that will provide additional parking stands, which should reduce the need for aircraft to hold pending stand availability. This will include a new direct taxiway from the main runway.</p>

	<p pid="c.93W.0/1">The Government regulate rail fares where operators are likely to have a high degree of market power. Increases in regulated fares are limited to RPI+1 per cent. and the Secretary of State for Transport recently announced that regulated fares will be capped at this level until at least 2014. Fares that are not subject to regulation are priced at the discretion of train operators. However, the recent White Paper, &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot;, concluded that the fares structure requires simplification for the benefit of passengers and announced its intention to work with the rail industry to implement a simplified fares structure.</p>

The recent White Paper announced the Government's intention to specify an overall improvement in train reliability (in terms of the public performance measure) of 92.6 per cent. by 2014, compared to a current industry reliability figure of 88.1 per cent. Franchise agreements with train operators contain performance standards that the operators have a contractual obligation to meet and the Department for Transport has sanctions that it can take to ensure that train operators meet their performance obligations.</p>

	<p pid="c.98W.2/1">This information is not held centrally for local roads. Highway maintenance on local roads in England is the responsibility of each local highways authority. All local highway authorities have been encouraged to produce asset management plans for their roads. These will consist of inventories of stock, its existing condition, and target condition based upon desired service levels. This information will assist local highway authorities to programme their road surface repairs.</p>
	<p pid="c.98W.2/2">The Department has also endorsed &quot;Well maintained highways&quot;, the code of practice for highway maintenance produced by the UK Roads Board. The document which can be found at <a href="http://www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org">www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org</a> provides best practice guidance on the programming of highway maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="c.98W.2/3">The Highways Agency are responsible for highway maintenance on the strategic road network in England. Their programme is sub-divided into significant renewal schemes and small works. Both types of programme may fluctuate, depending on the overall state of network assets and in-year urgency for tackling unexpected deterioration. The condition target for the strategic road network is measured by a road surface condition index. This target has been met since it was introduced in 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="c.100W.6/1">If individuals provide a minicab service without holding the requisite licences they are committing an offence. Responsibility for enforcing the law rests with Transport for London within London and the relevant local licensing authority elsewhere in England. The police also, of course, have a role to play in enforcing the law.</p>
	<p pid="c.100W.6/2">Last year we brought forward a change in the law which will establish a more comprehensive system for licensing minicabs (private hire vehicles&mdash;PHVs). Section 53 of the Road Safety Act 2006 repeals the exemption from PHV licensing outside London for vehicles which work on contracts lasting not less than seven days. When the repeal takes effect&mdash;in January 2008&mdash;it will be much harder for operators and drivers to evade licensing. A similar provision (section 54 of the Act) will bring operators and drivers dedicated to contract work in London within the PHV licensing regime&mdash;in March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.101W.2/1">The estimate of &pound;1 million was included in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the proposal to repeal the private hire vehicle (PHV) contract exemption; a copy of this is in the Library of the House. The RIA was based on the following assumptions: (a) 2000 drivers (b) 2000 vehicles and (c) 300 operators would have to be licensed as a direct result of the repeal of the contract exemption. Average fees for each of the licences were assumed to be &pound;250, &pound;200 and &pound;400 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.101W.2/2">These estimates and assumptions were based on the fact that the terms of the contract exemption are narrow and apply in a relatively limited number of cases. They made no allowance for cases now coming to light where transport providers might have believed, or claimed, that they were covered by the exemption but were not in reality so covered. A number of these cases are, and will remain, outside the definition of a PHV in the legislation and therefore will still not need to be licensed. Others should have been licensed as PHVs in the past and repeal of itself will not therefore create a new requirement to meet licensing costs. The Department has sought the views of stakeholders on draft guidance for local licensing authorities on the impact of the repeal and we expect to publish the final version of this shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.104W.0/1">While we make no excuse for focusing on walking and cycling strategies which can help children walk and cycle to school, young people can also benefit from many of our other initiatives to encourage people to walk and cycle more. Cycle training teaches young people a life skill which enables them to undertake a range of journeys, not just to school. Evidence shows our safe routes to school are also being used by the wider population to access other locations on foot or by bike.</p>
	<p pid="c.104W.0/2">Many of the improvements local authorities are making to local cycling infrastructure and cycle networks can also benefit young people. One of our 6 Cycle Demonstration owns, Derby, has a specific focus on targeting improvements to encourage those under 25 to cycle.</p>
	<p pid="c.104W.0/3">We are also continuing to monitor progress on our Walking and Cycling Action Plan which aims to increase levels of walking and cycling to reduce congestion, improve public health and provide for more pleasant public space.

	<p pid="c.111W.11/1">To date, the SSDA has approved four (4) standard-setting bodies to develop pan-sector qualifications strategies. These four are Management and Leadership (MSC), Administration (GIA), Marketing and Sales (MSSSB) and Customer Services (IGS). The only other pan-sector for which a qualifications strategy is currently being considered is health and safety. If any other standard-setting body wanted to develop its own qualifications strategies it would need to demonstrate that the occupational area they want to cover is not already covered by an existing Sector Skills Council's Sector Qualifications Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.111W.11/2">In developing their pan-sector qualifications strategies, each standard-setting body is working closely with a lead Sector Skills Council which will ensure employer needs across the board are represented and that there is no duplication with other qualifications strategies. No standard-setting bodies will be responsible for approving qualifications, this is the role of the Sector Skills Councils. All cross-sector standard-setting bodies are being 'buddied' with a lead Sector Skills Council which will approve qualifications, drawing on the expertise of the standard-setting body and liaising with other Sector Skills Councils as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="c.115W.2/1">Tree felling in England is controlled by the Felling Regulations, which are administered by the Forestry Commission. Deforestation is also subject to the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Forestry) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999. Permission is not normally granted for deforestation unless it is for the recreation of priority open habitats, which have been lost due to planting with trees; often non-native conifers.</p>
	<p pid="c.115W.2/2">Under the Kyoto Protocol, global emissions from deforestation are already taken into account by developed countries in meeting their emissions reduction commitments. The UK and other European Union (EU) member states are negotiating on how to include emissions from deforestation from developing countries in future climate change agreements, on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.115W.2/3">This process is also supported by UK and EU action to tackle illegal logging and improve sustainable timber procurement, working with international partners including producer and consumer countries. Reducing emissions from deforestation is a key aim of the Environmental Transformation Fund announced in the 2007 Budget. The UK has already announced that &pound;50 million from this Fund will go towards reducing deforestation in the Congo Basin, by promoting sustainable forestry.</p>

	<p pid="c.118W.2/1">The Government are committed to improving the energy efficiency of homes across England in both rural and urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.118W.2/2">Our fuel poverty policies also aim to improve the energy efficiency of homes of the fuel poor. For those eligible clients, including rural customers who do not have access to mains gas, Warm Front has looked to widen the support it can offer by considering alternative (often low carbon) technologies for inclusion within the scheme. Further pilot schemes are now being instigated to test other technology for Warm Front suitability, including solar thermal and air source heat pumps.</p>
	<p pid="c.118W.2/3">The Warm Front scheme not only offers the installation of heating systems and insulation for eligible households, but also provides advice on improving the efficiency of the dwelling. Eaga Plc, the Warm Front scheme manager, has worked in conjunction with other organisations such as Age Concern, Farm Crisis Network and the Pension Service in rural communities across England to promote energy efficiency and other key support services.</p>
	<p pid="c.118W.2/4">We continue to fund the Energy Saving Trust, which provides information and advice to individuals and householders, including rural households. We have launched the Act on CO2 brand, including an advertising campaign and on-line carbon calculator to raise awareness of the link between personal behaviour and climate change.</p>

Local authorities are responsible for surface drainage from roads and public spaces, and the operation of highway drains; they also have permissive land drainage responsibilities for non-main rivers. Water and sewerage companies have a statutory duty to ensure the effective drainage of premises in their area, including any piped surface water arising from them. Internal drainage boards have permissive powers to undertake work to secure drainage and water level management within their districts, which cover 10 per cent. of the country's land area (mostly rural areas currently). The Highways Agency covers drainage from trunk roads.</p>

	<p pid="c.126W.2/2">The EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was set up in November 2002 as a result of the extreme flooding disaster that hit Central Europe in the summer of 2002. The purpose of the fund is to provide financial assistance to the regions of Europe in dealing with an extraordinary &quot;major&quot; or &quot;regional&quot; disaster of natural causes, including severe flooding. The fund is specifically targeted at support for emergency relief action, cleaning up and getting destroyed infrastructure back into working order. Match funding is not required under the EUSF.</p>
	<p pid="c.126W.2/3">Before a member state can apply for support from the fund, the total amount of damages incurred in a major disaster must exceed a specific level. The EUSF's eligibility threshold for what are termed &quot;National Level Disasters&quot; is for all damages, insurable and uninsurable, to exceed &euro;3 billion (2002 prices) or 0.6 per cent. of the affected country's Gross National Income (GNI), whichever is the lower, in order to qualify for assistance. The UK current estimate for total damage suffered in the June and July floods is &euro;4 billion (&pound;2.9 billion).</p>
	<p pid="c.126W.2/4">An application for support from the EUSF in respect of the June and July flooding in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was lodged with the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="">20 August</phrase> and is currently being discussed with them. The application is not a bid as it will be for the Commission to decide whether, and if so at what level, support will be offered. Applications by other member states to the EUSF have resulted in offers of support ranging between 2.5 per cent. and 5 per cent. of the total damage suffered.</p>

	<p pid="c.128W.8/1">The energy efficiency of the housing stock in England cannot be monitored directly but is modelled, using data from periodic surveys of the housing stock coupled with data on the installation of energy saving measures. Based on the delivery of measures by existing energy efficiency programmes, we expect to be on track towards the 20 per cent. target. DEFRA is currently analysing the effects of energy efficiency policies but cannot yet quantify the improvement precisely.</p>
	<p pid="c.128W.8/2">However, there is one positive indication that efficiency has already started to improve substantially. Against a long-term trend of rising gas consumption, household gas usage fell by over 8 per cent. over the period 2004-06. Of this, up to half could be attributed to higher prices; weather changes had little effect. Improved energy efficiency for heating, particularly higher levels of insulation (installed via the energy Efficiency Commitment) and more efficient boilers (required by Building Regulations), is likely to have contributed to the remaining reduction of gas, the principal heating fuel.

	<p pid="c.133W.2/16">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), which is partly funded by DEFRA, is responsible for delivering greater material efficiency, including increasing recycling rates. Its work on packaging waste interlinks with many aspects of recycling, such as working with local authorities to advise on recycling facilities and overcome barriers to recycling. WRAP also has a behavioural change programme which targets consumer recycling and explains why this is important.</p>
	<p pid="c.133W.2/17">WRAP is working with the retail industry to increase the recycling content of packaging and is targeting the supply chain through the voluntary 'Courtauld Commitment' agreement. Through its business growth and manufacturing programmes, WRAP is also working to ensure that the necessary facilities are in place in order to increase the capacity and capability of recycling and to increase the use of recycled materials in manufacturing.</p>

One of these is a wide-ranging and thorough review that has been established by the Government to identify any lessons to be learned for the way that we manage and respond to flooding events such as those experienced recently. This review will cover issues such as loss of drinking water supplies. It is being led by an independent chair, Sir Michael Pitt. We are aiming to publish initial findings by the end of the year and subsequently a formal report. A call for evidence is currently lodged on the Cabinet Office and UK Resilience websites.

	<p pid="c.147W.3/1">New deal plus for lone parents was introduced in April 2005 in North London, South East London, Bradford, Dudley and Sandwell, and Leicestershire. It was extended to Cardiff and Vale and Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders in October 2006. The current pilots, which run until March 2008, are open to eligible lone parents in non-London areas and eligible lone and couple parents in London areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.147W.3/2">The Child Poverty Strategy 'Working for Children', published in March 2007, announced the extension and expansion of the new deal plus pilots from April 2008 to March 2011. In pilot locations outside London, key elements of new deal plus for lone parents will be extended to eligible couple parents, and the pilots will be expanded to cover all London areas and will continue to be available to eligible lone and couple parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.147W.3/3">The effectiveness of the pilots is defined in terms of increased exits from benefit and increased employment outcomes compared with similar lone parents in non pilot areas. Evaluation also examines the effectiveness of delivery and impacts on the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.147W.3/4">Early findings from the pilots were included in 'The lone parent pilots after 12 to 24 months: an impact assessment of In-Work Credit, Work Search Premium, Extended Schools Childcare, Quarterly Work Focused Interviews and New Deal Plus for Lone Parents', DWP Report 415, published in March 2007, and in 'New Deal Plus for Lone Parents qualitative evaluation' DWP Report 426, published in May 2007. Both reports are available in the Library. Qualitative findings from the Scottish and Welsh pilots, and findings from the next wave of Impact Assessments will be published next year and placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.150W.0/2"><i> </i>The computer systems used to produce state pension forecasts are being updated to reflect the new state pension rules included within the Pensions Act 2007 and therefore the Pension Service retirement pension forecasting team is temporarily unable to provide a state pension forecast to people who reach state pension age on or after <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2010</phrase>. We aim to have the system changes in place by autumn 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/3">People reaching state pension age after 2010 who contact the Pension Service retirement pension forecasting team will still be able to obtain personalised information including:</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/4" class="indent">an indication of the current number of qualifying years and how many more are needed to get a full basic state pension under the new rules; and</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/5" class="indent">details of how changes to the state pension rules may affect the individual's state pension position.</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/6">This means people can still receive the help they need to plan for their retirement, and the vast majority of customers using these transitional arrangements have been happy with the service provided.</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/7">People who reach state pension age before <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2010</phrase> can continue to receive state pension forecasts from the retirement pension forecasting team. These forecasts include information on both basic and additional state pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/8">Approximately half of the people who use the forecasting &quot;on request&quot; (either online or by phone) service are affected by the current suspension. Based on previous requests for state pension forecasts in 2005-06 we estimate the suspension will impact 300,000 individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/9">The combined pension forecasting service is also suspended until autumn 2008 and this affects approximately 4 million individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.0/10">In the meantime the Pension Service are working closely with their IT suppliers to explore ways in which the timetable for reflecting state pension changes in state pension forecasting systems could be advanced.</p>

	<p pid="c.151W.5/1">Entitlement to income-related benefits requires that a person has a right to reside and be habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland (generally known as the Common Travel Area). If a person does not have a right to reside then he or she is treated as not being habitually resident and is not entitled to those benefits. A person who has a right to reside must also show that he or she is habitually resident in the UK unless he or she falls into an exemption category, such as that for EU workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.5/2">The term &quot;habitual residence&quot; is not defined in UK social security legislation but there is both domestic and EC case law on how that term should be interpreted. In order to determine whether a person is habitually resident, decision makers will, on the basis of the guidelines set out in the case law, consider a variety of factors about the person's circumstances. These include, for example, his or her attachment to and intentions in the UK; his or her reasons for coming here; and whether the person has family in the UK etc. Benefit decision-makers must be satisfied on objective grounds that a person who claims income-related benefits after arriving in the country has genuinely adopted the UK as his or her place of habitual residence.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.5/3">Where other European Economic Area States use the term &quot;habitual residence&quot; as a condition of entitlement to benefit, the term should be used in accordance with their domestic law and EC case law.</p>

	<p pid="c.155W.10/1">The number of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) is given in the following table. There have been no individual support orders (ISOs) issued in Cambridgeshire up to the end of December 2005 which is the latest period for which data are available. In April this year we completed a survey of 60 areas on support available for young people on ASBOs. The headline results support anecdotal information from practitioners that where ISOs are not being made it is mostly because they are already receiving other interventions from the Youth Offending Team (YOT). The courts are obliged to consider making an ISO every time they make an ASBO on a 10 to 17-year-old and must give a reason in open court if they decide not to do so. The use of ISOs continues to be actively promoted by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and the Home Office as an aid to helping YOTs fulfil their role in tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.167W.5/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>, only overseas students who can show that they have a place to study or are already studying at an institution which appears on the Register of Education Providers (REP) have been granted entry clearances or extensions of stay as students. The REP is operated by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) and the application process requires institutions to prove that they operate out of registered premises etc. The REP has been very successful in combating bogus colleges, particularly those which were entirely fictitious. In 2004, some 1,200 were visited ahead of the REP being implemented and 25 per cent were found not to be genuine and were prevented from registering. A further 69 colleges have so far been removed from the Register through a combination of visits conducted by compliance officers in the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) as well as removals instigated by DIUS. Since July 2007, as the BIA has expanded its compliance resource in preparation for the introduction of the new points based system (PBS) for managing migration, officers have also begun to make more pro-active visits to colleges applying to get on the REP to prevent the registration of those found not to be bona fide.</p>
	<p pid="c.167W.5/2">Under the PBS we have plans to go even further. Under Tier 4: (Students) of the PBS, all education institutions will need to be registered on a new register of sponsors in order to recruit international students. No private educational institution will be able to qualify for the sponsor register unless they can demonstrate that they have been independently inspected or accredited by one of a limited number of BIA-approved accreditation bodies. As announced by DIUS on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-24">24 July 2007</phrase>, accreditation will be used to provide an independent qualitative check on an institution to demonstrate it is a genuine education provider. Tier 4 is expected to replace the current system for students in the first quarter of 2009. Unaccredited educational institutions have some 16 months to obtain the necessary accreditation in order to continue bringing international students to the UK after that date and we are confident that less reputable education providers will not be able to pass this additional test.</p>

	<p pid="c.170W.0/1">The repatriation arrangements to which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, referred in his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">25 July</phrase> are the memoranda of understanding (MoUs) on deportation which were signed with Jordan, Libya, and Lebanon in 2005, and the separate arrangements we have agreed with Algeria. Copies of the MoUs, and of the exchange of letters between the previous Prime Minister and the President of Algeria, are in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.170W.0/2">The terms of the MoUs signed with Jordan, Libya and Lebanon provide for the independent monitoring of assurances. Such monitoring has however not yet been needed as the Jordanian and Libyan individuals we wish to deport from the United Kingdom on national security grounds under the MoUs are still within the process of appealing against our decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.170W.0/3">Since July 2005, eight men have been deported to Algeria on grounds of national security. There are no formal arrangements for post-deportation monitoring. However, the eight individuals concerned were given details of how to contact the embassy in Algiers, and were asked if they wished to provide details of next of kin who could be contacted by the embassy. Two chose to take up this offer, a third merely wanted us to let his relatives know his arrival details.</p>

	<p pid="c.170W.3/1">The agreements referred to are the Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) on deportation with assurances (DWA) agreed with Jordan, Libya and Lebanon in 2005, and the separate arrangements under which we are able to obtain assurances in respect of people we are seeking to deport to Algeria.</p>
	<p pid="c.170W.3/2">These questions seek information about the numbers of prisoners deported under the arrangements and what monitoring has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="c.170W.3/3">The ongoing appeals process means we have not yet deported anyone under the MoUs with Jordan and Libya, and we have not yet found it necessary to seek assurances under the MoU with Lebanon.

	<p pid="c.170W.3/4">Since July 2005, eight men have been deported to Algeria on grounds of national security. (A further individual who held dual Algerian and French nationality was deported to France on national security grounds). The arrangements with Algeria do not provide for formal monitoring following deportation. The deportees are given details of how they can contact the British embassy in Algiers, and are also asked if they wish to provide the details of next-of-kin who can serve as a contact point. Two of the eight opted to maintain contact with the embassy, a further individual merely asked for his relatives to be informed of his flight details.</p>
	<p pid="c.170W.3/5">All the men deported to Algeria were detained and questioned following their return, as provided for under Algerian law. Six were subsequently released; two are still detained in custody and are now facing criminal charges.</p>
	<p pid="c.170W.3/6">The terms of the draft answer have been cleared with LAB, OSCT and the FCO's Counter-Terrorism Policy Department.</p>

The purpose of handcuffing is to reduce the risk of: absconding; harm to the public, other detainees or staff; damage to property; preventing removal from the United Kingdom; or attempting to prevent the removal of another detainee.

It is a mandatory condition of authorisation that authorised businesses comply with the Rules of Conduct. These specifically require a business to &quot;ensure all information given to a client is clear, transparent, fair and not misleading&quot;. If a claims business has a contractual relationship with a client then it must specify &quot;any charge the business makes&quot;.</p>

Information on the number of unpaid work requirements which <i> (a)</i> were not completed and <i> (b)</i> completed in each of the last two financial years, by individual probation area, can be found in the following tables.

	<p pid="c.182W.2/1">Maintenance expenditure within London is planned in line with an agreed estate strategy which sets the priorities for maintaining buildings in line with business objectives whilst ensuring a safe and secure working environment. Annual maintenance budgets and programmes of work are agreed in line with this strategy and on the basis of identified business and building risks. Plans and programmes are reviewed quarterly in light of changing requirements and risks, with budgets and programmes amended accordingly. Total maintenance expenditure for 2006-07 (capital and revenue) was &pound;19,145,895. Forecast expenditure (capital and revenue) for the financial year 2007-08 is currently &pound;18,796,250, a reduction in overall expenditure of &pound;349,645 over 2006-07. This reflects planned reductions in both the size of regional estate and efficiency savings achieved as a result.</p>

Departmental officials meet with the senior management team of the Commission on a monthly basis to monitor their budget and performance against targets.

There is no centrally held information about the cost of free calls nor locally of the breakdown between UK citizens and foreign nationals. Therefore, it is not possible to provide this information.

	<p pid="c.201W.8/1">The precise impact on prisoners of increased prison populations and their overcrowding, alongside other factors, is unclear. Cell-sharing can be a protective factor and overcrowding itself does not explain why there are self-inflicted deaths in prisons. Most significantly, a high proportion of prisoners arrive in prison with risk factors that we know increase the risk of them harming themselves, such as substance withdrawal, uncertainty and anxiety about their own cases, the impact of and adjustment to imprisonment, family concerns, a history of previous abuse or self-harm, and mental health issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.201W.8/2">However, managing very high numbers of prisoners can hinder efforts to reduce prisoner suicide rates. For example, by causing an increase in transfers between prisons, some prisoners being located further from home and family support, a possible reduction in the time staff can spend with individual prisoners on care and risk assessment, and an increase in the length of time prisoners are locked in their cells, rather than engaged in regime activities, association and other purposeful activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.202W.5/2">A thematic review by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, 'No problems&mdash;Old and quiet: Older prisoners in England and Wales' (2004), examined the health care services available to older prisoners. It found that 85 per cent. of older male prisoners had one or more major illnesses documented in their medical records, and 83 per cent. reported at least one chronic condition. The most common documented illnesses were mental health issues and cardiovascular, musculo-skeletal and respiratory conditions.</p>

	<p pid="c.202W.5/5">The Department of Health will publish 'Pathways to Care for Older Offenders: A Toolkit for Good Practice' shortly. This good practice toolkit will help enable prison healthcare staff to develop services, backed by a formal, routine assessment process, that meet the health and social care needs of older offenders both during their stay in prison and following release back into the community. A copy will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.203W.8/1">The precise impact on prisoners of increased prison populations and their overcrowding, alongside other factors, is unclear. Cell-sharing can be a protective factor and overcrowding itself does not explain why there are self-inflicted deaths in prisons. Most significantly, a high proportion of prisoners arrive in prison with risk factors that we know increase the risk of them harming themselves, such as substance withdrawal, uncertainty and anxiety about their own cases, the impact of and adjustment to imprisonment, family concerns, a history of previous abuse or self-harm, and mental health issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.203W.8/2">However, managing very high numbers of prisoners can hinder efforts to reduce prisoner suicide rates. For example, by causing an increase in transfers between prisons, some prisoners being located further from home and family support, a possible reduction in the time staff can spend with individual prisoners on care and risk assessment, and an increase in the length of time prisoners are locked in their cells, rather than engaged in regime activities, association and other purposeful activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.203W.8/3">Similarly, there is no clear link between higher population levels and violence. For example, analysis of young offenders statistics, a prisoner group that can be associated with higher assault rates, has not been able to show any such link.</p>
	<p pid="c.203W.8/4">In respect of re-offending rates, the National Offender Management Service has not established a correlation between overcrowding and re-offending. Prison Service monitoring of the delivery of offending behaviour programmes has shown that less than 1 per cent. of those who started offending behaviour programmes in 2006-07 failed to complete them because of transfer, possibly indicating any increased prisoner transfers due to population levels or other factors are not hindering completion of offending behaviour programmes.</p>

	<p pid="c.206W.3/1">Information on prisoners who maintain their innocence is not held centrally by the Pre-Release Section (PRS) in the National Offender Management Service, nor is it recorded on the Prison Service Inmate Information System. The information could be collected only at disproportionate cost by examining the individual case records of the 173 prisoners concerned. As the information requested is not recorded routinely it is unlikely that an examination of individual case files either by PRS or staff at the various prisons concerned would produce reliable or accurate information.</p>
	<p pid="c.206W.3/2">Denial of guilt itself is no bar to indeterminate sentence prisoners progressing through their sentences, or to ultimate release on licence. Prisoners may maintain their innocence for a wide variety of reasons and that stance may often change during sentence. Guidance on the management of life sentence prisoners who deny their guilt is contained in PSO 4700.</p>

	<p pid="c.209W.2/1">The Government set out in their March consultation document that dormant accounts would include bank and building society accounts where there has been no customer-initiated activity for a period of at least 15 years. On this basis, an assessment by banks and building societies suggests that between &pound;250 million and &pound;350 million lies currently unclaimed in banks, and up to &pound;150 million unclaimed in the building society sector. These figures are for the United Kingdom. There are no specific estimates for Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.2/2">The banks and building societies have committed to a comprehensive recruiting exercise in advance of the introduction of an unclaimed assets scheme in the UK. This will build on existing arrangements to help customers to track down their accounts.</p>

The AIA will benefit all those small businesses that make capital investments, regardless of their legal form. There are around 4.3 million small businesses, 2.1 million of which are estimated to be making capital investments. For 95 per cent. of these, the AIA will mean that all of their capital expenditure can be written off in the year of investment.</p>

	<p pid="c.239W.5/1">It is not possible to update these figures on a directly comparable basis due to changes in the methodology applied since the publication of the background paper. Specifically, whereas the figures set out in the background paper were based on a 10 per cent. sample of the self-assessment system, current data draws on all available self-assessment returns.</p>
	<p pid="c.239W.5/2">On that basis, data drawn from the 2005-06 self-assessment returns show that some 143,000 have a residence or domicile status which would enable them to benefit from the remittance basis of taxation. Of these, some 114,000 are non-domiciled residents, with the remainder being resident but not ordinarily resident.</p>
	<p pid="c.239W.5/3">The most recent analysis suggests that around 83,000 individuals completed an employment schedule with UK employment income of about &pound;9.7 billion, giving an average annual employment income of just under &pound;120,000. A smaller subset of 17,000 also returned foreign earnings totalling &pound;900 million which were not remitted to the UK and therefore not liable to tax, giving an average foreign earnings figure of just over &pound;50,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.239W.5/4">As the data contained in paragraph 2.15 of the background paper was the result of a one-off analytical exercise which has not been repeated, an update is therefore not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.241W.11/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what estimate has been made of the average proportion of household income spent on water bills in each county in the South West. (154767)</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.11/4" class="indent">Estimates of household expenditure and income are based on the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS), which is based on a sample of approximately 7,000 households in the UK. Statistics on household expenditure are published in 'Family Spending', the latest edition of which was published on 18th January 2007 <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361</a>). An analysis of the household income data collected in the EFS also appears in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income', the most recent analysis being published on 17th May 2007 (<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>). The survey sample is not sufficiently large to allow reliable results to be produced for counties. However, using the data underlying these reports, estimates have been calculated of the proportion of household income spent on water bills in the South West region, compared to the UK as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.11/5" class="indent">In 2005/06, average household expenditure on water charges was &pound;329 per year for the South West compared to &pound;277 for the UK. In the same year, the average household disposable income in the South West of England was &pound;25,197, compared to &pound;26,039 for the UK as a whole. So the proportion of disposable household income spent on water bills was 1.3% in the South West and 1.1% for the UK as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="c.246W.2/2"><i> </i>We are concerned by the lack of political progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Elections in 2006 saw an increase in ethnic nationalist rhetoric. Since then, progress on the reform agenda has slowed. The priority is for BiH's leaders to reach agreement on police reform, a key condition for conclusion of BiH's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. Longer-term, constitutional reform will also be necessary for BiH to deliver effective governance for its citizens and carry out the reforms that the EU accession process will require. However, there has been little progress on either of these issues since the elections.</p>
	<p pid="c.246W.2/3">We fully support High Representative/EU Special Representative (EUSR) Miroslav Lajcak and appreciate his efforts to unblock key reforms since he took up office in July. We regularly express our concern about the lack of progress to BiH's leaders bilaterally, as well as through the EU and in conjunction with the Office of the High Representative/EUSR.</p>

	<p pid="c.249W.3/7" class="indent">for contracts which must be accompanied by special security measures or when the protection of the essential interests of the security of the United Kingdom require it.</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.3/8">All proposals of this nature to contract with a single source (i.e. without undertaking a tendering exercise) with an estimated value in excess of 1,000 need careful consideration and specific approval. The supporting case should at a minimum cover the following factors:</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.3/9" class="indent">why the supplier concerned is the only possible supplier of our requirements;</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.3/10" class="indent">what is the basis for believing that the supplier concerned will provide value for money? What comparisons have been made in this area;</p>

	<p pid="c.249W.3/13" class="indent">is the award of this contract likely to lead to further similar business being awarded to the same supplier without competition.</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.3/14">Where single source tendering is proposed for purchases which exceed &pound;1,000, a single source justification form must be completed and include an assurance that value for money will be achieved and background information covering as a minimum the points above to support that assertion. Decisions on single source purchasing where the value of the requirement is between &pound;1,000 and &pound;5,000 may be made by the internal sponsor department although advice should be sought from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's procurement centre of excellence, Procurement Strategy Unit, as required.</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.3/15">Single source proposals in excess of &pound;5,000 must be submitted for approval to the Procurement Strategy Unit. They must be considered by an official with specific delegated authority for single source action.

	<p pid="c.254W.3/1">Mansour Ossanlou, President of the Syndicate of Workers of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, has been arrested and detained several times over the last two years for his involvement in peaceful industrial action by the bus union. We, along with the EU, have serious concerns about Iran's commitment to uphold its international obligations with regard to freedom of expression, freedom of association and the right to form or join trade unions. We have therefore been monitoring Mr. Ossanlou's situation closely. We were extremely concerned at his forcible detention by unidentified assailants on <phrase class="date" code="">10 July</phrase>. It has since been confirmed that he is being held in Evin Prison in Tehran and is being investigated for alleged distribution of propaganda against the regime. We understand that neither his family nor his lawyers have had full access to visit him in prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.254W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">16 July</phrase> I called in the Iranian ambassador to London to discuss human rights issues. I raised specific concerns about the treatment of Mr. Ossanlou, and urged Iran to ensure that he is treated well and in accordance with his rights. I highlighted that we consider his arrest to be a direct breach of Iran's commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In meetings with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="">21 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">1 September</phrase>, the EU presidency also condemned Mr. Ossanlou's violent arrest and detention for peaceful actions in support of civil rights.</p>

	<p pid="c.254W.6/2"><i> </i>The agreement announced on <phrase class="date" code="">21 August</phrase> between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sets out a workplan for Iran to address outstanding issues concerning its past nuclear programme. If Iran implements it in full, it may prove to be a step towards resolving the Iranian nuclear problem. But addressing the outstanding issues is only one of the steps the International Community requires Iran to take in order to restore confidence in its intentions. As the UN Security Council has unanimously demanded in Resolutions 1696, 1737 and 1747, and as the IAEA Board of Governors made clear in its Resolution GOV/2006/14 of February 2006, Iran also needs to implement fully the Additional Protocol and additional measures that the IAEA has requested, and to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. Until Iran meets these obligations we will continue to follow the dual track strategy agreed with our partners in the &quot;E3+3&quot; (China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States), and to discuss further measures aimed at persuading Iran to fulfil all its international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="c.267W.0/1">In England, the Government have accepted each of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on long term care except the recommendation that personal care should be provided free at the point of delivery to all in all settings. We estimate that the cost of implementing free personal care in England would be around &pound;1.5 billion at 2003-04 prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.0/2">The Personal Social Services Research Unit has recently published &quot;Paying for Long-Term Care for Older People in the UK: Modelling the Costs and Distributional Effects of a Range of Options&quot;, which models a range of options for funding long-term care, including making personal care free to all in all settings.</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.0/3">The report gives estimated public expenditure costs at 2002 prices of between &pound;1.35 billion and &pound;1.8 billion, depending on the way in which free personal care is implemented. This covers residential and home care for older people. It covers the whole of the United Kingdom. The England equivalent range would be about &pound;1.2 billion to &pound;1.6 billion. These estimates take account of limited offsetting savings of disability benefits.</p>

	<p pid="c.268W.3/1">The Department funds research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality improvement and service development in the national health service and through its Policy Research Programme supports a programme of research at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) on the health of pregnant women and their babies. This includes research relating to cerebral palsy and other early childhood impairment where prematurity is the single largest risk factor. With additional support from other funders, NPEU is also undertaking work which relates to neurodevelopmental follow-up of groups of children recruited to trials of specific interventions, where either all or the majority of the recruited children were preterm.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.3/2">Implementation of the Department's research strategy &quot;Best Research for Best Health&quot; has resulted in an expansion of our research programmes and in significant new funding opportunities for health research. In particular, the major focus of the neonatal medicine research group at the Hammersmith and St. Mary's and Imperial College Biomedical Research Centre, formed this year, is the prevention and treatment of brain injury and developmental impairment in the newborn infant, both as a result of prematurity and birth asphyxia. The Department has allocated &pound;7 million over five years to the research theme of which the Centre's work forms a part.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.3/3">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is one of the main agencies through which the Government support medical and clinical research.

In addition, the MRC supports a large portfolio of reproductive tract research and underpinning reproductive medicine and paediatric research.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.3/4">More specifically, the MRC is currently funding a research project on Fragile X syndrome that aims to provide fundamental insights into the cellular mechanisms through which cognitive symptoms of the syndrome arise and that may be important for discovery of new therapies for mental retardation.</p>

	<p pid="c.276W.5/1">The meeting of the Working Group on <phrase class="date" code="">24 September</phrase> was to obtain member states' initial views on an orientation paper on setting maximum and minimum levels for vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs, issued by the Commission in late July. We have been advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that general discussions on the orientation paper in the working group revealed that many member states are yet to establish views on many issues. The Commission has asked member states to consider the various issues presented in the orientation paper in preparation for more detailed discussions at the next working group meeting which has provisionally been scheduled for November.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.5/2">FSA officials have raised the issue of circulation of the orientation paper with the European Commission. The Commission recognised that member states have obligations to consult their stakeholders and did not place restrictions on the circulation of the paper, leaving this to the discretion of the member states. The FSA sent the paper to United Kingdom stakeholders on <phrase class="date" code="">8 August</phrase> seeking their initial comments and held a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">14 September</phrase> during which the paper was discussed in detail. Further meetings between the FSA and Ministers will be arranged when necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.5/3">The European Commission has indicated its intention to produce proposals in the form of draft amending legislation to go forward to the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH) for consideration in early 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.5/4">Recent discussions between FSA officials and the European Commission focussed on the Commission's orientation paper, and have not extended to detailed discussions of legal principles. The legal basis for setting levels of vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs that informs the FSA's contribution to discussions with the Commission is outlined in the Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC and the Regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods EC No 1925/2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.5/5">FSA officials met with their counterparts from the Republic of Ireland and other member states during, and in the margins of, the European Commission's working group meeting with member states on <phrase class="date" code="">24 September</phrase>, on the setting of maximum permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>

	<p pid="c.279W.8/1">There is no system of national health service charges for sight tests. Certain groups including children, people aged over 60, those on a low income and those predisposed to eye disease are eligible for NHS funded sight tests. Those not eligible for NHS funded sight tests have to pay privately.</p>
	<p pid="c.279W.8/2">In 1999 we reintroduced free sight tests for everyone aged 60 and over. This resulted in a switch from private to NHS sight tests, rather than any material increase in the overall number of sights tests. This suggested that the cost of a sight test is not a disincentive for individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.279W.8/3">This Government have not introduced charges for dental examinations. NHS charges for dental examinations have been in place since 1989 for those patients who are not exempt on income or other grounds. In April 2006 the system of charges was simplified as part of the wider reforms to NHS dentistry. Under the reforms, dental examinations are no longer charged as a separate item of service but as part of a course of treatment. A basic course of treatment (band 1) costs &pound;15.90 and includes examination, diagnosis (including x-rays if needed), preventative advice and, if clinically indicated, a scale and polish.</p>

	<p pid="c.287W.5/1">Funding is allocated to primary care trusts (PCTs) on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine PCTs' target shares of available resources, to enable them to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need.</p>
	<p pid="c.287W.5/2">The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) oversees the development of the weighted-capitation formula. ACRA is an independent body which has national health service management, general practitioner, and academic members. It commissions research to measure the health needs of PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="c.287W.5/3">The health need element of the formula, which informs the revenue allocations to PCTs in 2006-07 and 2007-08, was based upon research carried out by the allocation of resources to English areas (AREA) research team in 2001-02 and by Warwick university. The AREA research modelled need for all areas in England, and as a result a national formula was developed. A detailed description of the research techniques and the formula are published on the Department's website<sup>(1, 2)</sup> at:</p>

	<p pid="c.287W.5/5">Generally, the data used in this research were based on full population datasets (for example, the National Census). Statistical sampling was not required in those cases. The significant exception was the Health Survey for England (HSE). HSE data for 1994-2000 inclusive were used and this provided a national sample size of 122,488.

	<p pid="c.296W.2/1">The communications agency concerned is Good Relations. Payments made to the agency for services provided to NHS Connecting for Health from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, when NHS Connecting for Health came into being, to <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-26">26 September 2007</phrase>, total &pound;509,263 including VAT.</p>

	<p pid="c.296W.2/3">NHS Connecting for Health recognises the need for clear and accurate communications with the public and other stakeholder groups, including national health service staff. A key priority for successful implementation of an effective, national information technology system&mdash;a central plank of national health service modernisation&mdash;is to ensure that the public and stakeholders are fully informed and have an awareness and understanding of the benefits. The agencies concerned were appointed to assist in this important communication process and to produce supporting materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.2/4">The contracts have delivered value for money. Examples of outputs include videos to explain the new systems and services; exhibition stands and an outdoor exhibition trailer to support face-to-face engagement; millions of copies of associated guidance material, posters and information packs for NHS staff and patients; and implementation advice and case studies for local NHS bodies that demonstrate the value of the programme, how benefits can be realised and lessons learned from implementations.</p>

As part of this review, the United Kingdom, on behalf of Europe, is in discussion with the pharmaceutical companies who manufacture methylphenidate products about the conduct of research to better characterise and further investigate the safety profile of methylphenidate.

	<p pid="c.305W.2/2">NICE have advised that drug therapy to treat ADHD, of which Ritalin is but one option, should only be part of a comprehensive treatment programme that includes a range of social, psychological and behavioural interventions. These are mainly aimed at the child, but sometimes involve the parents and/or teachers. NICE has recommended that drug therapy should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional with expertise in ADHD and should be based on a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug treatment may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.305W.2/3">Psychological interventions that may be helpful include behavioural management, parent training, family and/or individual therapy, social skills training, cognitive behaviour therapy and problem solving techniques, among others. Careful, informed clinical decision-making, involving the parents and child should involve discussion of the benefits versus the risks of all interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.305W.2/4">We have also asked NICE to develop a clinical guideline on both the pharmacological and psychological interventions to treat ADHD. The guideline will cover the care provided by primary, community and secondary healthcare professionals who have direct contact with, and make decisions concerning, the care of children, young people and adults with ADHD. The guideline will include:</p>
	<p pid="c.305W.2/5" class="indent">care in general practice and NHS community care;</p>
	<p pid="c.305W.2/6" class="indent">hospital out-patient and in-patient care;</p>

	<p pid="c.309W.0/1">The Department is advised by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on Wi-Fi or similar wireless (WLAN) technology and health issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/2">Current advice from the HPA is that</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;There is no consistent evidence to date that Wi-Fi and WLANs adversely affect the health of the general population. The signals are very low power, typically 0.1 watt (100 milliwatts) in both the computer and the router (access point) and the results so far show exposures are well within internationally accepted International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines. Based on current knowledge and experience, radio frequency exposures from Wi-Fi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones. Also, the frequencies used in Wi-Fi are broadly the same as those from traditional radiofrequency applications.&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/4">On the basis of this advice the Department believes it is not feasible to conduct any further estimates of the numbers affected.</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/5">The HPA statement on Wi-Fi is available at:</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/understand/radiation_topics/emf/wifi.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/understand/radiation_topics/emf/wifi.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/7">In 2005 the HPA published a review of electrical sensitivity. This is a condition which some people attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields associated with the electricity supply and electrical equipment. The review notes that although the symptoms are attributed to exposure to various types of electromagnetic fields, there is no proven scientific link between such exposures and symptoms. A number of studies have looked for diagnostic markers for electrical sensitivity but no consistent marker has been found. The HPA report entitled &quot;Definition, Epidemiology and Management of Electrical Sensitivity&quot; is available at:</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/hpa_rpd_reports/2005/hpa_rpd_010.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/hpa_rpd_reports/2005/hpa_rpd_010.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/9">From May to September this year the Department has replied to four parliamentary questions, four items of correspondence from organisations and twelve from members of the public that have cited Wi-Fi equipment as a cause of health problems including the disturbing symptoms referred to as electrical sensitivity.</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.0/10">The Department is not planning an inquiry into Wi-Fi but the HPA is announcing a programme of work on Wi-Fi and WLAN installations such as those used in schools and homes. Discussions are underway with partner agencies, especially those in the education sector. This project aims to systematically investigate the types of Wi-Fi equipment in use and produce information on exposures to radio signals from wireless computer networks.</p>

	<p pid="c.315W.0/1">Responsibility for upgrading communal television systems is a matter for landlords in consultation with residents. Digital UK is responsible for communicating with landlords and property managers in order to increase awareness and understanding about what they need to do to prepare for switchover.</p>
	<p pid="c.315W.0/2">The Government published research in 2005 and 2007 which looked at the readiness of communal television systems provided by social landlords. The most recent research carried out by BMRB<sup>(1)</sup> and published in January 2007 showed an increase in the level of upgrade work since the 2005 survey with 32 per cent. of organisations in the process of completing the upgrade of all systems and nearly 50 per cent. having completed the upgrade of at least 30 per cent. of systems. Digital UK continues to map subsequent progress in the social sector through regional meetings and direct communications with social landlords.</p>
	<p pid="c.315W.0/3">Collecting information on private sector landlords is much more difficult given the diversity of the sector. Digital UK collects information on awareness of digital switchover and conversion to digital television through the quarterly tracker survey. The most recent tracker survey<sup>(2)</sup> reports that digital conversion for households who live in flats is around 74 per cent. compared to digital take up of 80 per cent. across all tenures. Digital UK is continuing a targeted information campaign aimed at residents' associations and flat-dwellers in the first four regions scheduled for switchover, as well as communicating directly with private landlords.</p>

All jurisdictions currently on the 'white list' have a minimum age for gambling of 18.</p>
	<p pid="c.319W.11/3">It is also an offence under the Gambling Act 2005 if a person brings to the attention of a child or young person information about gambling with a view to encouraging the child or young person to gamble. The Gambling Commission has powers under the Gambling Act to prosecute any person in respect of this offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.319W.11/4">The Advertising Standards Authority's (ASA) new codes of practice for gambling advertisers put in place strict controls to prohibit gambling advertising during or around children's programmes or programmes commissioned for, principally directed at or likely to appeal particularly to audiences below the age of 18. The gambling industry has agreed to abide by a voluntary ban on television gambling advertising before 9pm (with the exception of sports betting advertising during sports programmes).</p>

Where the police believe that a premises selling alcohol is associated with serious crime or serious disorder, such as the use of knives or guns, they can apply for a fast track review of the premises licence under new powers which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. In such cases, licensing authorities must also consider if it is appropriate to impose immediate extra conditions, such as a requirement to search for weapons, on the licence pending that review.</p>

	<p pid="c.346W.5/1">The Government encourage all types of flexible working across the workforce by providing detailed guidance, promoting the benefits and encouraging the sharing of best practice. We introduced the right to request flexible working, for parents of young and disabled children in April 2003. In April 2007 we extended this right to carers of adults. Over six million employees now have the statutory right to ask to work flexibly.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/2">There is no evidence to suggest that we should place a duty on employers to provide flexible working arrangements. The right to request flexible working has been a huge success with four out of five requests accepted by employers. 87 per cent. of all employees are satisfied with their current working patterns and 90 per cent. of employees said that at least one flexible working arrangement was available to them if they needed it. We will continue to monitor the impact of the flexible working law.</p>

	<p pid="c.348W.12/1">Oil is a globally traded commodity and the rise in oil prices over recent years has affected all countries, not just the UK. Moreover, while the Government recognise that in recent years higher and more volatile oil prices have created problems for UK businesses, by increasing production costs and adding pressure to profit margins, several factors have helped limit the impact. Firstly, in real terms (current prices), oil prices have remained below the peak levels reached in the late-1970s and early 1980s. Secondly, the rise in oil prices has in part been driven by strong global economic growth. Thirdly, UK businesses typically now have a lower intensity to use oil, given improvements in energy efficiency and the shift in the structure of the economy towards services. Finally, developments in financial markets have allowed businesses to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in oil prices more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.348W.12/2">The 2007 Energy White Paper (<a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/">http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/</a>) sets out the measures the Government are putting in place to help improve the functioning of the global oil market, and to ensure that the UK's domestic market framework and supply infrastructure continue to deliver reliable supplies of oil-based energy at competitive prices, as they have done over the last 15 years.</p>

Higher oil prices&mdash;by increasing the finances available to oil companies and by improving the economics of higher cost projects&mdash;are one of the contributory factors but it is not possible to quantify the specific contribution. A range of other factors also interact to determine the level of investment and therefore future global oil supply, including technological developments, governments' policies, supply chain costs, and other energy prices.</p>

	<p pid="c.350W.9/11">Domestically, the main challenge is ensuring that UK oil infrastructure is able to cope with declining UK production and evolving trends in demand. Given the high volumes of oil the UK already imports, existing infrastructure is well placed to cope with higher volumes. However, UK refineries will need to respond to the challenges of:</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.9/12" class="indent">rising demand for diesel and jet fuel and falling demand for petrol;</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.9/13" class="indent">declining availability of North sea crude oils; and</p>

	<p pid="c.350W.9/15">The Government will continue to work closely with UK refiners as they address these challenges. The Government have also established with industry an aviation fuel task group to analyse what supply infrastructure may be needed to meet future jet fuel demand at UK airports up to 2030. Finally, we have taken steps to ensure our oil emergency stocking system is better placed to deal with the increasing levels of oil import dependence we face.</p>

	<p pid="c.351W.5/1">Global oil market tightness is expected to ease slightly over the next few years as new production and refining capacity is brought on-stream. However, given the complexity of contributory factors, the implications for international oil prices are uncertain. However, most analysts do not expect oil prices to make a sustained return to the average levels seen during the 1990s (around US$25 per barrel in today's prices), reflecting an expected increase in the market share of a relatively small number of producers, strong demand growth from developing countries, investment constraints, and a rise in marginal production costs outside OPEC.</p>

Closure decisions will not be determined by sub-postmasters' preferences though there will be cases where there is a strategic fit between a closure proposal and the sub-postmaster's wish to leave the network. As such, this will not form part of the information provided during the local area plan consultation.

The proposal will then need to be agreed by member states and the European Parliament. After a decision has been reached, we will bring forward the appropriate measures to make our contribution.</p>

	<p pid="c.359W.0/2"><i> </i>The Energy White Paper identified the need both to create the right financial framework, and to lower practical barriers relating to planning and grid connection, in the light of our target of 10 per cent. electricity from renewables by 2010 and aspiration to double this by 2020. It also outlined proposals to band the Renewables Obligation, reform the planning regime and improve renewables grid connection in order to address these barriers. In the context of renewable energy use in transport, the White Paper referred to issues of sustainability, mechanical impact and costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.359W.0/3">The 2007 spring European Council agreed an overall target for 20 per cent. of the EU's energy to be from renewables by 2020. Decisions have not yet been taken on individual member states' contribution to the target, but we are already giving initial consideration to potential obstacles to further renewable deployment&mdash;such as cost, technical feasibility, planning constraints, grid infrastructure, sustainability, and impact on wider energy policy goals&mdash;and how these might be overcome. We will be consulting on these issues in more detail once the European Commission has issued proposals on how the EU 20 per cent. renewable energy target should be implemented.</p>

Section 29 of the Data Protection Act provides that disclosure of personal data may take place where such disclosure is for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime, or apprehending or prosecuting offenders. Section 115 of the Crime and Disorder Act provides that any person who would not otherwise have the power to disclose information to a police authority or a local authority has power to do so where the disclosure is necessary or expedient for the purposes of any provision of that Act.</p>

Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which was &pound;60,000 at the start of 2006.

	<p pid="c.366W.2/1">Academies are required, by their funding agreements, to comply with admissions law and the Department's admissions codes as though they were maintained schools. This doesn't mean that they must adopt their local authority admission arrangements. Like voluntary-aided and foundation schools, academies are responsible for determining their own admission arrangements in consultation with the local school admissions forum, on which the local authority is represented, and other local admission authorities. They must also be part of the local coordinated application process. Unlike other state funded schools, academies are required to seek the approval of the Secretary of State for their admission arrangements and before making any changes.</p>

	<p pid="c.370W.2/2">All academies' funding agreements require them to have at least one local authority representative on their governing body, and local authorities acting as co-sponsors will usually have two governors. In order to determine the ethos and leadership of the academy, and ensure clear responsibility and accountability, the private sector or charitable sponsor always appoints the majority of the governors. This is the case even when a local authority is acting as co-sponsor for wider purposes. All academies are run on an independent basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.371W.2/1">The Government collect data on children who became the subject of a child protection plan. In the past this has also meant being placed on a child protection register, although these arrangements are now being altered. Figures are available for the years ending <phrase class="date" code="1990-03-31">31 March 1990</phrase> to 2001 under the category of physical injury and for years ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> to 2007 under the category of physical abuse. This information is provided by local authorities and includes cases of children suffering, or at risk of suffering significant harm from parents and carers (though it will also include other cases such as those where parents are unable to protect children from others posing a risk of harm to them). This information is set out in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="c.371W.2/2">Up until year ending <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> physical injury was recorded and could also be identified in cases where concerns about children included a mix of different categories. After that point, local authorities ceased reporting mixed categories separately so figures from year ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> onwards are only available for registrations and child protection plans that are attributed to physical abuse as a single category. In the same year, there was also a change to the registration category where physical injury was redefined as physical abuse. As a result of this change in definition, the figures reported in year ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> onwards for physical abuse may not be wholly comparable to the figures reported for 'physical injury alone' in preceding years.</p>

Extended schools will offer additional opportunities for safe, supervised play out of normal school hours. &quot;Aiming High for Young People&quot; published in July 2007 will support a major expansion of positive activities for young people over the next 10 years. The Department new has joint policy responsibility for play with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and will work closely with that Department and with Communities and Local Government and other Departments to build on the Government's support for play outlined in the &quot;Time for Play&quot; document published by DCMS in 2006.

'Every Parent Matters' and 'Aiming High for Children: Supporting Families' (both published in March 2007) signal our intent to continue to support families through our policies. This has been reinforced by the new Machinery of Government changes putting families in the title of the Department for the first time, moving us beyond arbitrary distinctions between services for children and adults. We are looking at how we should champion families across Government.</p>

Use of public transport is encouraged by departmental policies including limited car parking, free cycle parking with showers available for staff to use before starting work, flexible working, using public transport during the course of travel and making use of travel websites and information services, such as Transport Direct. Staff are also informed about local transport initiatives and promotions. Where the location or nature of the work makes public transport use impractical for staff, car sharing and the use of low emission vehicles is encouraged.</p>

	<p pid="c.381W.11/13">We do not make a separate assessment of the effectiveness of the education of deaf children. All pupils both with and without SEN are assessed at the end of key stages of learning and pupils with a statement of SEN have their needs reviewed annually. The statutory framework and the SEN code of practice should ensure that all children with special needs have those needs identified and assessed and receive appropriate support. We are currently in discussion with deaf and hearing impairment organisations about school attainment data for this group of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.381W.11/14">We have no plans to review the effectiveness of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal (SENDIST), which provides an independent and impartial appeal process against local authority decisions about the education of children with hearing impairments and other special educational needs. In the tribunal year 2005-06 the tribunal decided 31 cases in which hearing impairment was identified as the children's primary difficulty. The tribunal upheld 20 of 26 cases relating to school placement.</p>
	<p pid="c.381W.11/15">Under part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), schools must not discriminate against prospective disabled pupils in their admissions arrangements and should make reasonable adjustments to their admissions policies and procedures so that prospective disabled pupils are not disadvantaged by the school's admission arrangements. If a child is refused entry for other reasons, such as the school being full, then they have the same right to appeal as other children.</p>
	<p pid="c.381W.11/16">Local education appeals panels consider claims of discrimination in relation to admissions to, and permanent exclusions from, local authority maintained schools. SENDIST hears other claims about schools under the DDA.</p>

	<p pid="c.389W.8/1">A-levels, like other qualifications, are tightly regulated and standards monitored by the independent Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA). The Committee on Examination Standards chaired by the Director for Education at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concluded in 2004 that no examination system at the school or other level is so tightly or carefully managed.</p>
	<p pid="c.389W.8/2">Claims that A-levels have got easier have been investigated and refuted on numerous occasions since the 1990s, first by Ofsted and then by QCA. It is not possible to make a simple comparison between exam papers from one or two decades ago with papers today: pupils learn different things today because the world is a different place, with employers demanding different skills. The improvements we have seen in success rates at A level are a result of record investment, 30,000 extra teachers, double the number of support staff and billions invested in rebuilding crumbling schools. The further improvements planned for A-level as part of our 14-19 reforms, to be introduced in 2008, will provide further stretch and challenge for the most able pupils and ensure A-levels remain robust qualifications that are respected internationally. Success at A-level today is no less demanding than it was in the past.</p>

	<p pid="c.390W.2/1">Standards in secondary schools have risen dramatically. 2007 data are not yet available but in 2006 58.5 per cent. of pupils achieved five good GCSEs&mdash;an increase of 13.4 percentage points since 1997. Over 86,000 more pupils achieved five good GCSEs last year compared with 1997 and 62,000 more achieved five good GCSEs including English and maths compared with 1997. We are on track to meet the 2008 target of 60 per cent. of pupils achieving five good GCSEs and we expect that healthy trajectory to continue.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.2/2">Targets are an essential part of the Government's commitment to raising educational standards. The existing set of public service agreement (PSA) targets linked to raising attainment covers the period up to 2008. We expect to be announcing shortly a new set of PSA targets for the spending review period up to 2011.</p>

However, the School Food Trust's (SFT) second annual survey of take-up of school meals in England (published in September 2007), which is based on responses from 104 local authorities, reports that, in 2006-07, 90.7 per cent. of primary schools and 57.6 per cent. of secondary schools offered school lunches; and that 41 per cent. of primary pupils and 38 per cent. of secondary pupils ate school lunches.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.0/2">In addition, the Local Authority Caterers Association's (LACA) 'National School Meals Survey 2007' which is based on responses from 94 LACA member authorities, reports that 65 per cent. of local authority caterers forecast a deficit on 2006-07 trading; and that 51 per cent. forecast a deficit on 2007-08 trading.</p>

	<p pid="c.408W.3/1">The Government are taking action to reduce the total level of school balances which stood at &pound;1.6 billion nationally at the end of the financial year 2005-06. We believe it right to ensure that some of this money is used to support the education of today's pupils. We propose therefore to require local authorities to redistribute locally 5 per cent. of all positive revenue balances which, on the basis of 2005-06 figures, would apply to around 20,500 or 90.4 per cent. of all schools. That will encourage these schools to think carefully about the level of their balances and to plan ahead for their use.</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.3/2">It will be for each local authority in consultation with its Schools Forum to decide how the redistribution will work in their area. Because the redistribution takes place within a local authority it will reward those schools who budget prudently for a small surplus at the end of each financial year, at the expense of those schools who maintain consistently high balances. As the resources will be redistributed there is no overall cost to the school system from this measure and we estimate that a 5 percent. annual redistribution would release around &pound;75 million a year for wider use within schools.</p>

However the total cost of each inspection includes two extra days for the lead inspector to prepare and write up the inspection. Costs also include the administration of the inspection and quality assurance processes. As a result, the costs of inspection vary according to the size of the school. Some examples are:</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.6/20" class="indent">A typical primary school of 241 pupils, with an inspection led by an additional inspector and the report quality assured by HMI, would be &pound;6,018.</p>

	<p pid="c.408W.6/24" class="indent">Up to 30% of all schools are now considered for a reduced tariff inspection (RTI). These are schools which meet pre-defined criteria indicating that they are likely to be good or outstanding overall.

	<p pid="c.410W.2/26" class="indent">In 2005-06, a new inspection framework was introduced. Under the new arrangements, schools are inspected every three years rather than every six years, as was formerly the case. More schools are therefore inspected each year and the increase in the number of schools made subject to special measures in 2005-06 should be viewed in the light of this information.</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.2/27" class="indent">Under the section 10 inspection framework, which was in operation before September 2005, schools in special measures were monitored on a termly basis by HMI until they were judged to be providing a satisfactory standard of education. At that stage, Ofsted removed them from the category and published an inspection report. Some remained in special measures for three years or, in a minority of cases, for even longer periods. Ofsted has no power to close such schools but informs the Department for Children, Schools and Families, as well as the relevant local authority, of the progress of all schools in special measures. Since September 2005, Ofsted has continued to monitor the progress of schools in special measures and has reinspected those which have been in the category for two years or more. A few schools have remained in special measures following these inspections.</p>

	<p pid="c.412W.0/15">The number and proportion of schools moving from the serious weaknesses category to special measures has reduced considerably since 2003. Ofsted have reinspected the majority of schools that were placed in the significant improvement category during 2005-06 and over 90 per cent. have now been judged to be providing a satisfactory standard of education.

	<p pid="c.414W.3/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-06">6 August 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.3/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.3/4" class="indent">Although I am unable to answer the particular question you have raised, I have set out in the following tables the data Ofsted has on the proportion of observed lessons in secondary schools from September 1996 to August 2007 which were taught in setted/streamed classes</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.3/5" class="indent">The data are based on the use of streaming and setting in lessons observed during inspection. Some explanation of these figures may be helpful. Before September 2005, inspectors were usually informed about how classes were organised by means of pre-inspection documentation, discussion with headteachers or teachers' schemes of work or lesson plans. Under the inspection arrangements at that time, all full-time teachers were observed by inspectors. Since September 2005, the recording of class organisation has been based either on discussions with the headteacher or teacher by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may therefore not represent pupil grouping in the school as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.3/6" class="indent">From 2003-04 the distinction between streaming and setting was removed and instead data recorded on whether the class was mixed ability or setted/streamed.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.3/7" class="indent">Physical education classes have been excluded from the analyses as these are not usually setted for ability in the subject</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.3/8" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools, and will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.418W.5/2">Additional and specialist learning for all diplomas offers a range of vocational and general qualifications to support choice and progression into higher education or employment. In determining the additional and specialist learning options within the level 3 diploma in engineering, the Diploma Development Partnership, awarding bodies and QCA are working very closely with higher education institutions and employers to ensure clear progression routes for young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.418W.5/3">Physics, Modern Foreign Languages, Electronics, Advertising or Multi-media Software Skills are all examples of some of the choices available for young people studying the Engineering Diploma at level 3. Full details are set out in the Diploma Additional and Specialist Learning Catalogue which is available on the National Database of Accredited Qualifications <a href="http://www.accreditedqualifications.org.uk">www.accreditedqualifications.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.424W.2/1">The level of qualification required to teach Mandarin and Urdu will be the same as for any other modem language and teachers will normally have a post A level qualification which will be built upon as part of their training. It is not possible to state how many new teachers of a particular language there will be over the next few years or therefore what the cost of training them will be. While the Government sets the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) a target for the number of training places for modem languages as a whole, it does not specify how this should be split between individual languages. This depends on the demand from schools and local authorities for teachers of a particular language, which will then be reflected in the number of training places offered by providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.2/2">Following the review of the key stage 3 curriculum (11 to 14-year-olds), schools will be able to offer any major European or world language from September 2008. The new key stage 3 programme of study does not stipulate what languages should be taught, although suggests schools might offer major European or world languages such as Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish and Urdu. It is a school level decision which languages they teach.</p>

These will ensure that every year those who manage teachers and head teachers agree objectives appropriate to the individual teacher and at the end of each year the teacher's performance will be assessed against those objectives and associated performance criteria. Our aim is that career progression and financial rewards should go to those who are making the biggest contribution to improving pupil attainment, those who are continually developing their own expertise, and those who are helping to develop expertise in others.</p>

	<p pid="c.426W.2/1">The Government are committed to improving the supply of well-qualified teachers of shortage subjects and for the past few years has made financial incentives available to encourage people to train as teachers of shortage subjects. In mathematics and science we offer a training bursary of &pound;9,000 to students taking a postgraduate certificate of education (PGCE) and, after successful completion of induction, a golden hello of &pound;5,000. In other shortage subjects including modern languages, technology, music and religious education we offer PGCE students a bursary of &pound;9,000 and a golden hello of &pound;2,500.</p>
	<p pid="c.426W.2/2">We fund the Training and Development Agency for Schools to advertise for recruitment to particular shortage subjects, to provide help and advice telephone lines to potential teacher trainees, and to run pre-training enhancement courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry to enable people without a degree in the subject, but with post-A-level knowledge, to retrain as specialist teachers in these subjects. We have extended postgraduate teacher training courses to enable providers to offer significant chemistry, physics and mathematics subject knowledge training. The expansion of Teach First also gives high class graduates the opportunity to teach shortage subjects in challenging schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.426W.5/1">All teachers, as part of their initial teacher training and induction period, must demonstrate that they can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with special educational needs (SEN) or disabilities, and know how to seek advice from those with specialist knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="c.426W.5/2">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to discuss their own development needs in performance management reviews, and to address development priorities. This could include strengthening knowledge and understanding of a particular area or aspect of SEN, which could of course include severe, profound and multiple learning difficulties. Such children would normally be provided for in special schools because of the complexity of their needs. It would be for those schools to ensure that staff employed to support them had the necessary knowledge, skills and experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.426W.5/3">All schools receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. A wide variety of courses are available covering SEN, ranging from awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers and their schools to determine their own particular training and development needs. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN,</p>
	<p pid="c.426W.5/4">The Department's published SEN strategy, 'Removing Barriers to Achievement', recognised the importance of training and committed us to work closely with the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) to ensure that initial teacher training and programmes of continuing professional development provide a good grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN. We have commissioned the TDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trained, newly qualified and established teachers. These initiatives are being implemented and evaluated over the period 2005-08 at a cost of approximately &pound;1.1 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.427W.5/2">Sector Skills Councils have the lead role at the national level to identify the skills employers need and to raise investment in skills. Each SSC is required to produce an employer-led Sector Skills Agreement setting out an action plan to increase skill levels, including an analysis of the diversity of each sector SSCs identify the factors behind the gender, age, ethnicity and disability profiles of their industries. This analysis informs SSC strategies, targets and measures to redress imbalances. SSCs also have a more direct role in encouraging employers to consider recruiting non-traditional sources of labour. For example, the Women and Work Sector Pathways initiative is testing new career and recruitment routes, helping women into sectors and occupations where they are currently under-represented.</p>

	<p pid="c.428W.2/3">A quarter of a million apprentices, of whom 47 per cent. are female, are currently in learning. The number of female apprentices has steadily increased as more apprenticeships have been offered, including in more non-traditional sectors. The Learning and Skills Council has taken action to promote equality and diversity in apprenticeships, including equality-proofed promotional materials to attract apprentices from a wide range of backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/4">An internal review of apprenticeships is taking place to address the strategic challenges of delivering the entitlement to an apprenticeship place for every suitably qualified young person by 2013 and of reaching 400,000 apprenticeships in England by 2020. The review will also address the equality and diversity challenges for apprenticeships set out in recent reports from the Equal Opportunities Commission, Women at Work Commission and the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs. The review concludes in November.</p>

	<p pid="c.430W.5/1">In April 2001, responsibility for providing careers advice passed from the Careers Service to the Connexions Service. Connexions provides services to 13 to 19-year-olds and to people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities up to the age of 24. The following table shows the amount of central Government funding allocated to the Connexions Service and the Careers Service in each of the last 10 years. Information on the amount spent on careers advice is not collected centrally. However, an independent study undertaken in 2006 concluded that, on average, around 42 per cent. of a Connexions Partnership's expenditure was on information, advice and guidance.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-10-08c.153971.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-10-08c.430W.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" colnum="430W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071008/text/71008w0089.htm#07101022005525">
	<p pid="c.430W.8/1">The Department has a number of initiatives already in place to ensure that 16 to 19-year-olds in employment have access to training.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.8/2">Government-funded apprenticeships offer the opportunity for young people to earn as they learn. There are over 200 apprenticeships designed by employers, available to 16 to 19-year-olds in 80 different sectors with 130,000 employers taking part. These apprenticeships give employees the opportunity to learn on the job and also through off the job training.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.8/3">Train to Gain gives employers the opportunity to access publicly-funded support to train their low skilled workers. Whilst apprenticeships are the most appropriate route for 16 to 19-year-olds in employment, 19-year-olds are also eligible for funding through Train to Gain. 16 and 17-year-olds who are in employment, and who have not yet attained NVQ level 2 or equivalent, are entitled to reasonable paid time off during normal working hours to study or train for a qualification which will improve their future employment prospects.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.8/4">The Department is also piloting Learning Agreements to help 16 and 17-year-olds in employment get back into education and training. Young people will agree personal contracts to return to education or vocational training in return for financial support.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.8/5">From 2013, when all young people are required to continue in education or training until the age of 18, we are proposing that where employers are employing a 16 or 17-year-old for more than 20 hours a week and are not providing or arranging accredited training for them, the employer will be required to release the young person from work for a day a week to attend training elsewhere. Where employers want to offer training themselves, we will encourage and support them to do so. We will work with employers to seek flexible and low burden ways for them to get existing good quality training accredited.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.8/6">Engagement in learning, and educational attainment, are critical if young people are to achieve good outcomes, and fulfil their potential. Our 14 to 19 reforms will ensure that all young people have the opportunity to choose a learning pathway which suits them and which can be the basis for progression to further learning, higher education and employment. This is essential if our young people are to have the skills they need to compete in our increasingly global economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.8/7">And our initiatives are having an effect. The number of 16 to 18-year-olds participating in education and training increased to 1.55 million at the end of 2006, the highest number ever. And, the percentage of 19-year-olds achieving at least level 2 was 71.4 in 2006. This is an increase of 5.1 percentage points since 2004.</p>
