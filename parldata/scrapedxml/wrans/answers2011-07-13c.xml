	<p pid="c.319W.3/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) vigorously prosecutes defendants who have been charged with human trafficking offences. In addition, the CPS plays an important role in preventing harm from trafficking from reaching the UK, through prosecutors working with source countries to improve the ability of overseas investigators and prosecutors in case building and prosecution to disrupt human trafficking at source. The CPS is also working with source countries to improve international co-operation to assist in the provision of information and evidence to support prosecutions in the UK. The CPS published a new policy statement on the prosecution of cases of Human Trafficking on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-02">2 June 2011</phrase> that explains the prosecution process to those who support victims of trafficking.</p>

	<p pid="c.320W.6/1">The alcohol treatment requirement (ATR) of a community order or suspended sentence order is available to courts for offenders who are dependent on alcohol and whose dependency requires and is susceptible to treatment. Treatment costs are generally funded by primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and Substance Misuse Area Planning Boards in Wales and the costs of supporting delivery of the requirement are funded by NOMS through Probation Trusts.</p>
	<p pid="c.320W.6/2">Significant local variations in commissioning practice and costs of treatment modalities have made it difficult to establish the average cost of treatment delivered through an ATR.</p>
	<p pid="c.320W.6/3">Detailed work to cost the services funded by NOMS estimates the average direct cost of supporting delivery of an ATR at &#163;373 per completion. This estimate is subject to a number of assumptions which are detailed in published information that has been placed in both Libraries.</p>

Data on the number of applications made for a summons or warrant to return the offender to court for breach is not collected centrally by type of requirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.320W.6/6">72% of offenders successfully completed ATRs in 2009-10<sup>(2)</sup>. This Government will create greater flexibility for the provision of ATRs to ensure that people who meet the threshold receive the treatment and rehabilitation they need to tackle their substance misuse.</p>

	<p pid="c.328W.0/2">Police recorded crime statistics come within the remit of The Home Office. Offences recorded under the Protection of Harassment Act 1997 are included within their offence classification of &#8216;Harassment&#8217; and cannot be separately identified from other offences recorded within that classification. It is therefore not possible to identify those Section 4 offences which are recorded and subsequently not proceeded with.</p>

The Park Energy Centre will provide low carbon cooling, heating and power in Games-time, and over the longer term post-Games, from biomass boilers and a combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) plant which can be converted to use lower and zero carbon fuels as these technologies develop.</p>

	<p pid="c.334W.5/1">The seaside remains an important part of the visitor economy, accounting for some 24 million domestic overnight trips and almost &#163;4.6 billion in overnight visitor spend across the UK in 2010. The VisitEngland website gives wide coverage to the coast, and the seaside also features in themed promotions through print and electronic media and related marketing activity. Government's tourism strategy includes the aim of growing the value of the domestic tourism market, and coastal destinations and attractions can contribute significantly to this objective. The British Resorts and Destinations Association and other industry members have been working with VisitEngland to develop a Coastal Resorts Action Plan. This will focus on transforming perceptions of product and experience; coastal resort infrastructure; co-ordinated activities and events to grow tourism value; and building better intelligence and data.</p>

	<p pid="c.334W.8/1">I had the opportunity to visit the North East in June, during which I held meetings with local industry representatives to discuss the opportunities for tourism growth and development.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.8/2">Over the next four years VisitBritain will be running the &#8220;You're Invited&#8221; programme, which will capitalise on the international interest in the recent royal wedding, as well as next year's diamond jubilee and Olympic and Paralympic games, and showcase Britain to the world. The programme aims to attract four million extra visitors, spending &#163;2 billion in the UK economy, which will support businesses, jobs and growth. The programme is backed by a &#163;100 million marketing fund, funded by the public and private sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.8/3">VisitEngland is working closely with local areas and destinations, in line with Government's localism agenda, to grow the value of local tourism economies. This is co-ordinated through the national strategic framework for tourism, which includes an action programme developed in consultation with the tourism sector. VisitEngland is currently working with destinations across the country, including in the North East, on a campaign to deliver economic growth from the domestic market, and to support employment and job creation.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.8/4">&#8216;The time to be in England&#8217; initiative will maximise the impact of the unique events of 2012, including the Queens diamond jubilee and the Olympic and Paralympic games, helping to spread the benefits of the games beyond London and maintain a legacy of domestic tourism growth. The campaign is the subject of a bid to the second round of the regional growth fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.8/5">Tourism policy seeks to help improve the sector's productivity and competitiveness, in particular, to address the burden of regulation affecting the industry. The Government's Red Tape Challenge focused on the hospitality sector in May, inviting the industry and the public to identify regulations holding back the industry and stifling growth. Alongside this, the Government have set up an industry task force, led by senior industry figures, to identify rules, regulations and inspections impeding the sector, and which might be cut, modified or abolished.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.8/6">The Government's plans for promoting the growth of the visitor economy are set out in detail in the paper, &#8220;Government Tourism Policy&#8221; published in March 2011, and available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.344W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID)'s contribution to the Government's action against human trafficking will be set out in the new human trafficking strategy. DFID's most important contribution is our work to tackle the root causes of human trafficking in poor countries such as poverty, lack of economic opportunities, and social exclusion. For example, DFID has one of the largest bilateral programmes on social protection, directly helping very poor people in over 15 developing countries.</p>

We support the Malawi Anti-Child Trafficking Project, run by the Salvation Army, which aims to improve knowledge of and access to rights for children in Malawi who have been trafficked or are vulnerable to being trafficked. In Bangladesh we have supported a police reform programme which has recently established a Human Trafficking Investigations Unit. In Uganda, we have supported UNICEF to help identify and support trafficked women and children in the northern Karamoja region. DFID is currently developing a new regional programme which will aim to reduce the numbers of women and girls trafficked in the south Asia region.</p>

	<p pid="c.346W.2/2">Since then we have become increasingly concerned about economic management and governance in Malawi. The Secretary of State has raised these concerns with the Government of Malawi, and concluded that, until there are changes in Government of Malawi policy we can no longer justify the provision of general budget support to the Government of Malawi.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.2/3">However, we are determined to continue funding programmes that protect the poor. DFID support has helped improve food security for over 7 million people a year by providing them with high yielding maize and legume seeds via the Farm Input Subsidy Programme. We are currently considering how best to continue support to improve the production of maize crops in Malawi.</p>

Departmental modelling estimates that around three-quarters of households where someone is receiving carer's allowance across Great Britain will be entitled to current benefits replaced by universal credit, or universal credit, in steady-state.

	<p pid="c.352W.5/4">The Government has set out an ambitious programme of reform and transformation. The introduction of Universal Credit and the Work Programme, alongside our plans to improve and personalise the services we offer, will provide both significant challenges and opportunities for Jobcentre Plus. We will become a smaller, leaner and more flexible organisation which delivers more of its services over the telephone and Internet.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/5">As we deliver more, of our services over the Internet, and as unemployment falls, so we will free up capacity in our network. Face-to-face contact will reduce as more services can be accessed online and as we simplify the benefit system. Ultimately, these reforms are aimed at delivering a better service in a more efficient manner.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/6">Our Jobcentres will remain central to our operation. The Government's reforms will transform and strengthen the support for people to get back into work. Our prime concern is to ensure that we have a Jobcentre network that is appropriate to deliver the service our customers need, and of course cost effectiveness and productivity will be a factor. Each District has been asked to produce a service delivery plan, mapping how customers in that District will be served in each locality.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/7">No decisions have yet been taken on any closures. Once we have developed our options we will consult with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. We will in addition, undertake full Equality Impact Assessments and actively seek to mitigate, as far as is possible, any potentially adverse impacts. These assessments will be used in our decision making about the future.</p>

Work programme providers are free to design support based on the needs of individuals and target the right support at the right time. Work programme providers will be paid for getting people into work and keeping them there, which means that there are strong incentives for delivery partners to provide skills training where that support would help a customer move into work and keep them in work.</p>

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the 2009-10 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. 3. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes. 4. Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost rather than an After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they are. 5. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response. 6. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. 7. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand children. 8. Proportions of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point. 9. Each of the measures is defined as: Absolute poverty: children living in households with equivalised incomes below 60% of 1998-99 median household income held constant in real terms. Relative poverty: children living in households with equivalised incomes below 60% of contemporary median household income. <i>Source</i>: Households Below Average Income 1994/95-2009/10, DWP</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.361W.4/1">This away day event was authorised by the Department in February 2010, before the coalition Government took office. The booking was made under the last Administration, while the cost of the event was debited via the Government Procurement Card in May 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.361W.4/2">Poisson Rouge, an events management company, were contracted to provide the venue and the event. The total cost of the event was &#163;4,719.21 which comprised &#163;3,417.71 of payments made to Poisson Rouge and &#163;1,301.50 to the venue, the Brickhouse.</p>
	<p pid="c.361W.4/3">The event involved hire of a room during the day at the venue, for a review of work in internal audit. While I am informed the Brickhouse often features such figures as 'burlesque chanteuse Lady Beau Peep' and 'showgirl sensation Amber Topaz', the event in this instance did not involve civil servants watching, or indeed, performing cabaret or other eclectic entertainment.</p>
	<p pid="c.361W.4/4">No alcohol was consumed at the event. The purpose of the staff event was to review work carried out for 2009-10, identify areas for improvement, agree changes for the forthcoming year to improve service delivery and build the team. However, the final part of the day did involve a team building event involving drumming, organised by Poisson Rouge.</p>

	<p pid="c.361W.4/6">The policy on such events has changed significantly following the arrival of the new Administration in May 2010. Team review events now take place at no or very limited costs, for example through using rooms in the Department. New checks and balances have been put in place, assisted by the discipline of the Department publishing all spending over &#163;500 and greater openness over the Government Procurement Card.</p>
	<p pid="c.361W.4/7">I am aware that Poisson Rouge has been used in the past by a number of public sector clients. Embracing transparency and reducing away day spending is a prime example of how both Whitehall and the town hall can make sensible savings to cut costs, protect frontline services and pay off the deficit inherited from the last administration.</p>

	<p pid="c.362W.5/3">It states:</p>
	<p pid="c.362W.5/4">&#8220;The FiReControl project was flawed from the outset because it did not have the support of those essential to its success&#8212;local Fire and Rescue Services. The Department rushed the start of the project, failing to follow proper procedures. Ineffective checks and balances during initiation and early stages meant the Department committed itself to the project on the basis of broad-brush and inaccurate estimates of costs and benefits and an unrealistic delivery timetable, and agreed an inadequate contract with its IT supplier. The Department under-appreciated the project's complexity, and then mismanaged the IT contractor's performance and delivery. The Department failed to provide the necessary leadership to make the project successful, over-relying on poorly managed consultants and failing to sort out early problems with delivery by the contractor. The Department took a firmer grip of the project from 2009 and terminated the contract in December 2010 to avoid even more money being wasted. The Department is now trying to minimise the future cost of the project by subsidising Fire and Rescue Services to use the Regional Control Centres&#8221; (National Audit Office press release, <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-01">1 July 2011</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="c.366W.2/1">We believe the public have a reasonable expectation that their household waste collections should be weekly, particularly for smelly waste. That is why we have already ditched the last Government's policy of imposing fortnightly collections and we are now going to work with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections. We want to make it easier to recycle, and to tackle measures which encouraged councils to cut the scope of collections.</p>
	<p pid="c.366W.2/2">My Department does not hold centrally the frequency data requested, however, the Government will be working with the Waste and Resources Action Programme to monitor levels of service, and my Department is examining how we can increase transparency to local residents on the frequency and cost efficiency of waste collections, with a view to using best practice to help increase frequency and quality of service.</p>

Their roles include the policing of RAF stations at home and overseas, provision of higher level investigative support, and advising on security and risk management issues. They also provide tactical policing support to military operations including close protection and counter intelligence work.</p>

	<p pid="c.371W.5/2">These individuals were members of Lashkar-e-Taiba and they were captured as they posed an imperative threat to security in Iraq. They had travelled to Iraq to target coalition forces and the operation launched against them was necessary in order to save lives. Our forces risked their lives to capture such individuals and to ensure the security of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="c.371W.5/3">They were captured by UK forces in and around Baghdad in February 2004, at the time that the UK was an occupying power in south eastern Iraq, and immediately transferred to US forces in Iraq in accordance with established processes. The reason for this transfer was that the UK did not have its own detention facility close to where the two individuals were captured. The individuals were then held in US detention at Balad and subsequently transferred to a US detention facility in Afghanistan by August 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.371W.5/4">UK forces did not undertake an assessment of whether or not the individuals were prisoners of war because they were immediately transferred to US forces for detention. As part of the review of the case completed by officials between late 2008 and early 2009, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) considered the status of the detainees and determined that, as there was no information to suggest that they were members of the armed forces of Iraq, they would not have been prisoners of war. They may have been protected persons under the Geneva conventions, subject to certain criteria being satisfied. If they were protected persons, compliance with the Geneva conventions in respect of detainees held by US forces was primarily a matter for the US.</p>
	<p pid="c.371W.5/5">The MOD is co-operating fully with Sir Peter Gibson's Detainee inquiry, the purpose of which was described by the Prime Minister, in July 2010 as to</p>

These departures are a measure of the growing pressure on those close to Gaddafi&#8212;both from sustained military action to prevent the regime attacking its own people, and from UN and EU sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="c.384W.5/1">Throughout the Libya evacuation, our top priority was the safe and quick evacuation of British nationals and other eligible persons. The UK instigated the military multinational evacuation cell, based in Malta, to co-ordinate rescue efforts throughout the crisis. Whenever we sought a charter flight to support the evacuation, our brokers would return a number of options from different air operating companies. We made a selection on the basis of seat capacity, location of aircraft and price. Once our selected charter was confirmed, the broker informed the unsuccessful bidders. Because of the way the charter market works, it is not possible to hold other flights on reserve without paying significant costs. Following the FCO Review of Consular Evacuation Procedures, which I lodged in the Library on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-04">4 July</phrase>, we are examining the most cost-effective way of securing redundancy capacity, if we need it in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.387W.5/3">Olympic and Paralympic Games family members such as athletes, coaches and officials will be required to obtain accreditation for the Olympic or Paralympic Games before participating in the games, and will undergo a series of biographical security checks undertaken by the Home Office prior to being granted accreditation and receiving an Olympic or Paralympic identity and accreditation card.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/4">As a result of commitments given in the host city contract for the games, certain visa national games family members will be able to use the Olympic and Paralympic identity and accreditation card in lieu of a visa when it is presented with a valid national passport or other acceptable travel document during games time. Consequently, they will not need to apply for a visa to enter the UK and provide their fingerprints and facial image prior to travelling to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/5">UKBA will therefore collect the fingerprints and facial images at the UK border from visa national games family members to maintain a proportionate level of its usual security checks on this group of people during the games. The agency will only collect the fingerprints and facial image of visa national games family members that it identifies as not already possessing.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/6">We are currently taking secondary legislation through Parliament to provide UKBA with the power to collect the fingerprints and facial images of the visa national games family members who are able to use their accreditation card in lieu of visa.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/7">UKBA is also seeking to collect visa national games family members fingerprints and facial images before they travel to UK to take part in the games to reduce the amount of biometrics it needs to collect at the UK border during games time. A special visit visa, for which fingerprints and facial images have to be provided, is currently available to likely games family members, and we are also seeking to collect visa national games family members fingerprints and facial images on a voluntary basis overseas prior to games time.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/8">The fingerprints and facial images collected from visa national games family members will be stored for 10 years then destroyed. If prior to the lapse of 10 years the person becomes a British citizen their fingerprints and facial image will be destroyed. This retention period mirrors UKBA's business as usual biometrics retention policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.396W.12/1">The international financial assistance package for Ireland agreed in December 2010 included: a &#8364;22.5 billion loan from the IMF, of which &#8364;7.2 billion has been disbursed; a &#8364;22.5 billion loan from the EFSM, of which &#8364;11.4 billion has been disbursed; a &#8364;17.5 billion loan from the EFSF, of which &#8364;3.6 billion has been disbursed; and, &#8364;5 billion of bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.12/2">The UK's exposure breaks down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.12/3">A bilateral loan of &#163;3.227 billion is available to Ireland. The loan cannot be drawn until after the approval of the third quarterly review of Ireland's Memorandum of Understanding with the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission. The review is expected to take place in August.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.12/4">The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is financed by the European Commission raising funds on capital markets, guaranteed by the EU Budget. There is no direct impact on the EU Budget from any such borrowing by the Commission. Only in the event that a beneficiary member state defaults on loan repayments would the EU Budget be adversely affected. In those circumstances, member states would be liable for a share based on their contribution to the EU Budget at that time. Contributions to the EU Budget vary over time, mainly driven by the member states&#8217; share in the EU's Gross National Income. For this reason, it is not possible to state exactly the UK liability. As an illustrative example, based on contributions to the 2010 EU Budget, the UK's share would be approximately 14%.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.12/5">It is not possible to provide an estimate of the UK's contribution to specific IMF programmes. The UK contributes funds to the IMF as a whole rather than to any country-specific IMF programme. Our ultimate exposure to any IMF lending programme would be in line with our quota shareholding, i.e. around 4.5%.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.12/6">It is in our national interest that the Irish economy is successful and its banking system is stable. Ireland accounts for 6% of Britain's total exports&#8212;we export more to Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and China put together. By offering Ireland a bilateral loan, Britain is recognising the important economic relationship between Britain and Ireland, including between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="c.404W.8/1">The scope of the EC Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive has been problematic since its adoption at the end of 2002. There is no direct reference to an exemption for 'fixed installations' in the directive, but the European Commission's guidance does allow for one in its interpretation of Article 2.1.</p>
	<p pid="c.404W.8/2">The Department's understanding is that a simple electric shower fitted into a bathroom as a discrete or stand-alone unit would not be regarded as a fixed installation and would, therefore, be caught within the scope of the Directive and UK Regulations. A power shower that has controls in the bathroom but a remote pump and/or water heater fitted elsewhere in the building would be regarded as part of a fixed installation and, therefore, outside scope.</p>
	<p pid="c.404W.8/3">European negotiations on a recast of the original directive are underway and we are hoping for greater clarity on this and other scope issues once a new directive is agreed.</p>

	<p pid="c.404W.11/5">The allowance is available to Jobseekers Allowance customers who have been claiming for 26-weeks or more. Participants have access to a volunteer business mentor to provide guidance and support as they develop their business plan and through the early months of trading. Once a customer can demonstrate they have a viable business proposition with the potential for growth in the future, they can access financial support.</p>

	<p pid="c.404W.11/12">In July 2011 the Government announced the launch of a new mentoring scheme, developed in partnership with the private sector, to improve access to, and stimulate the demand for, mentoring. Developing and established businesses will now have access to more knowledge and support through a brand new web portal:</p>

An offer of independent counselling will be in addition to the assessment of whether there are grounds for an abortion under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended. All clinicians who provide abortion care should always undertake a discussion about the choices available to pregnant women and identify those who require more support in decision-making.</p>

New United Kingdom-wide physical activity guidelines were launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-11">11 July</phrase> as part of a UK Chief Medical Officers' report which details the latest evidence on the physical activity required to achieve general health benefits and prevent diseases, including some cancers. We will be publishing a document on obesity shortly after the summer. It will set out how obesity will be tackled in the new public health and national health service systems and the role of key partners. An alcohol strategy will follow later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.409W.3/4">The NHS cervical screening programme continues to play an important role in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer in women. The programme prevents cervical cancers by detecting and treating abnormalities which, if left undetected and untreated, may develop into cancer. Experts estimate it saves up to 4,500 lives per year. As set out in &#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221; (January 2011) we have committed to invest &#163;60 million between 2011 and 2014 to incorporate flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) into the NHS bowel screening programme. New evidence has shown that a one-off FS screening test for bowel cancer at age 55 can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer in people attending screening by 33%. Experts estimate FS will save around 3,000 lives every year.</p>

	<p pid="c.411W.2/1">Data on new diagnoses of dementia are not collected. However, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) collects each year the number of patients on the dementia register in general practices. The figures for the latest three years are shown in the following table.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.411W.2/4"> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><i>Number on dementia register</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.411W.2/11">We believe however that these figures underestimate the actual number of people in England who have dementia and it is estimated that approximately 650,000 people in England have the condition. Because of this level of under-diagnosis, one of the Government's priority objectives in implementing the National Dementia Strategy is increasing the early diagnosis of dementia.</p>

	<p pid="c.419W.5/2">The Department has allocated &#163;80,000 to work with the Women's Health and Equality Consortium on a project to agree specific actions to promote greater awareness of human trafficking and provide health professionals with guidance on how to respond to victims appropriately. The project is due to commence in summer 2011. As part of this work, the Department is seeking to provide more health services/professionals with the training and skills to refer potential victims directly into the National Referral Mechanism. The Department has also recognised the need for better understanding of the issues around health and trafficking and has therefore invited bids for research in this area, due to commence in 2011. The Royal College of General Practitioners has also been commissioned to develop an e-learning course on violence against women and children which will include trafficking.</p>
