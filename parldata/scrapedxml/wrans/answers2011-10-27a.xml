	<p pid="a.286W.6/1">All species of bats are afforded a very high level of protection through transposition of the EU Habitats Directive into UK law; this includes making it an offence to deliberately capture, injure or kill a bat or to damage or destroy a breeding or resting site. In addition, the very best sites for populations of greater and lesser horseshoe bats have been given further protection as sites of special scientific interest and special areas of conservation. Natural England works with landowners within agri-environment schemes to enhance the environment for both the lesser and greater horseshoe bat. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee and Natural England also provide financial support to the Bat Conservation Trust to co-ordinate the National Bat Monitoring Programme, which in turn provides annual population trend data. The latest data from 2010 suggests that the population of both species is increasing steadily.</p>

	<p pid="a.287W.6/1">The UK Government are committed to achieving genuine and radical reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). The European Commission's proposals for reform are a welcome start but we need to work with others&#8212;including member states, the European Parliament and the European Commission&#8212;to agree the changes necessary to deliver real reform. In particular, UK proposals are aimed at eliminating discards, decentralisation of decision-making, a more economically rational fisheries management system, greater integration of fisheries and environmental management, and also applying the principles of sustainable use both outside EU waters and within.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.2/1">Commission Communication (2000) 1, of <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-02">2 February 2000</phrase>, outlines the European Commission's approach to using the precautionary principle and establishes Commission guidelines for applying it, among other aims. This communication stresses the need for the precautionary principle to be considered within a structured approach which is made up of risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. In the communication the Commission recognises that one way of applying the precautionary principle is through the Community rules for prior approval of certain products before they are placed on the market, such as in the case of pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.2/2">Following the approval of pesticide active substances under the EU regulatory regime, pesticide products are authorised in the UK under the EU rules for national authorisations. As part of this process, the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (the Government body responsible for regulating pesticides) carries out checks to ensure the risks that can arise from the use of these products are not unacceptable. This will include an assessment of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment may be exposed to it. CRD routinely restrict the way products can be used (e.g. specifying dose rates, timing and place of application) to ensure protection of human health and the environment. Pesticide users are also legally obliged to take all reasonable precautions to protect the health of human beings, creatures and plants. As part of its role, CRD considers relevant scientific studies as they arise to see if they are relevant to UK authorisation, and continues to keep abreast of research and developments in other EU member states and elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.5/1">As pesticides are subject to a European regulatory regime, Ministers are keen that these issues are addressed through collaborative working across the international arena. Since this work was published, it has been considered in an international forum (the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry) (SETAC) which is developing the pesticides risk assessment for pollinators (honeybees and non-Apis bees) with a focus on 'non-Apis bees'. This forum recognised that the risk assessment scheme for honeybees did not cover non-Apis bees, and that the risk assessment approaches, studies and associated trigger values need to be further developed. Work is also ongoing with the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD). on 'other pollinators' under the Pesticides Effects on Insect Pollinators (PEIP) initiative. Government scientists and officials are already actively engaged in these major international initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.5/2">The new pesticides marketing Regulation (Regulation 1107/2009) introduces a requirement for consideration of the impact on biodiversity and the ecosystem as part of the approval criteria for active substances, as well as other new proposed data requirements. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are to produce revised guidance on aquatic ecotoxicology (including biodiversity consequences) by 2014. Other aspects of biodiversity will be addressed as relevant guidance (eg terrestrial ecotoxicology) is revised or developed by EFSA, and the SETAC and OECD work is expected to feed into this.</p>

	<p pid="a.296W.2/1">The Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD), which is part of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), is responsible for commissioning and publishing the results of the national pesticide residue testing programme in the UK. Around 3,500 samples of food are tested for a range of pesticides. All results are published on the HSE's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.2/2">Field crops are not tested. The monitoring programme tests mainly fresh food and some processed food at the point which it is available to consumers on the market for a range of pesticides. The table summarises when CRD last monitored food from the crops listed for the pesticides and gives the maximum residue levels (MRLs).</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.2/3">Due to the analytical difficulties associated with testing for Glyphosate and Glufosinate, analytical research (Project PS 2538) was undertaken and completed in 2009 to validate the analytical methods in a range of food including cereals and cereal based products. The outcomes of this research are published on the Science and Research section of the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.2/4">Maximum residue levels are established only for food which is sold for human consumption. However, when MRL's are set for food products derived from animals, the regulatory process takes into account the contribution of any residues from the animal feed.</p>

It is not the purpose of the DWPP to control consent standards from package treatment plants.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.2/2">The Environment Agency uses a risk-based approach when assessing consent compliance at package sewage treatment plants. Where a detrimental effect on the environment is suspected, visits are made and samples of the effluent are taken for analysis. If the Environment Agency finds that pollution of groundwater or surface water is being caused, or is likely to be caused, officials would initially discuss that with the permit holder to seek improvements such as maintenance. If necessary the permit can be reviewed.</p>

Once the review has been completed we will propose the way forward, probably around the turn of the year.

By 2014-15, Government expects that over 1.3 million low income pensioners will receive a &#163;140 rebate.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.0/3">For the Broader Group of the Warm Home Discount Scheme, suppliers have discretion over the eligibility criteria they use. They must target those in or at risk of fuel poverty and their eligibility criteria must be approved by OfGem. Those eligible will receive a rebate on their electricity bill. This is set at &#163;120 in 2011-12, rising to &#163;140 by 2014-15. Low income families and those with long term illnesses, disabilities and the elderly may be assisted. It is not possible to estimate the number of consumers eligible under the Broader Group, as eligibility will vary according to which energy supplier the consumer is registered with. The amount which the six participating energy supply companies must provide in the form of rebates to the Broader Group will also increase across the four years of the scheme. It must be a minimum of at least &#163;3 million in 2011-12, rising to &#163;47 million in 2012-13 and &#163;90 million in 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="a.300W.3/1">The overall spending target for the Warm Home Discount Scheme, set out in Schedule 1 of the Warm Home Discount Regulations 2011 (2011/1033), is &#163;1.1 billion over the four years of the scheme (2011-12 to 2014-15). This represents a significant increase in activity and funding on the 2008-10 voluntary agreement between the six major energy supply companies and Government which was worth &#163;375 million over three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.3/2">Energy suppliers are required by Regulation 7 of the Warm Home Discount Regulations 2011 to provide the proscribed rebate to all Core Group customers who the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" name="Christopher Huhne">the right hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase>, notifies them of, unless they provide an exception, as set out by the Secretary of State under Regulation 8. As a result, energy supply companies will be required to provide a rebate of &#163;120 to all customers notified to them in the Core Group this winter. Government estimates that over 600,000 low income pensioners will be provided with a rebate this winter. As the eligibility for the Core Group is widened, so the number assisted is expected to increase over the subsequent three years of the scheme. For the Broader Group of the Warm Home Discount Scheme, suppliers have discretion over the eligibility criteria they use. They must target those in or at risk of fuel poverty and their eligibility criteria must be approved by OfGem. &#163;3 million has been allocated for the energy suppliers to provide &#163;120 Broader Group rebates in 2011-12. To ensure a smooth transition from the previous Voluntary Agreement, &#163;140 million has been allocated for Legacy Spending in 2011-12, for suppliers to continue to provide discounted and social tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.3/3">The level of expenditure required under the Broader Group will increase with each scheme year. It will rise to &#163;47 million in 2012-13, as spending on legacy tariffs decreases, and to &#163;90 million in 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="a.302W.9/1">The current legislative framework is intended to provide a balance between rights and responsibilities for landlords and tenants. We therefore have no plans to change tenure arrangements in the sector. Private rents are market led and, therefore, significantly driven by housing supply. Excessive regulation would drive up rents and reduce choice for tenants. Rent controls, historically, resulted in the size of the private rented sector shrinking from 55% of households in 1939 to just 8% in the late 1980s. Rent controls also meant that many landlords could not afford to improve or maintain their homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.313W.2/1">The principal objective for the transposition of European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes is to comply with UK Treaty obligations to transpose the provisions of the new directive into UK legislation fully and appropriately. Where this requires the strengthening of current legislation we will do so. Article 2 to the new directive allows member states to retain stricter national provisions in force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-09">9 November 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.2/2">The recent public consultation on the options for transposition of the new directive which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-05">5 September 2011</phrase> sought views on which measures should be retained in United Kingdom legislation using Article 2. We are now analysing the responses to the consultation and will announce decisions on options in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.316W.3/2">The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) is not aware of any confirmed losses of rape case files by itself or by the Interpol Bureau within SOCA. There is one instance where the original case papers relating to the UK end of an investigation into a sexual offence, alleged to have occurred overseas against a British citizen, were not transferred to the relevant overseas authority. Duplicate case papers have been transferred to the relevant authority in the overseas jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.3/3">An investigation, supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, is currently under way into how this apparent failure occurred, including whether the case papers were transferred between the relevant agencies within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.3/4">Since May 2011, UK police forces have been able to send &#8220;Transfer of Crime&#8221; material, including rape cases, directly to overseas partners on behalf of the Interpol Bureau. Prior to that, such material, initially processed by police forces, was sent through the Interpol Bureau in SOCA. Once received by SOCA cases were normally processed in less than a week. Allegations of rape would be treated as urgent.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.3/5">The Home Office does not hold any information on the average length of time taken for cases involving the alleged rape of a British citizen in an EU country or in countries outside the EU to reach trial or a conclusion.</p>

We are instead working to strengthen fundraising skills and boost levels of giving across all regions of England. We have established a &#163;100 million match funding programme to create endowments and cultivate philanthropy. We have introduced new tax measures to incentivise legacy giving and gifts of pre-eminent objects to public collections. We have strengthened public recognition for those who give, including through the honours system. We have arranged master classes across the country by world-leading fundraisers, and we have published a Giving White Paper. All of these measures will benefit the entire country.</p>

These figures only reflect cases where CICA reduced the award due to unspent convictions, which the current compensation scheme says they must do.

	<p pid="a.328W.8/1">As a member of the Inter-Ministerial Group on Violence Against Women and Girls, the Ministry of Justice supports the general definition of domestic violence as agreed by that group in 2004, which is:</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.8/2">&#8220;any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.8/3">This current cross-government definition is also quoted in the guidance manual for Specialist Domestic Violence Court systems for partners, including the independent domestic violence advisers, to determine how they will identify domestic violence cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.8/4">Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 which provides for civil remedies against domestic violence, does not specifically use the term &#8220;domestic violence&#8221;. Under that legislation, orders can be obtained to protect a person &#8220;associated&#8221; with the alleged perpetrator from &#8220;molestation&#8221;. Molestation is not defined but covers a wide range of conduct including but not limited to physical violence (for example, it would include pestering and harassing a person). &#8220;Associated persons&#8221; is defined in the Act and covers a very wide range of relationships, including &#8220;intimate personal relationships&#8221; of significant duration.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.8/5">Similarly, the pre-application protocol for family mediation information and assessment meetings which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April</phrase> simply sets out that if a client has made an allegation of domestic violence (ie they have been subjected to any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse be it psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) against another party and this has resulted in a police investigation or the issuing of civil proceedings for the protection of any party within the last 12 months then that client will be exempt from the need to attend a mediation information and assessment meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.8/6">The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill employs a broad definition of &quot;abuse&quot; in providing for legal aid to be available for private family law cases involving domestic violence or child abuse, and for cases relating to abuse of a child or vulnerable adult. The definition in the Bill would not exclude from scope any of the types of abuse covered by the general definition of domestic violence agreed by the Inter-Ministerial Group. To avoid creating an incentive for false allegations, applicants for funding will be required to provide objective evidence of domestic violence, as set out in the Government's response to the consultation &#8220;Proposals for the reform of legal aid in England and Wales&#8221;. The circumstances that would be accepted as evidence of abuse will turn on the application by the courts, prosecutors and other agencies of their existing criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.8/7">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) domestic violence abuse programmes are designed for adult male offenders who are or were in intimate heterosexual relationships when the violence or abuse occurred. &quot;Violence&quot; in this context means any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) and in this context an intimate relationship means a sexual relationship.</p>

	<p pid="a.330W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.8/2">(i) For the Social Impact Bond at HMP Peterborough, the Government, together with the Big Lottery Fund, will pay for results if the frequency of reconviction events for &lt;12 month sentenced prisoners released from HMP Peterborough falls by 10% in one of the three 1,000-offender cohorts, or by an aggregate of 7.5% across the three cohorts together, compared to matched control groups. If these thresholds are not achieved, no payment will be made. The frequency of reconviction events is the number of times an offender is convicted at court during the 12 months following release from prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.8/3">(ii) The success criteria adopted for the pilot at HMP Doncaster is a binary measure based on offenders' proven reoffending. Reoffending will be measured using the reconviction rate, which is defined as the percentage of offenders that commit an offence during the 12 months following discharge from HMP Doncaster, and which is proved by a court conviction during this period or in the subsequent six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.8/4">Once the results from each year of the pilot are available, Serco will only be able to retain 100% of the annual contract value if the one-year reconviction rate for that year has been reduced by at least five percentage points against an agreed baseline, determined by the 2009 reoffending data for the prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.8/5">If this target is not met, 10% of the contract price will be reclaimed by the Ministry of Justice. If the target is exceeded, Serco will receive an additional payment for each extra percentage point reduction, up to a maximum reduction of 10 percentage points.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.8/6">(iii) We are running Local Justice Reinvestment pilots in Greater Manchester and in five London boroughs for two years&#8212;these pilots are also referred to as Local Approaches to Payment by Results. No payments will be made to the test areas unless demand on the justice system, measured through Ministry of Justice agencies, falls by 5% or 10% against baseline for adult and youth systems respectively. The reduction in demand will be calculated according to a series of demand metrics at the end of each year of the two-year pilot, and used to determine any payments to the pilot areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.0/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June 2011</phrase>, the most recent available data, there were <i>(a)</i> 332 and <i>(b)</i> 59 prisoners under sentence for murder and rape respectively in category D prisons in England and Wales.

	<p pid="a.332W.0/2">The numbers of such prisoners held in category D/open conditions will depend on how many of those prisoners pass the necessary robust risk assessment and the availability of spaces in the open prison estate at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/3">All murderers and many serious sexual offenders will be serving indeterminate sentences. Depending on the minimum sentence or &#8220;tariff&#8221; and the risk they pose, such prisoners, move through their sentence via a series of progressive transfers into lower security establishments in the closed prison estate. The decision to transfer indeterminate sentenced prisoners (ISPs) to open conditions is a categorisation decision which is a matter for the Secretary of State for Justice. The Secretary of State may take this decision after seeking advice from the Parole Board or executively where the prisoners have demonstrated exceptional progress in closed conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/4">Indeterminate sentence prisoners are normally considered for recategorisation to open conditions no earlier than three years before the end of their tariff.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/5">Moving indeterminate sentence prisoners to open conditions is an important part of the offender's rehabilitation. It tests their suitability for eventual release whilst still maintaining many of the restrictions of a closed prison. Should the offender's behaviour in open conditions give rise to concerns, he/she can be returned to closed conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/6">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has recently implemented measures to reduce delays in the process of moving indeterminate sentence prisoners to open conditions where such a move has already been approved by the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.3/1">The figures requested are provided in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.3/2">Figures are not available on the number of qualified probation officers performing an assistant chief officer role. Figures provided for assistant chief officers therefore relate to all assistant chief officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.3/3">All probation areas became probation trusts by <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>; this included a number of areas merging to become trusts. Two tables have therefore been provided that show snapshots of staff in post before and after the mergers. Surrey and Sussex submitted merged data one month before their merger; figures provided for them for 2009-10 are therefore merged.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.3/4">Data was unavailable for some areas/trusts within the periods in question due to local technical/staffing issues. Where there is missing data, the latest available figures they submitted at that point in time have been included within the relevant year. This is applicable to Cheshire (September 2008 figures included within the 2008-09 figures); West Mercia (November 2009 figures included within the 2009-10 figures); Derbyshire (March 2011 figures included within the 2011-12 figures).</p>

	<p pid="a.336W.2/1">Providers of probation services in England and Wales will be subject to the requirements of the Probation Qualification Framework (PQF) in the same way as Probation Trusts. This means that they will be obliged to provide induction training for all offender facing staff and professional qualification training for Probation Services Officers (PSO), Probation Officers or equivalent staff. The quality of the training will be assessed by the Probation Qualification Assurance Board as part of the contract monitoring process.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.2/2">Other training proposals will be scrutinised via the competition process to ensure that staff are competent to deliver services and manage the appropriate level of risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.341W.0/1">Access to Work provides vital support to help disabled people get and keep employment. We want as many disabled people as possible to know this support is available. The recent Sayce review recommended changes that will increase the number of people who are able to benefit from Access to Work and raise awareness about its availability among disabled people and employers. A public consultation following the review has just closed and we will be considering ideas and reactions from that consultation and publishing a statement in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.0/2">During the Sayce consultation period two Access to Work events were held, one in Manchester for Third Sector organisations and Access to Work Users and a further meeting in London for employers of disabled people. The attendee list at both events was extensive and featured many recognisable names.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.0/3">Also from <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December 2010</phrase>, disabled job seekers have been able to find out immediately if they are eligible for Access to Work support by completing a short on-line questionnaire at:</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.0/4"><a href="http://www.Direct.gov.uk">www.Direct.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.341W.0/5">If eligible, they are then able to print off a new Pre-Employment Eligibility Letter which will help build their confidence when applying for jobs and can be shown to prospective employers. This delivers the commitments in the coalition programme to reform Access to Work, so that disabled people can apply for jobs with funding already secured for any adaptations and equipment they will need.</p>

	<p pid="a.341W.3/1">The Department occupies the vast majority of its properties under the terms of a 20-year PFI contract with Telereal Trillium, for which it pays a unitary charge in return for fully fitted and serviced accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.3/2">The unitary charge includes works carried out over the life cycle of the accommodation which contain an element of refurbishment that cannot be disaggregated from overall expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.3/3">Some refurbishments are not covered by the unitary charge and are funded separately as capital expenditure. This is because it would not be practical or demonstrate value for money for the taxpayer if the contractor were to price into the unitary charge the potential business change volumes.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.3/4">Any business-driven changes to the estate would fall into this category such as in 2010-11, for example, when Jobcentre Plus initiated the Response to the Economic Downturn project, which converted primarily back of the house space to temporary front of the house space in order to support more jobseekers.</p>

This covered a total of 52 projects. Full details are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.3/18">The 52 projects are proposed and funded by the business unit e.g. Jobcentre Plus.

	<p pid="a.345W.5/1">The Department considers socio-economic factors in the initial stages of contracting using Sustainable Procurement Risk Assessment Methodology which considers the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), opportunities for apprenticeships, the implications for diversity and equality as well as for climate change and sustainability. Where relevant and proportionate, appropriate contractual terms are included at contract award to monitor supplier performance in these areas during contract delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.5/2">The Department has a policy that supports the UK social and economic agenda by ensuring that DWP jobs are not offshored. In addition the Department's policy also requires that any supplier, either when tendering for contracts or wishing to make changes to arrangements during the life of a contract, has to submit detailed proposals and gain DWP written approval if they have any intention of offshoring work or data.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.5/3">DWP supports the Government target of 25% of Government spend via SMEs by 2015. SMEs are considered to have more potential for growth and are more likely to be innovative in contract delivery. The effect of this policy is more employment leading to an increase in taxation revenue for the Exchequer and a reduction in benefit payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.5/4">The Department's commercial strategy commits to improving Value For Money (VFM) through cost reduction and cost avoidance activity. In line with Cabinet Office policy, pre audit VFM savings for the financial year 2010-11 were &#163;432 million of which &#163;180 million were cash releasing and &#163;252 million related to VFM activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.5/5">The Department leads on the introduction of frameworks which improve VFM for other Government Departments (OGDs) and also leads on cross-government VFM activity through its Crown Commercial Representative.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.5/6">The use of DWP assets by OGDs also saves substantial resources, for example resource management (RM) system which delivers strategic resource management solutions for the Department and OGDs and the customer information system (CIS), an intelligent IT database which generates significant VFM for the Department and OGDs.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.5/7">The Department retains ownership of intellectual property rights as part of the standard legal terms and conditions used when contracting. This enables revenue to be generated for the Exchequer (or contract costs reduced) on occasions where it is appropriate for intellectual property rights to be sold. While not directly linked to contracts it awards, the Department also considers raising revenue for the Exchequer by using the Wider Markets Initiative to generate income from its assets, where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.346W.2/1">The Department plans to realise substantial efficiency savings over the period of the spending review through measures which will deliver both savings and improved customer service, as well as focussing its resources on key reforms of the welfare system such as the introduction of universal credit. These plans include a reduction in the size of the corporate centre by up to 40%, and parallel measures to reduce the costs of benefits processing by 25% through streamlining and modernising frontline activities. These measures include, for example, shifting from paper to digital based services and sharing information more efficiently within and between Departments. Specific actions to improve the efficiency, ease and speed of the Department's frontline activities are included in the business plan.</p>

We have yet to settle on the precise details of how the transition will work, and the effects on housing benefits staff.

	<p pid="a.351W.5/1">Universal credit will be introduced in October 2013, and individuals will be migrated to the new system over the subsequent four years. Experience of previous reforms and transformation programmes has shown that thorough operational testing is essential prior to a wide ranging implementation. As such we will deploy this 'pathfinder' approach on the universal credit programme. We will do so in good time to ensure lessons learnt can be incorporated into wider implementation plans and delivery processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.351W.5/2">Additionally, as part of the work to build the new system, claimants are being engaged in its design through frequent sessions in which they are asked to respond to both high level design thinking and detailed service design. There will be significant levels of testing specifically focused on ensuring that the various components work effectively together, including realistic business testing.</p>

We are trialling data matching this year to see if it will help to get more people onto the electoral register.

Government do not set targets for apprenticeships but provides funding and forecasts the overall number of places that may be afforded. Apprenticeships are paid jobs, therefore we rely on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities to meet local demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.5/2">In the last five years 180,000 people started an apprenticeship in engineering and manufacturing technologies.

	<p pid="a.354W.8/2">The 2009 National Employer Skills Survey identified that small businesses tend to have a higher proportion of total vacancies that are skills shortage vacancies. That is why the Department has launched a number of targeted measures to support smaller businesses to recruit new employees and up skill existing employees more easily.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.8/3">This includes improving the information and guidance for small businesses on businesslink.gov, including how to access skills support. In addition, we fund a leadership and management programme for senior leaders of small to medium size enterprises to help them develop their own personal leadership and management skills so they are better able to create a high performing, innovative workplace and to improve the skills of their work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.8/4">This Government are also taking action to make it easier for small businesses to take on apprenticeships. As well as increasing funding to deliver some 360,000 apprenticeships this year, the Government have introduced new quality standards, cut red tape and boosted the number of advanced level apprenticeships to deliver the skills employers need to drive growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.355W.5/2">At worst, UK businesses could be forced to pay the most favoured nation tariff to export goods to the EU. In 2009, the simple average EU MFN tariff was 5.3%. But it is possible the UK would be granted some form of preferential access, whereby UK business would pay less than the full MFN tariff. In either case, tariff payments would also depend on the precise pattern of trade in any given year. In addition, estimating the extra administrative burdens associated with completing customs declarations, claiming preferential tariff treatment or other non-tariff costs of exporting goods and services to the EU could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.356W.3/1">The primary responsibility for the validity, veracity and completeness of the information in the annual reports of UK companies rests with the directors. Shareholders should also be actively engaged in holding directors to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.3/2">For larger companies, external auditors will express an opinion on whether the annual accounts give a true and fair view; have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework; and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The auditor must report on whether in his opinion the information given in the directors' report is consistent with those accounts. Statutory auditors are themselves independently monitored.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.3/3">In addition listed companies are covered by the Listing Rules, made by the UK Listing Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.3/4">The Financial Reporting Review Panel proactively reviews a sample of public company and large private company accounts for compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act. Where there is, or may be, a question of non-compliance, the panel engages with companies with a view to seeking corrective action where necessary. In addition, both the panel and Companies House respond to concerns raised. Where appropriate the Secretary of State for Business, Information and Skills can use powers under the Companies Acts to conduct confidential, fact-finding investigations into the activities of live limited companies anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.3/5">Official receivers and insolvency practitioners are required to investigate the circumstances of failure of companies and establish why they have become insolvent. This could uncover evidence of inappropriately prepared reports and accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.3/6">Directors of limited companies are required to deliver accounts and reports to the Registrar of Companies under the Companies Act 2006. If a company fails to deliver its accounts and reports by the appropriate date all persons who are directors of the company immediately before the end of the reporting period are guilty of an offence; unless they can prove that they took all reasonable steps to comply with the requirements before the end of the period. Companies House send reminder letters and e-mails before accounts become due to help companies comply with their filing requirements. If companies fail to file on time, Companies House commences enforcement action, which can ultimately result in the prosecution of directors. When a company delivers accounts late, an automatic civil late filing penalty is imposed. The latest figures show (September 2011) that over 92% of active companies deliver accounts on time and 99% of active companies have an up to date set of accounts filed at Companies House. These are among the highest compliance rates of any company registry in the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.360W.2/1">The Department worked closely with the Cabinet Office and other Departments to produce the Government's Social Mobility Strategy in April 2011. This strategy set out our overall approach for tackling social mobility and provided details of the specific steps that the Department would be taking to support this.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.2/2">Investing in people's skills through education and training is a key driver of improved life chances. That is why we are committed to establishing clear career progression routes built on well-respected vocational qualifications and our expanded Apprenticeships programme is at the heart of this: funding in financial year 2011/12 will increase to over &#163;1.4 billion; we will increase the quality of apprenticeships through new national standards; and, the Access to Apprenticeships pathway will benefit up to 10,000 vulnerable young people aged between16-24. The National Career Service, to be launched in April 2012, will help people to find the most appropriate route to suit their personal needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.2/3">For some people, entering the labour market and progressing can be a huge challenge and need substantial help and guidance to develop their skills acquisition and progress to sustainable employment with prospects. Our reforms to further education, published in our Skills for Sustainable Growth strategy and in the New Challenges, New Chances consultation, mean that funding of further education and training is fairer by refocusing it on those that need it most. My Department is working with DFE and DWP on the Participation Strategy, which will be published in November and set out how we intend to maximise the number of young people in education training and employment. In addition, our commitment to Informal Adult and Community Learning can provide the initial stepping stone people need to further.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.2/4">Our reforms to promote fairer access to higher education were set out in the White Paper &#8220;Students at the Heart of the System&#8221; (June 2011). To help make progress in the numbers of young people entering higher education from disadvantaged backgrounds, and in particular to the most selective universities, we are establishing a new framework, which places more responsibility on universities and colleges to widen participation. Universities and colleges that charge more than &#163;6,000 for tuition will need new access agreements that demonstrate to the satisfaction of the independent Director of Fair Access what more they will do to attract and retain students from under-represented and disadvantaged groups. They will also need to participate in the new National Scholarship Programme from 2012 and provide matched funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.2/5">Further information on the specific commitments, milestones and success indicators are provided in the Social Mobility Strategy.</p>
