	<p pid="a.277W.12/1">Four targets were set, and significant progress has been made in all four areas, as follows. In particular, for the second year running the two Houses have reduced their carbon emissions. Two of the targets were missed and further work will be needed to meet the demanding targets set for future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.12/2">Carbon emissions: The target was to reduce carbon emissions (resulting from energy consumption) by 7% by 2010-11, relative to 2008-09. For the second year running the two Houses reduced their absolute emissions but this year the target was missed by 1.0%. The target does not take account of space heating requirements and so this measure was considerably affected by the winter weather conditions. When weather factors are taken into account the reduction beat the target by 0.7%.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.12/3">Water: The target was to reduce water consumption by 12% by 2010-11, relative to 2008-09 which was exceeded. Consumption was reduced by 18.0% on 2008-09 levels. The main contributor was the more efficient use of borehole water for cooling in Portcullis house.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.12/4">Waste generation: The target was to reduce the volume of waste generated by 10% by 2010-11, relative to 2008-09, which the two Houses exceeded. Weight of waste was down 20% on base year.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.12/5">Recycling: The target was to recycle 60% of waste generated by weight by 2010-11. Although the rate of recycling was improved, at 49.2% it fell short of the target. Performance has declined due to reduction in reported amount of glass recycled; the cause continues to be investigated but appears to be due to incorrect historic data from the contractor. The new waste contract due to be awarded this summer will require the provider to work in partnership with the authorities in the two Houses to meet our waste recycling targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.6/1">The Government have recognised the issue of inward migration and the potential difficulties that this can cause in some areas. In the past, population figures did not accurately reflect the extent of general immigration. However, for the first time Formula Grant is informed by more accurate and timely population estimates developed through Phase 1 of the Migration Statistics Improvement Programme. This means that those areas that have experienced increased population growth over recent years will receive a larger grant allocation. At the same time, the Government have reduced ring fencing and ended costly central reporting requirements. These changes mean local authorities themselves will be able in future to decide how best to address the impacts of immigration on their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.6/2">The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (Mr Hague), recognises the difficulties some local authorities are experiencing as a result of specifically Nepalese migration. He has met with representatives from Rushmoor borough council to discuss this, and has offered to speak to the Local Government Association to see how local authorities can work together to attract those settling in this country to a wider area. The Cross Government Working Group on Gurkhas has also been reconvened at the Prime Minister's request to continue to monitor the concerns and challenges created by the 2009 immigration policy change for Gurkhas.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.6/3">Local authorities have powers, under the Housing Act 2004, to assess the risks and hazards in residential properties using the Housing Health and Safety Rating System. If a property is found to contain serious (category 1) hazards, the local authority has a duty to take the most appropriate action. This could range from trying to deal with the problems informally at first to prohibiting the use of the whole or part of the dwelling. This system provides an important safety net, ensuring that homes are safe and free of hazards which pose a significant risk to the occupant. It is in local authority's interests to collect information across all housing tenures through housing condition surveys and to decide on the best approach for their area.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.3/2">We continue to discuss the situation in Syria with our international partners including in the middle east, at the UN and within the European Union. In those discussions we underline the importance of condemning the violence against civilians who are expressing their views in peaceful protests, the need for the Syrian authorities to show restraint and to respond to the legitimate demands of people with immediate and genuine reform, not brutal repression.</p>
	<p pid="a.285W.3/3">The UK was heavily engaged in the European Union decision to impose a travel ban and assets freeze on 13 individuals in the Syrian regime who are responsible for the violence. On Friday the Syrian ambassador to London was told that if the violence does not stop immediately and all political prisoners are released, the EU would take further measures including sanctions targeted at the highest levels of the Government. Alongside this action in the EU we are working to convince others that the UN Security Council should send an unequivocal message of condemnation of the situation and call for urgent political reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.6/2">Worldwide, the Government are committed to combating violence and discrimination against LGBT people as an integral part of their international human rights work. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has a clear programme for promoting the human rights of LGBT people which focuses on the decriminalisation of homosexuality and fighting against discrimination. This includes taking action on individual cases where discrimination has occurred; lobbying for changes in discriminatory practices and laws; and supporting LGBT human rights defenders during gay pride events, some of whom face hostile receptions and violence.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" name="Theresa May">the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)</phrase>, on policy issues that affect both Departments and it is not usual practice to disclose the content of those meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.3/2">The Ministry of Justice and the Home Office worked with the Department for Transport to develop proposals to introduce a fixed penalty notice (FPN) for the offence of careless driving and to increase the level of certain road traffic FPNs, as set out in the Department for Transport's recently published Strategic Framework for Road Safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.3/3">There are a number of FPN schemes in operation across a wide range of offences which provide the police and other enforcement agencies with the means to deal quickly and effectively with low-level offending. Among these are the penalty notice for disorder (PND) scheme and FPNs for a number of road traffic offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.3/4">The aim of the PND scheme is to allow the police to impose a swift financial punishment in response to low-level, nuisance behaviour which provides a practical deterrent to future offending. The initial payment rate for PNDs was 53% in 2009. Unpaid PNDs are registered as fines by the courts and are indistinguishable from other fines. The overall payment rate for all fines in the financial year to March 2011 was 93%, and the payment rate excluding the value of administrative cancellations for the same period was 80%. 76% of adults and 67% of youths who received a PND in 2008 did not go on to reoffend within one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.3/5">Fixed penalties for offences in respect of a vehicle provide a quick and simple way of dealing with those offences that do not require prosecution, but do require some formal action. In addition and where appropriate, police officers can offer offending drivers the opportunity to attend, at their own expense, an educational course as an alternative to paying the fixed penalty amount and receiving the associated penalty points. This helps people become better drivers and further reduces pressure on the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="a.292W.2/1">The Cabinet Office during 2010-11 implemented a wide range of measures to reduce cost which will provide benefits throughout the spending review period. Key among these has been the creation of the Efficiency and Reform Group, which has brought together a range of functions allowing it to drive substantial efficiencies and reforms in civil service HR, ICT, commercial and procurement, estates and other support functions. The ERG has also changed the way in which these functions are carried out as between the Centre and Departments, allowing it over the two years to <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-31">31 March 2012</phrase> to reduce the headcount and cost of its aggregated functions by around one-third. The ERG has now embarked on substantial reforms of arrangements for learning and development within the civil service, affecting the National School for Government; for procurement by Government Departments, affecting Buying Solutions; and government marketing and advertising, affecting the Central Office of Information.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/2">Further savings will come from changes to the structure of and programmes run by the Office for Civil Society (OCS). Some functions of the former Social Exclusion Taskforce ceased when OCS was formed. These included responsibility for social exclusion policy and a number of community-related grant programmes (e.g. grassroots grants, community assets fund) which have now been realigned with this Government's priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/3">Elsewhere within the Department, other structural changes have flowed from the review of arm's length bodies. In particular, two sponsored non-departmental public bodies (Capacitybuilders and Commissioner for the Compact) have also been closed. There have also been smaller scale changes within the National Security Secretariat flowing from the creation of the National Security Council and Office of Cyber Security, and publication of this Government's National Security Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.294W.18/1">The opening quota for the 10 metre and under fleet is boosted by fisheries administrations acquiring additional quota in-year for their use. Information on the under 10 metre fleet's share of quota at <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase> is in Table 1. However, focusing on such an analysis can be misleading, as some of the quota stocks included are of little interest to inshore vessels. In addition, many of these vessels catch types of fish, such as crabs and scallops, which are not subject to the constraints on their activity that may be seen when targeting quota species. Figures for landings of quota stocks and non-quota stocks are also included in the table and show that 79% of all landings by the UK 10 metre and under fleet in 2010 were of non-quota stocks.</p>

	<p pid="a.298W.2/1">A comprehensive EU regulatory framework to contain, prevent and, thereby, reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) from equipment such as refrigeration and heat pumps is already in place having been fully implemented since 2009 in Great Britain by the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/261). However, this framework stops short of controls to phase down the production of the gases themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.2/2">There are existing proposals at an international level to use the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to phase down the production and use of HFCs. This would affect all types of equipment, not just refrigeration and heat pumps. The UK Government remains supportive, in principle, of an international phase-down of production and consumption of HFCs but there are many technical issues to be discussed before any formal negotiations on a phase-down could take place. The Government will continue to push for the development of a phase-down agreement at the upcoming Montreal Protocol and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meetings, and support this aim. Further detailed analysis of impacts of the proposals will also be conducted.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.2/3">The latest estimate of HFC emissions from refrigeration, based on the assessment by the consultants AEA, available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.2/4"><a href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/documents/hfc-aeat101005.pdf">http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/documents/hfc-aeat101005.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.298W.2/5">was 4,336.7 kt CO2e in 2009<sup>(1)</sup>. The latest projections of HFC emissions from refrigeration in 2030 is 1,693.9 kt CO2e.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.2/6">The AEA study also estimated that 0.06 kt CO2 eq. of HFC 134a would be emitted from heat pumps in 2009, rising to 0.16 kt CO2 eq. of HFC134a by 2025. It should be noted that these estimates are highly uncertain, and are very small in relation to HFC emissions from the other sectors. These estimates of emissions are currently not included in either the main F-gas model or the UK national greenhouse gas emission totals, and further work is needed to refine the fundamental parameters before the emissions from this sector can be included.</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.6/1">The Government have two key aims in their reform of the student immigration system: to tackle abuse of the student system and support work on reducing migration to sustainable levels. The independent school sector is a highly regulated part of the education sector, with independent schools subject to statutory regulation, overseen by the relevant Departments and inspectorates responsible for education across the UK. In our experience of operating Tier 4, the independent school sector has demonstrated good levels of compliance with immigration requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.6/2">Independent schools primarily use the Tier 4 (Child) category as the majority of their pupils are aged between four and 17-years-old, using the Tier 4 (General) category for the very small number of pupils who need to apply to the UK Border Agency once aged 18 or over. Independent schools have therefore been excluded from the interim limit on the number of Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies they may assign under Tier 4 (General) between <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-21">21 April 2011</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-05">5 April 2012</phrase>, because of the low levels of abuse and small numbers using the Tier 4 (General) category when compared with other sectors which are not subject to statutory regulation, have higher levels of non-compliance and higher numbers of students attending institutions within the sector.</p>

This made recommendations for improving the work capability assessment including making greater provision for individuals awaiting or in between courses of chemotherapy, those receiving residential treatment for drug or alcohol misuse and individuals with severe mental health conditions or communication difficulties. The review also made recommendations to take greater account of how an individual has adapted to their condition and to simplify some of the descriptors.

	<p pid="a.318W.5/3">The strategy embodies our determination to tackle child poverty, as set out in the coalition's Programme for Government. It sets out how our radical reform programme will help to transform people's lives and break cycles of disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.318W.5/4">Our strategy focuses on the most vulnerable groups in society recognising that to help children who live in poverty we must; reform welfare to make work pay and helping those who are struggling to enter the labour market. We will give dignity to those who cannot be expected to work by bringing forward proposals to reform disability payments. For those who are able to work, we will provide targeted help to get the best outcomes for them and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.318W.5/5">We will do all in our power to increase the life chances of children by supporting vulnerable families through expanding the network of health visitors, targeting child care for the most disadvantaged and investing in early intervention. By increasing standards in education, we will raise children's aspirations and narrow the gaps in attainment which play such a crucial role in defining children's future lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.318W.5/6">The strategy sets out a new, broader approach to measurement that goes beyond a narrow focus on income targets. We will develop better ways to measure poverty, including responding to Frank Field's recommendations on severe poverty and life chances indicators, to better capture the experience of living in poverty and reflect the Government's overarching commitment to increasing social mobility.</p>

	<p pid="a.320W.0/1">The most recently published figures are set out in the following tables 1 and 2. They show that there are still 2.6 million children in relative poverty in the United Kingdom. The gap between the poorest and richest in our society has accelerated over the last five years despite &#163;150 billion having been spent on tax credits alone since 2003-04 leaving Britain more divided than it has been in a generation because of a failure to tackle the root causes of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-05">5 April</phrase>, the Government published the first national child poverty strategy, &#8216;A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families' Lives&#8217;. This strategy draws together policies from right across Government, as well as looking at the role of partners outside of national government, which will act together to tackle the causes and effects of child poverty. The strategy illustrates our radical new approach, including key structural reforms, to get to the root of tackling child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.0/3">The Government remain committed to their goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="a.321W.2/1">In the Pension Disability and Carers Service (PDCS) we have existing specific learning provided by the Professionalism in Decision Making and Appeals (PIDMA) body within the former Disability and Carers Service (DCS). The course is Understanding Working Age and Child Customers which has a section on understanding the impact of a learning disability specifically covering Autistic spectrum disorders. This course is for all appropriate disability living allowance and attendance allowance decision making staff and covers all the issues to consider when deciding on entitlement to the benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/2">Additionally we are currently building a modified and updated version of that learning product for our local service customer liaison managers (CLMs) to reflect their newly widened responsibilities for dealing with visits, where required, to all of the Department's &#8220;vulnerable client groups&#8221;. CLMs have received the existing PIDMA course above in the interim as part of the preparation for implementation for the new service. The new course is intended to build on that by providing learning more specifically tailored to visiting officers and part of a whole suite of new learning products for Local Service to be delivered from autumn 2011 onwards. Consequently, this learning does cover the issues visiting officers need to cover with the families of children with Autism. For example, topics included are:</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/3" class="italic">Common:</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/4">Identifying needs that might arise from childhood impairments</p>

	<p pid="a.321W.2/14">Local Service is the only direct customer facing service within PDCS. All other customer interaction is via correspondence, telephone or the internet with the sole exception of dealing with certain complaints, where face to face contact is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/15">Disability living allowance is paid on the basis of a persons need for help with care and mobility. It is not, in general, paid in respect of a particular diagnosis such as Autism. decision makers from the Pensions Disability and Carers Service, make decisions based upon the information supplied by the customer, in many cases using supporting evidence, for example a factual report from the applicants GP, to determine whether the applicants care and/or mobility needs are sufficient to justify an award.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/16">Jobcentre Plus is committed to providing individual tailored support to customers with autistic spectrum conditions using our services. We make required reasonable adjustments, including making use of the most suitable environment or premises for conducting interviews. Where individual customers ask us to we work with their families and representatives to facilitate access and participation with our services.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/17">Where family members are carers Jobcentre Plus will help support them so they are not forced into hardship by their role. Our Care Partnership Managers help develop services for carers by working in partnership with relevant organisations, assessing demand for support and encouraging the development of local services such as replacement care. They ensure advisers have comprehensive up to date knowledge, skills and local information in order to provide effective support for carers who would like to combine work with their caring responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/18">We ensure our advisers are aware of the need to make suitable adjustments for people with autistic spectrum conditions. Our specialist disability employment advisers receive additional skills training including provision about autism.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/19">Our Raising The Game On Disability Seminars also promote disability awareness and confidence and are available to all Jobcentre Plus staff. The seminars feature advice on working with customers with Autism.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/20">In addition, if a person is in receipt of attendance allowance or DLA care component at the middle or highest rate, a second person, who may or may not be a family member, may be able to claim carer's allowance provided they satisfy the conditions of entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.2/21">In Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (CMEC) one of the Commission's values is being client focused. In order to provide a first class service, we need to ensure our services are accessible to them.

	<p pid="a.326W.5/2">Only a small proportion of HMRC officers receive physical self-defence training. The total number is approximately 1,250 individuals, some 2% of total HMRC staffing.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.5/3">The vast majority of those who receive training do so because they are required to conduct arrests using the powers contained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, or equivalent powers in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The remainder are trained because the risk assessment relating to their work indicates that such training is necessary for their own safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.5/4">The Department currently has eight senior instructors, who are trained by the National Police Improvement Agency (NPIA) in the ACPO-approved Personal Safety Techniques curriculum. This incurred a one-off cost of approximately &#163;1,500 per senior instructor. By successfully completing this training, these officers are accredited &#8220;trainers of trainers&#8221;, so they are able to train and accredit other HMRC staff to act as instructors. The Department currently has approximately 50 such instructors, a number of whom are currently under training.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.5/5">All of the techniques taught are within the ACPO approved Personal Safety Training manual. However, only the techniques appropriate to HMRC officers' roles and powers are taught.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.5/6">The costs to HMRC for this training fall under two general headings: payments to the NPIA for the training of senior instructors; and payment for the hire of suitable venues to carry out the training.

	<p pid="a.330W.6/1">A range of tariff and non-tariff barriers apply to agricultural imports to the EU from Algeria, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia. Tariff barriers are governed by bilateral Association Agreements between the EU and the respective countries, and vary considerably product-by-product and country-by-country. Limited agricultural tariffs remain for Egypt for example, which finalised a revised Association Agreement in 2010 whereas Algeria has yet to negotiate substantial revisions and so faces higher tariffs. Key non-tariff barriers remain for all countries including seasonal restrictions, Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards, complex rules and regulations, and weak trade facilitation.</p>

The session on capabilities focussed wholly on pooling and sharing of military capabilities, where member states showed broad support for the initiative.

	<p pid="a.338W.6/2">Although work is under way in the EU and NATO to improve the transparency of current pooling and sharing activities among member states and to generate opportunities for the pooling and sharing of military capabilities in the future, there is no specific framework in place in Europe for the pooling and sharing of military resources. Decisions concerning military capabilities to be pooled and shared are subject to, and potentially constrained by, matters of national sovereignty. Although the work is being co-ordinated by these institutions, we are clear that the initiative must be member state driven, and conducted voluntarily.</p>
