	<p pid=".297W.3/2">The tobacco taskforce was established in 1998 to provide practical assistance to the sports affected by the Government's decision to ban tobacco sponsorship of sport. The taskforce's role is mainly advisory: to assist sports currently in receipt of tobacco sponsorship to find replacement sponsors by assessing the needs of each sport offering advice on best practice in establishing commercial relationships with sponsors; and assisting the sports in making links with potential new sponsors. In all, seven sports have sought assistance to make the transition from tobacco sponsorship&mdash;rugby league, clay pigeon shooting, billiards and snooker, pool, darts, ice-hockey and angling.</p>

The strategy for sport&mdash;A Sporting Future for All&mdash;and the Government's plan for sport set out an action plan on how we intend to achieve those objectives. Responsibility for developing grassroots sport at the regional level rests with a number of organisations including Sport England, local authorities, local education authorities, schools, sports governing bodies, sports clubs, volunteers, and in order to ensure the best use of resources it is essential that all these interests work in partnership.</p>

	<p pid=".297W.9/4">For the future I have made it clear that I want to see a strengthened regional structure for the delivery of sport in the regions which involves local decision making and strong partnerships with all the key local interests.

Initial estimates are that the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme could be worth up to &pound;30 million per year. There is no cap on the scheme; all listed places of worship that meet the criteria will receive a grant. This Department has been asked to make a small contribution to its administration costs. We have asked English Heritage to meet this commitment, which they have chosen to do through the redirection of &pound;2 million in grant-in-aid from the Joint Places of Worship (JPOW) Scheme.</p>

It would be difficult to arrive at such figures, given that in many cases there will be a number of factors influencing a decision to reduce the size of a business or to cease trading, for example prospects for an individual business prior to the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.2/2">The Global Compact is the UN Secretary General's initiative on global corporate social responsibility involving a number of leading international companies and NGOs. It encourages companies to take nine core human rights, labour and environment principles into consideration in their business in the developing world. We fully support the UN Global Compact and were one of the first Governments to do so. The Global Compact is a voluntary instrument aimed at developing best practice that goes beyond compliance frameworks and encourages creative responsibility on the part of companies. We encourage firms operating in developing countries like Sudan to consider how they can best implement the principles behind the compact. The compact offers the potential to make a tangible improvement to the quality of life of people affected by UK company operations around the globe, but particularly in the developing world.</p>

	<p pid=".309W.8/1">My Department has been responsible for the introduction of 533 statutory instruments since May 1997. Of these 533 regulations, we estimate that 9 per cent. reduced costs borne by businesses, charities and voluntary bodies, while over 75 per cent. had no or a negligible effect on costs for businesses, voluntary bodies, and charities. Over 30 per cent. of all the regulations introduced by DTI since May 1997 have been orders licensing firms to provide public telecommunications services, increasing consumer choice and competition in this sector.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.5/1">A report published in October by the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) praised the improved organisation and conduct of the elections. It highlighted a number of cases of manipulation, for which it identified the Socialist Party, rather than Prime Minister's Meta's Government, as responsible. The ODIHR report made clear that these shortcomings were not such as to affect the overall result. We continue to encourage and support Albanian efforts to address any flaws and to strengthen the democratic process.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.8/1">Arms have been smuggled into Kosovo from various sources, including a low level of trafficking from Bosnia and Herzegovina. In an effort to tackle this activity and strengthen law and order structures in Kosovo, in June 2001 the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) adopted legislation against the illegal possession of arms, illegal border crossings in and out of Kosovo, and terrorism. The United Kingdom strongly supports these measures.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.11/1">Public service broadcasting is important at a time of international tension when millions of people around the world rely on the BBC's objective reporting. In response to the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> the BBC World Service has increased output in Persian, Pashto, Urdu and Arabic and mounted its longest-ever continuous news transmission in English. I welcome these enhancements. A survey carried out among Pashto and Persian-speaking male heads of household in Afghanistan before the crisis indicated that 71 per cent. of Pashto speakers and 62 per cent. of Persian speakers listened to the World Service weekly.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.5/1">We have published a draft Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill and an implementation plan to take forward the recommendations of the review of the criminal justice system. We are consulting on our response to the review and expect to introduce the legislation in this Session. Our response to the review marks another key step in implementing the Belfast Agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.5/2">This was the most important review of its kind to have been undertaken in Northern Ireland in the last 30 years. The criminal justice system has served the people of Northern Ireland well over many years, often in very difficult circumstances. The review is radical and progressive, maintaining the best of the old system while integrating applicable international concepts and practices.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.5/3">I want to ensure that everyone interested in the future of criminal justice in Northern Ireland has adequate opportunity to have their say and to contribute to the effectiveness of our proposals. I am therefore extending the period of consultation by a further four weeks to <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-07">7 January 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".322W.12/1">The level of threat posed by dissident republican groups remains high. Dissidents are believed responsible for the bomb attack on Woodbourne Police Station in October. The security forces continue to frustrate their attempts to disrupt the peace process. The most recent successes are the arrests and subsequent charges of republicans after the discovery of a bomb in Armagh, ammunition finds in Lurgan and Moira. Anti-terrorist Branch officers also recently made a number of arrests in north London and Liverpool in connection with the bomb attacks in London and Birmingham.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.5/1">The Government do not intend to extend the scope of the proposed Regulation on cross-border payments in euro to sterling denominated payments. The approach taken in the Regulation is inconsistent with the competition-based approach that we believe is the better way of tackling the problem of market failure in cross-border payments. Such an approach would be consistent with our commitment to introduce a new regime for regulating competition in domestic payment systems&mdash;as recommended by the Cruickshank report. Not including sterling denominated payments would also avoid the potentially counter-productive effects arising from the proposed Regulation that could be damaging to consumers.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.11/1">The KPMG Review of Financial Regulation in the Caribbean Overseas Territories and Bermuda recommended: the establishment of independent regulatory authorities; the introduction of investigative powers to assist inquiries by overseas regulators; and the establishment of comprehensive anti-money laundering networks.</p>

	<p pid=".328W.2/1">The European Commission is responsible for publishing statistics on fraud and irregularities against the EC budget. Its latest report including figures for detected irregularities was published in May 2001, entitled &quot;Protecting the Community's financial interests and the Fight against Fraud&quot;, and is available on the internet. Details of the developments described in the Commission's report are also set out in the Government's July 2001 &quot;Statement on the 2001 EC Budget and Measures to Counter Fraud and Financial Mismanagement&quot;, Cm 5173.</p>
	<p pid=".328W.2/2">Care should be taken in interpreting the statistics because the Commission's report does not distinguish between cases of fraud and irregularities. Errors arise when, for example, payments are made outside prescribed time limits or using the wrong exchange rates. Moreover, increases in the level of detected errors may be attributed to improved detection and notification of cases by member states.</p>

A United Kingdom liaison officer from the Immigration Service now operates alongside French colleagues in Paris and juxtaposed immigration controls were established at Waterloo and Paris this year, which enables passengers to be cleared before they pass through the channel tunnel. It has also had significant success in taking forward, in conjunction with the police, the prosecution of people suspected of having attempted to facilitate the illegal entry of inadequately documented foreign nationals.</p>

	<p pid=".335W.5/1">Immigration Officers routinely attend ports which are normally unstaffed, in order to examine passengers arriving on services originating from outside the European Economic Area. Other services are closely monitored and carriers are required to fax passenger manifests to a designated local immigration office.

The Warnings Index computer system is the primary tool for providing information to staff operating the immigration entry control; it also provides information on matters of national security and the prevention of crime. All Immigration Service staff at points of entry have access to this system.

However, I can say that DU in munitions will at various times have been found in ammunitions depots at Kineton, Longtown and Dean Hill, on ships fitted with Phalanx weapons systems, at the ranges at Eskmeals and Kirkcudbright, and at locations involved in nuclear weapons programmes. DU used for other purposes has been present in a number of the aircraft listed in the earlier answer that are the property of MOD, at RAF Stafford, at the research establishment at Fort Halstead, at sites involved in the naval propulsion programme, and at the Royal hospital, Haslar.</p>

	<p pid=".343W.0/1">The immunisation programme for armed forces personnel in the Gulf conflict involved a number of vaccinations. These can be divided into three categories: those which were part of the anti-biological warfare (BW) immunisation programme; routine service health immunisations and third, travel and specific immunisations against the risks associated with individuals' particular employment.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/2">Details of the anti-BW immunisation programme, including datasheets on the vaccines used, were published in the Ministry of Defence paper: &quot;Background to the Use of Medical Countermeasures to Protect British Forces during the Gulf War (Operation GRANBY)&quot; in October 1997. A further paper entitled: &quot;Implementation of the Immunisation Programme against Biological Warfare Agents for UK Forces during the Gulf Conflict 1990&ndash;91&quot; dated January 2000 provides details on how the anti-BW immunisation programme was implemented, including estimates of the numbers immunised. Detailed information on the numbers of routine service, travel and employment specific immunisations administered is not available. Copies of both documents are available in the Library of the House and on the MOD's website at: <a href="http://www.gulfwar.mod.uk">www.gulfwar.mod.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/3">As the January 2000 paper makes clear, some individuals would have received a typhoid and tetanus vaccination which is routinely given as one combined immunisation referred to as TABT (typhoid, paratyphoid strains A and B plus tetanus). All of the other immunisations were administered singly. No tests were carried out in advance of the effects of combining a number of drugs into a vaccine because no such combination was intended. Details of such tests as were carried out in advance are set out in the October 1997 paper; some of these are being replicated in MOD's vaccines interactions research programme which is studying whether the vaccines used to protect UK personnel during the Gulf conflict can give rise to adverse health effects. This work is due to complete in 2003. The findings will be published in scientific literature.</p>

However, in view of the Government's undertaking to be as informative and thorough as possible in addressing issues of concern to Gulf veterans, I have asked that the information requested be researched. I will write to the hon. Member as soon as possible placing a copy of my letter in the Library of the House. The policy of the MOD for some years has been that no medical records should be withheld except where legislation so requires.</p>

This is available on MOD's website at: <a href="http://www.gulfwar.mod.uk">www.gulfwar.mod.uk</a>. I have arranged for a copy of this paper to be placed in the Library of the House. The paper describes arrangements for medical record keeping during the Gulf conflict; discusses a number of reasons why records that were kept may not have been complete, and provides guidance to Gulf veterans on how to obtain their service medical records.</p>

The return of three patients to the UN on <phrase class="date" code="">6 November</phrase> took around four hours longer than originally scheduled, due to the distance some members of the Critical Care Team had to travel to reach RAF Lyneham, the subsequent requirement to undertake a crew change in Italy, and the failure of airfield lights there. We would normally expect aeromedical evacuation from Kosovo to take around 24 hours. On this occasion it took around 26 hours.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.2/2">Seven of the eight patients went to the Centre for Defence Medicine. Six were admitted to the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust and one was admitted to City Hospital, Birmingham. None of these were transferred from one Birmingham hospital to another.

	<p pid=".350W.5/1">I assume the hon. Member is referring to civilian employees of the Department whether working in direct support of the armed forces or elsewhere in the Ministry of Defence. As explained in the Strategic Defence Review White Paper (Cm 3999), changes in civilian personnel numbers result from the drive for greater effectiveness and better value for money. Para 30 section 2.1 of the UK Defence Statistics 2001 contains details of the changes and copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.2/1">The purchase of the two new aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy is expected to cost up to &pound;2.9 billion. It is too early in the programme to provide definitive figures on the anticipated running costs of the carriers, since much will depend on the eventual design that is selected. Reliable forecasts for the carriers' running costs are being developed to inform the main investment decision on their build, which is currently scheduled for the end of 2003. As the ships are being designed to reduce support costs from the outset and will not undergo long refit periods while in-service, it is our intention that the overall running costs for the enhanced capability that CVF will offer should be less than that for the current class of ships.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.8/1">I have placed in the Library of the House a list of the historic and heritage properties and scheduled monuments, which are in the Ministry of Defence's care. I regard these properties as very valuable in both national and departmental terms, and we seek to maintain them to the highest appropriate standards.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.8/2">Valuation of such properties is, however, difficult whether in terms of the contribution they make to our business, or in open market terms. For MOD accounting purposes we record only the replacement value of operational assets (for instance, an historic building used for administrative purposes would be valued as an office with certain capacity). The National Asset Register records historic/heritage properties as having nil value. Given the number of properties in the keeping of the MOD, as well as their often unique history and location, the information required is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost, which would in any case be of questionable practical use.</p>

The defence budget will, however, increase in real terms over each of these years. The defence budget for 2004&ndash;05 will be agreed during Spending Review 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".357W.0/1">We are not currently planning to order a new tank for the Army. Deliveries of the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank (CR2) have only recently been completed. The CR2 provides an excellent capability, ensuring that British forces will continue to be properly equipped to conduct high intensity warfare for many years to come. However, as one would expect, research and evaluation into its potential successor is taking place now. It is too early to properly identity the type of vehicle that will eventually replace the CR2.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.2/1">The National Health Service Counter Fraud Service has carried out two patient prescription charge evasion exercises, measuring (to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.6 per cent.) the levels of fraud by patients from samples taken in November 1998 and July 1999. The amount of money lost to the NHS is estimated at &pound;117 million in 1998&ndash;99 and &pound;69 million in 1999&ndash;2000, demonstrating a reduction in losses from evasion of &pound;48 million (41 per cent.).

Where NHS Direct has acted as the first point of contact for patients seeking medical help out-of-hours, up to 50 per cent. of calls are handled without the need for onward referral to an out-of hours-doctor.

	<p pid=".371W.5/1">The University Hospitals of Leicester national health service trust is carrying out an urgent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Jones' death in the accident and emergency department at Leicester Royal infirmary (LRI) after a considerable time spent waiting on a trolley. Initial investigations indicate that Mrs. Jones' treatment in accident and emergency was appropriate to her presenting condition. A post mortem revealed that she died of a pulmonary embolus and it is believed that this could not have been foreseen. Nevertheless, procedures have been revisited and strengthened and the trust has apologised to her husband.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.5/2">Following visits to Leicester Royal infirmary by the National Patients Access Team and the Winter and Emergency Services Team (WEST), a remedial action plan has been put in place, to address the problems of long waiting in accident and emergency at the LRI. The regional office continues to work closely with the trust and WEST to help Leicester to meet the new national target, which states that by the end of March 2002 no one should have to wait more than four hours in accident and emergency before admission.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.5/3">We are determined to tackle the problem of long trolley waits in some parts of the country. The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust has received &pound;3.7 million to modernise its accident and emergency department, as part of our &pound;115 million accident and emergency modernisation programme. A further &pound;366,011 was announced last week for extra emergency care nurses at the trust between now and 2003.</p>

Such a conference will have the same status, and should proceed in the same way, as other initial child protection conferences, including decisions about registration on the child protection register. The involvement of midwifery services is vital in such cases.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.2/17">An unborn child will be registered on the child protection register if a decision is taken at the initial child protection conference that the unborn child is at continuing risk of significant harm. The act of registration itself confers no protection on a child, and should always be accompanied by a child protection plan.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.2/18">An unborn child will be de-registered from the child protection register if the child dies or it is judged that the child is no longer at continuing risk of significant harm requiring safeguarding by means of a child protection plan. De-registration will also take place if the child's family have moved permanently to another local authority area. In this case, the receiving local authority should convene a child protection conference within 15 working days of being notified of the move, only after which event may de-registration take place in respect of the original local authority's child protection register.</p>

	<p pid=".378W.3/1">This is an operational matter for London Underground (LU), but they advise that the measures requested do not form part of their regular monitoring and management reporting process. I understand that the most recent available survey on passenger numbers at peak times was completed by London Underground during 2000 and the resulting information on this and on measures of capacity was given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" name="Keith Hill">the then Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill)</phrase>, in answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-22">22 March 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-03-22.283W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 283W</phrase>. Regrettably, some of the information given in answer to that earlier PQ was inaccurate and the table provides corrected information.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.3/2">For each line, the table provides a snapshot of the busiest quarter-hour period on the busiest section. The table shows in columns D and E the figures which London Underground record as the &quot;theoretical design capacity&quot; of trains, as determined by the manufacturer and set out in an earlier answer of <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-02">2 February 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-02-02.315W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 315W</phrase>; and in columns F and G the actual numbers of people they recorded as using those lines at the busiest period. I regret that the earlier figures were misleading: the corrected figures show that the Underground is not as crowded as the previous answer appeared to show.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.3/3">However, it should be noted that in practice some trains may have a higher and some a lower crowding. This could be caused by either any unevenness in the time between consecutive trains or in the uneven distribution of customers along platforms.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.2/1">The Government's modernisation plans for the London Underground follow the principle that risk should be allocated to whoever is best able to manage it. The aim is not to transfer risk for its own sake, as this would lead to a decline in value for money, but rather to optimise the transfer of risk. The private sector infrastructure companies will be liable for all cost overruns that result from their acting in an uneconomic or inefficient manner. However, the financial risks associated with 'force majeure' events are retained by London Underground, as long as they are not caused by and are beyond the control of the infrastructure companies.</p>

The assessment considered the impact of the link on commercial property development, house building and job creation in the main areas affected by the link, that is, around St. Pancras, Stratford, and Ebbsfleet stations and the Royal Docks. Impacts in the rest of the United Kingdom were not assessed. The assessment of the gross direct regeneration implications associated with the link is shown. The cost of creating a similar number of additional jobs through other regeneration programmes was estimated to be &pound;1,000 million (at 1998 prices).</p>

	<p pid=".381W.5/1">Local transport authorities have a statutory duty to produce a local transport plan (LTP). They are required to set out five-year integrated transport plans which cover all forms of transport and include a set of locally devised aims and objectives, a long-term strategy to meet them, a costed implementation programme and a set of targets and performance indicators to measure progress. They also provide annual progress reports. The first full LTPs were produced in July 2000 and cover the period from April 2001 to March 2006. Capital resources for local transport improvements are provided through the annual local transport capital settlement; we will announce shortly the allocations for 2002&ndash;03 which will include provision for road safety improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.5/2">Road safety is an important component of the local transport plan (LTP) process and we will expect to see all transport authorities to be making progress in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.5/3">Somerset's first LTP annual progress report reports progress in several inter-related strategies, eg. a 14 per cent. reduction in killed and serious injury (KSI) accidents on the county's roads in 2000 over 1999 and a 50 per cent. reduction (50) in child KSI accidents over the same period. The county has introduced 90 local safety schemes on its roads in the last five years, such as speed management and improving facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, and in 2000&ndash;01 nine primary, six middle/secondary schools and one FE college have committed to the Safe Routes to School initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".386W.2/1">The Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) scheme was one of a number of measures introduced to enhance the accuracy of the vehicle register maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). It is designed to keep DVLA's unlicensed vehicle keeper records up to date. Since introduction over 2.5 million SORN declarations have been made recovering revenue of &pound;6 million. The number of SORN declarations received is constantly monitored and DVLA is carrying out an in depth review of the accuracy of the vehicle register.</p>
	<p pid=".386W.2/2">SORN prevents unlicensed vehicles from &quot;dropping off&quot; the vehicle register and measuring vehicle excise duty (VED) evasion is a useful way to assess impact. At the last full survey in 1999, evasion rates showed a fall from 4.1 per cent. to 3.9 per cent., a saving of &pound;17 million a year.</p>

My Department estimates that the cumulative effect of this reduction will be no more than 0.03 Mtonnes per year in 2010, and could be less. The outturn will be dependent on how market factors influence the take-up of the better heating control requirements that were introduced with the deferral to compensate for the lower boiler performances.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.3/1">The UK fuel poverty strategy was published on <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase>. This set out the Government's goal to seek an end to the problem of fuel poverty, with the first target to ensure that by 2010, no vulnerable household&mdash;older people, families, disabled and long- term sick&mdash;need risk ill health due to a cold home or spend more than 10 per cent. of income to keep warm.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.3/2">The strategy is based on a range of programmes and measures to tackle the root causes of fuel poverty: programmes to improve the energy efficiency of fuel poor households. These include the individual home energy efficiency schemes within each country as well as programmes to improve the standard of social housing. As part of their reports under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1996, we have asked energy conservation authorities to report on their efforts to tackle fuel poverty; continuing action to maintain the downward pressure on fuel bills, ensuring fair treatment for the less well off; continuing action to tackle poverty and social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.3/3">We will also be working with interested groups to further improve these programmes, and also to develop programmes that can identify and assist those healthy adult households at risk from longer-term fuel poverty.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.0/3" class="indent">I am sorry that I was unable to reply, but had I had done so, I would have told you that a contingency plan has been drawn up that will enable the Department and field staff to respond rapidly to an outbreak occurring in any of the three areas. The current plan emphasises the continued adherence to and rigorous enforcement of the existing control strategies, including tight bio-security. It is a working document that will be refined in the light of any developments including up to date advice. In addition, DEFRA has now announced that in an area surrounding Thirsk, additional, stronger biosecurity measures will be introduced. A Press Release (59/01) was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-23">23 July</phrase>.&quot;</p>

These measures coupled with the ongoing message on biosecurity continue to be successful in preventing the spread of the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.0/6">In addition, we maintain the capability, both in terms of infrastructure and resources, to respond to any recurrence of disease expeditiously.

A comprehensive review of the use of emergency vaccines against foot and mouth disease will be published shortly in the scientific journal <i>Vaccine</i>.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.0/2">The current scientific evidence is that ruminants can, but not invariably, become infected following vaccination and this depends on the strain of the virus and the length of time between vaccination and exposure to the virus. Such animals therefore present a potential risk and the international guidelines on the movement of vaccinated animals take this risk into account. More research of the long-term carrier state is needed in countries with the disease, and where vaccination has been used, as long-term studies of sufficient size are not possible in the laboratory.</p>

The Government are also working with many stakeholders in different producer countries to promote sustainable forest management as well as tackling illegal logging. The Forest Law Enforcement Conference held in Bali in September, which the Under-Secretary of State for International Development attended on behalf of the Government, has added a new dynamism to efforts to curb illegal logging through effective measures at a national, bilateral and international level.</p>

To this end Government buyers have been instructed to implement this policy and to report annually on their purchases. An interdepartmental working group is monitoring progress and will provide further guidance and advice to buyers. The Government's approach should help to transform the market into supplying more timber and timber products from sustainably managed sources. More information is given in the Third Annual Report on Greening Government, published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-27">27 November 2001</phrase> and available on the internet (<a href="http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk">http://www.sustainable- development.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid=".400W.12/1">Through the Bellwin arrangements, Government expect to contribute some &pound;26 million to the costs incurred by local authorities affected by flooding in 2000. Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for flood defence for English local authorities were announced on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase>. Government provide grant which covers some three quarters of SSA with the remainder assumed to be raised from the standard level of council tax.</p>
	<p pid=".400W.12/2">The Government's expenditure under Bellwin, coupled with their meeting a major proportion of the SSA, will substantially mitigate the effect on council tax bills arising from flooding, though the actual effect will depend on each local authority's spending decisions across all its functions.</p>

Further to increases in spending plans in the last two spending reviews, additional funding of &pound;51 million over the four years from 2000&ndash;01 was announced in November 2000 following the severe flooding last year.

	<p pid=".405W.5/1">The elimination of scrapie from the national flock is the objective of the national scrapie plan for Great Britain which I launched in July. Modelling work undertaken early last year suggested that it would be possible to have a significant increase in the resistance of the national flock within 10 years. We are currently updating the model to reflect current information, including the level of actual uptake under the plan. We will then be taking the views of stakeholders on what would be an appropriate target date, or dates, to work towards for the achievement of a scrapie-resistant sheep flock. The Animal Health Bill currently before Parliament would give the Government the ability to underpin a target date by using compulsory genotyping powers.</p>

	<p pid=".408W.0/1">The Human Rights Act 1998 was brought into full effect on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-02">2 October 2000</phrase>. Courts, Government Departments and public authorities received written guidance, training and publicity material about the Act. All Departments reviewed their legislation and procedures in the light of the new provisions. In addition, measures were put in place for necessary co-ordination and monitoring across Whitehall. A &pound;1.2 million blitz advertising campaign was mounted last autumn with advertisements in the national, local and ethnic press. A competition for young people, centred on the Act, attracted over 280 entries involving over 1,000 young people. Research showed that awareness among the public of the Act and the fundamental rights it protects nearly doubled during the period of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".408W.0/2">The Human Rights Unit has continued after commencement of the Act, and maintains a dedicated helpdesk and an extensive website. It remains a focal point of knowledge and good practice on human rights. Its activities include presentations at a range of seminars, conferences and training events, as well as providing 'roadshow' training events outside London. The Unit has contributed to the work of the Department for Education and Skills to introduce the subject of citizenship in schools, which will be a part of the national curriculum for secondary schools from September 2002, and is working with other organisations on an ambitious new youth awards scheme directed at all UK schools and youth organisations based on the values of the Human Rights Act. The Unit is currently revising guidance for Whitehall Departments about the Act and, with the Bar Council, the popular Study Guide to the Act. These will be re-issued early in the New Year.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.8/1">Communications between the prosecuting advocate and witnesses prior to a trial are governed by the Bar's Written Standards for the Conduct of Professional Work. The standards provide that a barrister may have contact with a witness with a view to introducing himself or herself, explaining the court's procedure and answering any questions about it which the witness may have. They also place upon the barrister a responsibility to ensure that witnesses are put as much at ease as possible. Victims, or the members of a victim's family, should be treated in the same way. Crown Prosecutors who are solicitors should also adhere to the same standards.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.8/2">In the Crown court the prosecuting barrister will be supported by a CPS caseworker. If the victim or members of the victim's family wish to contact the prosecution barrister during the hearing itself, the first point of contact will be the caseworker. In many cases, the caseworker will be able to deal with the query without reference to the prosecuting barrister. In some cases the caseworker will need to refer the victim's comments to the prosecuting barrister. If the caseworker is engaged on another case in a different court, the usual means of communication between the victim or the victim's family and the prosecuting barrister will be via the usher or a police officer.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.8/3">In the magistrates court the prosecutor will not have the support of a caseworker and is, as a result, reliant in practice on the usher or a police officer to communicate to him or her any comments that the victim or the victim's family may have during the hearing.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.8/4">The Crown Prosecution Service believes that more could be done to encourage victims or the families of victims to make the prosecutor aware of things said in court that are material and are factually incorrect.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.8/5">The CPS is therefore currently considering in consultation with Victim Support how victims could be better informed as to when it is appropriate to communicate with the prosecutor and the means by which it can be done.</p>

	<p pid=".410W.2/1">The guidance to defence counsel is set out in the Standards Applicable to Criminal Cases, which are annexed to the Code of Conduct for the Bar of England and Wales. The relevant paragraph (Annex F12.2(k)) is worded as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".410W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;A barrister acting for the defence . . . should as to anything which he is instructed to submit in mitigation which casts aspersions on the conduct or character of a victim or witness in the case, notify the prosecution in advance so as to give prosecuting counsel sufficient opportunity to consider his position. . .&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.2/3">All practising members of the Bar are expected to be familiar with the Code of Conduct and to apply its principles and standards. The Code is issued subject to the approval of the Lord Chancellor. Neither the Bar nor the Lord Chancellor routinely monitors compliance with the Code but the Bar, through complaints referred to its Professional Conduct Committee, is able to assess the effectiveness of particular parts of the Code upon which a complaint is based. No complaints have been made about individual barristers failing to observe the guidance set out above.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.2/4">I have made no representations, nor had any discussions with the Bar in relation to the Code of Conduct and the operation of the specific guidance on derogatory mitigation.

	<p pid=".412W.2/1">My Department's &quot;Guidance Notes for Teacher Employment Businesses and Agencies&quot; describes the requirements for checks which the Department considers must be made by agencies providing supply teachers to schools in order to comply with the law. These include checks to establish that supply teachers have the necessary qualifications and checks of identity, health and fitness to teach, as well as against criminal records and the register of barred teachers. Regulation of agencies and employment businesses is provided under the Employment Agency Act 1973 and Conduct Regulations, which are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate enforces this legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.2/2">Circular 7/96, issued to schools in parallel with the &quot;Guidance Notes for Agencies&quot; mentioned, provides guidance to head teachers taking on temporary teachers. It emphasises that schools should be clear about the checks that have been carried out, even where by an agency; that it is a school's responsibility to ensure that all checks have been made; and that schools should ask for written assurance that any agency used has carried out these checks.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.2/3">My Department also issued further guidance to local education authorities (LEAs), schools and agencies in 1998 reminding them about the checks that should be made on teachers, and others seeking to work with children. Schools were advised that cases of serious or deliberate deception by an applicant might constitute a criminal offence, and should be reported to the police and to my Department.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.2/4">The White Paper &quot;Schools Achieving Success&quot; proposed a Quality Mark for agencies and LEAs. I would expect any Quality Mark to lay out expectations of agencies and LEAs in terms of their recruitment and management practice and their relations with schools.</p>

	<p pid=".416W.2/1">Information about class sizes has been collected from maintained primary and secondary schools as part of the Annual Schools Census in January for over 20 years. In order to provide a true representation of the sizes of classes experienced by children, each school is randomly allocated a specific time on the census day at which class sizes should be reported. The current collection asks for the number of pupils, teachers and teaching assistants in the class at the appropriate time and also for its Key Stage and National Curriculum Year Group. The activity in which the class is engaged is also requested.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/2">The September Class Size Count is a separate collection started in 1998, introduced to monitor class sizes at Key Stage one. The statistical method used is the same as in the January Census, but, in order to lessen the burden on schools, information is collected only from primary schools and about classes where the majority of children will reach the appropriate age during the school year. The information required about each class in September 2001 was the number of pupils, teachers and teaching assistants and the activity in which the class was engaged and, for classes of 31 or more, the number of excepted pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/3">Information on individual schools is not normally published. Where individual school information is published as in the School Performance tables, the information is first checked with the schools concerned.</p>

In addition the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly support two students. EUI students undertake study and research in one of four departments; Economics, Law, History and Civilisation or Political and Social Sciences. Most of these students are undertaking a three year doctorate, but there are some students who undertake a one year Masters in Law.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.5/2">There are two other European institutions where students are supported by my Department. Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate arrangements. Fifteen students are supported at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium and Natolin, Poland. Students follow a one year course and enrol in one of four departments; Economics, Human Resource Development, Political Sciences or Administrative Sciences. All follow a compulsory programme of European General and Interdisciplinary Studies.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.5/3">In addition two students are supported at the Bologna Center, part of John Hopkins University, in Bologna, Italy. Students study an interdisciplinary course, including a modern language, International Economics, International Relations and European Studies.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.5/4">The Government are keen to see greater collaborative links between Higher Education Institutions across Europe, both by encouraging EU students to study in the UK and by funding students at the three institutions to which this question refers.</p>

The remaining borrowers had accounts which were sold to the two private sector owners, but where the administration remains with the SLC. The number of borrowers with accounts classified as being in repayment status includes some 543,000 borrowers whose repayments were deferred because their income level was below the repayment threshold.</p>

Repayments from borrowers outside the taxation system, and from those with small loans, are made to the Company.</p>

Their role is to decide in individual cases whether the school should admit a child, having regard to the case presented by both the admission authority and the parents. The panel decides first whether one of the statutory grounds for refusing admission applies. But even if the panel decides that it was proper to refuse to admit the child, they proceed (except in the case of infant classes, to which special rules apply) to a second, discretionary stage of consideration. At this stage, they balance the effect on the school of admitting another child against the parents' reasons for wanting the child to be admitted.</p>

	<p pid=".427W.8/1">There are no grounds on which an appeal panel can overrule a primary school's decision not to admit a child to an infant class size because that would take the class size above 30, if the school has followed its published admission arrangements. The panel can uphold that infant class appeal only if the decision was not one which a reasonable admission authority would make in the circumstances of the case or the child would have been offered a place if the admission arrangements had been properly implemented.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.5/1">In the White Paper &quot;Schools Achieving Success&quot;, we have stated our commitment to actively promote modern language teaching in primary schools so that more older primary children learn a second language. We are already doing a great deal to support language teaching in primary schools, although we do not have a statutory curriculum for languages at primary age. The National Curriculum contains guidance for teaching 7 to 11-year-olds, and we have published a scheme of work for primary French, and further materials for primary German and Spanish. We are supporting the Early Language Learning initiative, through which we are piloting approaches to extend language teaching in primary schools, and developing a curriculum guide to good practice and classroom materials. A national advisory centre on early language learning has been set up with an accompanying website.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/2">We will be building on existing links between primary schools and specialist language colleges. The increasing number of specialist colleges and the developing focus on their roles as &quot;hubs&quot; of excellence will enhance opportunities for primary schools to access language expertise.</p>

The Department has not studied the impact on language learning in the UK of the emergence of English as a world language, but we are doing a great deal to support and enhance foreign language teaching and learning.

	<p pid=".434W.2/1">Since 1997, this Government have consistently shown their commitment to tackling age discrimination against older people through a wide- ranging programme of research, consultation and development initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.2/2">We have overseen a range of co-ordinated strategies through consultation with older people and representative groups, that identify and address their needs including overcoming age discrimination. These include the Better Government for Older People Programme, the 10-year Transport Plan, Quality and Choice for Older People's Housing: A Strategic Framework, the National Service Framework for Older People and the Performance and Innovation Unit report &quot;Winning the Generation Game&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.2/3">Our jobcentre network, including the new employer direct call centres, are working to eliminate age discrimination through a range of options. They have a policy of not accepting job vacancies with an upper age limit unless the employer can show genuine reason for the restriction. They deliver a wide range of programmes which are available to older people including new deal 25+, new deal for disabled people, work based learning for adults, work trials and programme centres.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.2/4">In April 2000, the new deal 50 plus was launched and up to September this year had helped over 51,000 over 50s back to work. The programme is currently developing third age apprenticeships, which are new work based training opportunities designed to help older people retrain, particularly in sectors which have been reluctant to recruit older people.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.2/5">The Government are committed to implementing age legislation in employment by 2006 and in the lead up to legislation, our AgePositive campaign will be intensified; vigorously promoting the business benefits of employing young and older people in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.2/6">The campaign includes three national and regional annual awards for employers who demonstrate their commitment to employing an age diverse work force, promotion of the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, a wide ranging research programme and a range of media advertising.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.2/7">On <phrase class="date" code="">3 December</phrase> the campaign launched a new AgePositive website <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk">www.agepositive.gov.uk</a> and new research studies including the Evaluation of the Impact of the Code of Practice and Good Practice in the Recruitment and Retention of Older Workers.</p>

The original intention was to deliver a local pilot, partnering Knowsley local authority. However, we decided on a national pilot and have partnered with Inland Revenue to deliver information and services through satellite and cable iDTV providers to approximately 7 million users across Great Britain. The pilot service, which will be evaluated, is due to be launched in the spring of 2002 and will run for an initial one year period. Further developments beyond the pilot period will be dependent on the pilot evaluation findings.</p>
