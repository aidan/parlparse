This strategy focuses on maximising the public benefits which trees, woods and forests can deliver. Changing demands from society mean that public benefit is the key test of &quot;adequacy&quot; today. Sustainable management of the existing resource is just as important as new woodland creation. Increased afforestation must be linked with identifiable public benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1430W.2/2">We have seen a long-term increase in the area of woodland in England and the Forestry Commission monitors this through the national survey of woodland, which has been carried out every 15-20 years since 1924. In addition the Forestry Commission publishes softwood availability forecasts to help inform the plans of wood-using industries and investors. At present we estimate that only around one quarter of annual growth is harvested from England's native woodlands each year, and only 60 per cent. of the annual growth from England's conifer forests.</p>

The average municipal waste growth up to the millennium was around 3.5 per cent. per year, indicating a significant step change in the UK's waste management. Data for 2006-07, expected in autumn 2007, will provide further useful evidence on whether the trends of recent years have been sustained.</p>
	<p pid="b.1430W.8/2">Between 1998-99 and 2002-03, the amount of waste produced by businesses in England fell from 69 million tonnes to 68 million tonnes per year<sup>(2)</sup>, while GDP increased by about 10 per cent. In this period, industrial waste fell by 6 per cent. (2.5 million tonnes), declining faster than industrial gross value added (GVA)<sup>(3)</sup>, which fell by 3.5 per cent. Commercial waste increased by 6 per cent. (1.7 million tonnes), compared with the 29 per cent. increase in commercial GVA. These changes mainly reflect increased employment in the service sectors and a decrease in industrial activity, along with increasing reliance on imports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1430W.8/3">The overall aim of waste prevention is to decouple waste growth from increases in GDP. The recently published Waste Strategy 2007 renews the Government's commitment to breaking the link between economic growth and waste growth, by placing more emphasis on waste prevention and re-use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1430W.8/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Municipal Waste Statistics 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.1430W.8/5" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> Environment Agency Survey of Commercial and Industrial Waste 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="b.1430W.8/6" class="indent"><sup>(3)</sup> Gross value added (GVA) measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector. The GVA generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units' total output less intermediate consumption (that is, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output), or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1431W.5/1">DEFRA's Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme has been established to provide targeted guidance and support to businesses to improve their resource efficiency and to minimise the levels of waste that are unnecessarily sent to landfill. For example, the BREW Programme funds the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). NISP matches one operator's waste with another's raw material needs. In the first two years of its operation, in the region of 1.7 million tonnes of material have been diverted from landfill, with &pound;70 million of cost savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1431W.5/2">An early assessment of selected BREW activities suggests that the programme has made a good start in returning landfill tax receipts to businesses and helping them improve their resource efficiency. Around &pound;4 has been saved by business for each &pound;1 of BREW-funded advice and support. There were also reductions in water use, waste sent to landfill and the amounts of raw materials used by businesses. Many of the benefits will be seen beyond 2005-06, and work is currently under way to assess the impact of programme spending in 2006-07. More details about the BREW Programme can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1431W.5/3">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is also working across a range of industry sectors to reduce waste arisings. For example, WRAP is working with retailers and their supply chains towards its 2006-08 business plan target to secure reductions in packaging waste of 80,000 tonnes a year. WRAP has specific programmes with the construction and manufacturing sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1431W.5/4">My Department has also produced the publication &quot;Saving money by reducing waste&quot;, which gives practical guidance on waste minimisation for farmers and growers and is available from the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1431W.5/5">Apart from guidance and support offered by DEFRA, there are also two sets of regulations in place to encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise, recycle and recover packaging and reduce packaging waste. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find further solutions to the challenge of minimising packaging, and recommend ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1431W.5/6">The Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS), which was published in April 2006, also challenged the food manufacturing sector to reduce its own waste by 15-20 per cent. by 2010. Thirteen major grocery retailers (representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector) have signed up to a voluntary agreement, the &quot;Courtauld Commitment&quot;, and are working with WRAP to:</p>

As well as providing overnight accommodation for me, the facilities at Hillsborough castle are also used to provide official hospitality and overnight accommodation for members of the Royal Family, visiting dignitaries and diplomats. Other activities at the castle include departmental meetings, the Annual Garden Party and Citizenship Ceremonies. In addition to its use by the Northern Ireland Office and other Government Departments, charities and local community groups can request to use the facilities, generally for fund raising purposes, and the castle and grounds are open at certain times of the year for guided tours.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.2/2">The costs associated with my overnight accommodation at Hillsborough castle cannot be separated from the overall cost. The cost of running Hillsborough castle for the 2005-06 financial year was &pound;4,948,666.27. As custodians of this listed building the NIO takes seriously the need to preserve, maintain and refurbish the fabric of the building. This cost includes the maintenance of the buildings and grounds, and the security of the castle, the grounds, and that of Ministers, officials and visitors while present at the castle. It also includes the cost of catering, hospitality and administration. &pound;3,165,938.56 is included in this amount in respect of cost of capital and depreciation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1447W.9/1">The National School Sport Strategy aims to increase the proportion of all schoolchildren who spend at least two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport. The strategy includes a variety of measures to encourage take-up among children and young people with special needs and disabilities, including those who have visual impairments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1447W.9/2">For example, the Youth Sport Trust has recently been working with disability sport organisations, including British Blind Sport, to develop new resources for teachers and coaches working within our network of 100 multi-sport clubs for young disabled people.

	<p pid="b.1448W.11/1">The Government are committed to increasing diversity and equality of opportunity in UK institutions. The Ministry of Justice is working with the judiciary and Judicial Appointments Commission to increase diversity, for example, by promoting the judicial service and widening the range of people eligible to apply for judicial office. The Judicial Diversity Strategy, setting out the approach, was announced to Parliament by written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-05-17.25"><i> Official Report,</i> column 25WS</phrase>. The Judicial Appointments 8<sup>(th )</sup>Report published in March 2006 showed that the proportion of female judges appointed in the previous year had increased from 31 per cent. to 41 per cent. Between 2001 and 2006 the percentage of female judges rose from 14 to 18 per cent. The percentage of those from a BME background appointed increased from 5 per cent. to 17 per cent. over the previous seven years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1448W.11/2">Colleagues in the Home Office are extremely active in pushing for greater diversity in the police and have introduced a number of initiatives looking at recruitment, retention and progression. These include positive action guidelines on recruitment, and a toolkit looking into the setting of targets for the recruitment of women. Twenty-Two per cent. of police officers are women, and 3.7 per cent. of police officers are from ethnic minority backgrounds. Progress has been made in recruiting minority ethnic Special Constables (6.6 per cent.) and Police Staff (6.9 per cent.) and especially minority ethnic Police Community Support Officers (15.2 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.1448W.11/3">In 2002 we introduced the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act allowing positive measures towards women's increased participation in politics. This legislation is having an impact. Women now make up 20 per cent. of MPs compared with 9 per cent. before 1997. However, there is still a long way to go: only 2.3 per cent. of MPs are from non-white backgrounds, compared with around 8 per cent. of the population. The Discrimination Law Review is considering the case for widening the scope of positive measures to target the selection of political candidates beyond gender. It is also looking at how to widen the range of voluntary positive action measures available to organisations as employers and service providers in order to prevent or compensate for disadvantage or to meet the special needs of groups protected by discrimination law. Our consultation paper, &quot;A Framework for Fairness&quot;, setting out our proposals for a Single Equality Bill, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-12">12 June</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1453W.2/2">The conclusions of the December 2004 Transport Council asked the Commission to submit a reasoned analysis of the results of the public private partnership (PPP) negotiations, including on risk allocation and final costs, before any final decision was made.

	<p pid="b.1453W.2/9">The Government have not set either a maximum level of funding that they would approve for the project, or a cost-benefit ratio at which they would withdraw their support. The latest information from the European Space Agency is that costs of the development phase are &euro;1778.40 million to date (2007 cash terms). The draft EU Financial Regulation allocates &euro;900 million, at 2004 prices, to the deployment phase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1453W.2/10">The Government are strongly committed to the existing budget ceilings and to ensuring that there is no reopening of the Financial Perspective. The principle that member states would not be required to fund Galileo from national budgets for the deployment and operational phases of the programme was agreed at the March 2002 Transport Council. The Government remain committed to this principle.</p>

	<p pid="b.1463W.5/2">The UK Government fully support academic freedom and are firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics. While I appreciate the independence of the UCU, I am very disappointed that the union has decided to pass a motion which encourages its members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and education institutions. I profoundly believe this does nothing to promote the middle east peace process, in fact the reverse. Within both Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories there are both progressives and reactionaries. The problem with academic boycotts and the problem with what the UCU is proposing is that it makes the job of the progressives more difficult and it could reinforce the stance of those who take a hard line position.</p>

These discussions have reinforced my view that a boycott would be inconsistent with the spirit of openness and tolerance that should inform public life. Education plays a vital role in developing and aiding understanding between different people. It is therefore all the more important to keep open channels of communication with academics and educational institutions during these difficult times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1463W.5/4">As an independent body, the union would be free to take any action, within the law, voted for by its members. UCU members, like all HE employees, must behave in accordance with their institution's own anti-discrimination policies and the UK's wider legislative framework on employment and equality.</p>

	<p pid="b.1466W.2/1">There is an assumed fee contribution for all further education provision funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), including courses in lip-reading. For 2007/08 the assumed fee element will be 37.5 per cent. meaning that LSC funding will continue to account for at least 62.5 per cent. of the cost of all LSC funded FE courses.

	<p pid="b.1466W.2/3">With the exception of the rules on fee remission individual funding does not differ according to age, although providers have discretion over the level of the fees they charge and many providers will have their own local fee remission policies in place. For instance in 2004/05 more than 80 per cent. of lip-reading courses were free to learners either as a result of national policy or the discretion of the provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.2/4">Learners who do not qualify for free tuition can still receive support from Learner Support Funds administered directly by colleges.

	<p pid="b.1467W.5/3">Progress over future spending reviews will depend on the Government's fiscal position, demographic change, and progress by schools in continuing to deliver improvements in results and wider support for parents and pupils.</p>

	<p pid="b.1467W.8/1">Information on the closure, merger or opening of particular university departments is not collected by the Department. However, some science subjects are starting to become more popular and the measures we are taking to increase demand and the extra &pound;75 million announced last year should help to sustain capacity as demand increases. We have consistently made clear that if a science department closes at one institution, the Higher Education Funding Council for England should seek to maintain capacity elsewhere and we announced last year that the Council should report to us on how provision can be maintained in this way.</p>

	<p pid="b.1469W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-04">4 June 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/2">We have increased investment in further education by 48 per cent. in real terms between 1997 and 2006. In line with our Skills Strategy, first set out in the Skills White Paper 2003, public funding needs to be focused on helping those without the basic and level 2 skills for employment and further progression in learning. This is a planned and continuing strategy to respond to the skills challenges we have as a country. As part of this strategy, my Department recognises the importance of colleges maintaining provision at lower levels to support progression and flow through to higher levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/3">The Department does not hold information on publicly funded post-16 places at local or regional levels. Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's Chief Executive has written to the hon. Member with the information you have requested and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/4" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/5" class="indent">I am writing in relation to your request for information about the effect of budget changes upon Westminster Kingsway College and in particular the assessments of effect on level 1 and other entry level places, and the assessment of the financial position of the college.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/6" class="indent">The 2007/08 budget allocated to Westminster Kingsway College is &pound;25.8m, which compares to &pound;25.9m in 2006/07. Whilst this is a marginal reduction in recurrent funding between years, it should be noted that the college would need to meet the annual cost of living increase from within its budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/7" class="indent">In return for the budget, the LSC has agreed stretching targets with the college to increase the proportion of full Level 2 places in 2007/08. Across the college sector in London, there is a comparatively high volume of places at entry and level 1, in particular ESOL, but there are fewer places available at level 2. There is a high proportion of the adult population who are low skilled and the LSC with colleges is keen to support employability both amongst disadvantaged groups and those in low skilled employment. To do this, it is important that there is a balance of vocational programmes at lower and higher levels. In 2005/06, some two thirds of adult provision at Westminster Kingsway College was ESOL and we wish to work with the college to achieve a range of vocational places and different levels leading into employment and higher skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/8" class="indent">In recognition of this change and the impact on the existing profile of provision, the LSC with its partner, the London Development Agency, has agreed a &pound;15m package of ESOL Support Funding to ensure that entry and level 1 ESOL places are sustained in 2007/08. The consequence of this additional funding will be that the budget for Westminster Kingsway College is unlikely to show a reduction in real terms against 2006/07. In view of this outcome, we do not envisage that the financial health of the college will be adversely impacted by the 2007/08 budget change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.2/9" class="indent">If you have any further questions about this matter, do please contact Christopher Wright at the London Central area office on 0207 904 0729.</p>

	<p pid="b.1482W.9/1">All UN Development Programme (UNDP) work in Burma is carried out in compliance with guidelines established by its Executive Board. These stipulate that all UNDP assistance to Burma should be clearly targeted towards programmes having grass-roots-level impact in a sustainable manner, particularly in the areas of primary health care, the environment, HIV/AIDS, training and education and food security.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.9/2">In order to deliver this mandate, UNDP has established the Human Development Initiative (HDI), funded by DFID and other donors, with the objective of meeting basic needs and alleviating poverty in some of the poorest areas of Burma. In accordance with the Executive Board restrictions, UNDP does not transfer funds to the Burmese authorities. However, like other international organisations operating in Burma, UNDP has been required to purchase items such as fuel and telecommunications services and pay rent for its premises, and the authorities remain the sole provider of such services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.9/3">UNDP has a network of approximately 1,500 national staff based in the 57 townships in which the HDI operates in Burma. These staff&mdash;at the state/division level, township level and community level&mdash;undertake extensive routine process monitoring for all project activities. They are involved in all aspects of implementation, verification of accounts and expenditures, review of problems, and provision of technical support to ensure effective implementation. Their monitoring is supplemented by national programme managers, which in turn is overseen by UNDP international staff who also regularly visit programme sites. No difficulty has been encountered in such monitoring on account of any Government control or restrictions. National staff can travel freely; they do not have to ask for travel permission and are not accompanied by counterpart or local officials in the performance of their project work. Internationals do have to ask for permission but there has been no case when permission has been denied. Furthermore, the formulation of the Operating Guidelines by the Government (February 2006) has not had any significant impact on UNDP's ability to engage effectively in the field, or to abide by its Executive Board mandate, adhering to humanitarian principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.9/4">On the basis of their programme monitoring, UNDP provides DFID with periodic written progress reports on HDI activities. This includes substantive information on activities, achievements, challenges/issues and recommendations as required, as well as budgetary information. A detailed financial report accounting for the previous tranche of support from DFID is necessary before the next tranche is provided to UNDP. Donors themselves carry out an annual joint assessment mission to review the HDI programme. Further ad hoc fieldtrips are made by donors to project sites&mdash;in DFID's case, about four times a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.9/5">Finally, in order to ensure compliance with the Executive Board mandate, independent assessments of the HDI are carried out regularly and reported to the Executive Board. The assessment teams include a team of external consultants who undertake 3-4 week field trips to prepare their report. The report for the period May 2006 to April 2007 is now being finalised and will be presented to the Executive Board in September 2007. The initial findings conclude that the HDI programme is in full compliance with the Executive Board mandate and addresses the needs of the poor and vulnerable in rural areas of Burma with humanitarian assistance. The 2006 Assessment&mdash;covering the period 2005-06&mdash;also echoes the conclusion of previous reports, namely, that the HDI programme effectively provides humanitarian support on a large scale and that</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.9/6" class="indent">&quot;all projects operate independently of the Government and target the village-level groups and needs described in the [EB] mandate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.9/7">The full report can be found on the Executive Board website at:</p>

DFID's total spend on education also includes funds disbursed via multilateral organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.2/3">In launching the UK education initiative, we asked governments to prepare ambitious 10-year education sector plans to which donors should contribute funding support. In Africa, 25 countries are involved. Of these, to date, 17 have produced their plans. The Education for All Fast Tract Initiative (FTI), supported by 15 donors, is also supporting the development of education sector plans. The FTI's Education Programme Development Fund provides technical assistance to help with the preparation of plans and the Catalytic Fund for the implementation of endorsed plans. 31 countries have obtained FTI endorsement since its inception in 2002 and a further 30 countries are working towards endorsement in 2007 and 2008. The UK is contributing some &pound;150 million through the FTI.</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.2/4">Since April 2006, the UK has announced 10-year agreements to support education plans in Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Tanzania totalling &pound;646 million. The UK has also made recent commitments to support education plans in Burundi, DRC, India, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="b.1486W.5/1">DFID is working with a wide range of partners, including the World Health Organisation, developing country Governments, pharmaceutical companies and non-governmental organisation on the development of the Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA).</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.5/2">MeTA seeks to increase transparency over vital information on the price, quality and availability of essential medicines in developing countries so as to help tackle high prices, challenge corruption and address inefficiency. One third of the world's population lacks access to essential medicines. The prices patients pay are often much higher than the price agreed at procurement, with cumulative mark-ups of 300 per cent. not being uncommon as medicines move from procurement through storage, supply, distribution and ultimately to health centres and pharmacies. In addition, up to a third of medicines on the market in developing countries are fake.</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.5/3">Procurement and supply systems are generally opaque, meaning excessive price mark-ups, corruption and inefficiency can go unchallenged. Most people have little idea about what medicines should cost, or what a good-quality medicine looks like.</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.5/4">MeTA seeks to change this by securing high-level political commitment to increased transparency and accountability over medicines procurement and supply in countries that choose to take part, and by bringing the right people around the table&mdash;Government Departments, civil society organisations, companies and others&mdash;to agree ways of disclosing information on the price, the quality and the availability of essential medicines into the public arena, with the aim of ultimately reducing the cost, improving the quality and increasing the availability of medicines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.5/5">MeTA builds on the success of the extractive industries transparency initiative (EITI) by applying principles of transparency and accountability to medicines procurement and supply. Application of EITI principles to other sectors was supported by G8 countries at the recent Heiligendamm summit, and their specific application to the health sector was a commitment in the 2006 International Development White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.5/6">A major stakeholder meeting for MeTA was held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-18">18 April</phrase>, attended by all relevant groups and addressed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development. An official launch will take place in the summer, with the launch of pilots in around five countries to develop a model approach to increased transparency and accountability in medicines procurement and supply.</p>

Translating this figure into flights and emissions reductions suggests that the emissions saving as a result of the decision will be in the range of 0.2-0.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) per year.

	<p pid="b.1499W.2/2">The latest data indicates that over 95 per cent. of traders, whose returns are subject to the current verification programme, have so far been found to be participating in, or profiting from, MTIC fraud, or there is sufficient suspicion to warrant further investigation. Only 1 per cent. of the VAT withheld under this programme has been found to be properly payable. To date, the courts have found that HMRC's actions have been proportionate and reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1499W.2/3">HMRC does not hold centralised information relating to &quot;<i> (b) </i>otherwise incorrectly claimed or improperly paid&quot;. VAT incorrectly claimed or improperly paid can result from a diverse number of factors, including other fraud, avoidance or error and gathering such data would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1500W.9/1">The information published in the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals in Great Britain on toxicological procedures is classified according to the nature of the substance tested. There is no authoritative definition of the term 'household products' within toxicology and it is not defined in any national or international legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1500W.9/2">However, in the context of the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, regard is paid to the definition of finished household products as set out in the 2002 publication on The Use of Animals in Testing Household Products produced by the Boyd Group, a forum encompassing a wide rage of expertise and perspectives concerned with the use of animals in scientific procedures. As part of the quality assurance process for compiling the statistics each return for the use of household products is scrutinised to ensure appropriate categorisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1500W.9/3">All products that are primarily intended for use in the home fall within the sub-category 'Substances used in the household' and would include such products as detergents and other laundry products, household cleaners, air-fresheners, toilet blocks, polishes, paper products such as infant nappies, paints, glues (and removers), other furnishing and DIY products and household pesticides. The sub-category applies to both finished household products and their ingredients, although in practice mainly the latter are tested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1500W.9/4">Procedures for toxicological purposes accounted for 14 per cent. of all procedures started in 2005 and, of that, 0.005 per cent. of procedures were for the evaluation household products. The number of procedures for the testing of household products remains very small and has reduced dramatically from 1,032 procedures in 2002 to 21 in 2005, a fall of 98 per cent. It is anticipated that it will always be the case that only very small numbers of animals will be used for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.1503W.8/1">To account for its carbon emissions the Home Office measures the consumption of electricity, gas and fuel oil across the estate and converts these figures into carbon equivalents with the assistance of the Building Research Establishment. Carbon emissions from road travel undertaken by Home Office staff are accounted for in accordance with DEFRA's guidance to business on environmental reporting. We measure the amount of travel by hire cars, pool cars, private vehicles and taxis and take account of vehicle fuel type in calculating emissions. These figures are submitted for inclusion in the Sustainable Development in Government report published annually by the Sustainable Development Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1503W.8/2">Separately the Department participates in the Government's carbon offsetting scheme, which calculates the carbon dioxide emissions created by official air travel. Central data are provided to DEFRA who then adjust these to take into account the total impact that aviation imposes on climate change and purchase credits from projects which prevent or remove an equivalent amount of emissions from the atmosphere.</p>

The outcomes of each of these reviews was published in July 2006. In addition, the Prime Minister asked me to instigate a review of counter terrorism, but there is a limit to what I can report on the results of this review due to national security considerations. Finally, I have recently instigated a review of policing, led by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Ronnie Flanagan. My drive to improve delivery in the Home Office's objectives means that a wide range of other reviews of policy and operational issues have been undertaken and continue to be undertaken (such as a review of deportation of foreign national prisoners and Sir Ian Magee's review of the criminal records of offences committed abroad by UK nationals).

	<p pid="b.1522W.2/1">Unlike the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) which was established to bring together views on the current performance of a local authority, the new risk assessment will look at risk and will focus more on areas rather than just institutions. The risk assessment will be undertaken jointly by all local services inspectorates and will be the primary source for determining future inspection programmes allowing a better targeted, more proportionate approach. The majority of existing rolling programmes of inspection will cease during 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.2/2">Under best value local authorities are required to secure continuous improvement in they way they exercise their functions having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Evidence of how well authorities complied with or achieved best value was considered as part of CPA and will continue under the new CAA. The Audit Commission will continue to have powers to inspect under Best Value, with any inspection in future being triggered by the risk assessment.</p>

This equated to &pound;1 billion of new efficiency gains from councils in each year. At least half of these gains had to be cashable, i.e. release cash that could be reallocated by councils to meet local priorities. The Gershon Review set no targets for headcount reduction in local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1535W.2/2"><i> </i>Communities and Local Government does not hold a record of representations received about the use of receipts from the local taxation of second homes. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, billing authorities have had the freedom to reduce the council tax discount on second homes from 50 per cent. to 10 per cent. In 2005-06 authorities raised an additional &pound;92 million from the reduced second homes discount. The use of that revenue is a matter for individual authorities to decide in light of local priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1537W.0/2">No research has been commissioned or evaluated by my Department, or its agencies, specifically relating to joint waste authorities (JWA). I am not aware of any similar research undertaken by the Audit Commission on JWAs or on alternate weekly collection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.0/3">However, AEA Technology has carried out work on DEFRA's behalf to examine potential economies of scale in waste management and barriers to achieving them. This highlighted the importance of authorities sharing waste disposal facilities if we are to meet our environmental objectives. The final report, &quot;Economies of scale: waste management optimisation study&quot;, is available from DEFRA's website. This gives examples of a number of joint working models that could be used by local authorities, including JWAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.0/4">In addition, a report on 'Joint working on wastes management', published by the Innovation Forum, highlights the benefits of joint working in two tier areas, citing possible efficiency savings of around &pound;150 million nationally. The report identified the limited legal basis for joint working as one of the key barriers to joint working on waste. In response to this report, the Government have introduced clauses in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill to allow the establishment of JWAs to enable local authorities to put their waste partnerships on a statutory basis if they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.0/5">The Audit Commission has published a number of guidance documents containing advice to local councils on how they can meet their statutory requirements with regards to waste by improving their waste management and adopting best practice. The Audit Commission also examines the performance of councils and the services they provide, including waste, through the Comprehensive Performance Assessment, and provides recommendations for improvement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1537W.3/3">The new powers and freedoms, announced earlier this year as part of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, were requested by local authorities and will allow authorities that wish to put joint working on a statutory footing to create stronger partnerships in delivering their waste services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1540W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">pursuant to the reply, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-29">29 March 2007</phrase>, Official Report, c. 1721-24W</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.0/2">The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. We do not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our Households Below Average Income series as it is not a good measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey (FRS) may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.0/3">Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2005-06&quot; (HBAI). This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportions in persistent poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.0/4">Pension credit has been highly successful in reducing pensioner poverty; since its introduction, the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by over 700,000. Now, for the first time in a period of sustained economic growth, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole, after housing costs are accounted for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.0/5">We continue to make every effort to ensure that pension credit goes to those who are entitled to it. It is more challenging to reach those entitled to smaller amounts, or to the savings credit only, who may be less familiar with the entitlements available to them. The Pension Service has contacted pensioners to encourage them to take up entitlement to pension credit many times already as part of extensive marketing activity. Over 70 per cent. of those pensioners who appear to have entitlement to pension credit have been contacted over five times already. And around 25 per cent. of customers visited about pension credit say that they do not want to make a claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.0/6">However, we are committed to improving take-up and are continually looking at further ways to target these groups and encouraging them to apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.0/7">The information requested for pensioners in Great Britain is shown in the following tables. Estimates of entitled non-recipients of MIG or pension credit should be treated with caution. This is especially the case given that we are looking at the extreme of the income distribution and so are less sure of pensioners' modelled entitlement. Results are based on small sample sizes and have not been corrected for biases that may be inherent in estimates of entitlement to income related benefits&mdash;that is, they may be based on the data for those who appear to be entitled non-recipients but will not all actually be entitled non recipients and vice versa. Figures are therefore presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income.</p>

For the purposes of this analysis, benefit unit based data (take-up statistics) were combined with household equivalised income based results (Households Below Average Income statistics).<br/> 9. Estimates for 2000-01 and 2003-04 onwards incorporate the results of a data matching exercise, which links the Family Resources Survey with DWP administrative data in order to identify 'hidden recipients' of MIG-PC, i.e. those people who tell the FRS they do not receive pension credit, but actually do.<br/> 10. Estimates are presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income, as the analysis is based on single-year survey data and the absolute numbers of such pensioners who were not claiming the pension credit or minimum income guarantee they were entitled to might be biased due to small sample sizes.<br/> 11.

It therefore does not include cases where a pensioner is in receipt of some benefit, but this is less than the amount they are truly entitled to. Including these cases may not give a reliable indication of full take-up due to the potential error that exists in modelling entitlement.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1544W.5/1">There is a legal requirement to review the level of contracted-out rebate rates at least every five years&mdash;the next review is due to set rates from 2012 to 2017. However, the Secretary of State can, if he considers it necessary or appropriate, review rebate rates more frequently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1544W.5/2">The Government have considered the timing of the next review, taking account of both the current fiscal circumstances and of the pension reforms being introduced in the Pensions Bill. As a result, we do not believe it is necessary to review the rebate rates in the short term. However we will continue to monitor the impact on contracting out of the various pensions reforms, in particular the decision to abolish contracting out for defined contribution schemes. These factors will be taken into account when considering the timing of future reviews.</p>

We also collect data on official air travel, taxi use and the use of personal vehicles for business purposes.

	<p pid="b.1553W.0/1">The Department holds records of those staff who have declared a disability. However, this is not broken down by reason, therefore epilepsy cannot be separately identified. When staff are absent from work due to an epileptic episode, this is recorded on the Department's sickness absence database as a neurological condition and not specific to epilepsy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1558W.0/1">Consultancy services for advertising campaigns should be understood as the provision of strategic advice on campaigns, not their delivery. Most Government advertising is bought through the Central Office of Information (COI) and under the terms of COI framework agreements advertising agencies are contracted to supply advertising services only, i.e., creative products based on a communications strategy. Advertising agencies (on COI's roster) do not supply broader consultancy services. On occasion wider ranging consultancy projects may inform campaign work but the costs would not be attributed to the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558W.0/2">Where consultancy is provided by other organisations it usually results in a range of communication activities which may or may not include advertising; so it is not possible to distinguish the cost of providing consultancy for advertising from that for other forms of communication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558W.0/3">With reference to the second question (139518), the following table shows the advertising spend on information campaigns commissioned by the Department's Communications Directorate in the last five years.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.1558W.0/6"> <td><i> Financial year</i></td> <td><i> Advertising expenditure</i><i>  (&pound; million)</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1558W.0/14">We have no central record of advertising spend by Departmental agencies and could not obtain these without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558W.0/15">The budget for recruitment advertising below senior civil service level has been delegated to directorates over the period in question. The costs of advertising, as opposed to the other elements of recruiting, could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558W.0/16">For appointments to the senior civil service (SCS), recruitment advertising costs cannot be provided within cost threshold for 2004-05. In 2005-06, the total amount spent on recruitment for SCS posts was &pound;859,000 and in 2006-07 to date &pound;571,000. However, this is not just monies spent on advertising but on assessment centres, head-hunting and advertising.</p>

In particular, the University College London Hospitals (UCLH) Biomedical Research Centre and the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, formed this year, plan to undertake work on sudden cardiac death. The centrally funded budget for the cardiovascular disease research theme at UCLH is &pound;5.1 million over five years and for the heart research theme at Oxford is &pound;3.1 million over five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1564W.2/1">The Government consider that decision-making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional, or complementary/alternative treatments, has to be a matter for local national health service providers and practitioners as they are best placed to know their community's needs. In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of any treatments, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend. If they are unconvinced about the suitability of a particular treatment, they cannot be made to refer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.2/2">The Department recognises that the health needs of a community can differ from area to area and primary care trusts (PCTs) would reflect these needs in developing these policies.

The programme for resolving the technical and data issues relating to the production of DAP on the MHRA website is ongoing. This is a high priority for the Agency and full resolution is planned by the end of the 2007-08 business year.

	<p pid="b.1567W.5/1">National health service numbers are currently issued and controlled by the national health service central register (NHSCR). At close of business on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June 2007</phrase> the total number of records held by NHSCR on the central health record inquiry system (CHRIS) was 74,581,472. This included a number of deceased patients (9,166,168), and number of invalid records (355,735). The total of NHS numbers 'in issuance, at that point was therefore 65,059,569.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/2">The in issuance figure includes a further 7,903,001 numbers where the patient entry contains an exit or cancelled flag. There can be a number of reasons for this, such as where patients are known to have left the country on a permanent basis, armed forces personnel, and unregistered, the majority of which will be of notified births that have not yet been registered with a general practitioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/3">As part of the Department's NHS Connecting for Health Agency's demographics migration programme the personal demographics service (PDS) will replace the following existing NHS demographics services:</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/4" class="indent">the NHS Central Register (CHRIS);</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/5" class="indent">demographic functions of the national health applications and infrastructure services (NHAIS);</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/6" class="indent">the NHS strategic tracing service (NSTS); and</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/7" class="indent">NHS number for babies (NN4B).</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/8">Moving to the PDS becoming the single authoritative source of demographics will enable the existing national demographic systems to be shut down, resulting in reduced operational costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/9">The PDS is an essential element of the NHS care records service, underpinning the creation of an electronic care record for every registered NHS patient in England. It will serve as a gateway to the clinical record, enabling authorised healthcare professionals to locate quickly the clinical record that is uniquely associated with each demographic record. Unlike the previous services, this single authoritative source of demographics is already accessible throughout the NHS and is integrated fully with the other applications and services delivered as part of the national programme for information technology. It provides more convenience for patients as they need only notify one authorised healthcare organisation of a change of address, and this change will be then available to all healthcare organisations as and when the patient's records are accessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.5/10">The demographics migration programme is also endeavouring to eliminate use of NHS temporary, and old-format numbers. These peaked in November 2004 at some 273,578 temporary, and 8,474 old-format numbers. By May 2007 nationally these figures had reduced to some 78,997 temporary, and just 30 old-format numbers. The elimination of use of all temporary and old-format numbers within the NHS is on target to be achieved by spring 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1569W.0/1">In reviewing Part IX of the Drug Tariff, the Department is trying to ensure that there is transparency for the national health service between the reimbursement price for items and remuneration for services provided; there is none today. The aim is also to ensure that the NHS, and the taxpayer, is getting value for money&mdash;and, most importantly, that patient care is maintained or, where appropriate, improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.0/2">This is why there have been two recent consultations. One set out proposals for reimbursement levels for item price&mdash;&quot;Arrangements for the reimbursement pricing of stoma and incontinence appliances under Part IX of the Drug Tariff&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.0/3">The other, &quot;Arrangements for the remuneration of services relating to appliances within Part IX of the Drug Tariff&quot;, set our proposals relating to service provision; both what that service should be and the remuneration that the NHS would make for such services. Here the intent was to ensure fair remuneration of valued services provided by the pharmacy and appliance contractors. It was also designed to make sure that the services provided by all dispensing contractors are to the same standard no matter where in England a user of appliances may live.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.0/4">The underlying costs of the services they provide is a commercial matter for providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.0/5">As previously advised, the volume and complexity of the responses to the consultation are such that the Department has decided that it needs more time to analyse the information provided. Consequently, no changes will be implemented in July 2007 as proposed in the consultation documents.</p>

	<p pid="b.1569W.6/1">Forward payments have been made to the National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) suppliers to reduce contract costs. All forward payments are repayable in the event of subsequent non-commencement of services and are protected by bonds or charges against assets, which enable the payments to be withdrawn on demand. Moreover, forward payments are typically made after the contractor has already incurred the costs to which the payments relate. This prudent approach has subsequently been adopted as an option in guidance issued by the Office of Government Commerce in respect of the procurement of IT-enabled services from the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.6/2">The value of forward payments made to local service providers (LSPs) since inception of NPfIT, as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> are shown in the following tables. Forward payments are depleted as the supplier successfully delivers the contracted solutions. Instead of being paid as the projects go live, suppliers are allowed to recognise the appropriate amount of the forward payment for that project. The principle of payment on delivery is thus maintained.</p>

	<p pid="b.1573W.11/1">In March 2006, guidance on the implementation of smokefree legislation was published by Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services. The purpose of the guidance, which includes specific sections on no-smoking signs, is to support local council regulatory officers in successfully implementing smokefree legislation which will be enforced in England from 6 am on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">Sunday, 1 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1573W.11/2">The Department has also provided a two-phase training programme for local authorities on smokefree legislation and will shortly launch an e-learning facility so local authority officers can complete training at their workplace. Training also includes references to no-smoking sign requirements and has been provided to develop a standardised approach to the enforcement of the new smokefree law across England, and has been provided free of charge to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1574W.2/1">The Department has provided a two-phase training programme for local authorities on smokefree legislation and will shortly launch an e-learning facility for local authority officers to complete training at their work place. Training has been provided to develop a standardised approach to the enforcement of the new smokefree law across England, and has been provided free of charge to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1574W.2/2">The first phase of training was conducted between October to December 2006 for service planners within local authorities to assist the development of local smokefree implementation strategies. Some 450 officers attended this training. The second phase of training is currently being delivered for local authority regulatory officers to provide knowledge, practical skills and competencies so they can build compliance with the new law in their local areas. Some 1,150 places have been made available for local council officers for this training. The two-phase programme of training has been delivered to local councils free of charge by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) on a regional basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1574W.2/3">An e-learning facility has also been developed to provide training on the new smokefree law for local council officers.

	<p pid="b.1575W.0/1">Through the Smokefree England campaign, the Department is delivering a major communications campaign to support businesses to be prepared for the implementation of smokefree legislation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>. Recent surveys by the Department show levels of awareness amongst businesses and the general public have improved significantly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1575W.0/2">Information on the new law is available from the freephone Smokefree England information line on 0800 169 169 7 and on the Smokefree England website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1575W.0/4">Presently, the Smokefree England website receives approximately 100,000 visits a week, while the phone line receives 6,000 calls a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1575W.0/5">The Department has developed a range of guides on the new law. A Smokefree England information pack, including a guide, no-smoking signs and other support materials has been sent to all registered, actively trading businesses in England that employ staff during April. Guidance documents can be downloaded from the Smokefree England website, and are available in a range of different languages and accessible formats, including an MP3 audio version.</p>
	<p pid="b.1575W.0/6">The Department also continues to work closely with a diverse range of organisations across the country to increase awareness of the new legislation among their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1575W.0/7">In May, the Department commenced a national advertising campaign using a range of media to inform members of the public about what the legislation will mean when it comes in to force. While 93 per cent. of the overall population are aware of smokefree legislation, 45 per cent. don't know that it comes into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>. Therefore the campaign has been developed to assist the public to know when the law will be implemented, where the law will apply and what the penalties are for non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1575W.0/8">Local authorities are also working to build compliance in their communities through a diverse range of activity. Local businesses are advised to contact their local council for advice and support in implementing smokefree legislation. National health service trusts and local NHS Stop Smoking Services are also working in different ways to promote the new smokefree law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1575W.0/9">The total budget allocated to the Department of the smokefree communications campaign is &pound;8.5 million. The costs to local authorities and NHS trusts of their efforts to promote the new smokefree legislation could be made only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1577W.0/1">The information requested regarding the numbers of patients treated with maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is not held centrally. However, there is one such medical grade maggot which is now available on prescription in the United Kingdom so that general practitioners can use MDT in the community. There were around 1,100 prescriptions written for dispensing in the community for LarvE (the commercial brand name for the sterile maggots) in 2005, which does not include hospital use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has advised the national health service that the choice of debriding agent for difficult to heal surgical wounds should be based on comfort, odour control, other aspects relevant to patient acceptability, the type and location of the wound and total costs. The actual costs of treating difficult to heal wounds have not been measured. If specific services for the management of difficult to heal surgical wounds were to be developed throughout the NHS, there would be organisational and cost implications, which would need to be evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/3">My noble Friend, the Minister of State for Health (Lord Hunt), has received an invitation from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1450" name="Madeleine Moon">the hon.

Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase> regarding the issue of MDT.</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/4">The Health Technology Assessment Programme funded a trial of MDT to be undertaken by the Department of Health Sciences of the University of York. The study started on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-01">1 June 2004</phrase>, involving 600 patients with venous leg ulcers who were randomised to one of three treatment groups to compare their effects on healing and debridement times. The Government, through the Health Technology Assessment Programme, agreed to fund this study, which had been several years in the planning and cost over &pound;700,000. The report of the research is expected in early 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/5">MDT may cause pain or discomfort, particularly in patients already experiencing wound pain. This usually occurs about 24-36 hours into therapy and worsens as the larvae grow larger, Painkillers should help to relieve the pain; otherwise removing the maggot dressing provides immediate relief. The maggots should be contained within the wound. If they escape onto unprotected skin around the edges of the wound, the larvae secretions can cause a rash on the skin which resembles a superficial burn.</p>

It is not possible to identify separately appointments to the Crown court and county court as judges on the Circuit Bench and recorders are deployed to either. District judges sit in the county court only. Members of the full-time judiciary are not subject to formal appraisal after appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1581W.8/2">In addition to the minimum criteria set out in law for appointment to each level of post, applicants must demonstrate that they have the qualities and abilities needed to successfully take on judicial office, including relevant knowledge and experience, independence, professionalism, judgment and people skills. Information about candidates' political views is neither sought nor taken into account in the selection process. Since April 2006, the independent Judicial Appointments Commission has had the responsibility for appointments and has set out the qualities and abilities it believes are necessary for judicial office. These are: intellectual capacity, personal qualities, the ability to understand and treat fairly, authority and communication skills and efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1584W.2/1">Use of court cells does not form part of Operation Safeguard, which is an agreement with the police to hold prisoners overnight in police cells.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.2/2">81 invoices for the use of police cells under Operation Safeguard since October 2006 have been received. To date, 54 of these have been paid to the value of &pound;6,681,300. As different police forces may submit monthly, bi-monthly or consolidate invoices, the number expected is not known.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.2/3">Since the beginning of 2007 current data shows that court cells have been used on 373 occasions (as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June 2007</phrase>) over 16 nights. This does not correspond precisely to the number of prisoners: one occasion means one prisoner night in a court cell.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.2/4">To date, one invoice to the value of &pound;120,000 (excluding VAT) has been paid to cover the contingency of having places available in court cells between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-17">17 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February</phrase>. 12 prisoner nights were spent in court cells during this period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.2/5">Use of police cells to hold prisoners and of court cells to hold prisoners as a last resort will continue until operational capacity in prisons has increased to a level where all prisoners can be accommodated safely. NOMS is increasing prison capacity and has announced 8,000 new places by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.2/6">We estimate that it costs around &pound;385 per place per night to hold a prisoner in a police cell, and around &pound;300 for every place in a court cell (this cost is incurred whether the cell is used or not).</p>

	<p pid="b.1587W.5/1">The Prison Service takes prisoner and staff safety seriously and every prison is required to have in place a violence reduction strategy which requires establishments to do all they can to minimise violence. Additionally, Prison Officers in juvenile offender institutions are given the same defensive training in control and restraint techniques as officers in non-juvenile establishments who face similar risks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1588W.2/1">All prison officers employed in public sector prisons receive the same control and restraint training (and are required to complete annual refresher training) to prepare them for all types of incident, regardless of which type of establishment they are posted to. Personal protective equipment is available wherever the risk dictates, again regardless of the type of establishment. All prison officers are trained in its use.</p>

	<p pid="b.1588W.5/1">Extendable batons were issued in 2005 to all staff who carried the outdated wooden stave. Officers in juvenile establishments have never carried staves and at the time of the introduction of batons consideration was not given to widening their use. A review is planned later this year to consider what evidence there may be for extending the use of batons to other parts of the estate.</p>
