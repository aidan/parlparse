	<p pid="d.215W.2/1">The Directgov Motoring section and electronic vehicle licensing (eVL) were the sub-sites that received the most direct visitors and recorded the most online transactions in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.215W.2/2">We are looking at how we might make citizens who complete a transaction on one of these sub-sites aware of what else Directgov has to offer. This is relatively simple to do but requires the Departments who manage the content or own the transaction on the sub-sites to include the necessary changes to allow us to advertise other services.</p>
	<p pid="d.215W.2/3">One area in which we have seen a degree of success is the Act on CO2 campaign. The offline advertising calls for citizens to search online for the campaign without mentioning Directgov. Yet we know that about a fifth of people accessing the Act on CO2 campaign site have come from a promotion on the main Directgov website suggesting that they found the campaign while looking at something else on Directgov.</p>

	<p pid="d.216W.2/1">Directgov is promoted to the public through a variety of online and offline channels. Online promotion includes partnership arrangements with sites such as AOL and MSN. Directgov also undertakes search engine optimisation and pay per click activity with search engines such as Google, MSN and Yahoo.</p>
	<p pid="d.216W.2/2">Offline channels include an ongoing PR programme plus partnership activities with intermediaries such as Jobcentre Plus and UK Online Centres.</p>
	<p pid="d.216W.2/3">Directgov also undertook a month long marketing campaign in February 2006 and again in March 2008 which focused on the depth and breadth of the Directgov offer, new transactional content on the website, and on Directgov's multi-channel presence.</p>
	<p pid="d.216W.2/4">Looking ahead, as Directgov becomes the main point of entry to public services online, there is an imperative to generate a higher level of awareness of Directgov and its services to the public. Therefore Directgov is planning a national marketing campaign to run over the next three years, starting in January 2009. It will be a multi-media campaign, using TV, radio, print, partnerships, ambient and online channels to increase understanding of the depth and breadth of information and services available through Directgov on the web, mobile and DiTV. The aim is to demonstrate relevance to citizens and increase propensity to use Directgov, with consequential increase in brand awareness and visitor numbers to Directgov. This will help Departments to realise the benefits from Directgov by increasing use of the online channel.</p>
	<p pid="d.216W.2/5">Allied to this, we are looking at how we can use alternative channels such as branded 'widgets' and applications to deploy content onto third party sites in the future.</p>

	<p pid="d.218W.0/1">A communication strategy to support the changes to the eligibility rules for Income Support affecting lone parents is currently being implemented.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/2">The strategy has a very clear focus on the need for timely and accurate communications to (1) customers affected by the changes, (2) Jobcentre Plus staff in roles impacted by the changes, and (3) external stakeholders involved in giving accurate advice to customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/3">Key objectives of the communications strategy are to ensure that the following audiences receive co-ordinated, timely and tailored messages, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/4" class="indent">Existing lone parent customers and those making new or repeat claims to Income Support&mdash;understand the changes and how they will be affected</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/5" class="indent">Advisers working with customers&mdash;know how the changes will impact on them and their lone parent customers</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/6" class="indent">Stakeholders external to Jobcentre Plus&mdash;are clear on these changes and the effect they will have upon them and their customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/7">To meet these objectives the strategy includes the following:</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/8" class="indent">Mailshots sent direct on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October 2008</phrase> to specific lone parent customers, which outline the effect that the changes may have on them, including new requirements for quarterly attendance at work-focused interviews and how their claim to disability premium could be affected (where relevant).</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/9" class="indent">A further mailshot in on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-24">24 November 2008</phrase> to lone parents affected, confirming that the changes have been approved by Parliament. This will be supported by local mailshots to offer voluntary interviews 6 weeks prior to the end of the lone parents' Income Support.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/10" class="indent">Providing lone parent customers with detailed information factsheets that clearly outline the changes for them and the action they may need to take with the support of their adviser.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/11" class="indent">A leaflet and poster campaign to explain in visual format the steps each lone parent will take as the changes impact them.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/12" class="indent">Local 'Options and Choices' events for lone parents that explain the changes and offer advice and guidance in preparing for work (these have been in place since April 2008).</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/13" class="indent">Publication of details of the changes on both the DWP and Jobcentre Plus Internet sites.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/14" class="indent">A range of products available to Jobcentre Plus staff to ensure that they are able to deliver the correct messages to customers including briefings, desk aids, presentations, key messages, links to guidance and supporting articles in internal publications. This also includes roadshows delivered to senior managers to ensure understanding of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/15" class="indent">Numerous presentations to key external stakeholders and close engagement with external lone parent voluntary groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.0/16">The same approach is proposed for introduction of Phase 2 of the changes in 2009 and Phase 3 in 2010. However, in spring 2009 we will evaluate the Phase 1 communications and feed these findings into communication plans for the next phases.</p>

	<p pid="d.220W.2/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what guidance has been issued to Jobcentre Plus staff in relation to the time allowed to interview claimants by Jobcentre Plus. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus conducts a wide range of different interviews to meet both business and customer needs. Guidance to staff outlines the purpose and content of each interview type and the average length of time these should take to complete. Each interview takes into account the time required to undertake activities that must be covered in every interview and those that are only required as and when individual customer circumstances dictate.</p>

Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> 2. Small numbers<br/> To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> 3. Alcohol-related admissions<br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) &quot;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions&quot;.<br/> 4. Emergency admissions<br/> Includes all types of emergency admission (Method of admission codes 21-28).<br/> 5. Finished admission episodes<br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 6. Primary diagnosis<br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> 7. Secondary diagnoses<br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (6 prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> 8. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis<br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br/> Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> 9. Data Quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.226W.8/1">The cross-Government Adapting to Climate Change Programme increases Government's capacity to adapt by ensuring a co-ordinated approach across all Departments and the public sector. This includes implementation of the adaptation aspects of the Climate Change Act, such as development of the national climate risk assessment. Information about the programme can be found at</p>

	<p pid="d.226W.8/3">The Department of Health recognises that climate change will affect the health of UK citizens and in February, this year (2008) updated its 2001-02 report on the &quot;Health Effects of Climate Change in the UK&quot;. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.226W.8/4">Climate impacts affect many departmental responsibilities. We have worked closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to develop the adaptation sections of the Climate Change Act. There are therefore no plans at present to publish a separate climate change adaptation strategy as this would be seen as a duplication of the work that DEFRA are taking forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.226W.8/5">The key areas for the national health service in adapting to climate change include adapting the health and social care infrastructure (hospitals, nursing homes) to be more resilient to the effects of heat and floods; development of local 'Heatwave' and 'Flood' plans for coping with disasters; and increasing awareness of how people can adapt to changes in climate.</p>
	<p pid="d.226W.8/6">One of the effects of climate change already encountered in this country is the increased frequency of heat waves. The devastating heat wave across Europe in 2003 led to the Department of Health first launching its National Heatwave Plan in 2004, in which a 'Heat-Health Watch' system operates in England during the summer months, with advice from the Met Office, with four levels of response and appropriate advice.</p>

However, data on the number of people with individual conditions seen in primary care&mdash;such as depression&mdash;are not held centrally. While data are available on the total number of people admitted to the care of a consultant in secondary care with depression, they are likely to exclude many patients diagnosed with mild to moderate depression.</p>

The engagement activity included deliberative events with stakeholder organisations and with citizens. People were able to send in their views and comments via a dedicated website, by email or by post. Materials were also available for stakeholder organisations to run discussions within their own networks. We are in the process of analysing the responses and plan to publish a report of the responses received alongside the Green Paper.</p>
	<p pid="d.238W.0/2">Over 1,000 people attended the deliberative events run by the Department. We also received over 1,600 responses via the website, by email and by letter. Some of these responses summarise discussions with groups of people, or the results of surveys or petitions carried out by organisations as part of the engagement. Some of those responding via website did so more than once.</p>

The UK Intellectual Property Office has lead responsibility for the Government's national strategy on intellectual property crime and produces regular enforcement reports.</p>

	<p pid="d.240W.2/1">Communication providers (CPs), contracted call handling agents and the emergency authorities have responsibilities which are outlined in the code of practice for the Public Emergency Call Service (PECS). PECS is intended to deal with the method of handling '999/112' public emergency telephone calls between the call handling agents (CHAs) and the emergency authorities (EAs) in the United Kingdom (Police, Fire, Ambulance and Coastguard). All CPs have obligations under the Communications Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.240W.2/2">Section 4.6 of the PECS Code of Practice covers 'Calls without service request'. This relates to silent calls. It states that:</p>
	<p pid="d.240W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;There are many calls to 999/112 where a caller does not actually request an EA. In the overwhelming majority of cases these are children playing or customer misdials, but there is always a possibility of it being a genuine caller who cannot speak Very large numbers of accidental 999/112 calls are received from mobile phones.</p>
	<p pid="d.240W.2/4" class="indent">CHA Emergency Operators (CHA EO) try to obtain a response by asking the normal questions&mdash;for example &quot;which service is required&quot;, and &quot;if you cannot speak but need help please tap the handset screen.&quot; In cases where nothing apart from general noise (no speech) is heard, or where the voice link is terminated during CHA questioning (perhaps with background speech or noise), it is recognised that there is a negligible chance that it is genuine and the CHA EO can end the call.</p>
	<p pid="d.240W.2/5" class="indent">Where there is no response, the voice channel remains open and background voices are present it is recognised that the CHA cannot decide whether an EA is needed. In this case the call is connected to a police voice response system hosted by the Metropolitan Police Service which asks caller to press '5' twice if help is required. If 55 is pressed then immediate connection with the appropriate police authority is made. For any cases where suspicious noises are heard the CHA can override the above procedures and connect to a police EACR&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.240W.2/6">While the Home Office has oversight of the police service's handling of 999/112 calls, Other Government Departments are responsible for the 999/112 call handling standards of the other emergency services.</p>

	<p pid="d.241W.6/1">In 2004, following a trial in five forces, the then Home Secretary agreed that chief officers of all police forces in England and Wales could make Taser available to authorised firearms officers as a less lethal option for use in situations where a firearms authority had been granted in accordance with criteria laid down in the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.6/2">The Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July 2007</phrase> that authorised police firearms officers in England and Wales would be able to use Taser in a wider set of circumstances. These officers are now able to deploy Taser in operations or incidents where the use of firearms is not authorised, but where they are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves or the subject.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.6/3">Following the success of a 12 month trial in ten police forces, the Home Secretary agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-24">24 November 2008</phrase> to allow Chief Officers of all forces in England and Wales, from <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase>, to extend the use of Taser to specially trained units in accordance with current Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) policy and guidance. This sets out that Taser can only be used by specially trained units where officers would be facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves and/or the subject(s).</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.6/4">The cost of supplying Tasers to all forces in England and Wales is dependent on the operational decisions of Chief Officers on deployment of Taser. The Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-24">24 November 2008</phrase> that the Home Office would be making available a one-off injection of funding to support the purchase of up to 10,000 Tasers for use by police forces in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="d.246W.2/1">The Government believe that the ability to speak and write English is vital to integrating into British society and to improving equality of opportunity. Language skills help people get on in the workplace and make a contribution to their local community. Migrants who have a good level of English are employed at a higher level, are able to work safely and confidently in their jobs, find it easier to integrate into society; and are aware of the unwritten rules of behaviour. We are therefore promoting the learning of English through the immigration and citizenship process and the provision of English language classes.</p>
	<p pid="d.246W.2/2">Government have taken the following steps to encourage immigrants to learn English:</p>
	<p pid="d.246W.2/3" class="indent">In December 2007, we published Guidance on Translation for local authorities. The guidance spreads existing good practice, which ensures that translation is only provided where it is necessary and acts as a stepping stone to speaking English.</p>
	<p pid="d.246W.2/4" class="indent">The Home Office Green Paper on citizenship (published <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February 2008</phrase>) considers that it is right to allow ESOL further education courses at the 'home rate' in order that migrants can acquire key skills needed for good community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="d.246W.2/5" class="indent">Funding changes for ESOL provision were introduced last August to improve accessibility for the most vulnerable learners, with those who can afford to pay for English classes currently contributing up to 37.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.246W.2/6" class="indent">In October 2007 DIUS launched a new suite of ESOL for work qualifications. The new qualifications are shorter and more work-focused than traditional ESOL qualifications, giving learners practical English skills in essential workplace matters, such as health and safety and customer service. These provide more flexibility and choice for employers, agencies and learners. Employers should share responsibility for supporting employees with ESOL needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.246W.2/7" class="indent">The DIUS consultation on ESOL earlier this year set out an approach to ESOL funding centred on integration and community cohesion outcomes, and placing the assessment of need at a local level. DIUS are currently developing more detailed proposals for future ESOL funding on the basis of the consultation response.</p>

	<p pid="d.252W.8/1">The Department holds figures on capital works to windows (double-glazing), central heating and insulation for all local authority social sector dwellings. This information is collected and published through the annual Local Authority Business Plan Statistical Appendix (BPSA) returns. A set of tables containing information for the last seven years (2000-01 to 2006-07) by local authority and region has been placed in the House Libraries. Data are not collected at a constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="d.252W.8/2">Since 2001, many local authorities have chosen to transfer their entire social stock to registered social landlords through the option of large scale voluntary transfer (LSVT). The table reflects the increasing occurrence of these changes over the seven-year period as data are only collected from authorities which own their own stock or have set up an arm's length management organisation to manage their stock.</p>
	<p pid="d.252W.8/3">The Tenant Services Authority, the regulator of all housing associations in England, does not hold any information on energy efficiency measures put in place under the Decent Homes programme by housing associations.</p>

	<p pid="d.268W.2/1">In Northern Ireland, Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 ensures that equality issues, including disability, are integral to the whole range of public policy decision making.

	<p pid="d.268W.2/2">Section 49A of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995) (as amended by Article 5 of the Disability Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 2006) introduced the 'disability duties' in Northern Ireland to reflect changes to disability legislation in Great Britain. In addition to section 75 the Northern Ireland Office is therefore required, when carrying out its functions, to have due regard to the need to:</p>
	<p pid="d.268W.2/3" class="indent">promote positive attitudes towards disabled people; and</p>
	<p pid="d.268W.2/4" class="indent">encourage participation by disabled people in public life.</p>
	<p pid="d.268W.2/5">Under Section 49B of the DDA 1995, the NIO submitted a three year disability action plan to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland which sets out how it proposes to fulfil the disability duties in relation to its functions.</p>
	<p pid="d.268W.2/6">The NIO reports annually to the Equality Commission on its equality scheme and this includes a report on progress against its disability action plan.

	<p pid="d.272W.2/2">E.ON estimate that the proposed Kingsnorth super-critical boilers could attain an efficiency of around 47 per cent. against 37 per cent. efficiency from the existing Kingsnorth sub-critical boilers.</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/3">E.ON also estimate that the proposed Kingsnorth station could emit 8.6 MtCO2 per year, based on maximum assumptions of 0.717 MtCO2 per TWh of electricity and an estimated output of 12 TWH per year (cf 9.85 TWh achieved by the existing station in 2006). But actual output will depend on many factors, including the relative price of fossil fuels, the price of carbon, and whether, and if so when, any carbon abatement technology is fitted.</p>

It will work closely with research currently being carried out by the Southern Africa Federation of Disabled People's Research Project (&pound;2.2 million) which has been running since 2007. This five-year project which has been designed and run by disabled people in the region, has already started to produce evidence of the kinds of barriers disabled people face when trying to access basic services like health and education.</p>

	<p pid="d.279W.2/1">The Government announced in January 2008 a &pound;140 million strategy to educate the next generation of scientists and mathematicians and help recruit and train more science and mathematics teachers. Much work is underway to improve the number of specialist teachers, this includes:</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/2" class="indent">increasing the value of the teacher training bursary for science graduates to &pound;9,000 in September 2006, and the 'Golden Hello' for new science teachers rose to &pound;5,000 for trainees who trained on PGCE and equivalent courses from September 2005;</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/3" class="indent">continuing to recruit science graduates into teaching with incentives for providers of &pound;2,000 per recruit to attract more physics and chemistry teachers;</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/4" class="indent">offering courses to enhance physics and chemistry subject skills for those entering teaching who do not have a recent degree, or who have a related degree, in the subject;</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/5" class="indent">piloting accredited courses to give existing science teachers without a physics or chemistry specialism the deep subject knowledge and pedagogy they need to teach these subjects effectively, those who gain accreditation will receive a &pound;5,000 incentive. These courses are to be rolled out nationally from July 2009;</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/6" class="indent">setting up a mentoring scheme to support newly qualified science teachers which is to be piloted from July 2009;</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/7" class="indent">introducing a new cadre of science specialist higher level teaching assistants to support teachers;</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/8" class="indent">funding the Student Associate Scheme in which science undergraduates spend time in school supporting teachers; and</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/9" class="indent">establishing the Transition to Teaching programme to get employers to encourage talented staff to retrain as secondary school teachers in physics, chemistry, ICT and mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/10">The Government are also committed to improving the quality of teaching and learning. The Secondary National Strategy provides continuing professional development for science teachers focused on raising pupils' attainment. In partnership with the Wellcome Trust we have set up a national network of Science Learning Centres to provide professional development for science teachers, technicians and other science educators. The training focuses on encouraging innovative and exciting teaching practice that will enthuse and inspire young people. Together with the Wellcome Trust and industry, we are funding 'Project Enthuse' to enable science teachers to experience high quality professional development in contemporary science at the National Science Learning centre over the next five years and DCSF is also funding Impact Awards available to teachers attending the regional Science Learning Centres.</p>

	<p pid="d.280W.2/1">'Special measures' is not a term that the Department uses with reference to its engagement with local authority children's services. Ministers may take action to engage with local authorities where there is evidence of weakness in performance, for example as the result of 'inadequate' Ofsted judgment(s) in annual performance assessments (APAs) and joint area reviews (JARs). Such intervention can take various forms, from offering external improvement support, enhanced monitoring and challenge through to issuing an improvement notice (IN) in more serious cases. In the most serious cases, the Secretary of State may decide to make use of his statutory powers of direction and intervention.</p>
	<p pid="d.280W.2/2">In the last five years, Ministers have made use of their statutory powers of direction in relation to North East Lincolnshire (2005), Stoke-on-Trent (2007) and Haringey (2008), and have issued improvement notices to Salford, Leicester City and Surrey. We have also intervened without the use of statutory powers or improvement notices in various local authorities, deploying a range of improvement support options, including external consultancy support teams, independently-chaired improvement boards and enhanced monitoring arrangements.

	<p pid="d.299W.2/1">Responsibility for judicial training lies with the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary and is exercised through the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Maurice Kay. It would not therefore be appropriate for me to issue guidance on judicial training to the JSB.</p>
	<p pid="d.299W.2/2">The JSB's Magisterial Committee considered this recommendation. Because of the infrequency and relatively straightforward nature of such cases heard in the magistrates courts, and the fact that magistrates have qualified legal advisers to advise them on the principles involved, it was not thought appropriate to train all magistrates and legal advisers.</p>
	<p pid="d.299W.2/3">A paper entitled &quot;The law relating to criminal offences involving infringement of intellectual property rights&quot; was commissioned from a senior QC and is available to judicial office holders and legal advisers on the JSB training website.</p>
	<p pid="d.299W.2/4">Intellectual Property is a specialist area dealt with by a small cadre of specialist judges. It has not been the practice of the JSB to focus on teaching specialist substantive law, and the primary responsibility remains with judges (as with professional lawyers) for updating themselves. The relevant jurisdictional law still provides the background for all JSB training and any important changes will be highlighted at relevant training events.</p>

	<p pid="d.302W.2/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) offers a range of accredited programmes for offenders based on their specific behavioural needs as well as other activities such as education, work, resettlement and training. The programmes are accredited to be responsive to the diverse needs of offenders. There are no accredited offending behaviour programmes targeted specifically at offenders who have been convicted or are serving sentences for crimes where hate or racism was an aggravating factor. Many of the existing accredited programmes address risk factors found in such offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.302W.2/2">Some establishments and probation areas also deliver non-accredited programmes which are agreed locally to meet a particular need. Information on all these courses is not currently collated centrally. NOMS is aware that Merseyside, West Yorkshire and London probation areas have developed local packages to address issues around hatred and racially motivated offending.</p>
	<p pid="d.302W.2/3">NOMS is currently undertaking a census of non-accredited programmes delivered in custody and the community, which will show the number and type of programmes available for hate crime offenders. Following the census, there will be a programme of work to assess the benefits of certain interventions in addressing particular types of offending. Locally developed programmes that tackle hate crime are likely to fall into scope for such a review.</p>

	<p pid="d.310W.0/1">Central NOMS data do not use the term 'incidents of violence'; information is recorded under the term assaults. The following tables show incidents of prisoner on prisoner assaults in Feltham A and Feltham B in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.310W.0/2">The information is set out in the tables and is subject to important qualifications. The NOMS incident reporting system processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide an indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute.</p>
	<p pid="d.310W.0/3">Assault data are complex and the numbers need to be interpreted with caution. Information recorded as assault incidents may involve one or many prisoners as some assault incidents may involve more than one assailant or more than one victim.</p>
	<p pid="d.310W.0/4">The numbers supplied refer to the number of individual assault incidents. The numbers refer to all incidents recorded as assaults; these may also include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact events and allegations.</p>
	<p pid="d.310W.0/5">Ministers, NOMS and the Prison Officers' Association are collectively committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form. Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy and since mid 2007 this has been applied to the public and contracted out estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety.</p>

	<p pid="d.310W.0/50">The average population at HMYOI Feltham during this period was 609. Age is a known risk factor and younger prisoners are more likely to be involved in assaults than older prisoners. As regrettable as each assault incident is, the numbers are within the expected range.</p>

Adjudication awards are determined at a local level and therefore those awarded at HMYOI Feltham are not comparable to those awarded at other establishments.
