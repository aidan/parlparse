	<p pid="a.1440W.3/2">UK law enforcement agencies have reported a recent growth in the trafficking of illicit drugs through West Africa, including Cape Verde. We welcome the Cape Verdian Government's strong commitment to enforcing the rule of law and taking action against international organised crime. As a result of a short-term assessment of the increased use of Cape Verde as a drugs transit route, we are engaged with the Cape Verdian Government and other international partners in the region to identify both the nature of this development and how shared resources might be deployed to the region to best effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.3/3">Our Ambassador to Senegal, who has responsibility for the Islands of Cape Verde, met with Cape Verdian Ministers and officials in December 2005 to discuss a range of issues affecting the islands. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Department for International Development (Hilary Benn) is writing to the Cape Verdian Minister of Foreign Affairs about our work, with EU partners, to help the Cape Verde authorities tackle the growing problem of illicit drug trafficking through the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.1441W.2/1">The UN framework convention on climate change least developed countries fund will support national adaptation programmes in the poorest developing countries. Operational guidance for the fund was recently adopted by parties at the climate change conference in Montreal, December 2005. When the programming document for the fund is agreed by the Council of the Global Environment Facility, who will oversee the operation of the fund, the UK will consider providing finance. We recognise the fund's importance in helping Governments of the poorest developing countries manage the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1441W.2/2">As of April 2005, nine donors, including the UK, pledged approximately &pound;19 million to the special climate change fund. The UK contribution amounts to over half of this;&mdash;&pound;10 million over three years: 2005&ndash;06, 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. This will be available to support any developing country in managing the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1441W.2/3">Parties to the UN convention on climate change deferred a decision on activating the adaptation fund until management arrangements have been agreed, which should take place this year. The principle revenue stream to the fund will come from a 2 per cent. levy on emissions trading under the clean development mechanism.</p>

	<p pid="a.1441W.5/5">In Eritrea, DFID does not have any projects to support the promotion of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1441W.5/6">In Pakistan, DFID has provided &pound;525,000 to build the capacity of parliamentarians at the federal and provincial levels; &pound;326,000 to strengthen the capacity of local political party branches and &pound;208,531 for election monitoring to develop an understanding of the processes and outcomes of the 2005 local elections. DFID is also supporting the promotion of grassroots democracy across its projects by providing: &pound;2.8 million for a Gender Equality Project through the British Council to strengthen the capacity of local organisations to achieve access for women to political and economic decision making, protection from violence, and equal treatment in law; &pound;18 million through the Asian Development Bank to strengthen the ability of civil society to demand improved delivery of services and access to justice and approximately &pound;5 million for a Citizen Empowerment Initiative to strengthen the capacity of civil society organisations to engage government on issues of social exclusion, human rights and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1441W.5/7">In Russia, DFID has promoted democracy by addressing issues of community participation, voice and accountability across the technical cooperation programmes. The ongoing projects include: a &pound;3,800,000 Public Administration and Civil Service Reform Project to ensure greater transparency of the civil service, to promote freedom of information and to encourage civilian participation in the public administration reform process; &pound;4,980,000 Support to Poverty Reduction in Leningrad Region (Oblast) Programme to strengthen the capacity of the region and municipal authorities to develop community-based alternatives to service delivery and alternative approaches to income earning for young people of mixed abilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1441W.5/8">In Burma, DFID does not fund any projects solely focused on promoting democracy. DFID works with a range of partners including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the UN and international NGOs across health, education and livelihoods issues in a way that empowers civil society and communities. For example, DFID is providing &pound;4 million to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) over four years to help improve livelihoods for poor rural people through participatory local-level decision making.</p>

	<p pid="a.1447W.9/2">Health and Safety audits and Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessments are conducted on work stations as a matter of course, but should a member of staff feel that their 'work station' is not comfortable or their chair, desk or position of their computer terminal is causing discomfort to their back, they can request a DSE risk assessment. These assessments are conducted by trained assessors, who look to aid or prevent chronic back pain by ensuring that:</p>

	<p pid="a.1449W.8/1">The electoral process needs to fit with modern lifestyles and allow better access for those who find the voting process difficult. To this end, the Government are exploring options to improve the process of electoral registration and voting process. Any improvements to the system would however need to take into account security considerations; being at least as secure, if not more secure, than arrangements currently in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1449W.8/2">When the Co-ordinated Online Record of Electors (CORE) project is fully implemented we are proposing that electors may be able to access their information securely online and notify an ERO of any changes via the CORE system. Some EROs already use email and the internet to improve efficiency in parts of the registration process. However the law does not permit the use of email or internet for all electoral registration functions. In additional to this, we will also look at how email and the internet might play a role in increasing access to and participation in voting.</p>

The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), as part of its ongoing programme of democratic engagement, is actively working with committed organisations to promote awareness of voter registration at the national and local levels and in particular to deliver a pan-London campaign (&quot;Get London Registered&quot;) directed at London's 'urban youth'.

	<p pid="a.1454W.0/1">This information is not held centrally. The Returning officer at a local election, has a duty to publish the results of that election, including the names of the candidate(s) elected, the number of votes each candidate received and the number of rejected ballot papers under each head shown in the statement of rejected ballot papers (Rule 44(1 )<i>(c)</i> of the Local Elections (Principle Areas) Rules 1983). There is no duty, however, to inform the Government of the result of a local election. The local authority in question should hold this information.</p>
