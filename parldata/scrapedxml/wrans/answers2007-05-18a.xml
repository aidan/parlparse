	<p pid="a.932W.5/1">DCMS supports the teaching of science and engineering in the following ways:</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/2" class="italic"> (a) Museums</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/3">As highlighted in the OSI's review of DCMS's contribution to science and research, DCMS's sponsored bodies play a huge role in delivering public engagement in science through their educational and outreach programmes. DCMS spends &pound;340 million (2007-08) on its directly sponsored museums and allocates &pound;45 million (2007-08) to regional hub museums through the 'Renaissance in the Regions' programme, managed by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA).</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/4">Some individual museums have a direct remit for science education, such as the National Museum of Science and Industry (&pound;38.48 million GIA in 2007-08), Natural History Museum (&pound;45.09 million), Museum of Science and Industry Manchester (&pound;4.17 million) and National Maritime Museum (&pound;18.41 million) and a number of other DCMS-sponsored museums, for example National Museums Liverpool, have a significant science and technology-based element to their collections and offer a range of science-based learning activities. In addition, the Department awarded grants totalling &pound;401,000 in 2006-07 through the DCMS/Wolfson Museums and Galleries Improvement Fund to museums with predominantly science-based collections.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/5">DCMS funding has been directed by the Museums, Libraries and Archives (MLA) Council in a number of ways that allow regional museums to promote science and engineering to the general public, or to add value to the teaching of those subjects in schools:</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/6" class="indent">through Renaissance hub funding&mdash;many of the regional hub museums hold significant science and engineering collections;</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/7" class="indent">through the Renaissance Designated Challenge Fund&mdash;to improve the management and accessibility of collections designated as nationally significant for the benefit of the public;</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/8" class="indent">through the PRISM Grant Fund&mdash;grants are awarded to museums and similar organisations in England and Wales for the purpose of acquiring or conserving objects of scientific and industrial importance. A total of &pound;250,000 is allocated to the fund each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/9" class="italic"> (b) Science centres</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/10">DCMS does not fund science centres. When the Millennium Commission first provided funding to set up science centres there was an expectation they would be self-supporting within three years. The DfES and DTI jointly gave science centres a &pound;2 million funding package in 2004-06 to help alleviate short-term financial problems and provided a further &pound;750,000 over the period 2006-08 for project work managed by Ecsite-uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/11" class="italic"> (c) Other projects</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/12">Since 2003 the National Museum of Science and Industry and its regional partner museums and galleries have received a total of &pound;960,000 through the joint DCMS/DfES-funded museum education programme (known as 'Strategic Commissioning') for a series of projects designed to enrich the teaching of science in schools and to support the informal learning of older members and adults with English as a second language from local communities in north London. Through the same programme the Natural History Museum and its regional partners have received &pound;560,000 for project work, which is supporting the teaching of secondary science in schools across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/13">MLA through the Renaissance Subject Specialist Networks (SSNs) grant programme enables specific networks of museums and galleries to share knowledge, expertise and collections, with the aim of improving visitors' experiences. Current SSNs include those which promote science and engineering to the general public, or are involved in adding value to the teaching of those subjects in schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.935W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. I am responding, with his authority, on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps he has taken to combat the problem of parents diverting their income through company employees to avoid paying their children's full entitlement of child support.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/5" class="indent">Existing child support legislation includes provisions for both old and new scheme cases to cover circumstances where the non-resident parent appears to have reduced or diverted their income to avoid meeting their obligations to maintain their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/6" class="indent">For old scheme cases, where the parent with care has evidence that the non-resident parent is reducing their income to avoid their responsibilities, they can ask the Agency to review the maintenance assessment. This application, known as a 'Departure Direction', as the parent with care is requesting that the Agency departs from the original maintenance calculation, can be made in cases where the non-resident parents are able to control they amount of income they receive and where they unreasonably reduce that income.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/7" class="indent">For new scheme cases the procedure is similar, if the parent with care has evidence to believe that the non resident parent is diverting income for the purpose of reducing the maintenance assessment, they can apply for a 'Variation' to the maintenance assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/8" class="indent">In either case, the decision maker will consider whether; the non-resident parent has the ability to control the amount of income they receive and whether they have deliberately reduced the level of income by diverting it to someone else or into a business in order to reduce or avoid child maintenance. The Agency is also required to consider whether it is &quot;just and equitable&quot; to make a departure or variation decision. Broadly this means that the result of the departure or variation must be fair, taking account of all the circumstances of the case, and, in particular, the welfare of any child likely to be affected. This includes the child for whom maintenance is paid as well as any other children living with either parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/9" class="indent">The Agency will then consider the evidence and decide whether to restore the maintenance due to the level that it would have been had the income not been reduced. A typical example would be where the parent diverts income from a business to their spouse &mdash;who also works for the business&mdash;or where profits are retained in the company rather than producing an income.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/10" class="indent">Finally, where an allegation is made or conflicting evidence exists that suggests the non-resident parent has made a false statement, the Agency will consider whether a referral to the Agency's Criminal Compliance Team is appropriate. Section 14A (2) of the Child Support Act 1991 makes it an offence to knowingly make a false statement in reply to a request for information.</p>

	<p pid="a.936W.2/6" class="indent">The Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005 extended the ground in Regulation 19 of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations for a variation for income not taken into account under the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000. Variation regulations were extended to cover cases in which the non-resident parent has the ability to control the amount of income he receives from a company or business and the Secretary of State is satisfied he is receiving income that would not otherwise be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/7" class="indent">The Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005 also amended the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000 by making provision to take into account financial assistance paid in respect to the long-term illness or disability of a relevant other child or disability living allowance paid on behalf of that child, to a member of the non-resident parent's household where there is an application for a variation for special expenses for that relevant other child. The Regulations also made a number of consequential amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/8" class="indent">The variations regime is intended to ensure the Agency offers an accurate and fair service to both the non-resident parent and the parent with care. It allows for variations to the amount of maintenance due based on extraordinary factors not covered by the standard formula. The Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005 broadened the scope of the Agency's ability to ensure non-resident parents meet their financial responsibilities, and are not penalised for unavoidable increased living costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/9" class="indent">No specific assessment of the impact of the changes made by the Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005 has been conducted.</p>

	<p pid="a.939W.3/1">The Revitalising Health and Safety target for injury which applies to Great Britain is to reduce the incidence rate of fatal and major injury by 10 per cent. between 1999-2000 and 2009-10; the pro-rata target for 2005-06 is a 6 per cent. reduction. The available sources indicate no clear change since the base year in the rate of fatal and major injury to employees. Since 2000, HSE has concentrated on key priority areas in partnership with industry and others. This has resulted in significant improvements in, for example, falls from height where the number of injuries has reduced. This activity has begun to shown through to the overall fatal and major injuries rate</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/2">The Health and Safety Executive has a public service agreement (PSA) target to reduce injuries by 3 per cent. between 2004-05 and 2007-08. In the first year of this agreement, the rate of fatal and major injuries dropped by 6.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/3">There were 212 fatalities to workers reported for the whole year of 2005-06, 223 for 2004-05, and 236 in 2003-04. For the first six months of 2006-07, there were 124 fatal injuries to workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/4">There were 28,605 major injuries reported for employees in 2005-06, compared with 30,451 in 2004-05, and 30,689 in 2003-04. For 2005-06, there were also 117,471 other injuries to employees reported causing an absence of over three days.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/5">In 2003 (the most recent year for which data are available across the European Union) the average rate of work-related fatal injury in the European Union, excluding transport accidents, is 2.5 per 100,000 workers. The British rate is 1.1&mdash;the lowest across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/6">EUROSTAT has estimated that there were 3.5 million over three day injuries in the EU, allowing for under-reporting. This translates into a non-fatal rate of 3334 per 100,000 workers. The British rate is 1614. The British rate of workplace non-fatal injury in 2003 is the fourth lowest among EU member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.943W.3/2">However, the UK Government's support for biofuels has, to date, come mainly in the form of fuel duty incentives. A 20p per litre fuel duty incentive was introduced for biodiesel in 2002 and for bioethanol in 2005. Detailed information on the level of biofuel sales that these duty incentives have supported in each year since 2002 is available via the HM Customs and Revenue website at <a href="http://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=bulloil">www.uktradeinfo.com/index. cfm?task=bulloil</a> The figures in the following table set out the total amount of duty that has been foregone on biofuel sales because of these incentives.</p>

	<p pid="a.944W.5/1">The Strategic Rail Authority made an extensive study of the effects of ERTMS on the UK railway. Network Rail now leads the National ERTMS Programme and has updated the SRA's work. If applied when a line is being resignalled, ERTMS can reduce the overall cost of the railway and support capacity enhancement. ERTMS also produces a small safety improvement over and above the high level of train protection afforded by TPWS. However, the capacity and cost benefits only apply if ERTMS Level 2 is used to eliminate lineside signalling. The Cambrian Early Deployment Scheme will demonstrate the use of this technology in the UK for the first time.</p>

The programme is still in the planning stages and the number of places to be provided beyond 2007 has not been finalised. However, this year the capacity of the prison estate will increase in total by around 2,200 places. This includes 700 places from the 8,000 programme and the remainder from already planned expansions. All of the new places this year will be provided at existing prison sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.949W.3/3">The estimated total capital cost of the new 8,000 places is around &pound;1.5 billion. The breakdown of costs in each of the next five years has not yet been finalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.951W.8/1">HMRC are aware that a number of incorrect tax credit award notices have been sent out, including some containing partial information about another claimant's tax credit claim. This was caused by an isolated problem with one of the printers. HMRC take confidentiality very seriously and have robust procedures in place to protect information provided by claimants. As soon as they became aware of the incident, they corrected the problem with the printer and have taken steps to ensure there can be no recurrence. HMRC established that the incident affected around 42,000 families. In particular, 8,000 notices were sent out which contained some bank account details for a claimant other than the recipient.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.8/2">HMRC's immediate priority was to protect claimants' personal data and to ensure the correct information was provided to tax credit claimants. HMRC wrote to all claimants affected to apologise for this mistake; to provide the correct tax credit award notice; to advise them of the action that HMRC has taken to protect affected claimants; and to provide information on what further steps claimants may wish to take in response to this incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.8/3">As a precautionary measure HMRC immediately alerted the banking industry who issued a general alert to the banks. HMRC also provided the information necessary for the banks of affected claimants to put the appropriate safeguards in place. HMRC also informed the Information Commissioner.

	<p pid="a.953W.5/1">Fear of crime is at historically low levels but we are not complacent and acknowledge that older people continue to have a high level of fear of crime despite the relatively low risk of them becoming victims of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/2">Previous work to lower this level of fear amongst older people has focused on addressing the misperceptions about crime by promoting the facts about crime levels, and encouraging common-sense precautions which individuals can take to prevent becoming a victim. This has been achieved by working with charities such as Help the Aged and Age Concern to find new and better ways of tackling fear among the older population, as well as tackling the crimes committed against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/3">In addition, we are working to improve public confidence and, in turn, fear of crime. The roll out of neighbourhood policing will impact significantlyon confidence in the police. Greater community engagement, more visible policing in communities and increased local accountability of crime and disorder reduction partnerships will all aid the reduction of fear of crime amongst the elderly.</p>

	<p pid="a.961W.2/1">DFID has engaged in a wide range of project, programme and policy efforts designed to improve the cultural, economic and political situation of women in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/2">The third White Paper on International Development (published July 2006), &quot;Eliminating world poverty: making governance work for the poor&quot;, underlined DFID's commitment to give greater priority to work to support gender equality and women's rights in our development assistance, responding to key priorities of African institutions like the African Union (AU) and New partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/3">Our gender equality action plan (launched March 2007) sets out how we will meet these commitments. DFID is further strengthening its analysis of gender equality through country governance assessments and through discussions with partner governments and regional institutions such as the AU. This will enable DFID to support efforts on women's empowerment and equality, including the Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa (SDGEA) and The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. DFID will continue to support efforts to increase girls' enrolment in primary school, reduce HIV prevalence among women and girls, reduce maternal mortality, give social protection for the very poorest women and increase employment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/4">Examples of initiatives to address these issues include the following.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/5">In Sudan, DFID is empowering women in some of the poorest, marginalised communities as they learn to read and write assisted by the literacy and livelihood programme as well as supporting social marketing of mosquito nets, specifically targeting pregnant women and mothers of children under five.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/6">In Ethiopia DFID is a key contributor to the Government's productive safety nets programme which targets some of the most vulnerable households such as those headed by women.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/7">In Nigeria DFID has contributed to a girls' education programme improving net enrolment for girls especially in northern Nigeria, by addressing cultural and economic barriers. The security, justice and growth programme, through partnership with the Centre for Islamic Legal Studies, has carried out path-breaking analytical work on women's rights under Sharia law.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/8">DFID is supporting efforts to eradicate female genital mutilation; this includes the production of a best practice resource for civil society groups to encourage strong and appropriate legislation to protect women and children against this practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/9">We have formed a partnership with the International Finance Cooperation to undertake gender and growth analysis in a number of African countries including Tanzania, Rwanda and Nigeria. This is expected to lead to concrete changes in legislation and new investments.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/10">DFID is providing support to the World Bank's gender action plan, which has a particular focus on Africa including the launch of new programmes focused on women's economic empowerment.</p>

	<p pid="a.963W.5/3">In each of the last five years, final decisions about CSCF and DAF proposals have been rescheduled beyond original target dates, as a result of external circumstances and the need to carry out thorough due diligence checks across a wide range of organisations. In all cases, applicants have been kept fully informed about revised timetables and delays have been kept to a minimum (no greater than four weeks and usually significantly less).

	<p pid="a.965W.0/1">DFID's financing of education plans is largely provided through general and sector budget support and it is not possible to disaggregate our support to show precisely how much has gone towards <i> (a)</i> children transferring from private and unregulated schools to the state sector and <i> (b)</i> children who previously received no schooling. Where there have been increases in enrolment as a result of the abolition of school fees, only aggregate data are available, it is not possible to identify where the extra children have come from. The primary source of global data on enrolment of school children is the Education for All Global Monitoring Report. The 2007 Report was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase> and may be accessed via:</p>

	<p pid="a.965W.0/3">The UK's support to education is provided through bilateral and multilateral channels, including the Education For All Fast Track Initiative. DFID provides bilateral support tow partner governments to help them develop and implement their own education sector plans. Particular attention is given to getting children into school through removing school fees, providing equipment, building new schools, as well as through paying teachers adequate salaries and providing professional development opportunities for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.0/4">Between 2000 and 2005 many countries abolished school fees, including Lesotho (2000), Cambodia (2001), Zambia (2002), Kenya (2003), Mozambique (2004), Vietnam (2004) and Burundi (2005). In Kenya, this led to an additional 1.2 million students entering the school system. In Burundi, almost 500,000 additional primary school pupils arrived to enrol on the first day of school, double the number anticipated. Removing school fees increases enrolment but also makes it necessary to plan for the surge in order to maintain adequate quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.967W.6/1">An exercise carried out last year, looking at the regulations in force as at May 2005, estimated that the administrative cost to businesses in phase I of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme was around &pound;175,000 for all 511 installations in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.6/2">For phase II, the total administrative cost (including Scotland and Northern Ireland) is estimated to be around &pound;125,000. This is lower than in phase I as all installations already have Greenhouse Gas (GHG) permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.6/3">Further estimates of the costs to the UK of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme are available in the Regulatory impact assessment's published by DEFRA. Copies of these are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.6/4">A tiered approach to subsistence charges and permit application fees has been adopted, where the charges reflect the scale of emissions from the installation. This is consistent with cost-reflectivity principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.6/5">Following lessons learnt from phase I of the scheme, the Government have introduced a de minimis threshold and revised the interpretation of the definition of a ceramics site. 10 per cent. of installations have been removed from phase II of the scheme covering less than 0.3 per cent. of scheme emissions. The revision of the ceramics' definition is expected to remove around 30 installations, representing 0.08 per cent. of total emissions within the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.6/6">The Environment Agency commissioned a study that looked at the cost of compliance in the EU ETS. It found that in the first year of the scheme the costs for smaller emitters (emitting less than 10KtCO2 a year) were between &pound;1.08 and &pound;2.77 per tonne of CO2.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.6/7">It is difficult to get an accurate picture of the actual cost of compliance as Government do not have access to the prices businesses pay for allowances. The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) for phase II of the scheme estimates that the cost of the scheme to the UK economy could be between &pound;80 million and &pound;640 million per year. This cost assumes a certain level of abatement will take place within the UK and also that the UK will purchase some allowances from the market.

	<p pid="a.968W.2/2">94 installations successfully applied to the 'de minimis' threshold and these will be excluded from Phase II. This has led to the removal of 10 per cent. of installations from the scheme, covering less than 0.3 per cent. of scheme emissions. Emissions at these installations are likely to be covered by the proposed Energy Performance Commitment or by Climate Change Agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.970W.0/1">No decision has yet been made on whether a one-off ivory sale should go ahead. The UK will only support this if all conditions previously agreed by the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2002 have been met. The UK is currently considering the evidence to decide whether those criteria have been met and will also look to be informed by the African Elephant Dialogue meeting that will take place between <phrase class="date" code="">30 May</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="">1 June</phrase>, immediately prior to the CITES Standing Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.0/2">Nevertheless, the UK continues to support the global ban on any general commercial trade in ivory, a ban which has been in place since 1989. If any one-off sale is agreed, we would not expect to agree any further sales or annual quotas until the effects of such an event have been assessed. However, the concept of a fixed period moratorium is not in keeping with the way that CITES operates, where decisions are taken on the best scientific and trade data available at any time.</p>

	<p pid="a.972W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.8/2">An exercise carried out last year, looking at the regulations in force as at May 2005, estimated that the administrative cost to businesses in Phase I of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme was around &pound;175,000 for all 511 installations in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.8/3">For Phase II, the total administrative cost (including Scotland and Northern Ireland) is estimated to be around &pound;125,000. This is lower than in Phase I as all installations already have Greenhouse Gas (GHG) permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.8/4">Further estimates of the costs to the UK of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme are available in the regulatory impact assessment's published by DEFRA. Copies of these are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.8/5">A tiered approach to subsistence charges and permit application fees has been adopted, where the charges reflect the scale of emissions from the installation. This is consistent with cost-reflectivity principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.8/6">Following lessons learnt from Phase I of the scheme, the Government have introduced a <i> de minim</i><i> i</i><i> s</i> threshold and revised the interpretation of the definition of a ceramics site. 10 per cent of installations have been removed from Phase II of the scheme covering less than 0.3 per cent. of scheme emissions. The revision of the ceramics' definition is expected to remove around 30 installations, representing 0.08 per cent. of total emissions within the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.8/7">The Environment Agency commissioned a study that looked at the cost of compliance in the EU ETS. It found that in the first year of the scheme the costs for smaller emitters (emitting less than 10KtCO2 a year) were between 1.08 and 2.77 per tonne of CO2.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.8/8">It is difficult to get an accurate picture of the actual cost of compliance as Government do not have access to the prices businesses pay for allowances. The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) for Phase II of the scheme estimates that the cost of the scheme to the UK economy could be between &pound;80 million and &pound;640 million per year. This cost assumes a certain level of abatement will take place within the UK and also that the UK will purchase some allowances from the market. The final cost will therefore depend on the market price of carbon.</p>

	<p pid="a.974W.2/2">I welcome the recent World Bank report, the preparation of which was financed by DFID, and I broadly agree with its conclusions. Free movement and access are essential for Palestinians to be able to trade goods and services. The UK has repeatedly called on both parties to implement their obligations as set out in the November 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access. We have also regularly raised concerns with the government of Israel concerning their policies in Jerusalem, which threaten to cut off east Jerusalem from the west bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.2/3">The best prospect for lasting improvements in movement and access is through the peace process. DFID's programme therefore aims to work with partners to help end the conflict and create a viable Palestinian state. As part of this, we help develop Palestinian institutions where possible, and support Palestinian negotiators to move towards and prepare for a negotiated just peace. The UK also funds work to generate media awareness of movement and access restrictions, and to petition the Israeli High Court of Justice on such issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.984W.2/1">In each of the 79 countries listed the UK currently has a resident accredited Defence Attach&eacute;/Adviser (DA). In smaller posts, a singleton DA will also act as the de facto Military Attach&eacute;/Adviser (MA), Naval Attach&eacute;/Adviser (NA) and Air Attach&eacute;/Adviser (AA) to look after single service issues in addition to wider defence matters. To spread the work load, busier posts may have one or more additional accredited attaches/advisers that are subordinate to the DA. To align with the focus of the specific defence relationship with the host country, these individuals are often styled in more than one way: either as single service attach&eacute;s/advisers in their own right, or in a combined roles (such as NA/AA or MA/NA); or simply as the Deputy or Assistant Defence Attach&eacute;s/Advisers (covering issues across all three services). Where single service attach&eacute;s are not specified the DA performs these roles where required. A number of other countries and overseas territories are covered on a non-resident basis. The current disposition of attach&eacute;s/advisers is described in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.988W.5/1">Our mental health services are configured to provide community-based mental health care in line with national best practice, providing assessment and treatment in line with the guidelines and standards set by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the national service frameworks. We do this primarily through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental health care. One of these centres is located at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/2">In-patient care, when necessary, is provided in psychiatric units belonging to the Priory Group, through a central contract with MOD. The Priory Group has arranged a subcontract with Affinity Healthcare at Middleton St. George Hospital, Darlington for patients in the North East.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/3">Any mobilised serviceman or women injured on operational deployment is entitled to, and will receive the same level of medical treatment and support, irrespective of whether they are members of the regular or reserve forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/4">Once demobilised, it is a long established tradition that reserve forces' medical welfare becomes the responsibility of their own local NHS primary care trust and the majority of veterans' physical and mental health needs are met by these provisions. However, the MOD recognises that it has an expertise to offer in certain specific circumstances, and in November 2006 launched the Reserves Mental Health Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/5">The RMHP is open to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> following an overseas operational deployment as a reservist, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health. Under the RMHP, we liaise with the individual's GP and offer a mental health assessment at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire. If diagnosed to have an operational-related mental health condition, we then offer out-patient treatment at one of the DCMHs (e.g. Catterick Garrison). If more acute cases present, the Defence Medical Services will assist in obtaining access to NHS in-patient treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.994W.6/1">There are 28.5 million electricity meters in Great Britain. The average life of an electricity meter is 20 years, and around 5 per cent. are changed each year. Electricity meters could not be replaced by any device that did not meet the legal requirement that, where electricity is used, it must be measured by an appropriate meter. The Government will set out their views on electricity and gas metering in the forthcoming Energy White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.995W.6/1">Responsibility for tackling fuel poverty in England is shared between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Department of Trade and Industry's main contribution to tackling fuel poverty is through ensuring a competitive energy market, which will bear down on the cost of energy to the benefit of all consumers but particularly those in fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/2">The Department of Trade and Industry itself has a number of specific policies to tackle the issue of fuel poverty. The Department's Design and Demonstration Unit has designed and delivered projects to provide gas connections to deprived communities, and it is now developing community projects utilising renewable technologies. Last winter work was taken forward with energy suppliers, Ofgem and other key players to mail out to 100,000 elderly households in receipt of pension credit offering a range of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/3">The Department has also liaised closely with energy suppliers on the creation of the Home Heat Helpline, which provides a central point of information about help available from energy suppliers and Government. It has also encouraged energy suppliers to introduce social tariffs, price freezes and other measures for fuel poor and low income customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/4">The forthcoming Energy White Paper will set out some of the steps that are needed to tackle fuel poverty across all its causes.</p>

	<p pid="a.997W.2/1">Worldwide it has been estimated that the market for nanotechnology alone could be worth &pound;1 trillion by 2013. The benefits to the UK economy from exploiting the opportunities this represents should not and are not being underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/2">To that end the DTI is spending &pound;90 million over six years (it was announced in 2003) on research and infrastructure that promotes the commercialisation of Micro and Nano-technologies (MNT), with a focus on collaborative research and technology transfer. Much of this is 'pump priming' funding and includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/3" class="indent">funding of &pound;40 million for applied research projects that are relevant to industry;</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/4" class="indent">funding of over &pound;50 million to establish and maintain for five years a network of 23 Nanotechnology Centres developing nanotechnology solutions for industry in the areas of nanometrology, nanomaterials, nanomedicine and nanofabrication;</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/5" class="indent">funding for the Nanotechnology Knowledge Transfer Network&mdash;this a vehicle for the community to develop its ideas and interactions and a communications route between that community and the Government; and</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/6" class="indent">support for the Nanotechnology Industry Association&mdash;an independent organisation that promotes the responsible use of nanotechnology and raises awareness of its many applications among key audiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/7">This funding has been spread across the UK, and the North East is the location of no fewer than four Nanotechnology Centres<sup>(1)</sup> and is well represented in the consortia undertaking the nanotechnology applied research projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/8">After the third MNT competition for the Applied Research Programme, in spring 2005, the Technology Strategy Board decided that future support for MNT would be integrated with other technology areas such as materials within the Technology Programme. It is through this mechanism that future funding for nanotechnology will funded; for example, the spring 2007 Technology Programme Competition has two priority areas which involve the application of nanotechnology:</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/9" class="indent">Smart, Bioactive and Nanostructures Materials for Health&mdash;&pound;7 million</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/10" class="indent">Plastic Electronics&mdash;&pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/11">The Technology Strategy Board will be responsible for the research agenda and expenditure on nanotechnology.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/12">The Research Councils are funding on-going fundamental research. For example, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) has spent over &pound;132 million since 2003 on nanotechnology, and is currently investing about &pound;40 million pa in research grants and supporting 40 new PhD studentships pa in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/13">Regionally, the North East England has a strong micro- and nanotechnology capability in the areas of bio-nano, materials and devices, as well as semi-conductor research and production and the integration of these technologies in areas such as sensors and photonics.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/14">ONE NorthEast, in collaboration with DTI, is making a major investment in MNT and the North East is home to the University Innovation Centre for Nanotechnology. This is a 'virtual' centre fronted by the five Regional Universities, with a public investment of &pound;7 million from DTI and One NorthEast, and leveraging an extra &pound;14 million. It facilitates knowledge transfer, the strengthening of capacity and capability, and open access to state of the art facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/15">North East England has two Centres of Excellence concerned with facilitating the application of nanotechnology, the Centre for Nano and Micro Photonics Systems (Cenamps) and the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI). Both have major initiatives concerned with nanotechnology, which include the Fuel Cell Application Facility, a major bio-nano and medicine programme and the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility (&pound;7 million). The Centres are funded and supported by ONE NorthEast, in partnership with Central Government, Universities and businesses. These initiatives span and bring together different disciplines, industries and sectors as befits the broad outlook of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is also becoming increasingly important to the region's process industries. In this sector, CPI provides industrial research and development expertise, for example, in advanced manufacturing and new product development in material properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/16">Additionally, these Centres of Excellence play a key strategic role in the economy of North East England, facilitating 'cultural' change within the Regional Universities, encouraging them to become more entrepreneurial, and strengthening and building on the Region's capabilities in emerging small scale technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/17">An example of a successful new nanotechnology enterprise is Durham Scientific Crystals (DSC). DSC is a spin out company from Durham University's Physics Department. The Company, formed in April 2003, is actively involved in developing proprietary semiconductor materials. In partnership with the University, it has worldwide exclusive rights to commercially exploit a patented technology. The research was supported by One NorthEast and the Research Councils prior to the spin out from the University, and Cenamps has supported DSC since formation. DSC has subsequently received &pound;1 million funding from US based venture capitalist Amphion Innovations, which will help take the business to its next stage of development.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/18" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup><sup>( )</sup>The four Nanotechnology Centres are Fluence in Redcar, National Particulates in Wilton, INEX in Newcastle, and Plastic Electronics Technology Centre (PeTEC) in Sedgefield. Furthermore, Fluence, INEX and PeTEC are all co-funded by ONE.</p>

	<p pid="a.1003W.11/1">Current planning guidance expects proposals to be evaluated on the likely impacts taking into account the characteristics of particular locations. The likely impact of noise from wind turbines on local residents and those working in the vicinity are always considered in relation to the existing background noise levels. Acceptable separation distances for a turbine located within an industrial area differing from one located in a rural area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.11/2">The topography of the location, wind speeds and presence of natural barriers will also influence the levels of audibility in relation to nearby dwellings. For this reason, we do not intend to introduce inflexible separation distances. We continue to support the approach set out in Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 22&mdash;Renewable Energy: that it is for local planning authorities to</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.11/3" class="indent">&quot;ensure that renewable energy developments have been located and designed in such a way to minimise increases in ambient noise levels&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.11/4">using the 1997 report by ETSU to assess and rate noise from wind energy developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.11/5">Overall, the minimum desirable distance between wind turbines and occupied buildings calculated on the basis of expected noise levels and visual impact will usually be greater than that necessary to meet safety requirements arising from structural failure. The Companion Guide to PPS22 states that fall over distance (i.e. the height of the turbine to the tip of the blade) plus 10 per cent. is often used as a safe separation distance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1012W.0/1">There are two suppliers of diamorphine to the United Kingdom market, Novartis and Wockhardt. Both are working to their full available capacity, but are currently unable to produce enough to meet historic demand, although that demand may have changed due to changes in prescribing practice. The supply position improved during 2006 and the trend is expected to be maintained during 2007. However the improvements vary by product strength, reflecting manufacturing capacity issues. Some strengths remain in relatively poor supply while the position for othersis satisfactory. We believe that through careful prescribing and use of available stocks, as advised in the guidance the Department issued to prescribers and healthcare professionals in December 2004, patient care is not being compromised.</p>

	<p pid="a.1014W.5/1">Following the Department's arm's length body (ALB) review, responsibility for managing the contracts the work of the three existing national confidential enquiries was transferred from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) with effect from April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/2">The costs of the three inquiries for the last four years are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/3" class="italic"> National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD)</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/4" class="indent">Annual contract value for 2007-08: &pound;840,769.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/5" class="indent">Annual budget was &pound;809,472 for the years 2006-07, 2005-06 and 2004-05</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/6" class="italic"> Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH)</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/7" class="indent">The contract is with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as CEMACH is not a separate legal body.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/8" class="indent">Annual contract value for 2007-08: &pound;1,384,915.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/9" class="indent">Annual budget has remained same over the years 2006-07, 2005-06 and 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/10" class="italic"> National Confidential Inquiry into Suicides and Homicides (NCISH)</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/11" class="indent">The National Confidential Inquiry into Suicides and Homicides is a national research project, established in April 1996, as part of the work of School of Medicine, Division of Psychiatry within the University of Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/12" class="indent">Annual contract value for 2007-08: &pound;868,791.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/13" class="indent">Annual budget was &pound;839,412 in the years 2006-07, 2005-06 and 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/14">The confidential inquiries are separate, independent bodies. The NPSA agrees the bulk of their funding and through quarterly meetings, monitors each of them in terms of their performance and compliance with the terms of the contract. The agency has no role in the day to day running of the confidential inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/15">The agency recently completed a review of the three confidential inquiries. The aim was to evaluate their impact on clinical practice, quality of care and patient safety. The findings for each are summarised as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/16" class="italic"> National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/17" class="indent">The review found that that the enquiry had a unique product history and had demonstrated significant achievements. The review panel felt that more focus should be given to assessing impact on clinical practice, where necessary in collaboration with other agencies and devolved Administrations. The review panel made a number of recommendations which are being considered by the enquiry and action is under way to address the review report's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/18" class="italic"> National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/19" class="indent">The review panel considered that NCISH provided value for money and was fulfilling its remit in terms of the provisionof high quality, internationally renowned research thus improving patient care by providing an evidence base for changes to policy and clinical practice. The inquiry is now in the process of evaluating the implementation of key service recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/20" class="indent">Recommendations have also been made to improve governance, influence on policy across all four countries of the United Kingdom and dissemination of output. Action is under way to address the review report' recommendations and an independent steering group has been set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/21" class="italic"> Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/22" class="indent">The review panel supported the work of CEMACH. The panel felt that the enquiry was adding value in terms of quality but without any cost-benefit analysis, were less able to assess its value in terms of cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/23" class="indent">A number of recommendations were made which included the need to review the functionality of the present organisational and committee structure. The enquiry is taking action to address the recommendations and an action plan is being actively developed.</p>

In view of the widespread concern over the shortlisting process we set up an independent review of the Modernising Medical Careers recruitment and selection process. This is being led by Professor Neil Douglas, vice-chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.

The Government continue to develop the vision and policies for an NHS that is fit for the challenges of a new century. In this context, an NHS constitution could provide a clear expression of what is unchanging about the values of the NHS. It would set down and protect the values of what is a precious and unique institution, at the same time as the NHS itself is reforming and improving. The Government are currently exploring the idea of a constitution for the NHS, on which it could then consult. If successful, this work and consultation could lead to the adoption of a new constitution for the NHS in 2008, its 60th anniversary year, setting out a direction for the next decade.</p>
