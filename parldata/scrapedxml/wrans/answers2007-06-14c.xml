	<p pid="c.1177W.8/1">The mandatory ceremonies will be directly funded from the London 2012 Organising Committee's budget for the 2012 games. It is confident that the mandatory ceremonies will be funded within its &pound;2 billion revenue budget. The bid projects and signature events and the UK-wide cultural festival will be delivered and funded in partnership with a range of public and private partners. For example, the &pound;40 million Legacy Trust will fund cultural and sporting activity in the run up to the 2012 games.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.8/2">The London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games will shortly set out more detail on the bid projects and the UK-wide Cultural Festival. The Cultural Olympiad is an opportunity for exciting proposals to be generated in the regions over the four-year period with funding being drawn in from a number of sources.</p>

	<p pid="c.1181W.0/1">DCMS provides funding of around &pound;50 million per annum to VisitBritain, which promotes Britain as a whole. The Department's funding agreement with VisitBritain includes a target that, of the additional expenditure by inbound visitors generated by VisitBritain, a specified percentage should be achieved outside London. For 2005-06, the target was 55 per cent. and VisitBritain exceeded this by achieving a regional spread of 61 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1181W.0/2">Campaigns run by VisitBritain and enjoyEngland highlight attractions across the country to both inbound and domestic visitors. They target, for example, the growing demand for city breaks and the lifestyle market (including the appeal of food, sport, culture and family friendly attractions).</p>
	<p pid="c.1181W.0/3">VisitBritain also co-funds (with Visit London) the Britain and London Visitor Centre. This acts as a gateway for visitors to learn about, and set out to explore, the rest of the country. VisitBritain's quality assessment schemes for accommodation and visitor attractions ensure uniform national standards for visitors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1181W.0/4">The Department, along with our partners, will shortly publish a strategy to ensure that the tourism sector makes the most of the opportunities provided by the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. One of the principles of this will be that the benefits of the games are felt as widely as possible throughout the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1184W.6/1">The core statutory guidance document 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' sets out the way in which the training and development of staff and volunteers should be undertaken to help them safeguard and promote the welfare of children effectively. The guidance states that it is the responsibility of employers to identify adequate resources and support for multi-agency training. It is the responsibility of the local authorities (LAs), with their partners in children's trusts, and in discussion with the Local Safeguarding Children's Board (LSCB) to decide, which bodies should commission or deliver the training. In some local areas it is the LSCB themselves who are commissioned to deliver the multi-agency training.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.6/2">The Department only has data on this final type of training&mdash;delivered by LSCBs themselves. LSCBs were invited to take part in a voluntary survey in December 2006. In those survey returns, planned expenditure on the delivery of training in 2006-07 across those LSCBs for which we have data&mdash;around two thirds of all LSCBs in England&mdash;totalled around &pound;2 million. If this is representative of all LSCBs then across the whole of England we could expect LSCBs to have spent around &pound;3 million on safeguarding training in 2006-07. However this LSCB expenditure will be only part of the overall expenditure on multi-agency safeguarding training.</p>

	<p pid="c.1185W.2/1">When the academy programme was launched in 2000, sponsors were required to provide 10 per cent. of the capital costs of a new building up to a maximum of &pound;2 million. We have since moved to an endowment model of sponsorship, and sponsors will, as the norm, establish an endowment fund worth &pound;2 million (or &pound;1.5 million for the fourth or subsequent academy for sponsors of multiple academies). The Department does not distinguish between sponsorship commitments made by private sector donors and those made by charitable organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.2/2">There are at present 47 open academies. Of these: two academy trusts had met their full sponsorship commitments before May 2006; one is a former city technology college which is not required to provide sponsorship in the form of a capital contribution; and one is providing sponsorship under the endowment model of sponsorship, leaving a total of 43 academies with commitments to provide a contribution to capital costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.2/3">Over the 12 months ending <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May 2007</phrase> sponsor contributions to capital costs amounted to &pound;13,202,000, an average of &pound;307,023 over the 43 open academies described above.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.2/4">Sponsors' donations contributing to capital costs are normally made over the lifetime of the building costs of the project, so in the majority of cases a number of payments towards capital costs remain to be made.</p>

Revenue support grant and other elements of formula grant (such as redistributed business rates and police grant) have also been excluded.</p>

However, it has been excluded from the above table as prior to 2006-07 this funding was part of RSG, and the question excludes the funding from RSG. The Department can confirm that &pound;86,014 of DSG was paid to Westminster in 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="c.1187W.2/81">There are a number of smaller grants included in an 'Other' category on the revenue returns submitted by local authorities. It is possible that there may be some DfES grants within this category, but it is not possible to identify these separately within the return.</p>

	<p pid="c.1189W.8/1">As the Secretary of State confirmed in his speech to the Association of Colleges annual conference in November 2006 we have, by 2006/7, reduced the funding gap between school sixth forms and FE colleges for comparable 16 to 18 provision by 5 per cent.. We committed in the FE White Paper to take further steps to narrow this funding gap by a further 3 per cent. by 2008 and beyond that to take steps to narrow the gap further as resources allow. For the longer term we plan to establish common funding arrangements for all 16 to 18 provision with comparable funding for comparable activity, irrespective of the type of institution providing the education and training. Our recent consultation on the creation of a demand led system included proposals for this common 16 to 18 funding approach. We are currently considering responses to the consultation and plan to implement changes in time for the 2008/09 academic year.</p>

There has been huge interest in the national singing campaign and Howard Goodall, the singing ambassador, has received hundreds of messages from schools, organisations and individuals asking how they can become involved or providing details of the work they already do. Plans are being made to allocate the funding to major national initiatives to achieve the widest possible impact. This will include the production of a major song resource to be made available to every school and every child and the training of vocal leaders for schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.1202W.0/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, compensation in England for bovine tuberculosis (TB) has been determined primarily using table values, which reflect the average sales price of bovine animals in 47 different categories. The categories are based on the animal's age, gender, type (dairy or beef) and status (that is, pedigree or non-pedigree).</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.0/3">The Government are obliged to pay compensation for cattle that are culled as a result of TB. However, we believe that table valuations provide a fairer balance between the costs that are expected to be carried by the taxpayer and those that are expected to be carried by the farmer than was provided by the previous system of individual valuation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1205W.6/1">My Department does not provide any additional funding to local authorities to implement the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 (CNEA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.6/2">A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) published in July 2004 concluded that, taken as a whole, the measures introduced in the CNEA do not involve significant additional costs for local authorities. Indeed, the RIA concluded they could well lead to overall savings in local authority costs through increased efficiency and effective, well publicised enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.6/3">Local authorities themselves asked for these new powers to combat the minority who continue to fly-tip, drop litter and behave in an antisocial manner and the Government have now provided them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.6/4">In most cases, local authorities also have the flexibility to set their own fixed penalty rates for offences under the Act and, since November 2003, have been able to retain receipts from fixed penalties issued for local environmental crimes. Poor performing local authorities must re-direct this money into their street cleansing service, although those awarded an 'excellent' or 'good' rating are free to use the penalty receipts as they wish.</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.6/5">Comprehensive guidance has been issued to all local authorities to help them implement the CNEA. This includes specific guidance on developing an enforcement strategy and making the most effective use of available enforcement tools. DEFRA has also produced guidance on how local authorities can make efficiency savings in street cleansing and related services. Copies of all guidance can be downloaded from DEFRA's website.</p>

	<p pid="c.1212W.5/1">Food-related packaging makes up an estimated 18-20 per cent. of household waste and around 3.3 per cent. of the controlled waste which is sent to landfill<sup>(1)</sup>. No estimate is currently available of the proportion of food packaging waste landfilled or recycled specifically relating to sales of fresh produce.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.5/2">However, the Packaging Regulations, which place requirements on obligated businesses to recover and recycle a certain amount of the packaging waste they handle, have so far helped to raise the UK packaging recycling rate from around 27 per cent. in 1997 to around 56 per cent. in 2006. In real terms, the total amount of packaging waste recovered or recycled has increased from 3.3 million tonnes in 1998 to around 6.3 million tonnes in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.5/3">The Waste and Resources Action Programme is currently working with all leading supermarkets through the Courtauld Commitment to achieve a standstill, and then a reduction, in the amount of packaging waste. A number of retailers are considering the role that the selling of loose fruit and vegetables could make to those objectives, without increasing the amount of damaged produce which is then discarded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.5/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Figures are based on estimates of waste composition contained in the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit 2002 report, &quot;Waste Not Want Not&quot;, and information from WasteDataFlow for 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="c.1214W.5/1">Smoking-related litter is one of the most prevalent types of litter. Each of the last three local environmental quality surveys of England showed that smokers' materials were present on 79 per cent. of survey sites. Without action, the introduction of smoke free legislation in July this year is likely to increase this problem. However, the Government are taking steps to tackle this form of littering through a combination of regulatory options, partnership work, guidance and awareness-raising.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.5/2">Smoking-related materials were clarified as litter in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, in order to encourage greater enforcement against this offence. Street litter control notices may also be issued by local authorities where there is a significant problem with litter on the street. Notices can be used to place requirements on the occupiers (or owners) of premises to take steps to reduce litter outside their premises, such as the installation of litter bins.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.5/3">Following a consultation that closed on <phrase class="date" code="">8 May</phrase>, DEFRA is also extending these provisions to allow notices to be issued for eating and drinking establishments where food is consumed on the premises. A legislative opportunity will be sought to extend the list of premises further to include office buildings, aimed particularly at helping to deal with smoking litter dropped by customers and employees. This forms part of a package of tools already available to local authorities for tackling litter problems, including the use of on-the-spot fixed penalty notices for individuals caught dropping litter.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.5/4">In order to raise public awareness, the Keep Britain Tidy Campaign, run by Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS), launched a poster campaign earlier this month to encourage all smokers and businesses to take responsibility for cigarette ends, with posters appearing on bus stops, billboards and telephone boxes across England. A number of councils across the country are supporting the campaign.</p>

	<p pid="c.1218W.5/1">The Palestinian Authority is facing a severe fiscal crisis in 2006-07, mainly caused by a collapse in revenues. This fall has largely occurred as Israel has withheld the revenues, such as VAT receipts and customs payments, that it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. These resources typically made up around a third of the Palestinian Authorities domestic revenues and have been withheld since March 2006. Precise figures for the amounts are not available but the International Monetary Fund recently estimated they may be in the order of US$750 million. Other sources of tax finance have also fallen as a consequence of the broader collapse in economic activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. External funding from donors (including to the Palestinian Authority and the Office of the President) has risen since 2005 but this has been insufficient to offset the reductions elsewhere. Overall revenues for 2006 are estimated at US$1.4 billion, down from almost US$2.2 billion in the previous year. The EU has provided more financial assistance (over &euro;680 million) to the Palestinian people in 2006 than it did in previous years. During financial year 2006-07 the UK gave over &pound;70 million to the Palestinian people, &pound;30 million bilaterally and an additional &pound;40 million through our EU contributions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1219W.9/1">We believe sanctions have contributed towards containing the crisis in Darfur, for example in the Government of Sudan's acceptance of the UN's Heavy Support Package to the African Union peacekeeping force in Sudan. However, we want a solution to the crisis which may require further sanctions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1219W.9/2">We are concerned that sanctions should not impact on those in Sudan who have no responsibility for violence in Darfur, or on the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, thus damaging the south. We are therefore pressing for further targeted sanctions on individuals and an extension of the UN arms embargo from Darfur to all of Sudan, in line with the EU embargo, if the Government of Sudan and the rebel movements fail to honour their commitments.</p>

We have also deployed a military officer to Sudan to assist with the transition from the AU Mission in Sudan to the hybrid force. We will consider requests for troop contributions as and when we receive them from DPKO. The details of the force have now been agreed between the AU and UN and we are pressing the Sudanese Government to accept them and facilitate its deployment. A significant part of that agreement is that troops should be to the greatest possible extent contributed by African states.</p>

	<p pid="c.1220W.8/1">The Government's concern relating to human rights abuses, governance and democracy in Zimbabwe were most recently raised this week at the fifth session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. The EU and UK asked a number of questions of the UN special rapporteurs on the rights to food and housing concerning the impact of the denial of both for the human and political rights of ordinary Zimbabweans. In March, 50 UN member states supported a statement at the Human Rights Council by the EU presidency, on behalf of all EU member states, expressing concern at the situation in Zimbabwe. The UK also continues to raise these concerns in dialogue with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, and to press for her and other UN rapporteurs to have access to Zimbabwe. Other recent discussions with the UN have taken place with senior officials in the Department for Humanitarian Affairs, following on from the briefing in March to the UN Security Council on the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe which was given by the Office of the Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs at the UK's request. Our embassy in Harare is in regular discussion with the UN Development Programme Office regarding human rights, democracy and good governance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1236W.2/1">The House of Lords ruling related specifically to the considerations given by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT). This advised that, when assessing proportionality, the AIT was required to weigh up all relevant competing considerations and was not required to establish that the circumstances of a case were truly exceptional in order to find that removal would give rise to an unlawful interference with article 8 rights. As no specific findings were made to considerations given by immigration officers, no general guidance has been issued. Where article 8 claims are made the Border and Immigration Agency do consider all factors raised.</p>

	<p pid="c.1241W.2/1">Section 41D of the Road Traffic Act 1988 was inserted by the Road Safety Act 2006 and came into effect in February 2007. I have received no specific representations on this provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1241W.2/2">Section 41D provides for the punishment of offences relating to construction and use requirements in respect of having proper control of a vehicle and a full view of the road ahead or to use of a hand-held mobile phone or similar device while driving. Breach of any construction and use requirement was already an offence. This section makes specific provision for breach of these particular requirements by introducing a heavier penalty of obligatory endorsement, with disqualification at the court's discretion if the matter goes to court, or a fixed penalty of &pound;60.</p>
	<p pid="c.1241W.2/3">Enforcement of the provision is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police. The likelihood of detection has been increased by the increasing numbers of police, including the deployment on roads of teams involved in the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition equipment (ANPR). They can stop vehicles to deal with offences as the result of direct observation as well as an ANPR hit. The dangers of mobile phone use and the penalties associated with the offence are the subject of a publicity campaign by the Department for Transport.</p>

An improved investment climate will stimulate increased private sector investment and higher rates of sustainable growth, enhancing job creation and enabling Africa to lift itself out of poverty. This is why DFID, along with several other donors and companies with a long-term interest in Africa, supports the Investment Climate Facility for Africa (ICF). The G8 recently reaffirmed their continuing support for the ICF at their Summit meeting in Heiligendamm.</p>
	<p pid="c.1245W.13/2">The ICF is an independent pan-African trust that brings together African governments and institutions, the private sector and donor agencies to work collectively to improve the investment climate in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.1245W.13/3">The ICF's first major project, the Rwanda Investment Climate Project, was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-28">28 May 2007</phrase>, encompassing commercial dispute resolution and business and land registration. It is a three-year project in partnership with the Rwanda Government. The ICF is contributing about $9 million to the project.</p>
	<p pid="c.1245W.13/4">The ICF is also financing work on customs reform in East Africa in partnership with Business Action for Improved Customs Administration in Africa, as well as a project to speed up the payment of VAT refunds in Southern Africa. ICF expects to announce the approval of other projects under development in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1247W.5/1">The UK is trying to limit the negative effects of climate change on low income countries by leading the call internationally for a global framework with ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The UK is leading by example in this, with a commitment to reduce emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="c.1247W.5/2">The UK is also at the forefront of supporting poor countries adapt. DFID's rapidly rising aid budget means we can spend more money than ever to lift people out of poverty which makes them less vulnerable to climate change. But there is still much more that needs to be done. The UK has pledged at least &pound;75 million to support adaptation directly. For example, at the grass roots level we are investing in schemes such as safer flood resistant housing for thousands of people in Bangladesh. We are also contributing &pound;5 million over five years to improving Africa's ability to get and use information on what future climate trends will be, so that countries can plan better for this. In the last budget the Chancellor announced a new &pound;800 million Environmental Transformation Fund, which will include support for adaptation in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.1249W.5/1">The 2006 Department for International Development (DFID) White Paper commits the UK to &quot;help partner Governments abolish user fees for basic health services&quot;. DFID is fully committed to supporting the Government of Sierra Leone to ensure that this is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.5/2">DFID's position is shared by our partner agencies working in Sierra Leone, including WHO, European Commission, World Bank, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Children's Fund, World Food Programme and International NGOs. Recent Health Development Partners meetings in country have established a common position: we would like to see user fees abolished and want to help the government to reach that position for themselves, including helping them to understand how to fund the cost of health services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.5/3">The first step towards abolishing user fees is to establish the cost of providing basic health services and how to make this cost sustainable when user fees are removed. Currently fees collected by the government go towards funding the provision of services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.5/4">DFID is therefore funding preparation of National Health Accounts through World Health Organisation (WHO) to help establish how much money is currently being spent on health services in Sierra Leone from all sources (donor, International non-government organisations, private sector etc.). In addition DFID, along with other Health Development Partners, is planning to finance a study on options for pro-poor health financing. Once DFID has this Options paper it will be able to discuss with government the best way forward.</p>

	<p pid="c.1250W.2/1">In Somalia, DFID uses three principal mechanisms to ensure that humanitarian relief is reaching those who need it most. DFID is</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/2" class="indent">only funding the most experienced international relief agencies;</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/3" class="indent">obtaining regular and detailed reporting from the relief agencies, working with other donors where possible, backed up with visits in the field by DFID experts, where security permits;</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/4" class="indent">supporting objectively targeted assistance, where possible, such as: emergency medical relief&mdash;people are assisted if they are seriously ill&mdash;or emergency nutritional support&mdash;where entry onto a feeding programme is decided on the basis of the weight and height of the child. There is less likelihood of abuse when entitlement is established in this way.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/5">DFID provides a major proportion of our humanitarian funds to the International Committee of the Red Cross in southern Somalia, as they are experts at assisting victims of conflict and have good on-the-ground access.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/6">During the drought in Somalia last year, DFID's humanitarian adviser for east and central Africa visited south central Somalia in April. Following this assessment, DFID was able to provide further targeted assistance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.2/7">As part of our ongoing humanitarian programme, DFID has committed &pound;900,000 to International Medical Corps (IMC). Part of this support provides targeted assistance to malnourished children in the Bakool and Hiran regions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1250W.5/1">DFID provides financial support to the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) through a strategic partnership with the United Nations Development programme (UNDP) and a separate UNDP Somali Institutional Support project. Between July 2006 and December 2007, DFID has committed &pound;5 million to the UNDP partnership to support the achievement of reconciliation, stability and improved governance, rule of law and assisting Somali Diaspora to return and use their skills in public service delivery. Activities are being carried out with the TFG and with the regional administrations in Somaliland and Puntland. DFID has also committed &pound;2.5 million to the Somali Institutional Support Project (SISP) which focuses on supporting the key functions and actions to be performed by the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs).</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.5/2">Both the UNDP partnership and the SISP have provided technical and financial assistance to the Offices of the President, the Prime Minister, the Speaker, Supreme Court and other institutions. In the absence of a fully trained civil service, this assistance is enabling the Transitional Federal Institutions to have some technical capacity to function and interact with key stakeholders including the Somali people. Achievements include helping re-establish the National Civil Service Commission and providing management and financial training to civil servants. The UNDP partnership agreement has also been effective in helping the re-establishment of the Somali police force in South Central Somalia, through the training of 1000 cadets and the construction of Armo Police Training Academy and Hargeisa Central prison.</p>

	<p pid="c.1252W.3/1">In April 2006, health user fees were removed in all Zambian government-funded health institutions in rural areas. This has made health care free at the point of access in 54 of Zambia's 72 districts. Overall, it is estimated that a third more people are being seen in health facilities. However, there has been concern about the quality of services. In many clinics, drugs ran out, and health workers become even more overworked than before. There is a plan to expand free care to peri-urban areas later in 2007. Expansion to urban areas is expected to follow in time; however this needs to be undertaken with care because of the limited capacity of current facilities such as numbers of clinics, health workers and drug supply systems to cope with additional use.</p>
	<p pid="c.1252W.3/2">The Government of Zambia, together with DFID, has therefore prioritised improvements to drug procurement and supply chain systems, and the development of plans to address the human resource crisis. To assist, DFID plans to provide an additional &pound;2.9 million per year for five years in general budget support, which will be used to increase the grants to districts, procure drugs, and recruit and retain more health workers.</p>

This estimate was based on the number of cases in which the Secretary of State had approved eligibility for compensation and in which the assessor was to make his final assessments. The performance of the independent assessor is monitored by the miscarriages of justice team in the Better Trials Unit of the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. A monthly audit of cases is carried out and regular meetings are held with the assessor. It is also open to any applicant who is dissatisfied with the assessor's handling of their case to seek a judicial review.</p>

It is the responsibility of applicants to make written submissions to the independent assessor regarding the quantum of their claims, and he cannot make a final assessment until such time as those submissions have been made and agreed. Of the 38 cases in which a final assessment was made in 2006-07, 28 (76 per cent.) took more than two years from eligibility for compensation being approved to the final assessment. Over the five years from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, the average length of the independent assessment process, that is from eligibility being confirmed to final assessment, was three years. As at <phrase class="date" code="">7 June</phrase> there were 116 cases in which eligibility for compensation has been approved but a final assessment not yet been made. In 79 of those cases (68 per cent.) one or more interim payments have been made, on application by the applicants. There were 16 cases with the independent assessor for final assessment and three cases in which applications for an interim payment have been made.

It was found that, as well as the cost of testing a finished product adding up to &pound;3 per garment, making it from chemically flame retardant cotton would add another &pound;3-&pound;4 per garment. The research did not assess affordability but any such assessment must also take into account that flame retardant chemicals can affect the feel and comfortability of cotton fabric, and could pose problems for allergy sufferers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1269W.3/1">The Department has regular discussions with colleagues in Communities and Local Government (CLG) on many issues including on the important role which local authorities play in acting as an essential conduit for Central Government funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1269W.3/2">The Government are committed to an accessible transport system in which disabled and older people have the same opportunities to travel as other members of society. Its overall transport strategy, as set out in the Transport White Paper &quot;The Future of Transport&quot;, recognised the vital role that extending mobility plays in meeting the wider objectives for the economy and an inclusive society.</p>
	<p pid="c.1269W.3/3">Transport provision is largely funded via local authorities who are best placed to deliver the solutions that best meet the needs of local people. For example, to assist these aims the West Midlands region were provided with over &pound;155 million capital funding for both integrated transport and maintenance for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1269W.3/4">We have ensured, through the introduction of &quot;accessibility planning&quot; into the most recent round of local transport plans, that the needs of socially excluded groups are prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="c.1269W.3/5">We have already achieved a great deal to make mainstream public transport more accessible (for example, all new trains, buses and coaches must be accessible to disabled people, including wheelchair users) but the Government's wider strategy is to devolve decision making responsibility about local service provision closer to where services are delivered, and to encourage the removal of ring fenced funding so that local decisions can increasingly be informed by local context, priorities and need.</p>

	<p pid="c.1270W.6/1">There is a wide range of parking controls that a local authority can provide near schools. The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) 2002 gives local authorities powers to implement yellow zig-zag and keep clear road markings. These markings indicate where vehicles should not stop outside a school entrance. The local authority can determine whether the markings are advisory or made mandatory with an appropriate traffic regulation order. There are no plans to change these controls.</p>

It is for the South East region to decide whether it still wishes to prioritise funding for this scheme at its higher cost within its regional funding allocation for major transport schemes. Should the region formally advise that it continues to be a funding priority, the scheme will then be subject to a re-appraisal and value for money assessment in accordance with the Department's guidance before a final decision on whether to provide additional funding to the scheme is taken. The environmental impact of the Link Road was assessed in accordance with our appraisal methodology, when the scheme was originally approved in December 2004.</p>

The EC, World Bank, France, US, and Australia have all joined the international effort by committing new funds to education and private sector companies are working with African countries to support their efforts.

This cannot be assumed in deaths at ages under 15 and therefore deaths from injury/poisoning of undetermined intent are not included when examining suicide (intentional self-harm) in children. As there were no deaths in children aged under 13 with a suicide verdict for the period requested, the table shows the number of suicides in children aged 13 to 14, and the number of suicide or injury/poisoning of undetermined intent deaths in those aged 15 to 17.</p>

The proceeds were released to HM Treasury in April 1998 (for the original DSS estate) and further in December 2003 when PRIME was expanded to include the former Employment Service (ES) estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.2/2">In 2003, the Department and LST agreed a vacant possession value of &pound;140 million for the freehold and valuable leaseholds covered within the expanded PRIME Contract. The Department decided to receive this amount split into an up-front payment of &pound;100 million after seeking variant bids and a reduction in the annual Unitary Charge over the life of the contract, equivalent in present value terms to the &pound;40 million balance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.2/3">Following the expansion of the PRIME Contract, DWP retained two properties which for commercial reasons could not be transferred within the expansion. These two properties were subsequently sold in 2005-06 for &pound;5.075 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.2/4">Despite having already sold its property assets, DWP retains some 'claw back' rights in the form of what is called 'development gain'. Under this mechanism, if LST sells a property vacated after April 1998 for more than the price it paid at the start of the contract, then after the sale costs are deducted, DWP receives 50 per cent. of the uplift in value with LST. This applies to market driven value increase as well as LST's activities to enhance value such as obtaining change of planning use. For 2006-07, DWP will receive &pound;2.8 million.</p>

One objective for this review of scheme assets is to determine whether there are other pension schemes (in addition to those with compromise agreements) where although the sponsoring employer did not undergo an insolvency event, it would not be reasonable to expect the employer to have a continuing responsibility for supporting an under funded scheme. The review will provide an initial view in the summer, consult formally in the autumn and then report by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1293W.5/1">We have not worked out the exact cost of implementing the amendments as they are somewhat contradictory in effect and may be technically deficient. The intended effect would appear to be payment of PPF levels of benefit to those qualifying for FAS schemes (costs below). The amendments would also extend the level of benefits to an unspecified number of pension schemes in wind up with a solvent employer, costings for which will not be available until after the report of the review of FAS scheme assets. There would be very significant implementation costs in setting up and running the institutions proposed but these have not been costed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/2">Paying PPF level benefits to the current set of qualifying FAS schemes would cost around &pound;2.5 billion in NPV terms (&pound;640 million in addition to the budget extension) and &pound;10.6 billion in cash terms (an additional &pound;2.7 billion on the Budget extension).</p>

Currently, NHSBT is investigating vCJD screening, new filters to remove infectious prions, bacterial screening of platelets and pathogen inactivation of platelets. Such assessments consist of review of manufacturers' data on efficacy and quality of the product, laboratory studies and clinical trials as appropriate.

	<p pid="c.1300W.8/16">In addition, the majority of approved documents/communications are not directly issued to the NHS/social care as individual communications.

In some instances, documents may be approved simply for publication on the Department website only.</p>
	<p pid="c.1300W.8/17">No one in the NHS will receive all of these documents/communications. The vast majority are targeted to specific organisations. For example, some will go to ambulance trusts, some to primary care trusts, some to strategic health authorities and so on. The communications are then further targeted so that only the appropriate audience within those organisations receive the documents, for example, cancer leads, public health leads, mental health leads, chief executives, finance directors etc.</p>

These systems allow more efficient collection of reports and enable trusts to enter data at any time and view their own data. They provide trusts with a more accurate picture and contribute to building a better evidence base regarding risk factors for infection as trusts can see the data to assess the effectiveness of the interventions to reduce infections.</p>

This should be seen in the context of there being almost 250,000 FTE (280,000 headcount) more staff working in the NHS in England than in 1997 as there are now over 34,000 FTE (35,000 HC) doctors and over 65,000 FTE (79,000 HC) more nurses in the NHS than in 1997.</p>

	<p pid="c.1327W.2/1">There is currently no validated diagnostic test that would allow blood donors to be assessed as asymptomatic carriers of variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Therefore, together with the National Blood Service, the Department has introduced a range of measures to minimise the possible risk of secondary vCJD infection through the blood supply. In July 1998 the Department announced that plasma for the manufacture of blood products, such as clotting factors, would be obtained from non-United Kingdom sources. Since October 1999, white blood cells (which may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vCJD) have been removed from all blood used in transfusion. In August 2002 the Department announced that fresh frozen plasma for treating babies and young children born after <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase> would be obtained from the United States of America, and from summer 2005 this was extended to all children under 16 years of age. In December 2002, the Department completed its purchase of the largest remaining independent USA plasma collector, Life Resources Incorporated to secure long-term supplies of non-UK blood plasma for the benefit of national health service patients. Since April 2004, blood donations have not been accepted from people who have themselves received a blood transfusion in the UK since 1980. This was extended in August 2004 to include apheresis donors and donors who are unsure if they had previously had a blood transfusion. Since late 2005, blood donations have not been accepted from donors whose blood was transfused to patients who later developed vCJD.</p>
	<p pid="c.1327W.2/2">The Department will continue to consider further steps to ensure the safety of the blood supply as new evidence or suitable technologies become available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1328W.2/1">A cost/benefit analysis of introducing prion removal blood filters can only be completed once the Department has received both results of clinical safety trials and the independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the filters in reducing infectivity requested by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood and Tissues and Organs. The analysis will also need to be informed by the outcome of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease prevalence studies currently under way.</p>
