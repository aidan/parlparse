	<p pid="a.207W.3/1">The UK Government's vision for the marine environment is for clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas. To this end, the Government have taken steps within the past 12 months to protect sea life through a diverse range of initiatives and policies, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/2" class="italic"> Developing the Marine and Coastal Access Bill</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/3">The Marine and Coastal Access Bill is currently progressing through the parliamentary process; it had its Second Reading in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-15">15 December 2008</phrase> and started its House of Lords Committee stage on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January</phrase>. It is expected to gain Royal Assent in the summer or autumn of 2009. The Bill will bring significant changes to the way the marine area is managed and protected, and will help us towards our vision for the marine environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/4" class="italic"> Assessing the state of UK Seas</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/5">The Government make regular assessments of the state of the UK seas to evaluate the extent to which they are clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse. The first report, Charting Progress, was published in 2005 and is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/7">The second report is currently being prepared and is expected to be published in 2010. The monitoring and assessment work and evidence collection is co-ordinated across the UK through the UK Marine Monitoring and Assessment Strategy (UKMMAS).</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/8" class="italic"> Designating further Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/9">In the last 12 months, DEFRA has designated five additional marine candidate special areas of conservation (SACs) in UK offshore waters, which takes the total number of MPAs in UK waters to 156. These new sites have also been added to the OSPAR (Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic) list of MPAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/10">Furthermore, Natural England (NE) is currently carrying out pre-consultation discussions with stakeholders regarding a further eight marine sites in English waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/11" class="italic"> Closing valuable areas to the most damaging activities</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June 2008</phrase>, my predecessor, Jonathan Shaw, made the decision to close an area 60 square nautical miles in Lyme Bay to the most damaging fishing practices. A statutory instrument was signed off by the Minister and laid in Parliament, and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-11">11 July 2008</phrase>. Lyme Bay is one of the most important areas for marine life in England, and the decision to close 60 square nautical miles to the most damaging fishing methods demonstrated the Government's commitment to protecting the richness of our marine heritage as part of our goal of living within our environmental means.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-06">6 March 2008</phrase>, Jonathan Shaw announced his decision to ban scallop dredging and other towed bottom gear from the outer part of the Fal and Helford special area of conservation (SAC). The ban was implemented through a statutory instrument which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>. Following DEFRA's decision to ban scallop dredging, Cornwall Sea Fisheries Committee, with support from DEFRA, is considering introducing a byelaw in order to establish an experimental MPA in the outer SAC area for the purposes of assessing and managing the scallop stocks within it. The byelaw would prohibit all forms of scallop harvesting, including through diving. The public consultation on the draft byelaw was concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-15">15 February 2009</phrase>. Cornwall Sea Fisheries Committee is currently assessing the results of the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/14" class="italic"> Working with Europe to protect species and habitats</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/15">At the 60<sup>(th)</sup> annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) which took place in June 2008, the UK played an important role in the conservation and protection of cetaceans worldwide. We were able to defeat a Danish proposal for an annual take of 10 humpback whales in their Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling (ASW) hunt, thereby saving the needless slaughter of 50 humpbacks in the period 2008-12. We also made telling interventions on whale welfare; scientific whaling; the plight of the Western Pacific Gray Whale population; recent trade in whale meat from Iceland and Norway to Japan; and the Japanese Dall's porpoise hunt. The UK will continue to strongly support the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling and oppose all forms of whaling, other than limited whaling operations by indigenous people for subsistence purposes to meet a defined and substantiated need.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/16" class="italic"> Marine Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPS)</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/17">DEFRA has established a stakeholder group to drive forward the delivery of marine biodiversity. This group is chaired by NE and reports to the England Biodiversity Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/18">Through the Countdown 2010 grant programme, NE specifically called for projects to help the delivery marine biodiversity targets. Three large projects were awarded funds totalling &pound;286,000. These were:</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/19" class="indent">The Isles of Scilly Marine Biodiversity Project;</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/20" class="indent">British Elasmobranchs: building and applying knowledge for a sustainable future. This project aims to arrest, and where possible reverse, the decline in elasmobranch (shark, skate and ray) populations; and</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/21" class="indent">Solent Seal Tagging Project.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/22">NE also supported the Marine Conservation Society to produce the Marine Local Biodiversity Action Plan Guidance Manual for England published in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/23">In addition, NE published a report, State of the Natural Environment, in 2008, a copy of which is available on their website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/24" class="indent"><a href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk">www.naturalengland.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.207W.3/25">This included a chapter on the marine environment and its biodiversity. Further progress on the delivery of marine BAP targets is being captured through the 2008 Biodiversity Action Plan reporting process. This information is still being collated and will be available shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.210W.6/1">The Government have generally welcomed the European Commission's thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides. However, throughout the negotiation process, the UK consistently argued that the proposals should be based on sound evidence and supported by an impact assessment. In particular, we remain opposed to the use of hazard cut off criteria which will have a detrimental agronomic impact, but have not been demonstrated to deliver a positive benefit for human health. In the absence of an impact assessment, it is impossible to judge whether there will be any positive benefit accruing from this element of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.210W.6/2">Nevertheless, the regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and the framework Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides are expected to be approved by the Council in the near future.

The line of the route and spreading room is not fixed permanently and the Bill enables Natural England to review these and propose changes to the Secretary of State (subject to the same system of consultation and representations as the original proposals) at a later date. Certain types of land are excepted from the right of access. The categories of excepted land are set out in Schedule 1 to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and they include buildings and their curtilage and land used for the purposes of a statutory undertaking. Land can become excepted from the right of access at any time if some change or development occurs so that it falls into one of the excepted land categories in Schedule 1. Where development is carried out under the General (Permitted Development) Order 1995, the land will be excepted if it falls into an excepted land category. Public rights of way are governed by a separate and different legal framework.</p>

Additionally, it is currently assisting the Ministry of Defence in reviewing the optimum life of the existing warhead stockpile and analysing the range of replacement options that might be available. This work, some of which is being undertaken with the United States under the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement, will inform decisions likely to be necessary in the next Parliament on the need to refurbish or replace the current warhead.

	<p pid="a.240W.5/1">Information is a key asset to Government and its correct handling is vital to the delivery of public services and to the integrity of HMG. The Security Policy Framework, the Data Handling Report and the National Information Assurance Strategy produced by the Cabinet Office provide a strategic framework for protecting information that Government handle and put in place a set of mandatory measures which Departments must adhere to.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.5/2">Because of the potential security threat, it would not be appropriate to comment on the specific technical measures deployed to protect the Departments IT networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.5/3">Compliance arrangements comprise a system of self assessment, accreditation, assurance reporting, audit and review.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.5/4">There have been no reported breaches of the Department's IT systems in the last 12 months. Central records show that, for this period, 41 staff have been subject to disciplinary action for breaches of IT security policy. The types of incidents involved would have included, but not exclusively, mis-use of email, internet browsing, incorrect use of passwords and login details. None of the incidents compromised the integrity of the Department's systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.5/5">The Department's security governance arrangements are consistent with the mandatory requirements set out in the HM Government Security Policy Framework (SPF). The Permanent Secretary, as Accounting Officer has overall responsibility for all aspects of security. The Departmental Security Officer (DSO) supports the Permanent Secretary by providing advice on policy and procedure. The IT Security Officer (ITSO) supports the DSO by developing, implementing, reviewing and advising upon IT security policy. There are currently separate ITSOs working in the major business units brought together as the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.5/6">It is not in the interest of the security of the Department, or that of the public, to disclose detailed information pertaining to electronic breaches of security of Department's IT systems. Disclosing such information would enable criminals and those who would attempt to cause disruptive threats to the Department to deduce how to conduct attacks and therefore potentially enhance their capability to carry out such attacks.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.5/7">Depending upon the circumstances, a range of sanctions are available for failure to comply with the policies, including disciplinary or administrative action, and in extreme or persistent cases, termination of employment/services and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings.</p>

Regulations currently preclude the use of fixed penalties for these offences inside the Royal Parks.</p>

	<p pid="a.242W.5/1">The following table provides a breakdown of the actual expenditure for the National Offender Management Service Headquarters (NOMS HQ) for 2007-08, which is more up to date than the planning figure shown in the NOMS Strategic and Business Plan. Many of the functions delivered by NOMS during 2007-08 transferred to the new NOMS Agency as part of a restructured Ministry of Justice on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.5/2">Although the item in the plan is described as NOMS HQ it is not simply the headquarters function. The following table shows that the majority of the expenditure was related to centrally managed front line services, including electronic monitoring, prisoner escort services and prison and probation property. Other services at the centre of NOMS such as the Prison and Probation Ombudsman, HM Inspector of Prisons and Public Protection are directly related to front line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.5/3">NOMS HQ administration costs (as used in the Supply Estimates and MoJ Resource Accounts), in 2007-08 were &pound;76 million; or &pound;151 million if HM Prison Service's administration costs are included. This is 1.6 per cent. or 3.2 per cent. respectively of the total NOMS resource expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.5/4">NOMS HQ expenditure for 2007-08 can be analysed as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.244W.0/1">Once it has been decided that the role of a prison should be changed to include the holding of young offenders, a revised designation is prepared and signed by the Director-General of the National Offender Management Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.244W.0/2">It would be difficult and could be attempted only at disproportionate cost to identify which prisons have extended their designation, as many designation certificates may have changed a number of times over the past 10 years. As set out in the Ministry of Justice, NOMS Agency (HM Prison Service) annual report and accounts 2007-08, there are 14 closed male young offender institutions (YOIs) and one open YOI.</p>

	<p pid="a.244W.3/1">The national offender management service holds information on the number of offenders charged with serious further (violent) offences whilst under probation supervision for the years 2006-07, 2007-08 and for the first six months of 2008-09. However, this does not include all types of violent offence and it is not broken down by town or city.

	<p pid="a.244W.3/3">The offender management caseload statistics, which are published annually, include data on the number of offenders under probation supervision who are charged with serious further offences and whose cases proceed to review, as defined by the relevant probation circulars. Those data are updated to show outcomes, that is, convictions, acquittals, convictions for lesser offences and charges dropped.</p>
	<p pid="a.244W.3/4">The number of offenders convicted of a serious further offence is around 0.35 per cent. of the caseload of the probation service nationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.248W.9/1">In the criminal courts statements from disabled adults who use non-formal methods of communication are treated in the same way as statements from a witness whose first language is not English.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.9/2">When taking a statement from a witness who requires assistance with communication, the police interview is conducted with necessary assistance, such as an accredited deaf signer, an intermediary, or communication aids or relay interpreters where more than one form of communication is required. The statement is written by the police officer following the witness interview and then communicated back to the witness, with any necessary assistance to check its accuracy before the witness is invited to sign it.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.9/3">So far as the admissibility of the statement is concerned, this is a matter for the court to determine in each case. Written statements are admissible in certain circumstances but normally a witness would give evidence orally in court, again with any necessary assistance with communication.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.9/4">In the civil courts there are no plans to change the current arrangements in respect of witness statements. Each court has a customer service officer who is able to assist users by providing services such as hearing loops, sign language or lip speakers. When required, arrangements may be made to give evidence outside the court room, for example in a hospital. The judge, parties and court staff adopt a flexible approach to allow each case to be dealt with individually according to the circumstances of the person concerned and to accommodate any special needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.249W.9/2">In the 11 month period from April 2008 to February 2009, approximately 35 per cent. of all fresh chicken meat purchased by the House of Commons was approved under the RSPCA's Freedom Food scheme. No other fresh meat purchased over the same period was Freedom Food approved, but all fresh meat was sourced only from producers demonstrating high levels of animal welfare under other recognised quality assurance schemes, such as the Assured Food Standards Board's 'Red Tractor' scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.249W.9/3">Lack of availability is the main obstacle to the House of Commons increasing the proportion of Freedom Food approved meats purchased. The Freedom Food organisation acknowledges that supply is not always available in the food service sector due to the demands of retailers and the House of Commons catering service is working closely with the organisation to try to address this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.252W.5/1">In order to set a benchmark for carbon emissions reduction, DCMS calculated a carbon footprint for the Department; the Royal Parks Agency and 16 non-departmental public bodies in 2008. Progress is being monitored by individual organisations and will be followed up by DCMS after March 2010 once an appreciable amount of data is available. Specific operational examples of reduction carried out by DCMS are the replacement of existing gas boilers with more energy efficient models and the installation of improved energy efficient light fittings, variable speed drives (systems for controlling the rotational speed of an alternating current electric motor) and air handling units. Our sponsored bodies are making similar adjustments to their operational procedures. Further examples of their actions are available in the Pathways to Sustainability section of the Department website.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.11/1">Licensed electricity providers are generally eligible to claim enhanced capital allowances (ECAs) when they purchase plant or machinery that qualifies under any of several ECA schemes. One of those schemes, for energy-saving plant or machinery, provides ECAs for numerous technologies, including combined heat and power (CHP) systems. However, the ECA for CHP is not available to companies whose core business is electricity production in so far as they use the CHP to provide power to unknown end users. This proviso was necessary, in terms of the European Law State aid rules, to prevent any sectoral distortion of competition.</p>

This will include training and guidance on how and in what circumstances to make a referral to a drug treatment specialist for an assessment of problematic drug use. The guidance will be made available to staff working in offices in the Jobcentre Plus districts operating the drugs pilots in good time before the pilots begin.

	<p pid="a.272W.5/1">The formula for calculating the amount of notional income assumed from capital in pension credit, known as tariff income, is not intended to represent any rate of return that could be obtained from investing capital.

	<p pid="a.272W.5/2">In pension credit the first &pound;6,000 of capital is fully disregarded (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes). For each &pound;500 (or part of &pound;500) above this level we assume notional income at a rate of &pound;1.</p>

	<p pid="a.272W.5/5">Pension credit, through the savings credit, is designed to specifically reward pensioners with low or modest second pensions or savings. Notional income from capital is also qualifying income for the savings credit.</p>

For a company, an insolvency event may, for example, occur when an administrative receiver is appointed or the company enters administration under the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986. It would not be an insolvency event for the Government to take a majority stake in a company.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.2/3"><i> (a)</i> The Department has taken a range of steps to deal with gun crime including setting up the Tackling Gangs Action programme, which ran from September 2007 to March 2008. The programme saw a reduction of 51 per cent. in firearms-related injuries and a 27 per cent. drop in all recorded firearm offences across the four TGAP areas. Communities in those areas reported being more aware of police activity during TGAP and a further &pound;1.8 million has been allocated to build on these successes.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/4">One of the key strands in our programme of work is prevention&mdash;empowering communities to work with local agencies to take action to prevent gun crime and gang culture and offering support to parents to challenge their children's behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/5">We have also been working with the police to develop state-of-the-art imaging technology to provide information and intelligence on firearms used in crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/6">NABIS, which went live in November, is an invaluable tool to police forces round the country. We are of course also continuing to work with SOCA and HMRC to prevent and detect illegal firearms entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/7"><i> (b)</i> and <i> (c)</i> The Government's current crime strategy 2008-2011 covers the spectrum of crime&mdash;from antisocial behaviour to serious organised crime&mdash;whether it takes place in an urban or rural setting. The strategy framework aims to; intervene early to prevent offending, take action to reduce opportunity through situational crime prevention, and ensure that there is robust enforcement and action to reduce re-offending. These are all applicable to both urban and rural settings. The strategy, which has been built upon by the Policing Green Paper and measures in the Police and Crime Reduction Bill, placed real emphasis on local flexibility to tackle local priorities to allow local partners to tailor their response to reflect local need (where issues arising from an urban or rural setting might occur).</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/8"><i> (d)</i> We are working closely with the credit card industry to encourage wider adoption by retailers and cardholders of new anti fraud initiatives, with particular emphasis on card not present fraud, such as verified by Visa and Mastercard SecureCode.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/9">More generally, Government have allocated &pound;29 million over three years to implement the recommendations of the fraud review. This includes the creation of a National Fraud Strategic Authority, launched last October; a new national lead force role for the City of London police; and a National Fraud Reporting Centre (NFRC), expected to be fully operational in 2010, which will radically streamline the way that the public report fraud to the police. The NFRC will also equip law enforcement agencies with a powerful intelligence tool and help form the basis of better prevention advice and alerts to fraud threats for business and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/10"><i> (e)</i> The Government introduced statutory controls in the UK on unsolicited spam e-mails under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>. They provide a first line of defence against the kind of unsolicited e mails that many people object to where they have no knowledge of the advertiser or the products being marketed. The regulations require that unsolicited spam e mails must not be sent to an individual subscriber unless prior permission has been obtained or unless there is a previous relationship between the parties. The regulations can be enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the European Union (EU).</p>

	<p pid="a.311W.9/3">The cost to process Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks in the last financial year for which information is available (2007-08) is &pound;88.2 million. During that period the CRB processed 3.4 million disclosures, which generated &pound;97.8 million in revenue from fees. It should be borne in mind that 20 per cent. of the disclosures processed were for volunteer applications for which there is no charge, which represents a considerable saving to the voluntary sector. The CRB is committed to providing free-of-charge checks for volunteers.</p>

Flicker effects have been proven to occur only within '10 rotor diameters of a turbine'. The minimum separation distance to avoid shadow flicker from a wind turbine is therefore derived by multiplying the proposed rotor diameter by 10. The Companion Guide to PPS22 provides a worked example (paragraph 76) and depicts diagrammatically (Figure 5, page 162) the measurement 'one rotor diameter'.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.5/1">Fighting in May 2008 displaced approximately 55,000 people from Abyei town and surrounding areas from a total population of some 100,000. Up to 10,000 people displaced by fighting in May returned to Abyei after the signing of the Road Map peace agreement in June 2008. However, the majority were later displaced again by fighting in December and the latest reports from the UN indicate that the population of Abyei and surrounding areas is now fewer than 50,000, not including nomadic populations. Of these, most are living in displaced camps in Agok. Ongoing security concerns and very weak basic civil administration are the main barriers to returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.5/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) has provided &pound;3 million for water, sanitation, health care and basic household items for the displaced in Abyei through the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund. DFID is also providing some &pound;6.2 million in support of the Abyei administration, police and education.</p>

	<p pid="a.334W.11/2">No such steps are planned. The provision of childcare vouchers through the Employer Supported Childcare (ESC) scheme already offers significant rewards to employers. Employers offering ESC currently save &pound;130 million in national insurance contributions each year, and an attractive package of benefits, of which childcare can be an important part, improves staff retention, ensures access to a wider recruitment pool, reduces absenteeism and leads to a more motivated workforce.</p>

This is because Government expenditure on adult social care funding is part of a larger sum of money given by Government to councils and it is the responsibility of individual councils to determine how these funds are allocated between different local priorities, including adult social care.</p>

	<p pid="a.343W.2/1">These are matters for Ofsted. The Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and copies of her replies have been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert<i> , </i> dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-09">9 February 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/4" class="indent">As you will be aware, Ofsted was established in 1992, but the first children's centres were only designated from June 2003, with many developing from Sure Start Local Programmes and Early Excellence Centres. The services offered by Children's Centres varies but may include integrated early education and childcare. This means that a Children's Centre may include a provision registered by Ofsted (day care and childcare on non-domestic premises) or a maintained school which will be inspected by Ofsted. However, we do not identify if childcare providers or schools are part of a Children's Centre on our databases.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/5" class="indent">The figures below should be treated with some care. To produce these we have cross-referenced the postcodes of Sure Start Children's Centres, according to the DCSF Sure Start database (which is updated by local authorities), with those of the childcare providers and nursery schools on our records. This matching is unlikely to be fully accurate. A Sure Start Children's Centre may have the same post code as a childcare setting while not being the same establishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/6" class="indent">The following tables A and B show the number and proportion of registered childcare providers with a postcode match to a Sure Start Children's Centre receiving each overall quality grade following an Ofsted inspection from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-31">31 August 2008</phrase>. Table C shows the number and proportion of registered childcare providers with a postcode match to a Sure Start Children's Centre receiving each overall quality grade following an Ofsted inspection from <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September 2008</phrase> (when the early years foundation stage was introduced) to <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>, which are the latest data available on childcare inspections. Between <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, the early years inspection framework was based on the Children Act 1989, and used a three-point scale, ranging from good to unsatisfactory. Between <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-31">31 August 2008</phrase>, the inspection framework (commonly known as the Inspecting Outcomes for Children framework) used a four-point scale, ranging from outstanding to inadequate. The early years foundation stage inspection framework, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September 2008</phrase>, uses a similar four-point scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/7" class="indent">The following tables D and E show the number and proportion of nursery schools receiving each overall effectiveness grade following an Ofsted inspection from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase> to the <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-31">31 August 2008</phrase>, which are the latest data available on school inspection outcomes. Under the previous school inspection framework (commonly known as Section 10), this judgment was made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor. Since September 2005, the judgment has been made under the current school inspection framework (commonly known as Section 5) using a four point scale: outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/8" class="indent">It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach between frameworks, so simple comparisons are not possible. Inspectors do not make reference to, or comparisons with, different inspection frameworks. Ofsted's criteria for making inspection judgments about childcare and schools are clearly set out in our inspection guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/9" class="indent">Please note that that the selection of provision for inspection each year is not random. We select providers for inspection each year based on a number of factors, including the period since their last inspection and the grade awarded them at that inspection. Therefore, these figures should not be used to make judgments about the standards of national provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/10" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to right hon. Beverley Hughes MP, Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, and to right hon. Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.349W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/4" class="indent">The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) defines a small primary school as one with 100 pupils or fewer, while a small secondary school has 600 pupils or fewer, and these definitions are used in this response. Data identifying the total number of pupils on a school's roll in each academic year are derived from the DCSF Annual School Census. Schools for which the number of pupils on roll is not available have been excluded from this analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/5" class="indent">Ofsted introduced a judgement of schools' overall effectiveness in January 2000, and this response covers data since that point. Under the school inspection frameworks used between January 2000 and August 2005 (commonly known as Section 10), the school's overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor. Since September 2005, the overall effectiveness judgement has been made under the current school inspection framework (commonly known as Section 5) using a four point scale: outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate. Tables A to D show the percentages of schools by grade for each academic year since January 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/6" class="indent">It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from a seven- to a four-point scale. Ofsted's criteria for making inspection judgements about schools are clearly set out in our inspection guidance, which are available on the Ofsted website at:</p>

In 2007/08 we saw 64 per cent. of apprentices successfully completing their apprenticeship&mdash;up from 37 per cent. in 2004/05, and since 1997 we have witnessed a renaissance in Apprenticeships from a low point of 65,000 to a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.3/2">We have established a matching service to help those apprentices in the construction sector at risk of redundancy to find alternative employment and to complete their apprenticeship. We are currently working with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to explore how this approach might be extended to other sectors. More generally, providers and the LSC have procedures to advise and relocate apprentices in cases where providers or employers fail, to help ensure that they are able to continue in work and complete their apprenticeship. Where alternative work is not available local advice agencies working with training providers and colleges will help find other training opportunities. Such arrangements are being used, for example, to help former Woolworth apprentices complete their apprenticeship framework and find alternative employment or training.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.3/3">The &pound;140 million package announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in January for an additional 35,000 apprenticeship places will help fund new provision in both the public and private sectors, and will extend the opportunities available to people facing redundancy. This package will further boost the number of people starting an apprenticeship.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.2/2">Alongside existing programmes and training provision, we have announced new measures to provide employment-focused training for people facing or at risk of redundancy, as well as those who have been out of work for a longer period of time. This includes: a package of &pound;158 million to support 40,000 new employment-focussed training places for those at risk of redundancy; &pound;83 million to support 75,000 extra further education places for the long-term unemployed; and &pound;140 million to support 35,000 additional Apprenticeship places. The amount of funding that will be available to further education colleges for this training will depend on demand and skills needs of individuals rather than being linked to prior attainment.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/3">Within our existing entitlements, learners who already have a qualification at level 3 or level 4 may be able to access repeat qualifications, however the learner or their employer may be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of the course. Funding for repeat qualifications may be available through the Adult Learner Responsive or Employer Responsive route. In particular, Sector Compacts enable more flexible use of Train to Gain funding for retraining in subjects deemed a priority for a specific sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/4">In late January 2009, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) announced their Economic Challenge Investment Fund, a &pound;50 million fund (&pound;25 million from HEFCE matched with &pound;25 million from individual higher education institutions) to provide help for individuals and businesses during these difficult times. This will help universities and colleges to provide tailored training, development and professional support to vulnerable groups, including those who want to re-skill in strategically important and vulnerable subjects.</p>

	<p pid="a.367W.3/1">In the United Kingdom Mifegyne (mifepristone or RU486) is licensed for the termination of pregnancy (abortion). This product licence was granted following advice from the then Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) that was based on a review of all the available evidence for safety, efficacy and quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.3/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), in consultation with the wider Department, has reviewed the use of emergency hormonal contraception on a number of occasions: in 2001, when Levonelle-2 was made available for sale in pharmacies as Levonelle; in 2003, when the dosing regimen was changed from taking two tablets 12 hours apart to taking them at the same time; and in relation to this, when the strength of the pill was doubled in 2004 so that only one tablet need be taken. Advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (now the Commission on Human Medicines) was sought on all occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.3/3">In 2005 the safety of mifepristone was reviewed within the UK and Europe in response to the reporting of very rare cases of fatal toxic shock following infection, reported from the United States of America, in association with the use of mifepristone and misoprostol for medical abortion. The Food and Drugs Administration concluded that no causal relationship could be established and that serious bacterial infections may occur with all types of abortion, whether spontaneous, surgical or medical. Similar cases of fatalities had not been observed in the UK or Europe. No new safety concerns were identified and no action considered necessary. We are also aware that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reviewed the clinical use of mifepristone in order to update their September 2004 guideline on 'The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion'. This guideline recommends pre-abortion management for all types of abortion which includes infection screening and prophylaxis.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.3/4">The MHRA most recently reviewed the use of mifepristone in 2007. This review examined effectiveness and safety data relating to the use of mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin for the termination of pregnancy up to nine weeks gestation and the balance of benefits and risks was found to be favourable. A comparison of medical versus surgical abortion found significantly more suspected pelvic infections and surgical complications, including uterine perforation that required laparoscopy, after surgical abortion. Furthermore, no significant difference in the success rates after medical abortion was observed compared with surgical abortion.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.3/5">As with all licensed medicines, the safety of mifepristone and emergency hormonal contraception will continue to be monitored by the MHRA.</p>

These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data:</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS information centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.381W.6/1">The core aim of the Department's improving access to psychological therapies programme is to support the national health service to implement the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and deliver effective treatment for people with depression and anxiety disorders. Compliance with clinical guidelines published by NICE forms part of the developmental standards for the NHS and NHS organisations are expected to move towards their full implementation. The Department recognises the important contribution of the effective provision of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) and primary care trusts (PCTs) are obliged to provide funding for NICE-recommended cCBT packages where clinicians want to use them, however, the Department does not collect information on the uptake of cCBT.</p>

	<p pid="a.381W.6/3">The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency have provided procurement advice to the NHS. However, the Department is not in a position to ring-fence funds specifically for cCBT, including Beating the Blues, as decisions about local services are made by local commissioners based on local needs assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.381W.6/4">Information is not held centrally on the cost to the NHS of treating an individual for depression and anxiety so no comparison can be made as to the impact of the nationwide implementation of NICE guidance on cCBT.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.2/1">The national patient safety agency patient safety alert 'Clean Hands Save Lives' issued in September 2008 (which has been placed in the Library) provides guidance for the national health service, and explains the benefit of using alcohol handrubs at the point of care. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/2" class="indent">'There are a number of risks to patients and staff associated with the use of alcohol handrub, however the benefits in terms of its use far outweigh the risks. A risk assessment should be undertaken and a management plan put in place. This particularly applies to clinical areas managing patients with alcohol use disorder and patients at risk of deliberate self harm.'</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/3">Removing alcohol handrub from areas of hospitals is a decision for local determination, according to local risk, and the Department does not keep information on the decisions of individual hospitals centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/4">As the patient safety alert makes clear, what is important is that staff are able to undertake hand hygiene at the point of care, if necessary using soap and water.</p>

	<p pid="a.392W.8/1">It is for professionals in developing support plans with users and carers to balance the needs of both. In doing so they need to ensure that an assessment of risk is undertaken and that the support plan reflects that in a proportionate manner as stated in the &quot;Independence, choice and risk: a guide to best practice in supported decision&quot; (May 2007).</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.8/2">The Health and Social Care Act 2008 extended direct payments to those people who lack capacity to consent and who are currently excluded from the scheme. These people will now be able to benefit from direct payments through the appointment of a 'suitable person', often a friend or relative, to receive the payment on their behalf. The Department has recently consulted on draft regulations to implement this extension which, along with revised accompanying guidance, will come into force this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.8/3">Anyone making decisions for a person who lacks capacity, including a suitable person who receives direct payments on that person's behalf, is obliged under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA), to act at all times in the best interests of the person lacking capacity. Acting in someone's best interests includes involving them in the decision-making process as far as is reasonably practicable to make sure that the person is able to have as much input as possible into decisions about their care. Suitable persons will need to be able to demonstrate how they have spent the direct payment and councils will have the power to stop the direct payment if it is not being spent in the way which it was intended when it was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.8/4">We are also taking action to ensure advice is made available to families who will manage direct payments on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity. The Government are making resources available under the MCA grant to councils and primary care trusts to train professionals on all aspects of working with people who lack capacity and taking best interest decisions on their behalf. Councils decide how best to use these resources on training, awareness raising and appointing specialist MCA professionals.</p>

	<p pid="a.405W.3/1">Suppliers agreed at the Fuel Poverty Summit organised by Ofgem in April 2008 to provide greater visibility of their offers. Following this Ofgem have worked with the suppliers to ensure that information about their social tariffs and programmes and a contact phone number for consumers to check their eligibility is available on all the suppliers' websites.</p>
	<p pid="a.405W.3/2">Energy suppliers have committed to collectively spend &pound;100 million this year, rising to &pound;125 million next year and &pound;150 million by 2011 on social assistance. In order to meet this commitment to Government suppliers need to inform their customers about the assistance available to vulnerable groups through their social tariff scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.405W.3/3">Expenditure on suppliers' social assistance is monitored by Ofgem and they estimated, in a report published in December 2008, that over 800,000 customer accounts are now benefiting from a social tariff. This is a significant increase, almost doubling, since March 2008 which is a good indication of the level of awareness of the assistance suppliers offer.</p>

	<p pid="a.405W.6/5">published in December 2008, Ofgem supplied details of the qualifying criteria for the suppliers' social and discounted tariffs. This information shows that there is no minimum qualifying period for a customer to be eligible for suppliers' social and discounted tariffs.

	<p pid="a.405W.6/8">Ofgem set out its new criteria for what constitutes a social tariff. It proposed that for the financial year 2008-09, a supplier's social tariff had to be as good as the standard direct debit tariff but going forwards, a social tariff has to be at least as good as the lowest tariff in a customer's area.</p>
	<p pid="a.405W.6/9">SSE's, ScottishPower's and E.On's social tariffs are already consistent with the new definition. EDF, British Gas and Npower have been reviewing their social tariffs and will look to launch new versions to comply with the new definition in financial year 2009-10 as set out by Ofgem.</p>
