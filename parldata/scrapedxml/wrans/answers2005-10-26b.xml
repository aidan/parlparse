	<p pid="b.369W.2/1">The Environment Agency's Flood Map on the Internet illustrates the areas that could flood in a 1 per cent. (1 in 100) annual probability of flood from rivers and a 0.5 per cent. (1 in 200) probability flood from the sea. This is consistent with the requirements of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Planning Policy Guidance note 25 on Development and Flood Risk. Hence, the flood map shows both areas of known flood risk and potential risk. While it does not identify where further study is required the flood risk maps are subject to a programme of update and refinement. Areas that have previously flooded are shown on a separate historic flood map held by the Environment Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.369W.5/1">For part <i>(a)</i> the Environment Agency's assessment is based on those properties found within the Extreme Flood Outline. This is an area with an annual probability of flooding of 0.1 per cent. (or 1 in 1,000 year chance of flooding). The Environment Agency defines the extent of the natural floodplain as if there were no flood defences or manmade structures in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/2">East Riding of Yorkshire&quot; has been taken to cover the areas of East Riding of Yorkshire and Kingston-Upon-Hull local authorities. There are 146,800 homes and 8,350 businesses. Planning Policy Guidance Note 25, Development and Flood Risk (PPG 25) recommends that when drawing up or revising development plans, local authorities should give priority in allocating sites for development in descending order of flood risk (known as the 'sequential test').</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/3">To make these decisions as well informed as possible, the Environment Agency encourages local authorities to carry out a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. This assesses flood risk across the whole local authority area, rather than for an individual development, and enables local planning authorities to understand spatial variations in flood risk. Future development proposals can then be assessed in line with the 'sequential test'.</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/4">Both the East Riding of Yorkshire and the City of Hull councils have begun to develop a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment and have been in initial consultation with the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/5">In the meantime the Environment Agency is providing them with advice and information to assist the process, and continuing to comment on land allocations and individual planning applications in respect of flood risk, through their role as a planning consultee.</p>

Flood risk mapping is an important part of the Government's strategy on public awareness, to ensure that the risk from flooding is better understood by all concerned. It is important that people living and working in the floodplains should know about the probabilities of flooding so they can take informed decisions about precautionary action. Similarly those responsible for development planning decisions and emergency planning also need this information.</p>

	<p pid="b.377W.5/3">Our policy is that upon mobilization every reservist is given a full medical and dental examination prior to their acceptance into full-time service. The provision of healthcare continues throughout the period of full-time service through to when they return from operations for demobilization. At this point they receive a further medical examination and information about the availability of post-mobilization physical and mental health support.</p>

	<p pid="b.379W.5/1">The Veterans Agency is responsible for deciding claims under the Ex-Gratia Payment Scheme for Former Far East Prisoners of War and Civilian Internees. Mr. Peter Hall's claim was rejected because he was unable to show that he met the necessary birthlink criterion, which requires former civilian internees who were British at the time of internment to have been born, or have had a parent or grandparent born, in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.379W.5/2">However, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>, considering the application for judicial review brought by Mrs. Diana Elias, the High Court found that the birth link criterion had resulted in unlawful indirect racial discrimination. After careful consideration, the Ministry of Defence decided to appeal against that decision to the Court of Appeal. Until these legal proceedings have been concluded, that part of the scheme relating to civilian internees has been suspended.</p>
	<p pid="b.379W.5/3">Should the High Court judgment be upheld, the Department would have to change the eligibility criteria and cases so far rejected would be reviewed in that light.</p>

In this context she can be defined as the lead ship; however, Largs Bay, built by Swan Hunter, remains the First of Class vessel and as such is the benchmark against which the performance of the other three vessels will be judged.</p>

The Department for Transport provides funding support for the 11 mobility centres based in England. These centres provide advice where a medical condition has been identified that may affect driving competence, or where concern has been expressed about competence to drive. They also provide advice, information and assessment to any older or disabled drivers who contact them. In addition, many local authorities, through their Road Safety Officers, have developed initiatives to provide advice on competence to drive. Some of these schemes give advice through leaflets, while several provide an on-road driving assessment and report.</p>

Since this announcement, the Highways Agency has continued to develop proposals to improve the junctions on the A19 as recommended by the study. However, further progress on these specific schemes will be dependent on the advice the region provides to the Secretary of State on its transport priorities as part of the regional funding allocation process. The Highways Agency has also continued to develop proposals to reduce congestion on the A1 through Tyneside, but further progress will be subject to complementary work by local authorities in developing a strategy to reduce travel demand in future years. The Tyne and Wear local authorities have included a congestion strategy in their local transport plan for 2006&ndash;11 and the Tyne and Wear authorities have bid for Government financial support through the transport innovation fund to help with further development of their demand management options. We expect to announce the successful bids under this initiative by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.388W.8/1">We have worked hard with the LSC to simplify funding arrangements including reducing the number of separate budgets for further education. This has reduced bureaucracy and has made college funding more simple and transparent. We would be reluctant to reverse this process, which has been welcomed by colleges and their staff. Success for All&quot;, the strategy for reforming further education and training, makes clear that the Government's approach to pay is to enable local flexibility to meet local needs and to encourage a clear link between pay and individual performance. FE colleges and sixth form colleges are autonomous bodies, which negotiate pay and conditions with staff and their unions without Government involvement either nationally or locally.</p>

Parents have the right to express a preference for whatever school they wish their child to attend and we want as many parents as possible to be able to send their child to their preferred school.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.5/4">We have introduced a number of measures to make it easier for the best schools to expand in line with parental demand including making dedicated capital funding available for the expansion of successful and popular secondary schools. Schools wishing to expand must follow a statutory process&mdash;consulting interested parties and publishing a statutory notice. The final decision is taken by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or an independent Schools Adjudicator. Our guidance to SOCs and adjudicators makes it clear that there is a presumption in favour of approving proposals to expand a successful and popular school.</p>

It is for LAs to determine how much they spend on student finance administration within that settlement. Some LAs have claimed that their costs increased as a result of the introduction of the national Protocol IT system in 2004&ndash;05. We are therefore investigating this issue but do not intend to make a decision on reimbursement until the costs for the 2005&ndash;06 financial year are known.

	<p pid="b.395W.0/1">A large scale, comprehensive evaluation of Sure Start local programmes is under way which will assess, among other outcomes, the cognitive, behavioural and language development of 8,000 children living in communities served by Sure Start. Children have been assessed at 9 months and will be assessed again at age 3 and 5, and compared to children in similar circumstances who do not live in an SSLP area.</p>
	<p pid="b.395W.0/2">Assessments of children's development are made using standardised assessment scales. These include a measure of how many words a child uses, their ability to recognise numbers and shapes and observing the child's behaviour. These assessments are undertaken by trained researchers. Parents are also interviewed and other background characteristics of the family are collected.</p>
	<p pid="b.395W.0/3">An assessment of speech and language development in SSLPs showed that the proportion of children with a high number of words at age 2 and whose parents had no concerns about their child's language, rose from 70 per cent. to 76 per cent. between 2001 to 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.396W.2/1">In July 2004 the Government restated its commitment to tackling crime and disorder through the publication of the 2004 spending review, which included a Home Office target to bring crime levels down by a further 15 percent. between 2002&ndash;03 and 2007&ndash;08, and more in those areas with the highest crime. The crimes covered by this target include vandalism. Through the Government Offices for the regions and the Welsh Assembly Government, we have negotiated three year targets with each crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP) in England and community safety partnership (CSP) in Wales as their contribution to the delivery of the national target.</p>
	<p pid="b.396W.2/2">In the south-east, the Government Office has taken forward these arrangements via a series of communications with partners, including a regional target-setting event. They also spent time with Gravesham CDRP discussing the targets to be achieved by 2007&ndash;08. In terms of volume, criminal damage was the largest contributor and the importance of reducing this type of crime was therefore stressed. Gravesham subsequently set a target to reduce criminal damage, including vandalism, by 30 percent.</p>
	<p pid="b.396W.2/3">As part of the TOGETHER campaign, we have also published a range of step-by-step guides on tackling various aspects of antisocial behaviour, with two more in preparation. Much of the advice in these documents is applicable to vandalism. We are also currently collecting examples of good practice that will be disseminated to all partnerships later this year to help them drive down vandalism in their areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.399W.2/1">The IMPACT programme has made significant progress on two fronts. It will deliver, by the end of 2005, a national index of names (the IMPACT nominal index) which will enable any force to check where information is held on individuals by other forces. A programme definition project is being finalised. Under it, plans will be set out for longer term improvements in police information management, including the future of the police national computer.</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.2/2">A fuller statement on progress in implementing the Bichard recommendations will be placed before the House shortly. This will include a more detailed statement about the progress of the IMPACT programme. For commercial reasons, business cases are not released until contracts have been signed and associated contractual activities completed.</p>

	<p pid="b.400W.0/1">The IMPACT programme is intended to deliver improved police information management and information sharing systems over the next five years. The first application, a national index of names (the IMPACT nominal index) will be deployed into a child abuse investigation unit in every force in England and Wales by the end of 2005. Together with the interim police local cross-check (pending full police local cross-check delivered as part of the IMPACT programme on which preparatory work continues) this will enable police forces and the Criminal Records Bureau to check where information is held on individuals by other forces. Further decisions about the implementation timetable will be made by the end of March 2006.</p>

We share deep concern at Iran's decision to resume uranium conversion activities, contrary to successive International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board resolutions and in violation of the framework agreed by Iran for negotiations on long-term arrangements. The E3/EU have urged Iran to honour its obligations and comply fully with the requests of the IAEA Board of Governors. I hope Iran will reinstate its suspension of fuel cycle activities and return to talks with the E3/EU on the basis of the Paris Agreement</p>

	<p pid="b.410W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mrs Katherine Bryan to Lady Hermon dated October 2005</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about what action he intends to take to address the failings of the Briggs Rock Pumping Station outside Groomsport, Co. Down (20643). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.5/4" class="indent">Wastewater from Bangor receives mechanical screening before discharge to the Irish Sea via a marine outfall at Briggs Rock. The screening plant originally comprised two automatic rotating screens which removed most solids and materials from the sewage before discharge to sea. The screens became increasingly difficult to maintain and repair due to difficulties in sourcing replacement parts, and as a result became more expensive to operate. The condition of the screens continued to deteriorate and they were replaced by fabricated bar screens in late 2004. These screens had to be cleaned manually twice per day and were not as effective as the automatic rotating screens. This unfortunately led to some pollution on the adjourning coastline which Water Service cleaned up.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.5/5" class="indent">Pending the construction of the new North Down/Ards Wastewater Treatment Works, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2007, Water Service replaced the manually raked screens with new automatic screens. As part of the upgrade, a new water main was laid to the Briggs Rock sea outfall to supply water to clean the new screening plant. During commissioning of the plant in late September 2005, Water Service became aware that this new water supply to the screening plant was causing water pressure problems in the Groomsport area. Water Service responded quickly with temporary measures to return the water pressure in the area to acceptable levels. These measures included reducing water usage at the screening plant to a minimum. However, this means that the new screens cannot operate effectively at all times and new instances of pollution may result under flood conditions. These will be cleared up by Water Service if they occur.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.5/6" class="indent">Urgent investigations are underway to identify any water network improvements necessary to retain satisfactory water pressure to the local residents while at the same time enabling the screens to operate effectively. These investigations should be completed by the end of October and Water Service will take immediate action to undertake any remedial work identified.</p>

	<p pid="b.412W.2/1">No official estimate has been made of the number of people in Northern Ireland who will take advantage of the new status of civil partner. The regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the Civil Partnership Act 2004 attempted to estimate the proportion of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population in Great Britain who will be in a civil partnership in 2050. It proceeded on the assumption that 5 percent. of the adult population in Great Britain is lesbian, gay or bisexual. It then examined evidence of take up of comparable partnership schemes in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands and concluded that the take-up would be small, possibly in the region of 5 percent. to 10 percent. of the proportion of the heterosexual population who choose to marry. The legislation, however, has implications for same-sex couples who choose not to form a civil partnership but to live together as if they were civil partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.412W.2/2">1000 copies of the guidance, Civil Partnership: What does it Mean for You&quot;, were printed at a cost of approximately &pound;1,500. Copies have been circulated widely throughout Northern Ireland to political parties, Citizens Advice Bureaux, public libraries and other advice givers in the voluntary sector as well as groups representative of the lesbian and gay community in Northern Ireland. A draft of the guidance was considered by the coalition on sexual orientation, an umbrella group for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered community in Northern Ireland. In addition, the guidance is available on the Office of law reform website at <a href="http://www.olrni.gov.uk">www.olrni.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="b.412W.5/7">In the Northern Ireland civil service, the principal civil service pension scheme (Northern Ireland) operates on a policy of parity with the Home civil service scheme, the principal civil service pension scheme, therefore it would be the normal approach of the Northern Ireland civil service to introduce the same pension provisions as apply to the Home civil service.</p>

	<p pid="b.418W.5/1">The information is not available in the format requested. The rate of unfitness for all housing tenures at the Northern Ireland level was 4.9 percent. in 2001 and 3.8 percent. in 2004. The rate of unfitness in the Housing Executive and housing association sectors is around one per cent. Whilst it is not possible to provide a robust and precise figure below the Northern Ireland level because of the sample size, it is unlikely that there is any significant variation across Housing Executive districts.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.5/2">With the majority of stock built since 1970, and the relatively high level of resources committed to the maintenance and improvement of social housing, levels of unfitness in both the Housing Executive and housing association sectors has remained minimal. Across all tenures, the unfitness rate remains much higher in isolated rural areas and some inner city areas of Belfast and grant aid and urban renewal will continue to play important roles in reducing unfitness.</p>

	<p pid="b.429W.5/1">DFID does not have a specific technical assistance contract in Sierra Leone as such. Technical Assistance is an integral part of most of what DFID is doing in the country to strengthen the government's ability to deliver services to its citizens. As a result of the long years of war in the 1990s when many educated people fled the country, limited capacity is a major development constraint.</p>

	<p pid="b.430W.2/1">Credible independent estimates suggest that between three and five million people will face serious food shortages over the coming months. This is mainly as a result of bad governance by the Government of Zimbabwe, combined with erratic rains and the impact of HIV/AIDS which are also affecting neighbouring countries. The World Food Programme, with support from DFID and other donors, is presently providing food aid for one million vulnerable Zimbabweans, mainly children. Operations will be scaled up as hunger becomes more widespread in the months before the next harvest.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.2/2">In addition, the Government of Zimbabwe's forced clearance of unauthorised dwellings earlier this year, Operation Murambatsvina (Clean Up&quot;), displaced or destroyed the livelihoods of 700,000 people, aggravating poverty and food shortages in both urban and rural areas. The Zimbabwe Government's own efforts to mitigate the suffering caused by their mass evictions have been limited, and in some instances, the Government has obstructed the wider humanitarian effort, for example by refusing to accept the provision of tents and other temporary shelters for those without shelter. Despite these difficulties, a range of UN and non-governmental agencies are operating relief programmes reaching 40,000 affected households, including those affected by HIV and AIDS, with supplies of food, blankets, medical care and other essential items.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.2/3">DFID has provided over &pound;100 million in humanitarian support to Zimbabwe since the onset of the food crisis in September 2001. All funding is channelled through UN agencies and NGOs, who ensure that assistance reaches those who need it most.</p>

	<p pid="b.434W.5/1">The Government believe that current fixed opening hours encourage patrons to binge drink and the Licensing Act 2003, which takes effect on <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, will enable a greater variety of premises to adopt flexible hours and so remove the need for some patrons to drink as much as possible before the pubs and bars close.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.5/2">The Act also provides the police with a raft of new powers for tackling disorderly and criminal behaviour on licensed premises and to apply for reviews of licences where drunkenness and disorderly behaviour are prevalent.</p>

	<p pid="b.437W.12/2">The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 contains a range of powers in relation to the control of infectious disease. As to plans to review this legislation, I refer the hon. Member to my reply of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-10-24.189W"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 189&ndash;90W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.12/3">Emergency powers under part two of the Civil Contingencies Act are designed to allow the Government to respond quickly and effectively to the most serious emergencies where existing powers prove to be insufficient. They are capable of being used in the event of a range of emergencies, including those involving threats to public health, but only where existing powers would be ineffective. Their use is a last resort option&mdash;other approaches, such as bringing forward new legislation in an accelerated timeframe, would be considered first.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.12/4">The Act allows the making of temporary legislation&mdash;emergency regulations&mdash;in exceptional circumstances and only where the robust tests and safeguards in the Act are met. Such temporary legislation may amend existing powers or grant new ones where this is necessary and proportionate. In order to meet these tests any use of emergency powers must be tailored to the specific circumstances at hand. It is therefore not possible, and would be potentially misleading, to comment on any specific measures that could be taken using emergency powers in the event of a public health emergency&mdash;it would depend on the specific circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.5/1">It is only possible to provide data on the number of reportable incidents involving drugs and equipment. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) operates national systems for the collection and monitoring information of adverse events related to drugs and devices. Both systems rely upon voluntary reporting of suspected adverse events by health professionals. Manufacturers with respect to devices and marketing authorisation holders with respect to drugs have statutory obligations to report suspected adverse events.</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.5/21">The MHRA pharmacovigilance system does not differentiate between national health service and private hospitals. The number of reports received from London hospitals, therefore, includes day hospitals, private hospitals and hospitals that may now be closed. It is important to note that a report of an adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships, including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease.</p>

	<p pid="b.443W.5/1">The supply chain excellence programme (SCEP) consists of four projects, one of which is national contracts procurements (NCP). This project is being conducted in two waves. All work carried out under the NCP project first has a full opportunity assessment and approval from the SCEP's departmental board. A regulatory impact assessment was not carried out for the whole of the second wave as it does not require any changes to existing Regulations and is consistent with the Department's objectives to improve efficiencies in the national health service supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="b.447W.2/1">Local Area Agreements (LAA) are three year agreements. They give all areas the freedom to pool funding and spend it more flexibly to meet priorities for the individual local area. Further freedoms to help meet outcomes and targets in the LAA can be requested by each local area and those which have been granted and are under discussion are contained in each LAA. The level and type of funding varies across agreement, as each is based on different local priorities. The LAA guidance includes a summary of the funding streams which can be included in the agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/2">LAAs are entered into voluntarily by local authorities and their partners in the locality. Each local area develops appropriate performance management systems for the LAA and there are measures which can be applied should certain agreed targets not be met. Each LAA is based on local priorities and so each has a particular list of targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/3">A copy of each LAA is available on the ODPM website:</p>

	<p pid="b.447W.8/1">Under the first dome sale competition, which ran from March 1999 until February 2001, there were six firm final proposals, which culminated in preferred bidder status being given to two bidders in succession. When neither of those proposals could be brought to completion, the second sale process invited expressions of interest for both a future use for the dome and compatible uses for associated land on the Greenwich Peninsula. Three substantive proposals were received, although only two of these offered specific uses for the dome itself. Subsequently, the Meridian Delta Ltd. consortium with the Anschutz Entertainment Group was selected as best satisfying the assessment criteria, and negotiations were concluded with that consortium in May 2002. The commercial contracts went unconditional in June 2004 and work is now well under way on the new arena inside the dome.</p>

Since then fees for handling planning applications in England have been increased. These increases came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>.

The Government are currently inviting notifications of affected pension schemes to the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), and are therefore obtaining some information on the number of members facing pensions losses due to company insolvency.

	<p pid="b.462W.2/1">The UK Presidency has not put forward any detailed proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). What we have asked for is a proper debate on the future of the EU budget, including the CAP, and we have seen public contributions from politicians, political commentators, economists and fanners across Europe. As Presidency, we have also held formal consultations with each of the member states, as well as Romania and Bulgaria, in order to ensure that we understand their views and concerns on the EU budget for 2007&ndash;13, including the fundamental review of Community spending that we have proposed. The purpose of such a review would be to ensure that EU expenditure is focused on areas where the EU can add the most value in comparison with spending at the national or regional level, taking into account the global economic and political challenges faced by the EU. The UK Presidency believes agreement on the 2007&ndash;13 budget can and should be reached in December, and we will have to reflect, in the light of member states' views and the proposals published by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase>, how best to do this. We have also made good progress towards an agreement to reform the CAP sugar regime. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will update Parliament on these negotiations in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.467W.2/1">The UK Presidency tabled two discussions by Deputy Permanent Representatives to the EU on this issue in early July. Among other things, it was agreed to hold fewer, more focused debates and to limit the length of interventions by Council members. We think this has made Council meetings more efficient. These discussions were based on the guidelines set out in Annex IV of the Council Rules of Procedure, which were agreed by all member states in 2003 in preparation for the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 member states. The Rules of Procedures seek to focus Council meetings on the key decisions to be taken by Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="b.468W.5/1">The Government welcomed the proposals to create a European External Action Service (EEAS) designed to support the proposed new EU Foreign Minister role, as part of the Constitutional treaty. The Constitutional treaty proposed that the Service would be established by the Council, which is made up of member states, on the basis of a proposal by the EU Foreign Minister, and not by the Commission, although the Commission would have to give their consent to the proposals. As the hon. Member is aware, the future of the Constitutional treaty, and hence the possibility of an EU Foreign Minister, is uncertain following the June European Council. We do not believe that an EEAS, as envisaged in the treaty, can be introduced without treaty change.</p>

	<p pid="b.470W.5/1">Due to the political climate in Zimbabwe, the meetings with some of the sources were conducted on the basis that their identities would not be revealed except in relation to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) proceedings. The AIT decided to make an order under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 by which those sources which had requested anonymity were protected, and accordingly the team's summary of their evidence was not made public. However, the team's evidence is noted in detail in the determination of the AIT, which can be viewed on the AIT website at <a href="http://www.ait.gov.uk/determinations">http://www.ait.gov.uk/determinations</a>.do</p>
