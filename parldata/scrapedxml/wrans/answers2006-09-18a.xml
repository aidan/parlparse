	<p pid="a.2457W.12/1">The difference in funding for film projects between the City of Brighton and Hove and West Sussex is a reflection of the level of film making activity in each of the areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2457W.12/2">Since funding applications are necessarily considered on a project by project basis, the density of awards made in Brighton and Hove is attributable to the relative level of film activity in the area. Many more applications are received from the Brighton and Hove (341) than from West Sussex (87).</p>
	<p pid="a.2457W.12/3">It should be noted however that the proportion of successful applications to Screen South, the Regional Screen Agency for the South East, is in fact higher in West Sussex than in Brighton and Hove, with an average of 48 per cent. proceeding to award over the last four years compared with an average of 40 per cent. in Brighton and Hove over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.2457W.12/4">Equally, applications to UK Film Council central funds show the same trend: more applications have been received from Brighton and Hove (140) than from West Sussex (51), but of those latter a higher percentage proceeded to award&mdash;25 per cent. as against 14 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.2459W.0/1">The information available is from Land Use Change Statistics, shown in the following table. In a small number of London boroughs the proportions are not reliable enough to be shown for a single year. Proportions are also shown for the period 2001 to 2004 as a whole, and for the period 1989 to 1992 as a whole as four year averages are more reliable. Compared to 1989 to 1992 there has been a significant drop in the percentage of dwellings in London built on undeveloped land.</p>

	<p pid="a.2467W.6/2">Performance indicators and targets are currently set for local government by a number of different Government departments under separate performance management regimes. The number of centrally-set performance indicators and targets applicable to any individual local authority varies and will depend on the type of local authority (for example county council, district council, unitary authority or London borough) and the individual grant or funding regimes it accesses. Not all indicators have targets set against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.2467W.6/3">Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPIs) were introduced in 2000-01 in order to enable central Government to monitor progress over a period of time, allow authorities to compare their performance against that of their peers and provide residents with information about the performance of their local authority. BVPIs are also a key component of the framework developed by the Audit Commission to inform Comprehensive Performance Assessment judgments.</p>
	<p pid="a.2467W.6/4">The Government sets targets against 3 BVPIs. Local authorities are expected to set their own targets for improvement against the remaining 87 BVPIs.</p>
	<p pid="a.2467W.6/5">There are also a number of 'floor' targets, setting minimum standards that every area should meet, which have been set by central Government as part of each Spending Review since 2000. These floor targets now cover six thematic areas: crime, education, housing, employment, health and liveability, and are designed to help reduce the gap between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest.</p>

The estimate of &pound;350 million assumes a cost of &pound;750 per transaction failure&mdash;i.e. the total loss for buyer and seller at 1998 prices. The baseline research due to start shortly will provide more up to date and comprehensive data on the cost of transaction failure to consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.2472W.3/2">Pensions schemes that start to wind up are required to advise the pensions regulator, as it maintains a register of pension schemes. However, the status of the employer that sponsors an occupational pension scheme is not registrable information, which means that the regulator is unable to identify how many schemes in the process of winding up have a solvent employer.</p>

Projections of numbers receiving pension credit in the future are subject to a range of uncertainties and a number of factors including policies on uprating different benefits and assumptions on rates of take-up. The assumptions applied here are consistent with those that underpin published long-run expenditure projections, and are applied to projections of the number of pensioner households estimated to be eligible for pension credit. 2. Care should be taken when interpreting these projections. In particular data deficiencies make it difficult to be confident in the split between the number of people who may be in receipt of only the guarantee credit and those who may be in receipt of both the guarantee credit and the savings credit. Also the projections are sensitive to the assumed take-up rates (the same assumptions on the rate of take-up are applied to the current and reform projections).  3. Estimates of the proportion of pensioners eligible for pension credit are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models.  4. The projections of the number of pensioners eligible for pension credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes.  5. The projections of the number of male pensioners currently aged over 65 years who may be eligible for pension credit in 2010 have been derived from projections of the proportion of males aged 69+ in 2010 who may be eligible and projections of the number of males aged 69+ in Great Britain in 2010. A similar procedure was followed in estimating the number who may be eligible in 2012 and the number of females currently aged over 60 years who may be eligible in 2010 and 2012.  6. The reform projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper.  7. The projections in Table 1 assume that basic state pension is uprated in line with prices and the standard guarantee credit with prices each year after 2008. It should be noted that there is a Government commitment to uprate the standard guarantee credit with earnings until 2008. Treasury projections for the current system assume price uprating of the standard guarantee credit beyond 2008.  8. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-5 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-5 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty.  9. The projections are rounded to the nearest 50,000.  10. Qualifying age for the guarantee credit will increase with women's state pension age between 2010 and 2020, from 60 to 65.</td> </tr>

However, we have always made it clear that payment into a bank account is the best option for the overwhelming majority of customers, and so it is only right that we alert customers to the fact that there are accounts that may better meet their needs. For example, many are missing out on the savings that direct debits can bring and on interest paid on balances. Around 25 different bank accounts can be accessed at Post Office branches now.

	<p pid="a.2475W.9/1">The splitting of the European Parliament site between Strasbourg and Brussels is far from ideal. However, there is an historical and legal basis for the siting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, as agreed at the Edinburgh summit 1992, and any changes would require the unanimous support of all 25 EU member states. Unfortunately, we do not believe that the necessary political unanimity for such a change currently exists.</p>

	<p pid="a.2476W.0/1">The UK has long worked for a peaceful solution to the long running conflict in Northern Uganda. The recent cessation of hostilities and on-going negotiations relating to Northern Uganda are a promising step. However, it is clear that there is much work still to be done to bring a sustainable peace to the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.2476W.0/2">The UK, along with the rest of the EU, is a strong supporter&mdash;in principle and in practice&mdash;of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which was established to prosecute the most serious crimes of international concern. In July 2004, the ICC launched an investigation into the situation in Northern Uganda, following referral of the situation by the Government of Uganda. In October 2005, the ICC unsealed warrants for the arrest of five senior members of the Lord's Resistance Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.2476W.0/3">The operating procedures of the ICC, including the issue of warrants, are a matter for the Court and we respect its independence. We urge all parties to fulfil their obligations under the Statute of the Court. The ICC has made clear that it is following developments closely and remains in close contact with the Government of Uganda and the wider international community.</p>

There is close co-operation between many UK organisations including the police, security and intelligence agencies and Whitehall Departments with many other countries. It is not the normal practice of the Government to comment on the specifics of such matters. To do so can harm operational effectiveness, assist the terrorists and damage co-operative relationships beneficial to the UK's own security.</p>

If a lost way were to prove problematic for a landowner, a process already exists whereby the local authority may effect a suitable diversion or extinguish the right of way.</p>
	<p pid="a.2479W.2/2">The results for Cheshire and Shropshire, which will provide strong documentary evidence, will be available in spring and autumn 2007 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.2479W.2/3">The estimated total cost of the project over 19 years is &pound;15 million, including the additional resources needed to facilitate the process of recording the rights of way on the definitive map and statement (the local authorities' legal record of rights of way).</p>

	<p pid="a.2480W.2/1">This autumn, the lunar effect on the tides will be greater than average. However, this does not mean that there will be flooding. Weather conditions are critical in determining whether potential flood risk generated by high tides actually results in a flood.</p>
	<p pid="a.2480W.2/2">Defences in Essex are already prepared for high tides. Tidal surges in the North Sea can lead to flooding throughout the year and the maintenance regime and operational procedures take this into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.2480W.2/4">The Flood Warning system also links into the emergency planning and resilience structure for Essex. Regular meetings are held between the major response parties to ensure that, in a flooding situation, the response is co-ordinated and seamless.

	<p pid="a.2482W.12/2">I have considered the issue of pardons for world war one soldiers in the round, taking into account the difficult circumstances of that war and the spectrum of cases involved. Given the lack of information in many cases, I believe that it would not be fair to consider each case on an individual basis. However, it is now appropriate to show compassion by seeking a statutory group pardon for those individuals executed for cowardice, desertion and similar offences.</p>

Weight constraints mean it is not possible to provide additional armour.

The majority of patients in the two regions in the South East of England serviced by Allied Respiratory have transferred to the new supplier. Remaining patients are continuing to receive their oxygen cylinders through community pharmacies and are expected to transfer to Allied Respiratory over the next few weeks. Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts continue to monitor the situation and work with the supplier and clinicians to ensure patients needs are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.2509W.3/1">After completion, the reconfiguration is expected to deliver savings of &pound;250 million every year for reinvestment in frontline services, primary care trusts are likely to prioritise investments in the manifesto commitments such as additional palliative care services, improving access to cancer services and developments in mental health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.2509W.3/2">The savings are expected to be realised by the end of 2007 and then every year for reinvestment beginning in 2008-09. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been asked to oversee the generation of the savings locally. Each SHA has a cost envelope that it should realise but it is for local determination to work out the best way of achieving these savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.2516W.2/1">The report on default charges is being conducted by the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT have already stated that they believed that credit card default charges had been generally set at a significantly higher level than was considered fair and set a &pound;12 threshold for OFT intervention unless there were exceptional business factors. In response to this, credit card issuers have agreed to reduce their default charges&mdash;the majority by almost half.</p>

The OFT remains of the view that the broad principles do read across to the retail banking area and has decided to undertake further work on the application of these principles to bank current accounts. This fact-finding exercise is expected to take between three to six months, at which stage the OFT will consider whether a further detailed investigation of the fairness of individual bank default charges is needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.2524W.5/2">Our latest estimate (2005) is based on a comparison of the Vehicle register, maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), and the Motor Insurance Database. It is that there are about 2 million vehicles (about 6 per cent. of the UK vehicle fleet) being driven by uninsured drivers. There are no similar comparisons for earlier years.</p>
	<p pid="a.2524W.5/3">In order to strengthen enforcement activity to tackle motor insurance evaders we introduced two new measures last year. First, to give the police improved access to the Motor Insurance Database to enhance their capability to detect uninsured driving by using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2524W.5/4">Second, powers to allow the police to seize vehicles being driven uninsured. Both these measures are proving effective with the police seizing nearly 600 uninsured vehicles a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.2524W.5/5">In addition we are seeking powers in the Road Safety Bill to introduce a scheme of Continuous Insurance Enforcement which would enable us to enforce the requirement for motor insurance from the record. This means that rather than having to rely on spotting an uninsured vehicle on-road we can identify, from the database, vehicles where insurance policies have lapsed and not been renewed. This will enable us to target all such evaders, rather than just the necessarily smaller numbers that it is possible to identify on-road.</p>
