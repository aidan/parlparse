Recent improvements have been made to the operational welfare package, the aim of which is to maintain the strength and morale of service personnel in order to optimise and maintain effectiveness. It does so by providing support for the physical and emotional well-being of service personnel deployed on operations. Recent improvements to the package include an increase in the free weekly telephone calls from 20 to 30 minutes and a tax bonus. Other benefits of the package include free e-mails facility, free &quot;blueys&quot; (mail), free packages from families to personnel of up to 2 kg over the Christmas period and up to 14 days rest and recuperation break during a six month tour.</p>

	<p pid="b.347W.5/1">The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court offers a range of in-patient rehabilitation services and is the base for the Defence Medical Services' Rheumatology and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) consultants. Broadly, three categories of patient attend DMRC:</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/2" class="indent">Patients requiring immediate assessment and treatment, often from overseas locations, who can be seen by DMRC without prior hospital treatment. Patients are admitted directly with no waiting time.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/3" class="indent">Patients with complex rehabilitation requirements following hospital treatment for trauma or other physical injuries. Such patients include the operational casualties typically treated in NHS hospitals in Birmingham. The care pathways for these patients are planned to ensure that they come to DMRC at the most appropriate time in their clinical treatment, with the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Evaluation and Coordination Cell at Headley Court coordinating the case management of these patients. There is no waiting list for such patients&mdash;in other words, there are no such patients who ought to have started their treatment at Headley Court but who have been delayed in doing so because of any capacity limits at DMRC.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/4" class="indent">Patients for routine assessment and treatment are referred directly to the R&amp;R consultants or via our Regional Rehabilitation Units. The consultants offer appointments depending on clinical need, the availability of the patient and the start date of suitable courses of therapy for the patient's condition. Most patients in this category will be seen within six weeks of being referred to DMRC.</p>

	<p pid="b.354W.2/2"><i> </i>The number of friendly fire incidents in Iraq since 2003 is not held centrally. Friendly fire incidents could be Multinational Forces (MNF) on MNF, MNF on Iraqi Security Force (ISF) or ISF on MNF. Recorded instances of these incidents could only be aggregated from individual records, some of which we would have to request from coalition partners and the Iraqi security forces. This could only be done at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.359W.8/1">All Diplomas at Level 3 are being designed to give progression routes into Higher Education including Honours Degrees. Higher Education Institutions are members of the Diploma Development Partnerships developing the qualifications and are participating in the Local Consortiums which will be delivering the Diplomas. Four champions have agreed to promote the Diplomas, two from the HE sector. Deian Hopkin, Vice Chancellor, London South Bank University and Michael Arthur, Vice Chancellor, Leeds University are working to raise awareness and improve understanding of the reforms across the HE sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.8/2">A Higher Education Engagement Project Board with representation from each of the university groupings within the HE sector and FE has been set up to promote an understanding of the 14-19 reforms and to encourage the HE and FE sector to become involved in Diplomas. Diplomas have received &quot;in principle&quot; support from most HEIs. We do not expect HEIs to confirm their support until they have had the opportunity to see the content of the Diplomas in detail. The Board is also supporting a number of projects to map the Level 3 Diploma curriculums against degree courses and to illustrate progression pathways as well as working with UCAS to determine an appropriate point score.</p>

Some providers will maintain their own lists and local LSC partnership and regional LSC teams sometimes review these individual lists. We are therefore unable to provide the number of people on waiting lists nationally.</p>

These new arrangements should be operational by the early autumn. Colleges will be able to use BREEAM rather than commissioning individual assessments, which will bring the assessment cost down significantly from an average of &pound;25,000 to &pound;23,000 per project.</p>

	<p pid="b.361W.5/1">Implementation of the International Education Strategy is ongoing and there has been progress recently on a number of fronts. For example, building on the success of the first phase of the Prime Minister's Initiative (PMI) to increase student numbers by 75,000 (which was exceeded ahead of schedule), the Prime Minister last year launched a second phase with even more stretching targets to be achieved by 2011. These include an increase of a further 100,000 international students, to double the number of countries sending more than 10,000 students p.a. to the UK and to see a demonstrable improvement to student satisfaction ratings in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.5/2">We are also making progress against our objectives in multilateral forums. Within the European Union, for example, we are working with other member states and the Commission to develop the role of education and skills in achieving the Lisbon goals of jobs and growth. At the EU Education Council of November 2006, a UK-driven proposal for a compendium of good practice on Higher Education won widespread support. The Commission and member states are taking forward this proposal within the framework of the EU Peer Learning Cluster on Modernizing Higher Education.</p>

	<p pid="b.364W.5/1">The Department has not carried out a specific assessment of the impact of the Sexual Orientation Regulations on schools' bullying policies. However, the Regulations will ensure schools tackle homophobic bullying as seriously as other forms of bullying. We will clarify how the Regulations apply to school bullying policies in our forthcoming guidance &quot;Preventing and Responding to Homophobic Bullying&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.364W.5/2">We are currently considering all the Education and Skills Select Committee's recommendations, including that to require schools to record all incidents of bullying, and will issue a formal response very soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.364W.5/3">On the merits of issuing non-compulsory guidelines for schools, head teachers are under a statutory duty to determine measures to prevent all forms of bullying. The Department took a deliberate decision not to make its anti-bullying guidance statutory, or for that matter legally require schools to sign up to the Anti-Bullying Charter. We believe it is better to work with schools to encourage them to take ownership of their policies, and to tailor them to their own needs and circumstances. We recommend that, as best practice, schools consult the entire school community, including parents and pupils, in drawing up their behaviour policies, and indeed they are now under a legal requirement to do so under the Education and Inspections Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.364W.5/4">Ofsted reported in 2003 that most schools make good use of DfES anti-bullying guidance, and use the materials to raise staff awareness, revisit anti-bullying policies and strengthen their procedures. Our current overarching guidance to schools on tackling bullying, &quot;Don't Suffer in Silence&quot; was externally evaluated by researchers from Goldsmiths College London in 2003, who found that the pack met schools' expectations and helped in drawing up their anti-bullying policies.</p>

	<p pid="b.365W.5/1">The hon. Gentleman's questions refer to an &quot;Eco-Schools&quot; programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.365W.5/2">The only Eco-Schools programme that we are aware of is one for existing schools which results in three levels of award to acknowledge increasing levels of pupil involvement in a range of environmental issues. The Department is not involved in running this Eco-Schools programme<sup>(1.)</sup></p>
	<p pid="b.365W.5/3">The Department and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) have, however, been involved in discussions with manufacturers, suppliers and installers of roof-mounted microgeneration technologies. The DTI has also recently made grant funding available for the installation of these technologies in existing schools within the Low Carbon Buildings Programme<sup>(2)</sup>. In addition, it is already a requirement of Building Regulations that all new school buildings over 1,000 m<sup>(2)</sup> in area should consider the use of microgeneration and some regional and local planning policies require new schools of this size to install on-site renewable energy to supply a proportion (typically 10 per cent.) of the predicted building's energy load. Furthermore, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-10">10 April</phrase> this year the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced that:</p>
	<p pid="b.365W.5/4" class="indent">&quot;We're already rebuilding and refurbishing every Secondary School in the country and, as part of this programme, we will put &pound;110 million over the next three years to test a bold aim&mdash;even higher standards for new and refurbished schools to reduce their carbon emissions, in some cases up to carbon neutrality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.365W.5/5">DfES has made it a condition of funding for our capital programmes that &quot;BREEAM Schools<sup>(3)</sup>&quot; assessments are carried out for all major new and refurbishment projects above a certain size. &quot;BREEAM Schools&quot; awards credits for good environmental practices of contractors and good environmental performance of building elements, including roofs. DfES and CIRIA have also recently produced a guide &quot;Sustainable Water Management in Schools&quot; which encourages designers to use eco-friendly roofs to harvest rainwater.</p>

	<p pid="b.366W.5/1">Singing is an integral part of the National Curriculum for Music from Key Stages 1 to 3. At each stage teachers are required to introduce a range of music from different times and cultures. It is for schools to decide whether singing the National Anthem will meet the needs of their pupils in respect of the requirements for Music. Learning about the national anthem may also be included in Citizenship which became statutory for 11-16 year olds in September 2002.</p>

	<p pid="b.369W.5/1">In preparing for the secondary curriculum review the QCA considered evidence from research and reports into effective teaching produced by: Ofsted; various specialist subject and professional associations; national agencies, such as national strategies; and others. Documents containing evidence on the principles of effective teaching are available on the websites of each of these organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/2">In the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1575W, on secondary education: curriculum, 10 specific principles of effective learning were referenced. The 10 principles are that:</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/3" class="indent">students learn more when they are engaged actively during an instructional task;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/4" class="indent">high success rates (and to a less certain extent, moderate success rates) are correlated positively with student learning outcomes and low success rates are correlated negatively with student learning outcomes;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/5" class="indent">increased opportunity to learn content is correlated. positively with increased student achievement. Therefore the more content covered, the greater the potential for student learning;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/6" class="indent">students achieve more in classes in which they spend much of their time being directly taught or supervised by their teacher. In general, teacher instructional time that is spent with large groups is correlated positively with student achievement;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/7" class="indent">students can become independent, self-regulated learners through instruction that is deliberately and carefully scaffolded;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/8" class="indent">the critical forms of knowledge associated with strategic learning are (a) declarative knowledge, (b) procedural knowledge, and (c) conditional knowledge. Each of these must be addressed if students are to become independent, self-regulated learners;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/9" class="indent">learning is increased when teaching is presented in a manner that assists students in organising, storing and retrieving knowledge;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/10" class="indent">students can become more independent, self-regulated learners through strategic instruction;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/11" class="indent">students can become independent, self-regulated learners through instruction that is explicit;</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/12" class="indent">by teaching sameness both within and across subjects, teachers promote the ability of students to access potentially relevant knowledge in novel problem-solving situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.5/13">The document containing these principles, by Ellis, E.S., Worthington., L. A. and Larkin, MJ. (1996) is entitled &quot;Research synthesis on effective teaching principles and the design of quality tools&quot;. It is produced by the Worthington National Centre to Improve the Tools of Educators.</p>

	<p pid="b.372W.0/1">The following table gives the number and proportion of <i> (a)</i>16, <i> (b)</i> 17 and <i> (c)</i> 18 year olds not in education, employment or training by local authority in England, for December 2005 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.0/2">Data are drawn from the operational client management systems maintained by Connexions services. They only include those people known to the service (about 85 per cent. of the population); some young people who attended independent schools or were at school outside England are excluded. The age relates to those of calendar year age 16-18 on the date of measurement. Data are only available at the local authority level from 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.0/3">These NEET measures are those used for setting and monitoring local authority NEET targets. The definition differs from that used to measure the national departmental PSA NEET target. Along with not covering the entire population, the Connexions NEET measure excludes those on gap years, those in custody and those undertaking voluntary work. The PSA measure is for academic rather than calendar age 16-18.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.0/4">It is estimated that 220,000 (11 per cent.) 16 to 18 year olds were not in education, employment or training (NEET) at the end of 2005. Not all of these young people are out of work&mdash;the figures include young people taking a break from study, caring for families, or simply between jobs or courses. Annual surveys carried out on a group of young people at ages 16, 17 and 18 found that nearly 20 per cent. were NEET at one of the three survey dates, while only around 1 per cent. were NEET at each of the three survey points.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.0/5">Record numbers of 16 year olds are in full-time education. But, we recognise the need to take action to reduce the proportion of young people not in any form of education, employment or training, and have set ourselves a very challenging target to get the proportion down to 8 per cent. by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.0/6">Our 14-19 reforms are vital: the implementation plan makes a commitment to make an offer of learning to every young person after they complete year 11. They also give us the platform for agencies working with young people to plan and develop learning and employment opportunities that meet local needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.0/7">To keep them in learning, we need to help them tackle the other issues in their lives that might cause them to leave, which we are doing through our Every Child Matters reforms.</p>

	<p pid="b.383W.8/1">A completed application to register the Colchester Native Oyster was received in 2005. Since then, the application has been subject to a lengthy consultation process which provides interested parties within the UK with the opportunity to comment or object to the application. This consultation is necessary to ensure that all views are considered before a decision is taken by DEFRA on whether the application is justified and meets the requirements of the relevant Regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.8/2">The consultation process prompted a number of objections to, and comments on, the application. Officials have been giving detailed consideration to these representations and have been working closely with the applicants to address them. A meeting earlier this month, between officials and representatives of the applicant group, discussed some final outstanding points relating to the product specification for the Colchester Native Oyster. Following this constructive meeting, an announcement about the next stage of this process is expected to be made within the next month.</p>

	<p pid="b.384W.0/1">Following the Bonn Agreement in 2001, Germany assumed lead nation status for the police sector. The German police training project has trained approximately 17,000 Afghan national police personnel, including around 4,000 commissioned and non-commissioned officers. It is our view that the training provided by the German Government has been effective, professional and sustainable. This has provided the Afghans with a sound foundation that will help deliver a police force with a thorough background in a range of policing activities in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.384W.0/2">The German police training will become part of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) mission from June. The ESDP policing mission is an EU and international programme that aims to contribute to a joint international strategy for police reform.</p>

	<p pid="b.397W.5/1">The United Kingdom's priority for the Preparatory Committee is establishing the basis for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and the wider nuclear non-proliferation regime over the course of this review cycle. There are a number of specific issues on which useful work could be undertaken, many of which were set out in the EU Common Position agreed for the 2005 Review Conference and remain outstanding. It will be important to build consensus on these areas, and any new workstreams, in this and future Preparatory Committees. We hope that this process will culminate in a substantive final document being agreed at the 2010 NPT Review Conference.</p>

	<p pid="b.398W.11/1">A broad base of support within Somalia's complex clan structure is crucial to a lasting peace in Somalia. Therefore, it is vital that the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) reaches out to all the clans and lends a fully inclusive political process. We are stressing this in our contacts with the TFG, for example when my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, met President Yusuf in London on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>. We are urging the TFG to convene as soon as possible the National Reconciliation Congress, to involve all clans. We are encouraging other members of the international community to do likewise and we strongly endorse the Communiqu&eacute; of <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April</phrase> from the International Contact Group on Somalia, of which the UK is member.

	<p pid="b.407W.5/1">The national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease published in March 2000 sets the standard that people thought to be suffering from heart attack should be given thrombolysis (treatment with clotbusting drugs) within 60 minutes of calling for professional help. Where the journey time to hospital is routinely more than 30 minutes, the NSF states that other models of treatment should be considered, for example pre-hospital thrombolysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.407W.5/2">Angioplasty given as an emergency treatment (known as primary angioplasty) is developing as an alternative treatment to thrombolysis in some cardiac centres. No guidance has been issued on safe travelling times to receive primary angioplasty. Current evidence is that this technique leads to improved outcomes compared to thrombolysis, even if performed up to three hours from time of call for help.</p>

	<p pid="b.412W.2/1">Primary care and national health service trust drugs budgets are not determined centrally. From the inception of primary care trusts in 1999-2000, trusts are responsible for setting their own budgets; decisions on the level of funding will depend on local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.412W.2/2">The table gives the total drugs bill since 1990-91, and is broken down by primary care and the hospital and community health service (HCHS).</p>
	<p pid="b.412W.2/3">The Department does not publish the drugs bill on a per capita basis. The per capita figures shown have been derived from Office National Statistics mid-year total population estimates for England, and do not take into account age related demand for drugs.</p>

	<p pid="b.418W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/2">A key element of the national programme for information technology is delivery of a national summary care record. The first phase of this service will allow a summary of information held on general practitioners' systems to be uploaded to a national database to allow other clinicians to view it. Information is loaded onto the database from different systems via a transaction messaging system, which processes and routes data messages. Introduction of the summary care record has now begun at so-called early adopter sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/3">In the first instance it is expected that the service will be predominantly of use in unscheduled care settings where knowledge of allergies, medicines and major diagnoses will improve patient care and safeguard patient safety. It is expected that the service will be extended in due course to include information from other care settings. Implementation and the future development of the summary care record will be overseen by an advisory group, including clinical, patient and manager stakeholders, chaired by Professor Martin Marshall, the Department's Deputy Chief Medical Officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/4">The systems which will enable clinicians to access and use the care records service are being delivered by the national programme's local service providers (LSPs). Each of the LSPs has a portfolio of products that cover different care settings and specialities. It is the LSPs' responsibility to integrate their products with each other, and with the central services such as the summary care record, the personal demographic service that provides a single authoritative source of patient demographic data, and the access control framework, which registers and authenticates users. The purpose of these integration requirements is to underpin the creation of a coherent and consistent national information service.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/5">This is being implemented using the worlds first HL7 V3 enterprise solution (HL7 V3 is an international health messaging standard). The messages that support the integration of systems flow through the central spine database. The spine is the colloquial name given to the national database of key information about patients' health and care. It forms the core of the national health service care records service (NHS CRS). The spine currently deals with well in excess of 40 million messages a month and supports around 350,000 registered users, some 50,000 of whom access the system on a typical day, with a peak of over 20,000 users authenticating to the system in a single hour. This is in marked contrast with the previous situation in the NHS which was characterised by huge diversity and an inability to communicate information between systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/6">The NHS CRS will provide an integrated national service for all NHS clinical applications, with consequent improvements in patients' safety, care and experience, and the efficiency of the service as a whole. This is being delivered by providing an overarching information strategy that allows the portfolio of systems from the local service providers and the existing systems providers to be integrated into a coherent service. The clear evidence that this approach is proving effective is that 102 systems have been through the compliance programmes, creating a level of systems interoperability that was unimaginable three years ago.</p>

	<p pid="b.419W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.419W.2/2">Information from different suppliers is integrated in the new national health service information technology systems by having an agreed set of messages and interaction sequences to permit communication between systems. This set of messages and interaction sequences has been created by the Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency in the form of the Message Implementation Manual (MIM). They are defined using an international standard called HL7 version 3. NHS Connecting for Health has been a lead participant in the development of this standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.419W.2/3">The national application service provider for the NHS care records service (NHS CRS) uses the MIM to create a more detailed specification called the external integration specification. Local service providers use this specification to develop their systems, which are tested for conformity to it in NHS Connecting for Health's national integration centre (NIC). The NIC is staffed by NHS Connecting for Health's technical assurance team and testing teams from each of the suppliers. The assurance team is responsible for ensuring that suppliers' products and services can be implemented on both a national and local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.419W.2/4">The NHS CRS will provide an integrated national service for all NHS clinical applications, with consequent improvements in patients' safety, care and experience, and the efficiency of the service as a whole. This is being delivered by providing an overarching information strategy that allows the portfolio of systems from the local service providers and the existing systems providers to be integrated into a coherent service. The clear evidence that this approach is proving effective is that 102 systems have been through the compliance programmes, creating a level of systems interoperability that was unimaginable three years ago.</p>

	<p pid="b.422W.5/1">All primary care trusts (PCTs) have, within the last year, gone through the Fitness for Purpose assessment, which assessed the short-term risks of PCTs failing to meet their objectives in finance, strategy and other areas. PCTs also underwent a commissioning diagnostic, designed to identify gaps in their capabilities and enable them to create a focused improvement programme.

	<p pid="b.426W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/2">There are 13 approved premises in London, nine managed by the London Probation Board and four by voluntary sector providers. Collectively they provide a total of 311 bed spaces. The number of beds at each approved premises varies. The largest (Westbourne House) has 41 bed spaces, the smallest (Haling) has 18. In the board-managed sector, there are five assistant managers employed at each approved premises, making a total of 45 in all; seven of those posts are currently vacant. Across the four voluntary-managed premises there are 18 assistant manager posts, of which one is currently vacant.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/3">London Probation Board has, over the course of many years, built a significant pool of relief staff, who are used across the estate to provide cover for annual leave, sickness and training. All relief staff are CRB checked, required to undertake a 'shadow' shift before commencing their duties, and expected to complete the area's core approved premises training programme. A full list of relief staff is held by the London Probation HR Department, and only staff on the list are offered work. The number employed at each approved premises will vary over time as dictated by the need for cover. Similarly, each of the voluntary sector providers has a pool of relief staff on which they can draw to cover short-term gaps in staffing.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/4">The London Probation Board has engaged the services of a private security firm to provide one member of staff at each approved premises between the hours of 9pm and 9am. The security staff work alongside board-employed staff. The board employees act in effect as shift leaders, and are responsible for managing the residents, including enforcement action. They are responsible also for liaison with the standby manager, or the on-call assistant chief officer, in the case of an emergency. The role of the security staff is to provide additional waking cover during the night. Their tasks include CCTV monitoring, undertaking routine patrols of the building, and supporting the board employees in carrying out their duties. None of the voluntary sector providers currently use private security staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/5">The staff establishment at each approved premises managed by the London Probation Board (with the exception of Westbourne House) is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/6" class="indent">one manager</p>

There are a number of subject sample profiles loaded in each financial year for which the date of birth and also therefore the age on load is unknown.<br/> 3. The age figures should be treated with caution as there are some data quality issues relating to the recording of dates of birth on the Police National Computer (PNC) by arresting police officers. Key demographic data such as the DOB data are transferred electronically from the PNC to NDNAD.<br/> 4. There are 37,804 subject sample profile records on the database for which there is no record of the financial year when they were loaded to the NDNAD. These records have not been included in the count.<br/> 5. The figures given are the numbers of DNA subject sample profiles added to the NDNAD. There are more DNA profiles held on the NDNAD than there are individuals due to DNA samples being taken from some individuals on more than one occasion (i.e. due to replicate sampling). A study into the rate of replication on the NDNAD was first carried out in 2003. Using the rate of replication, it is possible to estimate the number of individuals on the database from the number of profiles. However, as the replication rate before 2003 is unknown, to ensure consistency, the data given are the number of profiles and not individuals. The estimated rate of replication on the database for the years since 2003 is as follows:<br/> The estimated replication rate for financial year 2003-04 was 10 per cent.<br/> The estimated replication rate for financial year 2004-05 was 10 per cent.<br/> The estimated replication rate for financial year 2005-06 was 11 per cent.<br/> The estimated replication rate for the end of financial year 2006-07 was 13.7 per cent.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.437W.11/2">Prison Service Order 1810 on 'Maintaining Order in Prisons' was introduced in July 2005. It requires the individual case management of disruptive prisoners and the transfer of key information from sending to receiving prisons when any individual is transferred between prisons and segregation units. It also stopped the informal transfer or return arrangements between establishments. The Prison Service launched a Segregation Unit Development Strategy in January 2005, which aimed to ensure that prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm are managed and supported outside of segregation if at all possible. There is also a review under way of all segregation policies. This includes specialist input from the National Offender Management Service, Prisoner Health, and the Prison and Probation Ombudsman and seeks to develop new strategies in relation to mental health care and alternatives to segregation.</p>

	<p pid="b.438W.2/2">No drug testing system is entirely foolproof but the mandatory drug testing policy and procedures of the National Offender Management Service are fully in line with best practice and are designed to reduce to a minimum the possibility that the process can be compromised. A robust system is in place to provide checks and balances and good management oversight including:</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/3" class="indent">rigorous chain of custody procedures;</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/4" class="indent">rigorous laboratory procedures;</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/5" class="indent">monitoring by Area Drug Co-ordinators during routine visits to prisons;</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/6" class="indent">Prison Service Standard Audits and a self-audit programme at establishment level to monitor performance against the Drug Strategy Standard 10&mdash;which requires prisons to conduct mandatory testing in line with the requirements of Prison Service Order 3 601 (Mandatory Drug Testing);</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/7" class="indent">Internal Audit review; and</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/8" class="indent">an independent Quality Assurance adviser who monitors the efficacy of the contracted drug testing laboratory on behalf of NOMS.</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/9">An assessment of the extent of the risks identified is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/10" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> use of false samples&mdash;the procedures for collecting samples are designed to minimise the risk of adulteration, dilution or the provision of a false sample. Research published by the Office for National Statistics in 2005 reported that around 3 per cent. of those prisoners tested admitted to an attempt to subvert the MDT process. In 2005-06 the laboratory reported suspicions about less than 1 per cent. of samples. Attempts to compromise MDT samples rarely prevent the detection of drugs;</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/11" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> refrigeration stabilises samples and maximises the ability to detect drugs. Lack of refrigeration is however unlikely to affect significantly the ability to detect the majority of drugs;</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/12" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> inadequate supervision in the collection of samples&mdash;a Prison Service Internal Audit conducted in 2006 found that establishments were collecting samples correctly;</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/13" class="indent"><i> (d)</i> collusion&mdash;the Prison Service Professional Standards Unit has responsibility for tackling staff corruption in conjunction with professional standards' managers working at area and local level. There is no evidence that collusion in relation to drug tests is widespread; and</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/14" class="indent"><i> (e)</i> administrative errors&mdash;a Prison Service Internal Audit conducted in 2006 identified some minor administrative errors but found that they did not affect the validity of the tests. Prisons were reminded of the need to follow good administrative practice.</p>

If the complainant remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to complain to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Prisoners held in privately-managed prisons who claim to have suffered mistreatment on non-medical issue are able to complain using the usual complaints process.

	<p pid="b.439W.8/2">Information for England and Wales on the completion rates for the main types of community sentence, for each year since 1995, can be found in Table 5.1 of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin: Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2005, a copy of which can be found in the House of Commons Library. Information on the number of offenders recalled to prison for breaching their licence conditions can be found in Tables 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 of the same publication. The reliability of those data at local area level is not sufficiently robust for publication. Generally, compliance and rigorous enforcement are essential if community sentences and licence supervision are to provide an effective punishment and deterrent, in which the public has confidence. The latest performance figures for the National Probation Service (covering April 2006&mdash;February 2007) indicate that 92 per cent. of relevant offenders have enforcement action initiated within 10 working days as required by National Standards; in 1999 it was just 44 per cent. Since 2002-03 the service has also been measured against a compliance target, which measures the proportion of orders and licences that reach the six months stage without requiring breach action. On this basis compliance has improved from 62 per cent. in 2002-03 to 72 per cent. in 2006-07 (April 2006&mdash;February 2007).</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.8/2">A research study carried out by the Home Office into prisoners received into prisons in England and Wales under indeterminate sentences for public protection (IPP) between April 2005 and March 2006, showed that the median tariff (minimum term) given to these prisoners was 30 months. Findings from the research were published in Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2005, a copy of which can be found in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.441W.8/2">A draft European framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia has been discussed over several years, including at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in spring 2003 and summer 2005. Agreement was not reached on either occasion. Negotiations restarted under the German presidency of the European Union, and a revised draft framework decision was discussed at the JHA Council in February 2007. A general approach was reached at the JHA Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-19">19 April 2007</phrase>. UK Ministers participated in all of these discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.8/3">This framework decision is not a European Union wide law on holocaust denial. It requires member states to criminalise the most serious racist and xenophobic acts where they are carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred and are threatening, abusive or insulting. Under our existing domestic law, this would only include denial of the Holocaust where it met all of these conditions. The framework decision sets a common EU standard for the most serious crimes but does not prevent member states from making other acts, including holocaust denial, criminal offences under their domestic law.</p>

In this form, they do not need special pumps or storage facilities: they are dispensed via standard petrol and diesel pumps, and motorists will not generally be aware that the fuel they are buying contains a small amount of biofuel. By 2010, we expect that the Government's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) will mean that the great majority of petrol and diesel sold in the UK will contain up to 5 per cent. biofuel.</p>

	<p pid="b.459W.2/1">Since 1998, the new deal has helped over 1.6 million people to find jobs, and contributed to a fall in the number of young people claiming jobseeker's allowance for more than six months from over 174,000 in April 1997 to 53,800 in February 2007. Independent research has shown the new deal for young people's positive impact on the economy, with estimated benefits to the economy of up to &pound;500 million a year.</p>

	<p pid="b.466W.5/1">In developing our employment programs and formulating our strategy for reducing child poverty, the Department for Work and Pensions has worked closely with a range of partners. As stated in the Working for Children report, it is important that we continue to do so. In addition to regular ministerial meetings with stakeholders, current and ongoing engagement takes places through: six-monthly meetings between officials and the largest of the child poverty stakeholder groups including, the Child Poverty Action Group, One Parent Families, Save the Children, Barnardo's and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation; the Child Poverty Accord, an agreement between The Local Government Association and Central Government Departments&mdash;DWP (and its Agencies), Department for Education and Skills, HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs&mdash;to work together to tackle child poverty. The Accord partners will continue to work with local authorities to develop anti-poverty strategies; the City Strategy which will play a significant role in increasing local employment rates, ensuring those most disadvantaged in the labour market can receive the help and guidance they need. It will bring together the public, private and voluntary sectors into a concerted local programme to improve the way support for individual jobless people is co-ordinated and delivered on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="b.466W.8/1">The Voice Risk Analysis software which the Department intends to test is a risk assessment process. It analyses micro physiological changes to a caller's voice and combines this analysis with a number of other techniques to provide an indication of the level of confidence that can be attached to answers to questions. It will not by itself be used to determine entitlement to benefit, but to identify which claims can be paid quickly or which may need further examination and supporting verification. The technique does not require the customer to be physically present. In contrast lie detectors require a customer presence and rely on measuring a range of involuntary physiological factors such as heart rate; blood pressure and respiration.</p>
