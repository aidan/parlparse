Defra does not build defences, direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake nor in general specify the materials and techniques to be used.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.0/2">The Government encourage authorities to consider a variety of options when considering solutions. A key point is that authorities should work with natural processes wherever possible and the use of beaches to absorb wave energy is a widely used soft&quot; technique. However, Defra does not hold information centrally on the various other techniques that might be in use and I regret that I cannot answer the question in more detail without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.196W.9/1">I understand the Environment Agency is responsible for 0.5 km of flood defence at Sizewell Village. This is dune with good beach, and stable at present. The shoreline management plan has a hold the line&quot; policy for this frontage.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.9/2">The power station is protected to a 1:10,000 standard. That is, it is protected against all events except those with a probability of occurrence in any one year of less than 1 in 10,000. I understand British Energy owns this defence and has regular liaison meetings with the agency. The environmental risks associated with the site flooding dictate that the defences must remain viable until such time as the site is deemed safe.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.9/3">North of the power station to Minsmere cliffs is an Environment Agency responsibility and defences are the subject of the current Minsmere sea defence study. Re-alignment of defences is a possibility in 60 to 100 years on current erosion rates. Present standards of defence range from 1:2&ndash;10 to 1:200. Residual life is currently considered to be between 25 years and 1,000 years for different sections. There are secondary defences in place for the defences of lower standard which provide a minimum of 40 to 60 years residual life.</p>

	<p pid="c.199W.5/2">Under existing EU law, in order to declare a GM-free zone, that is a region where GM crops cannot be cultivated, a member state has to prove that there are special reasons to introduce national measures. Austria applied for a derogation from Directive 2001/18/EC to declare the region of Upper Austria a GM-free zone. However, the European Court of Justice ruled against this measure, as the Austrian Government failed to prove that the region of' Upper Austria had a unique ecosystem which might justify a specific local risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.199W.5/3">EU law, as agreed by EU member states, sets out procedures which allow an individual GM crop to be approved for cultivation throughout the whole of the EU only if a detailed assessment confirms that it does not pose an unacceptable risk to health or the environment. Under current EU law, as agreed by EU member states, the only legitimate grounds for narrowing the geographical scope of an approval to prevent cultivation in a defined zone are the production of clear evidence that the GM crop involved poses a particular risk to the specific area in question. In the Austrian case, the European Court of Justice found that Austria had not demonstrated the existence of any such risks to the region of Upper Austria.</p>

	<p pid="c.201W.9/1">We have recently announced a further &pound;2 million of funding for the implementation of the Government's Regional Food Strategy. Currently, Food from Britain (FFB) are delivering, on behalf of and funded by Defra, the final year of a three-year national programme of support for the quality regional food sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.201W.9/2">The &pound;1 million a year funding has supported a raft of measures to strengthen the sector, including tasking the Regional Food Groups to encourage uptake of the Protected Food Names Schemes, which has resulted in a number of new applications to protect our regionally distinct food. In May, FFB organised a Protected Food Name Scheme seminar to bring together producers and key stakeholders with the objective of educating, informing and stimulating further uptake of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.201W.9/3">I am pleased to say that all this effort is yielding some positive results. To date, 36 UK products have been registered so far including Stilton Cheese, Cornish Clotted Cream and West Country Farmhouse Cheddar. A further 21 applications are being considered. Although this is lower than some of the southern European member states who have a much longer tradition of using geographical indications and, arguably, a structure and culture of production more attuned to their protection, it does compare well with quite a number of other member states.</p>

	<p pid="c.204W.2/1">The UK, together with other EU and G8 countries, has been working on solutions to the problems of illegal logging and the associated trade in illegally harvested timber for several years. This work, much of it supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DFID), has sought to understand the severity and scale of the problem, and also the consequences of possible solutions in order to inform policy development. Most relevant research is displayed on the independent website run by the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House and supported by the Department for International Development (DFID): <a href="http://www.illegal-logging.info">www.illegal-logging.info</a></p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/2">Some examples of recent research are illustrated as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/3" class="italic">(i) International Forests</p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/4">It is difficult to make exact measurements of the scale of illegal logging and estimates must be based on indirect data. The Government have therefore contributed to an international study on discrepancies in trade statistics, co-ordinated by the International Tropical Timber Organisation, as well as specific studies of the scale of illegal logging in Indonesia and NW Russia. These studies combined trade data with techniques such as remote sensing, and have also looked at the consequences of illegal logging for the economies of the countries concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/5">The Government have also led on research to evaluate potential solutions. These studies have looked at the compliance with WTO rules of possible trade measures, the applicability of anti-money laundering legislation, and the role of improved due diligence by the financial community in evaluating forest sector investments. Studies of the impacts on markets of measures currently being implemented to tackle the problem, for example the UK's public timber procurement policy, are currently under way&mdash;and these indicate that our policies are effective, not only in changing the market here, but also in improving enforcement in timber producing countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/6" class="italic">(ii) Wildlife</p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/7">The Government are committed to achieving the international biodiversity target to 'significantly reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010' which was agreed by heads of state at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/8">The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs funds a range of forestry projects under the Darwin Initiative many of which include monitoring of forest habitat. Defra has also recently commissioned a new research project to investigate the impacts of UK consumption internationally. The first stage of the project will cover aspects of habitat destruction, including illegal logging, as part of the wider evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="c.204W.2/9">(iii) Finally, in terms of measuring the impacts of illegal logging on local communities the Department for International Development (DFID) is also supporting an international research project on the impacts of illegal logging and of measures to enforce existing laws on poor people in several countries. Preliminary results indicate that, in some cases, current laws may actually discriminate against poor forest-dependent communities and legislative reform must go hand-in-hand with better enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="c.205W.5/1">The UK's programme to tackle illegal logging relies on close co-operation between a number of Government Departments including the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.205W.5/2">Recent discussions between the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for International Development have included, co-hosting a joint meeting of G8 Environment and Development Ministers on 17&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-18">18 March</phrase>. G8 Ministers agreed a range of actions to tackle illegal logging&mdash;both through working with timber producing countries to promote alternatives to illegal timber felling and, as major timber consumers to tackle their consumption of illegally logged timber.</p>
	<p pid="c.205W.5/3">The Departments also work together closely on the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) dossier. This will allow the EU to enter into agreements with poor timber producing countries providing them with assistance to tackle illegal logging. This assistance will include a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU, which will be reinforced by powers for Customs to deny access to unlicensed products from partner countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.209W.0/2">My Department has issued two guidance documents for all local authority education departments, schools (including independent schools) and FE colleges in England. Safeguarding Children in Education&quot;, explains the duty, roles and responsibilities placed upon them by sections 157 and 175 of the Education Act 2002 to carry out their functions with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. Safeguarding Children: Safer Recruitment and Selection in Education Settings&quot; underpins on-line training introduced in response to Sir Michael Bichard's recommendation that head teachers and school governors should receive training to ensure that the process of appointing staff reflects the importance of safeguarding children.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.0/3">Guidance on what action practitioners, including those in the education service, should take if they have concerns that a child is being, or is at risk of being, abused is contained in 'What To Do If You're Worried A Child Is Being Abused&quot;. In addition, Child Protection: Preventing Unsuitable People from Working with Children and Young Persons in the Education Service&quot; sets out the circumstances under which people may be reported to the Secretary of State on grounds of misconduct.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.0/4">The Government take the issue of child welfare and safety very seriously. We believe we need to make safeguarding everyone's business. Encouraging all organisations to have good systems and clear guidance in place forms a vital part of this. Local and national guidance for safeguarding and promoting welfare of children is based upon the provisions set out in the Children Act 1989 and the Children Act 2004. We are currently consulting on the Government's main guidance 'Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; which sets out the overarching systems and roles that different agencies play in keeping children safe.</p>

	<p pid="c.210W.2/1">The Government's principal role is in increasing awareness of child abuse among people who work with children. Our guidance documents, 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' and 'What To Do If You're Worried A Child Is Being Abused' set out the roles and responsibilities of practitioners who work with children to promote children's welfare and safeguard them from harm. A range of voluntary organisations, including the NSPCC and ChildLine, play a vital role in increasing public awareness of child abuse.</p>

	<p pid="c.210W.5/1">In January 2005, 1.2 per cent. of all key stage 1 classes had more than 30 pupils in them. In January 1997 the comparable figure was 29.0 per cent. and in January 2001 it was 2.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.210W.5/2">The majority of key stage 1 classes over 30 have exceeded the statutory limit to accommodate permitted exceptions, such as children who move into an area after the start of term who would have a long journey to the next school with places available. However, my officials are contacting local authorities to discuss those classes which are illegally large, to ensure that the required measures are taken to reduce them.</p>

	<p pid="c.211W.2/1">The Government are committed to increasing the amount of physical education and sport in schools. This includes competitive team games such as cricket.</p>
	<p pid="c.211W.2/2">Cricket may be taught to pupils in schools as part of the programme of study for games activities within National Curriculum PE. Games activities must be taught to all pupils in key stages 1&ndash;3 (age 5&ndash;14) and are optional at key stage 4 (age 14&ndash;16).</p>
	<p pid="c.211W.2/3">We have made cricket one of 22 key sports within the School Club Links workstrand of our National Strategy for PE and School Sport.

	<p pid="c.211W.2/4">The 2004/05 PE and School Sport Survey of schools in School Sport Partnerships found that cricket was the second most popular sport (behind football) for which schools had formal links with sports clubs, with 46 per cent. of schools having links with a local cricket club. The survey also found that 85 per cent. of schools provided cricket for their pupils, either in lesson time or after school. This was the sixth most popular sport provided in schools. Copies of the results of the survey have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="c.216W.2/1">Delaying to 2025 the introduction of a normal pension age (NPA) of 65 for members of the Teachers' Pensions Scheme would not reflect Government policy or be consistent with the principles agreed at the Public Services Forum. Those principles provide for NPA 65 to be introduced for new entrants as soon as practicable; and the pension terms of existing members to be discussed in scheme specific negotiations. The estimated net present value of the savings arising from reform of the public service schemes is expected to be around &pound;13 billion over the next 50 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.2/2">Savings to the Exchequer from introducing NPA 65 from 2025 have not been estimated and could be done only at disproportionate cost. It is, however, likely that delaying the introduction of NPA 65 until 2025 would absorb a substantial part of the expected &pound;13 billion savings that will arise from the implementation of scheme reform within the framework of the principles agreed at the Public Services Forum.</p>

	<p pid="c.216W.8/1">The Government are joining forces with the travel industry in a new campaign to encourage parents to book holidays during school holiday periods. Launching in November the Every Lesson Counts&quot; campaign will see the travel industry offer discounts and other incentives, such as free child places, to families making early bookings for the school holiday periods. Early booking holiday deals will be promoted through a dedicated Every Lesson Counts&quot; website which will provide a link to ABTA, Federation of Tour Operators and Visit Britain/Enjoy England sites where their members will be able to provide details of their offers for breaks&mdash;both in England and overseas&mdash;for the winter season and summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.8/2">We recognise that supply and demand can lead to price differences in periods of peak demand. This is why we have struck this innovative partnership with the travel industry to remind parents that by booking early, families will have more choice, more opportunity to book affordable holidays and more reason to keep their children in school.</p>

However, it does have other elements to it. One of these is a mechanism which allows authorities to apply for additional top-up funding for new pupil places where they can demonstrate that they face exceptional circumstances and that their overall resources are insufficient to meet their needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.221W.5/3">The final version of the standards will begin to come into force from September 2006.</p>

The national audit, which began on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>, will cover issues such as how much is being spent on school meals ingredients, how they are provided, whether children get hot or cold meals and the percentage of pupils currently buying school meals.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.5/5">The Government are also investing &pound;220 million over three years to help schools and local education authorities transform school meals through training and increased hours for cooks, equipment and a minimum spend on ingredients.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.5/6">Some &pound;30 million for this year has already been allocated to local authorities&mdash;with a further &pound;100 million over the following two years. &pound;30 million was granted direct to schools as part of their Standards Fund allocations, with a further &pound;60 million over the following two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.5/7">New or upgraded school kitchen facilities, where fresh produce can be prepared and served, will be made a priority as Government rebuilds and refurbishes every secondary school through its Building Schools for the Future programme. &pound;5.5 billion is being spent in 2005&ndash;06 rising to &pound;6.3 billion in 2007&ndash;08 to improve school buildings.

	<p pid="c.225W.6/1">There were no incidents reported on the A5 resulting in closure but there were planned works on two sections of the A5 trunk road that weekend.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>, the Highways Agency started major reconstruction and resurfacing works on the A5 at its junction with the B4036 at Long Buckby Northampton. This involved full closure of the A5 on two successive weekends between 16 and <phrase class="date" code="">19 September</phrase> and between 23 and <phrase class="date" code="">26 September</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.225W.6/3">There were also overnight closures on the westbound carriageway of the A5 near the Motor Institution Research Agency, in Nuneaton. On the weekend identified the closures operated between 20:00hrs and 06:00hrs on <phrase class="date" code="">Saturday 17 September</phrase> and on <phrase class="date" code="">Sunday 18 September</phrase>. The road reopened to traffic at 06:00hrs on <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 19 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.6/4">The A5 was closed on each occasion by means of a Temporary Traffic Regulation Order issued under the authority of the Secretary Of State for Transport.

	<p pid="c.234W.2/1">GNER's Franchise Agreement contains a number of measures whereby the Department for Transport is able to monitor both the qualitative and quantitative delivery of services. GNER's obligations include targets for the number of minutes delay caused to passengers as well as the number of services cancelled. GNER also has a punctuality target for 90 per cent. of services to arrive within 10 minutes by <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>. The quality of GNER's service is measured predominantly through a Service Quality regime, whereby its stations, trains and depots are periodically surveyed to ensure that standards are being maintained. The quality of its delivery is also reviewed and benchmarked twice a year as part of the industry-wide National Passenger Survey.</p>

A further &pound;50 million was provided in 2003&ndash;04 to fund the entitlement for men aged 60&ndash;64. The Government will provide an extra &pound;350 million in 2006&ndash;07 to fund the cost to local authorities of the improvement in the statutory minimum entitlement from half to free-fares.

	<p pid="c.240W.8/1">The Cabinet Office does not collect information on individual departments' spending on e-Government. However recent research by Kable indicates that &pound;14 billion per annum is spent on information technology (IT) across the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.240W.8/2">The Spending Review 2004 (SR04) reported that significant investment in information communication technology (ICT) in both central and local government is streamlining the delivery of services to the public, cutting transaction costs and reducing paperwork.

	<p pid="c.241W.2/1">Since the civil service strategy was launched in 2001, all main government departments, as well as many small departments, agencies and non departmental public bodies (NDPBs), have developed action plans for implementation of the strategy. Departments have made significant progress against these action plans, including: embedding skills for life training in in-house courses; developing specific literacy and numeracy courses and working with unions, through union learning representatives, to support staff. The Ministry of Defence Civil Service in Northern Ireland has recently won a national training award for their skills for life activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/2">The Cabinet Office, in its corporate work, has continued to work closely with Department for Education and Science (DfES) to support departments in implementation of the strategy. In addition, Cabinet Office as employer has addressed the strategy and taken action including providing information on an internal website; providing advice and support to staff; and the distribution of marketing materials and literature to raise awareness.</p>

	<p pid="c.244W.9/2">My Department works actively to promote both domestic and inbound tourism in England. At a national level, marketing and other work to promote tourism in England is overseen by the England Marketing Advisory Board, which advises on the use of grant in aid funding from my Department to VisitBritain for that purpose. Such funding will total &pound;12.9 million this year, and is included in VisitBritain's total allocation of &pound;49.05 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.244W.9/3">I have informed VisitBritain, and the Advisory Board, that my priority for tourism in England is EnglandNet, which will shortly be fully operational as a single marketing and information platform for internet users. The EnglandNet system allows users in the UK and overseas to access destination information at national, regional and local levels, and acts as a portal to the booking facilities offered by approved commercial operators. It has the full support of the Regional Development Agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.244W.9/4">With the involvement of the Advisory Board, VisitBritain runs a number of high profile, England-specific marketing campaigns each year. Recent campaigns have included Waterside England and Outdoor England. These campaigns are taken forward within Great Britain to promote visits to England and, following VisitBritain's recent re-organisation of its overseas activities, in the Irish, French, German, and Dutch markets.</p>

There is no direct relationship between the revaluation and the overall amount of tax revenue. That is determined by the budgets set by local authorities in the context of grants made available by the Assembly Government. There was a 9.5 per cent. increase in tax revenue in 2005&ndash;06 because of the budget decisions of local authorities. This is in line with the increase in tax revenue in previous years.</p>

	<p pid="c.257W.6/1">The 2004 Health Development Agency's publication, The Smoking Epidemic in England&quot; estimated that eight out of 10 female lung cancer deaths are smoking attributable. The best way to reduce the incidence of lung cancer in women is to persuade them to give up smoking.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.6/2">Since 1998, the Government have put in place a comprehensive strategy to tackle smoking to reduce the deaths caused by smoking. The strategy focuses on action to discourage people from ever starting and help for all smokers, of whatever age and sex, to quit. We are aiming to create a climate where non-smoking is the norm.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.6/3">We have banned almost all tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion. Our highly effective national anti-smoking education campaign is designed to reach all. People who wish to give up smoking can get help from the national health service stop smoking services. In 2004&ndash;05, 57 per cent. of people accessing the NHS Stop Smoking Services were women. We set out proposals to bring in new measures to improve the way the NHS helps smokers to give up in our White Paper, Choosing Health&quot;. We will reduce exposure to second hand smoke and, through a staged approach, make almost all enclosed public places and workplaces smoke-free. In addition, this year we ran an education campaign on the impact of smoking targeted at young women.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.6/4">Together this strategy has helped reduce smoking rates in women in England from 26 per cent. in 1998 to 24 per cent. in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.264W.3/1">Information on the estimated cost of the decision by Devon and Cornwall primary care trusts (PCTs) to fund Herceptin for early stage breast cancer is not collected centrally. We are already putting record amounts of new investment into the national health service&mdash;between 2003 and 2008 NHS expenditure in England will increase on average by 7.5 per cent. each year. It is for PCTs to decide how best to spend these resources taking into account local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.3/2">PCTs have many competing priorities but cancer is a national and local priority. Every PCT will have a sizeable number of people in their area who will be diagnosed with the disease each year. PCTs will need to ensure that they allocate sufficient resource to meet their local contribution to tackling cancer care or other areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.3/3">It may be appropriate in some circumstances for patients to be prescribed an unlicensed drug such as Herceptin. However, this should be the exception and not the rule because the licensing process is there to protect patient safety. Such decisions need to be taken following discussions with patients to ensure they are aware of the potential risks.</p>

	<p pid="c.272W.8/2">The Government aim to reach pregnant smokers through the ongoing partners&quot; education campaign, which provides information about smoking, the benefits to the health of both mother and baby in quitting, and how partners and families can provide support.</p>
	<p pid="c.272W.8/3">The national health service stop smoking services were allocated an additional &pound;6 million in 2001&ndash;02 to 2002&ndash;03 to target smoking in pregnancy and to provide specialist advisers to help pregnant smokers to quit. Pregnant women can also access our free, dedicated helpline for all smokers on 0800 169 0 169 and the specific helpline for pregnant women smokers on 0800 169 9 169. Local services are expected to liaise with Sure Start to ensure the most effective delivery of service to the women who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="c.272W.8/4">Drug misuse among pregnant women is identified through ante-natal care from their midwife or local general practitioner. Where identified, an assessment is carried out and the appropriate treatment and support arranged both during and post pregnancy. To deliver high quality care services for pregnant drug users, there is a co-ordinated approach between drug services, maternity services and children's health and social care services. Pregnant women are a vulnerable group as far as drugs misuse is concerned and where appropriate will be given top priority.</p>
	<p pid="c.272W.8/5">Obstetric departments are advised to develop good links with local drug specialists and GPs and the local social services. All local statutory authorities should have a written policy about drug misusing parents and all professionals involved should be aware of this policy.</p>

These duties include the need to make positive adjustments to ensure disabled people are not less favourably treated.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.3/2">The 2005 Act also places new duties on public authorities requiring them actively to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. By December 2006, local authorities and other listed public authorities will be required to publish Disability Equality Schemes setting out how they will implement this new duty. It will be mandatory to involve disabled people in determining an authority's priorities and action plan, but the Government do not believe it is right to specify in legislation the particular actions to be taken by authorities in order to promote equality of opportunity. This is because the implementation of the duty will maximise the inclusion of disabled people only if it fully reflects local circumstances and the priorities of local disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.3/3">The Disability Rights Commission will issue guidance to assist authorities in developing action plans that genuinely address the needs of disabled people and will oversee and enforce the implementation of the duty to ensure authorities are taking the actions required of them.</p>

	<p pid="c.278W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Geraghty to Mr. David Laws, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.278W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what his estimate is of the compliance rate for Child Support Agency cases for each quarter from 2000&ndash;01 to 2005&ndash;06; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.0/5" class="indent">The Agency has two measures of compliance. The case compliance rate is the percentage of cases for which a payment has been received, out of all of the cases for which a payment was due in a given period. The cash compliance rate is the percentage of the total amount of maintenance due to be paid in a given period which has actually been paid.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.0/6" class="indent">Information regarding the case and cash compliance rates is in the tables which I have enclosed with this letter.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.0/7" class="indent">I hope you find this information helpful.</p>

A non-resident parent who works for their own limited company will be an employee of that company (usually a director) and will not be self-employed.

On average over this period 511,000 incorrect awards were in payment at any one time, with approximately half of these due to customer error.

	<p pid="c.290W.2/2">Employers can give shares to their employees in a variety of different ways, including both taxed and tax-advantaged employee share schemes. These are reported to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). We do not know precisely how many companies have issued shares to UK employees in any year since 1997. This is because there are different reporting regimes for each type of tax-advantaged share scheme, plus taxed employment-related securities.</p>
	<p pid="c.290W.2/3">Published National Statistics show 6,427 companies were operating one or more tax-advantaged employee share or share option scheme in 2003&ndash;04. Of which, at least 1,045 operated a scheme that was open to all-employees. Other data show that in 2003&ndash;04 around 5,000 companies reported appropriations of employment-related securities subject to tax and national insurance. Many operate taxed and tax-advantaged arrangements simultaneously. For each tax-advantaged scheme, the following table contains either the total number of companies, or schemes operated by companies, where employees have been issued shares, or were granted or exercised share options:</p>

The obligation for 2005&ndash;06 is 5.5 per cent. rising to 15.4 per cent. by 2015.

	<p pid="c.304W.5/1">The UK has among the very best wind resources in Europe. Our view is that wind, both onshore and offshore, could easily contribute more that 10 per cent. of our electricity needs. Work undertaken by NGC indicates that 10 per cent. wind could be accommodated on the UK's transmission system with little additional cost or difficulty. Beyond that, NGC's work also indicates that 20 per cent. wind could be manageable. A view that is reinforced by experience in Denmark where wind already contributes more than 20 per cent. of electricity generation.</p>
	<p pid="c.304W.5/2">However, our renewable policies remain technology neutral. Our aspiration is to supply 20 per cent. of electricity needs from renewable sources by 2020. By that time we would expect other renewable technologies, such as biomass and wave and tidal, to come to the fore particularly as the balancing and wider system costs associated with wind are likely to increase as connected wind generation is increased.</p>

	<p pid="c.306W.2/2">The Government are committed to halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. Our measures for tackling child poverty for current and future generations cover not just financial support measures, but also measures to deliver employment opportunity for all, and improve children's life chances and break cycles of deprivation. Therefore it is not possible to provide a precise figure for the funding allocated in 2005&ndash;06 and future years, as the full range of public services must contribute to tackling child poverty. Details of this approach are available in the Child Poverty Review and the 2004 Spending Review White Paper (Cm 6237).</p>
	<p pid="c.306W.2/3">The Government have made a strong start to tackling child poverty. In relative low income terms this Government have already lifted more than half a million children out of poverty. Tax credits are a key element in the Government's strategy to tackle child poverty and provide financial support for families, and are benefiting 6 million families and 10 million children. In 2005&ndash;06 the child tax credit and child benefit provide up to &pound;59 per week for the first child and up to &pound;44 for each additional child, and the Government have committed to increasing the child element of CTC in line with earnings up to and including 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="c.307W.2/1">Countries will qualify for debt stock cancellation by reaching Completion Point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). By definition, Completion Point HIPCs have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty reduction and sound macroeconomic management that provides confidence that the savings from debt relief will be used for poverty reduction. Good governance is part of this, with standards drawn from national strategies. Once countries have qualified for debt stock cancellation, they will get 100 per cent. irrevocable relief. There will be no on-going conditionality.</p>
	<p pid="c.307W.2/2">Countries that have already completed the HIPC Initiative must demonstrate that they have maintained their commitment to poverty reduction and good macro-economic management in order to qualify for relief. They must therefore have remained current with their repayment obligations to the International Financial Institutions, and not have experienced serious lapses, including in governance, such that their IMF programmes would be at risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.307W.2/3">In addition, extra donor resources will be provided to the World Bank and African Development Bank to fully compensate for the costs of the debt stock cancellation. These resources will be allocated to all poor countries through the Institutions' existing Performance Based Allocation System, thereby providing a strong incentive for good policy (including governance) and performance. World Bank and IMF staff will also continue to monitor and report on the overall efficiency of public expenditure as well as on progress in reducing corruption and enhancing transparency in recipient countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.314W.0/1">The overall savings from increasing pension ages, after allowing for recycling monies into scheme improvements, had been estimated to have a net present value of around &pound;13 billion over the next 50 years. That would have come mostly from long-term savings on new entrants benefits. We still expect comparable net savings once the reforms are finalised. The principles for reforming civil service, NHS and teachers pensions agreed at the Public Services Forum provide that proposals for reforming schemes should be agreed by June 2006 and that new schemes with a normal pension age of 65 should be implemented for new entrants as soon as practicable thereafter. The pension terms for existing members, including pension ages, will be discussed in scheme specific negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="c.326W.9/1">The total cost of maintaining, renovating, and running Admiralty House in 2002&ndash;03, 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;345,929, &pound;216,487 and &pound;246,284. The estimated figure for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;269,126. These figures exclude business rates and council tax payable on the building. The cost covers work across the whole of Admiralty House which, as well as three flats assigned to Ministers by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, includes function rooms used by Government for more than 200 events every year.</p>
	<p pid="c.326W.9/2">The operation of Admiralty House is covered by a single facilities management contract which covers maintenance, renovation, security and running costs. It is not possible, within the overall total, to separately identify the costs that arise from the three flats in Admiralty House, although for internal accounting purposes the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister meets 20.7 per cent. of the costs of the operation of the entire building. This is calculated on the basis of the floor area of the flat occupied by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, as a proportion of the total floor area of Admiralty House. The actual amounts paid by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in each year reflect that the Office was established in May 2002, and thus did not pay costs for the whole of 2002&ndash;03, and benefited from an internal accounting adjustment that reduced ODPM's contribution in 2003&ndash;04. In addition there were minor works specific to the flat occupied by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, amounting to &pound;1,087 in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;159 to date in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

There is a general presumption against inappropriate development in the green belt which should not be approved, except in very special circumstances.</p>

ODPM is considering the responses it has received to the public consultation draft of the new Direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.332W.2/3">The Government have set a target for each English region to maintain or increase the area designated as green belt in local plans. Any proposals to establish new green belts, or to change the general extent of existing green belts, should be considered as part of a review of the regional spatial strategy, or the London Plan, in the first instance. This process will ensure that the proposals are subject to public consultation and discussion through an examination in public before an independent panel.</p>
	<p pid="c.332W.2/4">Similarly, any proposal to alter (exceptionally) a detailed green belt boundary should be considered through the preparation or review of a development plan document.

The South East Regional Housing Board has recommended that from their allocation of &pound;805 million for the two years a total of &pound;744 million should be allocated to the provision of affordable housing. However, the exact distribution of funding between programmes for 2006&ndash;08 will not be known until the completion of the Housing Corporation's bidding process.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.0/57">In August 2005 the Housing Corporation launched the bidding round for the 2006&ndash;08 Affordable Housing Programme (AHP). This invited both registered social landlords and non-registered bodies to apply for funds to develop affordable housing based on priorities set by the Regional Housing Boards. The outcome of this bidding round will not be known until early in 2006.</p>

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on the provision of affordable housing in its South East Regional Housing Strategy published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>. One of the key priorities identified in the strategy is the need to increase the provision of affordable housing in the region. In recognition of this, the board recommended that almost 92 per cent. of its funding should be used to increase provision of affordable homes. The Regional Housing Board has prioritised the growth areas (Ashford, Dartford, Gravesham, Medway, Swale) and other areas in Kent (Maidstone, Canterbury) for affordable housing funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.335W.5/2">The amount of affordable housing needed is determined locally in local housing strategies and development plans, and it is for local authorities in consultation with the Housing Corporation to agree numbers of units. The amount of housing brought forward depends upon the number and quality of bids made to the Housing Corporation for funding. Each bid is assessed against a number of criteria including value for money, design quality, environmental fitness and deliverability.</p>

This approach offers designers the flexibility to choose technologies that best meet their needs, that are cost-effective and practical, and that enable innovation.

	<p pid="c.347W.8/1">For the first phase of the European Refugee Fund, which ran from 2000 to 2004, the European Commission allocated &pound;146.7 million (&euro;216 million), of which around &pound;22 million was made available to the United Kingdom. Over this period the fund has been allocated to projects representing the three areas set by the European Commission&mdash;voluntary returns, reception of asylum-seekers, and refugee integration. All grants must be matched by money from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="c.347W.8/2">The United Kingdom has allocated all the funding received each year, although actual expenditure has in some cases been less than originally estimated. Final expenditure for this period has yet to be released by the European Commission following their scrutiny of reports from the projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.347W.8/3">New rules for the expenditure of the European Refugee Fund came into force this year, following consultation with member states. The subjects for expenditure remain the same but grants may now be made for longer than one year. For 2005, approximately &pound;6 million has been made available to the UK. Bids for grants were sought by the Home Office over the summer, and the successful applicants will be notified shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.356W.2/1">The Government take the problem of street drinking and antisocial behaviour very seriously. That is why we introduced local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and the Anti-social Behaviour Act in 2003&mdash;both of which cover England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.356W.2/2">Measures introduced to help reduce street drinking in Wales from 1997 include the Lions Breath&quot; project and the Targeting Alcohol Related Street Crime (TASC) initiative in Cardiff, the Calling time on Violent Crime&quot; initiative in Swansea and the national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns which took place over the summer and Christmas period last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.356W.2/3">The Violent Crime Reduction Bill, which is currently before Parliament and covers England and Wales, includes further measures like alcohol disorder zones, drinking banning orders and dispersal powers which may also have an impact on street drinking.</p>

The team was concerned with the issue of failed asylum seekers returned to Zimbabwe from the UK. The team met a broad range of non-governmental organisations and representatives of civil society.</p>
	<p pid="c.357W.11/2">A visit was paid to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Zimbabwean Immigration Service, in both cases these were courtesy visits which did not form part of the substantive work of the team. Due to the political climate in Zimbabwe, the meetings with some of the sources were conducted on the basis that their identities would not be revealed except in relation to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) proceedings. The AIT decided to make an order under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 by which those sources which had requested anonymity were protected, and accordingly the team's summary of their evidence was not made public. However, the team's evidence is noted in detail in the determination of the AIT, which can be viewed on the AIT website at: <a href="http://www.ait.gov.uk/determinations">http://www.ait.gov.uk/determinations</a>.do</p>

My right hon. and Noble Friend the Lord Chancellor announced in July this year that as part of the programme of work to increase the diversity of the judiciary, the Government would legislate when time permitted to change the current statutory requirements. Specifically, suitably qualified legal executives, patent agents and trade mark attorneys would become eligible for some appointments, and the requirement for rights of audience would be replaced with a requirement for a specified (and reduced) number of years post qualification legal experience.
