	<p pid="a.212W.2/1">Recent consultancy work, carried out on behalf of DEFRA, estimates that 24,850 tonnes of household batteries were sold in the UK in 2003. The great majority of these were alkaline manganese and zinc carbon varieties. There has been no legislative requirement for waste household batteries to be separately collected and detailed statistics have not therefore been kept. However, we estimate that various local voluntary schemes have resulted in a capture rate of less than 2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.212W.2/2">The Batteries and Accumulators Directive (2006/66/EC) came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-26">26 September 2006</phrase>. Member states have two years to transpose this measure into national law. This is a &quot;producer responsibility&quot; directive and, as such, the onus on collection and recycling will fall on battery producers in the first instance. However, local authorities are also likely to play a role given their current involvement in the collection of household waste. The exact form this may take will not be decided until the completion of formal domestic consultation with all parties concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.212W.2/3">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently working in partnership with a range of local authorities and not-for-profit organisations which already run recycling collection services on a number of pilot battery collection schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.212W.5/1">Agriculture as a whole contributes 7 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and 14 per cent. globally. The sector accounts for 36 per cent. of methane and 67 per cent. of nitrous oxide emissions in the UK, but only 1 per cent. of carbon dioxide. About 80 per cent. of this methane comes from enteric fermentation in the digestive system of animals (sheep, pigs and bovines), and 20 per cent. from animal waste. Methane emissions from agriculture have declined by 12 per cent. since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.212W.5/2">Recent research suggests that substantial methane reductions could be achieved by changes to feed regimes. Improving the longevity of dairy cows will also result in decreased methane production as a result of a reduction in the total number of animals needed to produce the same quantity of milk.</p>
	<p pid="a.212W.5/3">Defra is exploring the role of anaerobic digestion in reducing methane emissions in agriculture, both domestically and internationally. For example, we are taking a leading role in the Methane to Markets Partnership; an international initiative that advances cost-effective, near-term methane recovery and its use as a clean energy source.</p>

	<p pid="a.213W.5/2">DEFRA is taking the lead on offsetting emissions associated with the UK's presidency of the G8 in 2005, to help ensure that the presidency is carbon-neutral. All of last year's G8-associated meetings, including the G8 summit, were included in the DEFRA-led carbon offsetting initiative. The calculations included the emissions associated with air travel, local transport, energy use at venues and accommodation, and waste production.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.5/3">To offset these emissions, the Government have agreed to purchase 10, 000 Certified Emission Reductions from the Kuyasa low-income housing energy upgrade project in Cape Town, South Africa. This is the first Clean Development Mechanism project to be registered in Africa, and the first Gold Standard project to be registered anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.5/4">DEFRA is also responsible for administering the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund, which offsets all official and ministerial air travel of all central Government Departments (except the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which have their own offsetting schemes). Proceeds from the Fund will be used to purchase Certified Emission Reduction credits from energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that are based in developing countries and accredited under the Clean Development Mechanism. The organisations and specific projects that will be involved will be finalised soon and more details will be included in an announcement to be made shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.2/1">While carbon sequestration by forestry is a useful tool for offsetting some greenhouse gas emissions, sequestration in cropland and pasture through new management practices is less certain. This is because new management practices have to be followed for a substantial period of time in order to record additional carbon storage. Also, several years of stored carbon could be released by a change of practice in just one season.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.2/2">A more important issue is protecting the 10 billion tonnes of carbon held in UK soils, especially upland peat soils, from release through soil erosion and inappropriate management practices such as over-grazing. For example, allowing the peat soils of the High Peak to dry out would alone release carbon equivalent to 270 million vehicle miles.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.2/3">Defra is undertaking research to understand fully the issues on sequestration and protection of carbon stores. We are considering how to ensure agri-environment measures address this problem and are engaging with stakeholders, notably through the Rural Climate Change Forum, to ensure full understanding between the Government and industry on this problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.5/1">European Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004 lays down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries. The Regulation makes the use of acoustic deterrent devices (&quot;pingers&quot;) mandatory for vessels over 12 meters in length, involved in fixed-gear fisheries in the Celtic Sea Channel and Western Waters. It also sets up mandatory observer schemes to increase our knowledge of by-catch in fisheries.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.5/2">Unfortunately, there has been a delay in implementing pingers because studies of their effectiveness, costs and availability indicate that there are currently no devices suitable for use. A discussion was held at a Council Working Group on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-27">27 September</phrase> which recognised that, because of deployment problems in certain fisheries, some member states could not currently implement pingers as required. However, the group recommended that member states should continue work towards developing a suitable pinger.</p>

Technical staff carry out cross-compliance inspections regarding restrictions on the use of substances having hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists in farm animals. Responsibility for cross-compliance inspections on the control of animal diseases lies mainly with veterinary staff, although they are assisted by technical staff. Inspections for animal welfare requirements, which come into force in 2007, will be carried out by veterinary staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.218W.5/4">The Environment Agency is responsible for carrying out inspections in relation to groundwater, sewage sludge and nitrate vulnerable zones. Approximately 170 appropriately trained inspectors have undertaken work on cross-compliance as part of their duties.</p>

	<p pid="a.226W.0/2">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) recently published an Achievement Report. This included details of progress made on minimising waste through composting, reusable nappies, and in the retail sector. Progress made included:</p>
	<p pid="a.226W.0/3" class="indent">(i) signing up 92 per cent. of UK grocery retailers to the Courtauld Commitment to reduce packaging and food waste</p>
	<p pid="a.226W.0/4" class="indent">(ii) recruiting an additional 335,000 households as home composters</p>
	<p pid="a.226W.0/5" class="indent">(iii) diverting 22,954 tonnes of biodegradable nappy waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.226W.0/6">The Report is available from the WRAP website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.226W.0/8">As WRAP's work on reusable nappies started in 2003, it is too early to say what long-term changes there have been in consumer behaviour. The challenge in relation to reusable nappies, because of the convenience of disposable nappies, was recognised from the outset. I understand that WRAP will be preparing a report on lessons learnt from the campaign in the spring of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.226W.0/9">Each of the elements of WRAP's work on waste minimisation has produced valuable experience of how to influence consumer behaviour in making choices which reduce the amount of waste created.</p>

	<p pid="a.234W.6/1">The construction cost of a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) contract is the responsibility of the DBFO company. This is an important part of the risk transfer in this type of project, which gives the Department cost certainty in relation to construction costs. However, the Department and the Highways Agency monitor trends in road construction costs and take account of them in planning the forward programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.234W.6/2">Unlike conventional road improvement contracts, the costs associated with DBFO contracts are not just for the construction work but also cover the maintenance and management of the associated road network over a typical period of 30 years. The actual cost of construction is a matter for each DBFO Company.</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.2/2">Ofsted, the official body for inspecting schools, have not found any evidence that creationism is being taught in science lessons. The Department has not made an estimate of the number of schools or academies teaching creationism or intelligent design in religious education lessons.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.2/3">The national curriculum for science clearly sets down that pupils should be taught: how uncertainties in scientific knowledge and scientific ideas change overtime; the role of the scientific community in validating these changes; variation within species can lead to evolutionary changes; and, similarities and differences between species can be measured and classified. To meet the requirements of the national curriculum for science teachers have to teach about scientific theories. Neither intelligent design nor creationism is a recognised scientific theory and should not therefore be taught as part of the science curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.2/4">Creationism and intelligent design can be explored in religious education as part of developing an understanding of different beliefs. It is up to the local SACREs (Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education) to set the syllabus for how this should be done. The guidance for schools on collective worship states that every school must provide a daily act of collective worship for its pupils. There is no specific reference to creationism or intelligent design. The Department does not produce guidance on what should be discussed at scripture unions or religious clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.2/5">The Department is currently working with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to communicate this message to schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.240W.0/2">The Department does not set aside funding specifically for the installation of sprinklers in schools. It is for local authorities to decide what they do with the funding they are allocated. They can use it to install sprinklers where their need is demonstrated by a risk assessment, or where they represent value for money. Where a local authority has a general policy of installing sprinklers in schools, and need or value for money is not demonstrated in a particular project, it can of course provide additional funding to cover sprinklers.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.0/3">The Department is preparing a new publication on fire safety in schools&mdash;Building Bulletin 100, &quot;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&quot;. This includes guidance on sprinklers but, following public consultation, we saw the need to do more work in this area. We therefore commissioned consultants to analyse case studies of school projects where sprinklers have been installed. They are establishing reliable figures for both installation and maintenance costs, and developing these into a full cost benefit analysis. This work will be completed in January and then integrated into the final version of Building Bulletin 100, which we expect to publish several months later.</p>

	<p pid="a.248W.2/22" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/23" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/24" class="indent">You asked how many inspectors were employed to inspect the (a) performance, (b) quality standard and (c) guideline compliance of further education colleges in each year since 1997, broken down by inspecting body.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/25" class="indent">The Learning and Skills Act 2000 gave Her Majesty's Chief Inspector the responsibility for the inspection of further education colleges from 2001. It also required that these inspections be carried out jointly with the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI) where colleges also provided for education of learners who were 19 and over - which is the case for nearly all such colleges. This responsibility covers the inspection of sixth form colleges, tertiary colleges, colleges of further education, independent specialist colleges, and other specialist colleges such as those dedicated to agriculture and horticulture and art and design.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/26" class="indent">Before 2001, the inspection of further education colleges fell within the Further Education Funding Council. I am afraid Ofsted does not hold the records of that body.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/27" class="indent">Ofsted is required by the 2000 Act to inspect in accordance with a common inspection framework. Inspectors must report on the effectiveness of the educational provision, achievements and standards, leadership and management. It is not possible to separate the contribution of inspectors towards the inspection of performance and quality standards. The responsibility for guideline compliance primarily falls to the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/28" class="indent">Each of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools carries out a range of inspections so that it is only possible to provide approximate information to that requested and on a 'full-time equivalent' basis for inspectors directly employed by Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/29" class="indent">This number of inspectors on a 'full-time equivalent' basis directly employed by Ofsted and deployed on the inspection of colleges (by financial year) is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/30" class="indent">2001-02: 26 HMI</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/31" class="indent">2002-03: 26 HMI</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/32" class="indent">2003-04: 26 HMI</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/33" class="indent">2004-05: 22 HMI</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/34" class="indent">2005-06: 18 HMI</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/35" class="indent">In addition, Ofsted has deployed the services of 'additional inspectors' on a contractual basis as and when they are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/36" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Bill Rammell MP, Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.251W.5/31">The figures are for the average number of staff employed by the LSC each year and include temporary staff and agency staff. A rise in staff numbers occurred between March 2002 and March 2003 as the LSC began to build up the organisation, and took on significant new responsibilities, including the funding of school sixth forms. During 2004 the LSC undertook a re-shaping exercise which resulted in a fall in numbers in March 2005. Staff numbers subsequently increased slightly, reflecting the further work which was transferred by the Department to the LSC during 2005, including education maintenance allowances. However, we anticipate a reduction in the average number of staff in post between 2006 and 2007 as a consequence of the announcement in September 2005 by Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's chief executive, of proposals for a new structure for the organisation. This new structure aims to make the LSC more effective at identifying and responding to local learning and skills needs, and to achieve a less bureaucratic and more strategic relationship with partners and providers. This process is now nearing completion, and will achieve with estimated savings of up to &pound;40 million, which could be released to the front line for the further benefit of learners. As a result, the LSC will have a strong regional and local capacity, spending less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders.</p>

An independent Board of Governors ensures that editorial independence is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.2/4">The Department has a pre-agreed form of contract which it obliges the supplier to use with all TV production companies. The Department has the right to reject any contracts entered into that are not on this agreed basis, however, it does not have the right to veto specific programme commissioning contracts in order to ensure editorial independence.</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.3/2">For the 2006-07 settlement the best available population projections were the Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2003-based sub-national population projections. Because 2007-08 is the second year of a multi-year settlement, the provisional 2007-08 settlement also uses the 2003-based sub-national population projections. The Government are currently consulting on the 2007-08 provisional settlement and will take into account all relevant representations made during the consultation period before making the final settlement.</p>

In preparing for these calculations, the methodology will be reviewed and data used in the formulae to determine the 2008-09 to 2010-11 settlements will, consistent with the Secretary of State's policy on multi-year settlements, be updated to the best data available at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.3/4">As there have been no changes made to the formulae for 2007-08, and in order to treat all authorities consistently, I am not able to meet individual local authority delegations during consultation. I will of course meet with hon. Members representing Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>

The bid document included contingency and preliminaries of 23.5 per cent. in main venue costs. It also included a contingency for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games. The bid did not include provision for an Olympic Delivery Partner. This proposal was made following the establishment of the Olympic Delivery Authority. The use of a delivery partner will help to ensure the highest levels of programme management and cost control.</p>

	<p pid="a.271W.0/3">Guidance on the use of the Simple Caution for adult offenders is set out in Home Office circular 30/2005. The police (and CPS where appropriate) will consider whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances. If the suspect has previously received a caution, then a further caution should not normally be considered. However, if there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a significant deterrent effect (two years or more), then a caution can be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.271W.0/4">In the case of those aged 10-17 cautions were replaced by the Final Warning Scheme under Sections 65-66 Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which introduced reprimands and final warnings. Depending on the seriousness of the offence, a reprimand is normally given for a first offence and a final warning for a second offence. If a young person who has been given a final warning commits a further offence he or she must be charged (the only exception is where it is at least two years since the previous warning and the offence is not so serious as to require a charge, in which case a further warning can be given).</p>

He explained that this process of dealing with the backlog while maintaining deportation consideration for everyone who is released from prison will contribute towards a higher prison population until the position is fully resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.281W.8/3">He also set out that as part of improving processes for dealing with foreign nationals prisoners, we will reach the position by the spring of 2007 where the consideration of deportation for all foreign nationals will begin six months before the end of their sentences and that we are making steady progress towards that as we deal with the backlog.</p>

	<p pid="a.283W.5/1">It remains difficult to make an accurate assessment of the extent of the trafficking problem. There are no statistics that clearly indicate the precise number of women trafficked to the UK over the last 10 years, although intelligence suggests there has been an increase over the last two or three years. The emerging findings from a Home Office research paper due to be published in 2007 suggests that at any one time in 2003 there were in the region of 4,000 victims of trafficking for prostitution in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.5/2">An analysis of information obtained from Operation Pentameter will assist in further developing our understanding of the scale of the problem in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.284W.2/3">A number of other Government Departments may also encounter evidence of illegal migrant working during the course of their own operations and legal gateways exist for a range of law enforcement agencies to share such information with IND.

	<p pid="a.294W.0/1">Wymott has a Work Life Balance (WLB) scheme incorporated into its working patterns and nearly 20 per cent. of unified grades at the prison, up to senior officer level, have WLB arrangements in place. Wymott is currently in the process of reviewing all WLB agreements that are in operation, in accordance with Prison Service Order (PSO) 8010, Equal Opportunities, to ensure that staffing levels meet the establishment's needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.294W.3/1">In the current recruitment exercise for probation board chairs and members we have sought to attract applicants from across the public, private and not for profit sectors. We have particularly sought to attract individuals with 'business acumen' in whichever sector such skills have been obtained. During the present process we have written directly to the Magistrates' Association, and the LGA, as well as to such organisations as Lions and Rotary Clubs, to encourage applicants with diverse experiences. This has been supported by considerable additional activity to encourage applicants from BME and other traditionally under represented groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.294W.3/2">The skills, abilities and business acumen we are seeking during the current recruitment campaign are the same as we would wish to see represented on probation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.294W.3/3">The remuneration for trust chairs and members has not been yet been determined although presently, depending on the size of the area, probation chairs are paid between &pound;15,400 and &pound;27,500 and are asked to commit up to two days a week. Board members are paid at an hourly rate of &pound;15.40 with a commitment of up to five days a month.</p>

	<p pid="a.305W.5/1">Along with England and Wales, the Violent Crime Reduction Act (&quot;the Act&quot;) made three changes to the law in Northern Ireland with regard to knives. The Act raised the age at which knives can be legally purchased from 16 to 18 years of age; created a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon, which includes specified knives and bladed weapons, with a penalty of up to four years imprisonment; and reduced the threshold for a constable to exercise his power of entry and search of a school and a person on school premises for weapons including knives.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.5/2">The Government recently concluded a public consultation exercise including a major conference taking views on a series of proposals to improve further Northern Ireland's laws on knives. The proposals included increasing the penalty for possession of a knife in a public place; extending the list of &quot;offensive weapons&quot;; and increasing penalties for the illegal sale of knives. The consultation also sought views on a knife licensing scheme. I am currently considering the way forward in light of the consultation and the conference.</p>

	<p pid="a.312W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding how many residents parking schemes are under consideration by the Department for Regional Development in each Northern Ireland council area. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.2/4" class="indent">By way of background, I should explain that the Department took powers in the Road Traffic Regulation (NI) Order 1997 to permit the introduction of residents' parking schemes in Northern Ireland. However, one of the key success factors for residents' parking schemes is effective enforcement. At that time, the Police Service of Northern Ireland was responsible for the enforcement of parking restrictions, but indicated that they could not provide resources to carry out this enforcement. No schemes have therefore been implemented to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.2/5" class="indent">You will be aware that, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase> parking offences were decriminalised and Roads Service took over responsibility for the enforcement of parking restrictions. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-17">17 November 2006</phrase> we launched a draft policy consultation on residents' parking, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="">9 February 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.2/6" class="indent">While we have received a number of enquiries in relation to residents' parking schemes, none of these will be considered in detail until the consultation has been completed and a policy developed. However, I can advise that following publication of the residents' parking policy, it is intended that the first residents' parking schemes will be implemented towards the end of next year.</p>

The funding for such township-level interventions would be channelled through UN agencies.</p>

All funding decisions will be made by the Fund Board, which includes representatives from the donor consortium and independent international experts. Furthermore, the donor consortium has agreed with the Burmese authorities that implementation of the Three Diseases Fund will be consistent with the international humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality. These principles rule out any implementation by organisations with a political nature such as the Union Solidarity Development Association.</p>

	<p pid="a.317W.8/1">The closure of the field offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Burma means that ICRC will be unable to carry out its vital assistance and protection work with civilians affected by conflict between the Burmese Army and the ethnic armed groups. We are extremely concerned that this will increase the vulnerability of these civilians. We are also very concerned that since December 2005, ICRC has had to halt its programme of prison visits because it has been unable to carry them out according to its standard operating procedures. We believe that the ICRC's transparent, neutral and principled approach to aid delivery is the right one: respect for the humanitarian principles by donors, implementers and the authorities is crucial for the effective delivery of aid. The Burmese authorities' treatment of ICRC is a cause for profound concern for all agencies supporting humanitarian assistance in Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.321W.0/1">The eruption of Mount Nyamulagira in North Kivu, DRC has been anticipated for some time. Fortunately for the population of this troubled region, this volcano is situated within the Virunga National Park, which is largely uninhabited. Lava flows are being monitored by the Goma Volcano Observatory, and while it is still possible that lava may reach the Sake&mdash;Goma road, the speed of the flows has reduced considerably. To date the impact on inhabitants of the area has been minimal, but the situation will continue to be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.0/2">The volcano Nyiragongo, however, is only 18 km from Goma town and is also very active. DFID is providing support to the Goma Volcano Observatory to increase its technical capacity to monitor the status of these two volcanoes and to establish a risk management unit to carry out contingency planning and emergency response preparation. The Observatory is funded through the UN and works closely with local authorities in North Kivu and Rwanda, other UN agencies and NGOs. If it becomes necessary to evacuate people from the area, support will be provided through the rapid response mechanism (RRM)&mdash;a contingency fund established in DRC to ensure emergency assistance is provided as quickly as possible, supported by the UK and other partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.0/3">The recent fighting in Sake (25 km west of Goma) and surrounding areas between combatants loyal to renegade army commander General Nkunda and MONUC/FARDC forces has caused considerable disruption in the area, with approximately 15,000 people displaced. The area is now quiet again, but people are delaying their return home, fearing looting. A joint UN/NGO assessment mission has reviewed the situation and made a first distribution of food and other essential items to those in need, using RRM resources. The humanitarian agencies on the ground will continue to monitor and respond to the needs of the population until they can safely return home.</p>

We agree with the assessment and statement by the European Union which reiterates member states' commitment to supporting transparency, accountability and efficiency in aid programmes in Peru.

	<p pid="a.329W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking which (a) full time and (b) part time Jobcentre Plus offices have been closed in each of the last four years. This is something, which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/4" class="indent">I enclose a list of the offices that were closed and have indicated in each case whether the office was open full-time or part-time prior to closure. I have placed a copy in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/5" class="indent">Firstly, as part of the rollout of the new Jobcentre Plus network we have rationalised our estate. We inherited around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, several of which were unsuitable for the new processes, or were in the wrong place or in a poor state of repair. Often, the former agencies had offices situated at either end of the High Street and, in some instances, neither was suitable for conversion to Jobcentre Plus so we closed one or both of them. In each District we undertook detailed service delivery planning exercises in consultation with local stakeholders, identifying the sites which we would convert to the new standard and those, which needed to close. We also explained how, particularly in more rural locations, we would offer outreach services (&quot;flexible service delivery&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/6" class="indent">Secondly, as a result of our programme to centralise benefit processing we have identified sites which will no longer be viable once processing work has been taken away from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/7" class="indent">Thirdly, we have been looking very closely at the need for public-facing sites in a number of locations. The increased availability of new channels means that Jobcentre Plus customers can access services directly by telephone or Internet rather than needing to call into one of our offices. Reducing expenditure on our office network is part of our wider strategy for focusing resources more effectively on frontline advisory services to help our customers move into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/8" class="indent">The list of closures should also be set against the 837 offices that we have rolled out to date under our restructuring programme, plus over 150 locations where we have installed flexible service delivery arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/9" class="indent">I would emphasise that the closure of any of our offices involves consultation with local stakeholders, including MPs, and putting in place suitable alternative arrangements for delivering services to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.331W.8/1">Carers already have access to a wide range of support to help them back to work depending on whether they are, for example a lone parent or a disabled person, and the type of working age benefit they receive, such as income support or incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.8/2">In taking advantage of this support, carers may be able to attend a work-focused interview where they can get advice from a personal adviser on the programmes available to help them search for work or on training to update their skills. When making the transition into work, the personal adviser will also give advice on the financial assistance available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.8/3">We have also listened to the considerable public support for carers in drawing up proposals in the Health and Social Care White Paper when a commitment was made to improve respite care. In addition, the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, promotes co-operation between authorities and requires councils to inform carers of their right to an assessment which takes into account their outside interests including work, or the desire to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.8/4">Flexible working practices are good for business, employees and their families. In April 2003, we introduced a new right for parents of children up to the age of six and disabled children up to the age of 18 to request flexible working and put a duty on the employer to consider their request seriously. From April 2007, this right will be extended through the Work and Families Act to carers of adults. This will support carers who wish to remain in or return to work and will particularly help those aged 45 to 64, around one quarter of whom are carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.342W.3/13">In 2004, the FCO reduced the number of positions to be filled and as a result only one large-scale recruitment campaign was completed. The number of vacancies rose in 2005 and 2006 and four large-scale recruitment campaigns were undertaken resulting in higher associated advertising costs.</p>
