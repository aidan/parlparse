In all such cases staff are required to provide an explanation for the use of first class travel when claims are made.</p>

	<p pid="d.421W.2/1">The decision to abolish the Overseas Price Mechanism was taken in the autumn of 2007 as part of the broader agreement for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the 2007 comprehensive spending review. The OPM protected the FCO from currency fluctuations but it did not provide the Department with the incentive to factor in medium-term changes in currency costs when it allocated its resources. As part of the CSR07 agreement, the Treasury allowed the FCO to engage in forward currency markets to better manage short-term currency risk. This change brought the FCO into line with practice in other Government Departments.</p>

Units from the army supported the first Windsor Castle Royal Tattoo last year and it is planned to widen participation this year to include elements from the RN and RAF as well. Other tattoos, such as Birmingham, Aldershot and Durham, have also been supported by military assets in recent years and it is understood that the City of Cardiff are seeking to introduce a Cardiff tattoo in the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="d.430W.3/1">The capacity and capability of all three UK naval bases (Clyde, Devonport and Portsmouth) are regularly assessed to ensure that they individually and collectively meet the requirements of the Royal Navy. The most recent assessment was carried out as part of the Naval Base Review (NBR), which concluded in July 2007 that all three naval bases should be retained but optimised. This optimisation work has begun at each naval base and forms an integral part of the Maritime Change Programme (MCP). MCP is developing an enduring maritime enterprise, commensurate with the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS), that delivers affordable, sustainable and efficient Maritime build, equipment and through life support to meet the operational needs of the Royal Navy today and in the future.</p>

	<p pid="d.431W.2/1">The Belvedere Programme is considering future basing options for the Joint Helicopter Command.</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/2">Under the strategic direction of the Defence Operating Board and a three Star military officer (the Senior Responsible Owner), the Belvedere Team Leader has day to day responsibility for the programme timetable.</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/3">The range of variables and programme uncertainties has been more complex than originally envisaged, and has inevitably had an impact on the time taken to undertake the work. The criteria against which judgments are made, for both individual airfields and combinations of airfields, include:</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/4" class="indent">operating issues including aircraft numbers, command and control and flying hours; environmental issues including noise,</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/5" class="indent">availability and standard of domestic and technical accommodation;</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/6" class="indent">accessibility for aircraft and vehicle types; aircraft capacity of the airfield;</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/7" class="indent">opportunities for efficiencies and rationalisation;</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/8" class="indent">airfield location&mdash;low flying areas, training areas and local communities;</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/9" class="indent">future requirements; and,</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/10" class="indent">affordability and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/11">The costs of Belvedere since it was reconstituted in June 2007 have been a little under &pound;2 million. In addition, around &pound;2 million has been spent on essential maintenance works at RAF Lyneham to ensure that its existing infrastructure can remain viable if Belvedere concludes that the station should be retained.</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/12">No decisions have been taken on the number of bases required, nor therefore, of any accommodation requirements at RAF Lyneham. Any new accommodation would be provided to common joint-Service standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/13">Baseline noise and environmental impact assessments have been made for each of the sites being considered by Programme Belvedere. A full environmental assessment following selection of a particular option would take 11-12 months. The programme would then be delivered through a series of individual projects. Future costs would depend upon the option chosen.</p>
	<p pid="d.431W.2/14">The future of the Belvedere Programme is currently under consideration at senior levels within the Department.</p>

	<p pid="d.434W.2/2">Recreational beekeepers, who form a substantial majority of beekeepers in the UK, play an important role in helping to combat the decline in the honey bee population, both in terms of ensuring that they practice good husbandry to maintain and increase bee numbers, and through recognising the risks of spreading pests and diseases to other beekeepers if they fail to take action. The recent National Audit Office report highlighted the large numbers of recreational beekeepers who are unknown to the authorities and so who could be unaware of the risks of spread of pests and disease. An additional &pound;2.3 million funding was announced by the Secretary of State in January to support implementation of the initial phase of a 10 year plan to protect and improve the health of honey bees. This involves new work aimed at gaining a more accurate picture of the numbers and distribution of beekeepers and the status of the health of their colonies and increasing significantly the proportion of beekeepers registered on the National Bee Unit's Beebase database in England.</p>

	<p pid="d.435W.3/2">International trade in honeybees poses a risk of movements of pests and diseases. Consequently, imports are only allowed from a limited list of non-EC countries. Imports of honeybees into the UK are controlled by EC legislation which includes a requirement for each consignment to be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the relevant authorities in the exporting country. Imports from countries outside the Community are also subject to post import controls aimed at reducing the risk of introduction and spread of exotic bee pests, in particular, the small hive beetle and tropilaelaps mites, both of which are notifiable.</p>

Instead, chemical analysis is undertaken using standard methods and the ash is assessed for ecotoxicity by reference to the criteria for levels of dangerous substances given in the Environment Agency's Technical Guidance WM2 &quot;Hazardous waste: interpretation of the definition and classification of hazardous waste, 2nd edition, version 2.2&quot;. The Environment Agency has been working with the Environmental Services Association to ensure that the procedures used to assess incinerator bottom ash are both robust and technically appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="d.438W.8/2">The Government worked closely with local government in CSR07 to identify the overall pressure on waste management services, including the increase in landfill tax, along with the extent to which those pressures can be mitigated. Over the CSR07 period, the overall Government grant will increase by &pound;8.9 billion which takes into account local government's landfill tax liability, including the increased costs resulting from the rise in the standard rate escalator from 2008-09, and allows local authorities to deliver effective services including in the area of waste management.</p>
	<p pid="d.438W.8/3">DEFRA is also supporting local authorities to develop alternatives to landfill through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). To date &pound;2.02 billion PFI Credits have been committed to 33 projects which will divert waste from landfill. There are a further 11 projects in the application process, for the remaining &pound;1.18 billion PFI Credits currently available.</p>
	<p pid="d.438W.8/4">In addition the Waste Infrastructure Capital Grant provides direct funding to help local authorities put in place the front-end infrastructure needed to help them meet their landfill diversion targets.</p>

Such activity is not only potentially harmful to the environment but it also undermines the good work of legitimate charities which provide working electrical equipment to communities in developing countries.</p>

However part 3 of the Traffic Management Act 2004, which came into force in April 2008, allows local authorities in England, with the consent of the Secretary of State, to operate a permit scheme, under which anyone carrying out works in the public highway must seek permission for those works before proceeding.</p>
	<p pid="d.449W.2/3">No authorities have yet been authorised to operate a permit scheme.

	<p pid="d.450W.9/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) funds free legal representation at repossession hearings via the Housing Possession Court Duty Scheme. The scheme is available at 112 courts. There follows a full list of the courts where the scheme is available.</p>
	<p pid="d.450W.9/2">The LSC does not record the number of advisers per court and there is no specific number of advisers required. The LSC does require that legal aid providers ensure there is at least one adviser in court when the possession lists are heard and that all sessions are covered.</p>

	<p pid="d.453W.2/1">Free legal representation at repossession hearings in Wales is available through Swansea county court, and details of the number of people who have received assistance in each month since it was first piloted in January 2002 are shown as follows.</p>
	<p pid="d.453W.2/2">Between January 2004 and March 2005 there are no these data available. At that time the reporting of these data relied on providers submitting paper forms to the Legal Services Commission and in some cases no forms were ever sent. Since April 2007 these data have been submitted electronically and consequently the figures are more reliable.</p>

	<p pid="d.456W.0/1">The measure of reoffending used to provide National Statistics for England and Wales is not broken down by area. However, newly published data on local adult reoffending (a different measure of reoffending to the national statistics) are broken down by probation area and local authority (upper tier only).</p>
	<p pid="d.456W.0/2">The number of offenders used to calculate the local reoffending rate for the Essex probation area between <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase> is 20,810 and the reoffending rate is 8.19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.456W.0/3">The number of offenders used to calculate the local reoffending rate for the Essex county council area, which excludes the unitary authorities of Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock, is 15,737 and the reoffending rate is 8.20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.456W.0/4">The local measure measures the reoffending of all offenders on the probation caseload, aged 18 or over, at a certain point in time (a &quot;snapshot&quot;), while the national measure covers all offenders commencing a court order under probation supervision or released from custody during the first quarter of the year. Additionally, the local measure allows a three month period for reoffences to be committed, while the national measure allows a year.</p>
	<p pid="d.456W.0/5">The local reoffending figures are produced by aggregating the data of four snapshots of the probation caseload. Therefore the number of offenders quoted above is approximately four times the number of offenders on the caseload at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="d.456W.0/6">A reoffending rate of 8.19 per cent. with a caseload size of 20,810 does not mean that 1,704 different offenders committed a reoffence, as some offenders may have appeared in more than one cohort and reoffended more than once.</p>
	<p pid="d.456W.0/7">It should be noted the probation supervision of some offenders may end during the period while their reoffending is being monitored. Therefore some reoffences may be committed after probation supervision has finished.</p>
	<p pid="d.456W.0/8">For further details please see &quot;Local reoffending results <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase> England and Wales&quot; available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.457W.0/1">Those on red level status have the same access to telephones during office hours as other young people at Wetherby. However like all other young people they are normally engaged in educational or vocational training activities during the core day. If a young person needs to contact his solicitor a member of staff will facilitate it as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.457W.0/2">During the week, young people walk to their activity areas each day in the fresh air. At weekends, all young people have access to at least one hour's outdoor exercise per day. During the summer months, young people also have access to outdoor exercise in the evenings. In addition there are a large number of outdoor activities as well as horticultural and recycling vocational training. Some physical education activities also take place outdoors.</p>
	<p pid="d.457W.0/3">Young people on red level participate in the whole range of purposeful activities and curriculum. However they do not take part in association with other young people during the evenings or at weekends. Typically, they might expect to be out of their room for approximately 6.75 hours each day during weekdays, although this will vary for each young person.</p>
	<p pid="d.457W.0/4">Young people on red level are permitted to telephone their families at least every other day. However, more frequent contact can be arranged in cases where young people would benefit from it.</p>
	<p pid="d.457W.0/5">Freshly laundered clothing is issued to young people on a weekly basis. They receive five T-shirts, seven pairs of underpants, socks, a gym vest and shorts, two jumpers and two pairs of trousers. Each unit also keeps a stock of clean clothing in case a young person requires an emergency replacement.</p>
	<p pid="d.457W.0/6">48 rooms at Wetherby have a fitted shower providing unlimited access. The vast majority of other young people, including those on red level, have an opportunity to shower daily when they attend physical education activities or during the evening association periods.</p>
	<p pid="d.457W.0/7">The information on numbers of young people placed on red level and the length of time spent on red level is not held in the format requested and would involve the examination of a very large numbers of individual files which would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.458W.3/3">Anniversaries for which celebrations are planned by DCMS sponsored bodies include the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin, organised by English Heritage, and the 500th anniversary of Henry Vlll's accession to the throne, organised by Historic Royal Palaces. Both these anniversaries occur in 2009 and plans by the Department, or its sponsored bodies, for the celebration of other major anniversaries will be announced nearer the time.</p>

	<p pid="d.462W.0/1">It is unlikely that the time taken to publish the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's (CIPFA's) survey of library usage will have an effect on public library authority budgets for 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="d.462W.0/2">Due to the various validity checks from both CIPFA and the Audit Commission, and taking in queries from local authorities, the earliest date that figures can be shared with all subscribers is November. Data are published nationally between January and March. CIPFA believes this timetable ensures a 100 per cent. response rate and accurate data. We do not believe this timetable affects an authority's ability to plan budgets for the following financial year.</p>
	<p pid="d.462W.0/3">DCMS is represented on the CIPFA Library Standards and Statistics Working Party, but has not otherwise discussed the survey with CIPFA.</p>
	<p pid="d.462W.0/4">Being the primary source of data on public libraries, we look forward to the publication of the annual CIPFA statistics. However, we believe that local authorities should have the freedom to manage their library budgets in accordance with the needs and wishes of their communities and that close monitoring of their performance is unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.462W.0/5">The Library Service Modernisation Review, which was launched by the Secretary of State in October, will define Government's high level vision for the provision of modernised library services, and the necessary steps to achieve this vision, and is intended to encourage excellence in all authorities. We believe that participation increases when services are excellent and we hope that results of our own Taking Part and Active People surveys will demonstrate year on year increases in library participation.</p>

	<p pid="d.485W.5/2">The fund had two categories: capacity building and inter faith activity. The purpose of the capacity building category was to help build the organisational capabilities of faith-based organisations, enabling them to play a fuller part in civil society by engaging more effectively with public authorities. Capacity building for the large grants was subdivided into three categories: leadership and management; relationships with local, regional or national Government; and mentoring smaller faith organisations. The purpose of the inter faith category was to improve cohesion between different faith groups and the wider community, thereby bringing people of different faiths together to promote mutual understanding, respect and co-operation.</p>

	<p pid="d.499W.3/1">There have been two special development orders made in England since 1997. These were the Town and Country Planning (London Borough of Camden) Special Development Order 2004 (SI 2004/1231) and the Town and Country Planning (London Borough of Camden) Special Development (Amendment) Order 2004 (SI 2004/2355). The first order made provision for publicity for some planning applications (within the designated area) to be advertised on the internet. The amending order made an alteration as to compliance within the 21 day period for the display of notices, where notices are removed, obscured or defaced.</p>

	<p pid="d.500W.8/1">We do not have official figures on the number of local housing authorities who run rent deposit schemes. However, in 2007 Communities and Local Government published a homelessness prevention survey submitted by 301 local authorities, representing 85 per cent. of the total. 201 authorities reported that they had rent deposit schemes in place and a further 45 authorities reported that they were planning to have rent deposit schemes in place. This shows that private rented accommodation is an effective housing option for preventing homelessness and provides a viable alternative to social housing.</p>
	<p pid="d.500W.8/2">The Government take all aspects of homelessness very seriously. We have allocated over &pound;200 million to local authorities and voluntary organisations over the next three years (2008-11) to tackle and prevent homelessness in their area effectively. This is the biggest ever cash injection for homelessness services. Local organisations decide, based on local circumstances, how to use those resources to prevent homelessness.</p>

	<p pid="d.508W.12/1">The information requested is not held centrally. The comprehensive spending review (CSR) funding settlement includes &pound;270 million per year by 2010-11 to tackle healthcare associated infections (HCAIs). In 2008-09, the additional funding is reflected in the 5.5 per cent., increase in primary care trust (PCT) allocations and the 2.3 per cent. uplift to the national tariff (the latter specifically recognising the importance of tackling HCAIs and improving cleanliness).</p>
	<p pid="d.508W.12/2">The additional funding is not ring fenced, but rather is reflected in the 5.5 per cent., increase to PCT revenue allocations in 2008-09. In addition, the national tariff uplift for 2008-09 has an element that specifically recognises the importance of tackling infections and improving cleanliness. This means that all national health service organisations can afford to make significant investment and continue to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.508W.12/3">Some of the funding will be spent on implementing national policy&mdash;such as the requirement for all relevant elective patients to be screened for methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) from April 2009 and for emergency admissions as soon as possible within the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="d.508W.12/4">Other areas where additional funding can be invested will be left to local discretion, but &quot;clean, safe care&quot; guides the local NHS as to areas where this will have the most impact&mdash;such as investing in specialist staff. The Government's CSR settlement allows for up to &pound;45 million for this purpose, which could for example deliver two infection control nurses, one pharmacist and two nurses to care for patients in isolation, alongside additional infection control nurses in every community. As there is a shortage of trained staff in some areas, trusts may want to recruit to posts in infection control teams and train up additional infection control nurses.</p>

However, dental treatment under general anaesthesia may only take place in a hospital setting that has a critical-care facility. It is therefore very likely, though not absolutely certain that a child admitted to hospital for extraction of teeth will have had general anaesthetic, and that was the reason for their admission to hospital. A table which contains the number of hospital episodes involving the extraction of teeth by age group and primary care trust has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="d.513W.2/2">The GPRD contains records of patients recorded as suffering from malnutrition under a range of different terms, known as 'Read Terms'. There are many thousands of Read codes in total, and 24 separate codes relating to malnutrition. This range of different codes is designed to allow the general practitioner (GP) to record the condition at different levels of specificity of disease. The Read code used is at the discretion of the GP and is based on their diagnosis of the patient's condition</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/3">The data as previously given are a reasonable population based estimate of the level of malnutrition, as recorded within primary care data, based upon the GPRD sample size.</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/4">The analysis undertaken to count the number of such cases, in the GPRD, is not done routinely. It was done in response to a specific request. The analysis could be repeated at any time in the future.</p>

	<p pid="d.517W.5/2">The Department collected data on the value of redundancies and early retirements due to primary care trust (PCT) reorganisation in 2006-07, but we cannot separate the redundancy element from these figures.

These savings will be reinvested in front line services.</p>

	<p pid="d.522W.5/1">The Government are committed to driving forward increased personalisation of public services, including ensuring that people using social care services should have access to maximum independence, choice and control. Personal budgets, building on the success of direct payments and the experiences of the thirteen individual budget pilot sites, are central to this aim.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.5/2">Councils will be supported to make substantial progress on transforming their systems to deliver personalised services over the next two years. The ring-fenced social care reform grant provides &pound;520 million to help councils redesign and reshape their systems over the next three years in order to deliver this transformation. Performance across health and social care will be measured against relevant indicators in the national indicator set and any relevant local area agreement (LAA) improvement targets. This information will inform the Care Quality Commission's assessments of primary care trusts and councils across health and adult social care which, in turn, contribute to the comprehensive area assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.5/3">In addition to the existing performance mechanisms, the Department and its partners are working to improve the adult social care indicators for future spending cycles. This work builds on the lessons learnt from the current national indicator set and the first round of the LAAs. The revised indicators are likely to form part of the evidence base for both future assessments by the inspectorates and the foundation for the next round of LAAs. The Department is now taking initial development work forward in partnership with Association of Directors of Adult Social Services regional networks, joint investment plans and other local sector stakeholders and as part of a wider Government review of the indicator set for the next comprehensive spending review period.</p>

In 2007-08 the overall cost-effectiveness of the trust's work improved to &pound;1.20 per tonne of lifetime carbon dioxide saved. The trust's influenced lifetime CO2 savings have improved in 2007-08 to 21.5mt CO2 compared to 16mt CO2 in 2006-07.

	<p pid="d.528W.3/1">In our Carers Strategy, published in June 2008, we set out our vision of the support we aim to provide for carers over the next 10 years. In developing our Carers Strategy, we conducted one of the most in-depth and widespread consultations ever held on carers' issues. This included discussions with carers' interest groups on a wide range of benefit issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.528W.3/2">People who have retired from work but continue to care for relatives are not excluded from claiming carer's allowance. Although carer's allowance will not usually be payable where state pension is in payment, the person can still access the carer premium, currently &pound;27.75 a week, in the income-related benefits such as housing benefit and council tax benefit, or the equivalent additional amount for carers in pension credit. In addition, where someone would receive less from state pension than from carer's allowance, an amount of carer's allowance can be paid to make up the difference.</p>

	<p pid="d.528W.6/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>

	<p pid="d.528W.6/5" class="indent">It should be noted that the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 made changes to the way child maintenance is paid to parents with care in receipt of income based benefits. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>, the Child Support Agency, on behalf of the Secretary of State, was required to retain a proportion of child maintenance received in respect of parents with care in receipt of income based benefits. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>, the Agency forwards all maintenance received and parents with care in receipt of benefits will need to inform Jobcentre Plus about any maintenance they have received.</p>
	<p pid="d.528W.6/6" class="indent">The information you have requested in respect of the number of cases where the non-resident parent paid all, part or none of the child maintenance due in the previous quarter is included in the tables which have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.528W.6/7" class="indent">Some non-resident parents will go to great lengths to avoid fulfilling their responsibilities to their children. The Child Support Agency has made improvements to how it is collecting and enforcing maintenance and is now consistently collecting and arranging record amounts of child maintenance, with over &pound;1.1 billion collected or arranged in the year to the end of December 2008.</p>

A change in legislation in October 2008 removed the compulsion for parents with care on income based benefit (Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance (Income Based)) to pursue a claim for child support through the Agency. After this date, it is expected that some parents with care will opt to end their child support claim with CSA. This can be seen as a fall in overall caseload after October 2008.<br/> 2. In the run up to the change, a further legislative repeal in July 2008 means that single parents making a new claim for income based benefit will no longer be referred to CSA. Some will make direct arrangements with the Agency, but they are not compelled to do so. This change can be seen as a huge fall (to zero) in the numbers of potential new claims received directly from Jobcentre Plus from October 2008.<br/> 3. All cases received from October 2008 were classed as private intake. Any cases that were received from this time will be classed as private intake regardless of benefit status.<br/> 4. Jobcentre Plus applications include all applications originating from Jobcentre Plus where the parent with care is in receipt of Income Support or income based Jobseekers' Allowance at the time of application. It is not possible to identify those on Income Support separately.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.535W.2/2">The level of income at which income extinguishes entitlement to council tax benefit (CTB) will depend upon the liability for council tax as well as the individuals' personal circumstances. For this reason, it is not possible to provide income figures in the way envisaged in the question.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.2/3">People receiving the guarantee credit element of pension credit, income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or income-related employment support allowance are deemed to have no income or capital and they receive maximum CTB (subject to any standard deductions for any non-dependant household member).</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.2/4">People not receiving the income-related benefits listed above will have their CTB assessed on the basis of an &quot;applicable amount&quot;. The amount is made up of personal allowances and premiums. The personal allowances vary according to age and whether a person is single or one of a married or unmarried couple. The premiums are awarded to those groups identified as having extra needs, for example, long term sick or disabled people and elderly people.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.2/5">If net income is equal to or is less than the applicable amount, the customer will receive an amount equal to 100 per cent. of their council tax liability less any non-dependant deductions. If net income is more than the applicable amount, the customer will get less CTB. For each pound of extra income over the applicable amount, an adjustment of 20 pence will be made (this is the CTB taper).</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.2/6">In addition, anyone with savings, investments and other capital valued at more than &pound;16,000 will not normally qualify for CTB. Capital of &pound;6,000 or less is ignored. Capital of between &pound;6,000 and &pound;16,000 will be deemed to provide a weekly income of &pound;1 for every &pound;250 (or part thereof) if the person is aged less than 60, or &pound;1 for every &pound;500 (or part thereof) if they are 60 or over.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.2/7">The following tables set out the applicable amounts, and hence the level at which customers begin to start paying some council tax for the client groups listed in the question.</p>

	<p pid="d.537W.8/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about Jobcentre Plus Drug Co-ordinators including how many will be employed; what percentage of Jobcentre Plus offices they will cover; which grade they will be; and whether a job specification can be made available. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/5" class="indent">The introduction of Drug Co-ordinators is a joint initiative between Jobcentre Plus, the Department of Health (DH) and the National Treatment Agency (NTA) which has been put in place to support the National Drugs Strategy &quot;Drugs-Protecting Families and Communities&quot;. As part of this, the DH has put &pound;9 million into funding the posts from 2009-2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/6" class="indent">As responsibility for health is a devolved matter in Scotland and Wales, the DH can only fund Drug Co-ordinators in England, however, we will continue to work with officials in Scotland and Wales to try to ensure customers in these countries will have similar provision in the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/7" class="indent">We are currently recruiting to fill 63 Drug Co-ordinator posts at Band D (HEO) level. We will have at least one Drug Co-ordinator in place within each of our districts in England and they will be further supported by one of nine Strategic Lead posts (filled at Band F/Grade 7) which will be based within their region.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/8" class="indent">The decision to put in place district-based Drug Co-ordinators was based on research carried out by Glasgow University in 2006. The research provided information about the number of known problem drug users in specific geographical areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/9" class="indent">We already have eight Drug Co-ordinators in post, and expect that a further 52 will be in place by the end of March, with the remaining three posts being filled during April. We expect that well before October, all of the posts will have been filled and we will have a dedicated Drug Co-ordinator in post within every Jobcentre Plus district in England.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/10" class="indent">Whilst the Drug Co-ordinator posts are based at district level, part of their job is to ensure that customer-facing advisers within their district are aware of the help and support that we will be able to offer customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.8/11" class="indent">This means that a customer attending any Jobcentre Plus office in England who declares they are a problem drug user, will be offered a referral to a discussion with a treatment provider.</p>

	<p pid="d.541W.5/1">There is a statutory requirement to review all social security benefits each year and to consider whether they have retained their value in relation to the general level of prices. (The standard minimum guarantee in pension credit must be reviewed against the general level of earnings). A further requirement calls for certain benefits, including the state pension, to be up-rated at least in line with the increase in prices from April of the following year.</p>
	<p pid="d.541W.5/2">Following the most recent review, that took place in the autumn of last year, the rate of full basic state pension that will apply from this April will be &pound;95.25. This amounts to an increase in the current rate of &pound;4.55, which is in line with inflation as measured last September, when the Retail Prices Index was 5 per cent. This increase, against a backdrop of falling inflation, is in line with the highest increase in inflation last year and the biggest increase in the state pension since 2001. The increase in the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit to &pound;130 for single pensioners (&pound;198.45 for pensioner couples) from April more than keeps pace with earnings and represents the highest up-lift since it was introduced in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.541W.5/3">Furthermore, in order to provide direct financial support through the economic downturn pensioners have also received additional winter fuel payments this year that have increased the payments to &pound;250 for eligible households with someone aged 60 to 79 and &pound;400 for eligible households with someone aged over 80. In addition, for this year the Department has increased the Christmas bonus from &pound;10 to &pound;70 and increased the cold weather payment from &pound;8.50 to &pound;25.</p>

	<p pid="d.543W.5/1">Support for mortgage interest is available to those homeowners who qualify for one of the income-related benefits, income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance or pension credit. It is an integral component of those benefits. Couples are treated as a single unit in these benefits and if one member of a couple is in remunerative work of 24-hours or more, or has income which exceeds their entitlement, then they cannot receive the benefit. Only those couples who are not in remunerative work and who meet the other qualifying conditions of the benefit can receive support for mortgage interest. This is intended to ensure that resources are directed to where they are most needed and there are no plans to change this policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.543W.5/2">Support for mortgage interest is not the only form of help for homeowners in difficulty paying their mortgages. For example, the Government's Mortgage Rescue scheme provides &pound;200 million to support up to 6,000 of the most vulnerable homeowners facing repossession to remain in their home. The Homeowner Mortgage Support scheme, which we expect to be open for business with the first lenders in April, will help ensure hard working people, including couples, who suffer a temporary loss of income can stay in their home. Both schemes are being led by Communities and Local Government.</p>

	<p pid="d.548W.5/1">The SBRI is a mechanism by which Government Departments can seek to encourage the business community to develop innovative solutions to meet the Department's needs. All Departments are eligible to participate, and, following the successful outcome of the pilot programme, I encourage all those with appropriate research and development needs to consider using this mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="d.548W.5/2">Lord Drayson and Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Angela Eagle, wrote to ministerial colleagues on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-05">5 November</phrase> inviting participation in the scheme. The Technology Strategy Board, which manages the SBRI programme, has over the last year engaged with all central departments, to seek to identify suitable opportunities for the use of SBRI. As stated in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-25">25 February</phrase>, a &pound;10 million competition with the Department for Communities and Local Government will be launched in March, and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Health, and the Department for Transport also have advanced plans for SBRI competitions in 2009. The TSB is continuing to work with other Departments to identify further cases where the Departments could benefit from making use of SBRI to meet their technology development needs.</p>

From September 2009 all remaining local authorities will begin delivering up to 10-hours a week, over 38-weeks a year.

	<p pid="d.552W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-04">4 March 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/4" class="indent">From 1998 to March 2007, Ofsted inspected standards in education and training in the juvenile estate with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons. From 1996 to April 2004, Ofsted inspected standards in education and training at local authority secure children's homes and secure training centres with the Social Services Inspectorate; and from April 2004 to March 2007, it did so with the Commission for Social Care Inspection. Since April 2007, Ofsted has had sole responsibility for the inspection of secure children's homes and secure training centres. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons maintains its lead responsibility for the prison estate.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/5" class="indent">Prior to April 2007, Ofsted did not publish its own reports on juvenile estate establishments, including secure children's homes and secure training centres, but contributed to the report of the lead inspectorate. Since April 2007, Ofsted has published reports on secure children's homes and secure training centres. Please note that there have only been a small number of inspections annually.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/6" class="indent">Ofsted provides an annual summary of its assessment of this provision in Her Majesty's Chief Inspectors' Annual Reports. As Ofsted did not publish any of its own reports until 2007, the Annual Reports are the only continuous and comparative form of assessment relating to this area of provision over the past five years.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/7" class="indent">For the purposes of the following reports, the term 'secure settings' refers to secure children's homes and secure training centres accommodating children and young people under 18 years of age, and other establishments accommodating Juvenile/Young People offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/8" class="indent">The following excerpts are taken from the Annual Reports of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools 2004/05 and 2005/06, and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services, and Skills for 2006/07 and 2007/08.</p>

	<p pid="d.552W.9/11" class="indentitalic"> Main Findings</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/12" class="indent">Provision across the range of secure settings and within types of setting varies widely. Some young people are well served; others, already disadvantaged, have a poor deal which does little to help them to improve their life chances. Establishments vary, for example, in the extent of specialist teaching facilities and resources and the range of options available to them. Generally, provision for students to work towards qualifications at level 2 and above is limited.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/13" class="indent">Out of 10 young offender institutions inspected, two were judged to be very good, six satisfactory and two unsatisfactory. The provision for juveniles (15-17 year-olds) was better than that for young offenders (18-21 year-olds) mainly because they benefited from additional resources for this age group from the Youth Justice Board. The appointment of special educational needs coordinators and learning support assistants has improved initial assessment, the targeting and quality of one-to-one support and the quality of pastoral care for juveniles.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/14" class="indent">The establishments judged to be very good featured: very good leadership; effective behaviour management, support and guidance; rigorous monitoring of attendance; and effective arrangements for young people unable or unwilling to attend classes. In the poorer establishments, much of the teaching lacked challenge; education, training and residential activities were poorly integrated and accreditation rates were low.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/15" class="indent">Three of the seven local authority children's homes inspected were good or better; two were satisfactory, but two were unsatisfactory. In the best, there was a strong emphasis on assessing and monitoring students' progress and liaison and support from the local authority were excellent. By contrast, insufficient emphasis on achievement, inadequate quality assurance arrangements and weak links between education and care staff characterised unsatisfactory practice.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/16" class="indent">Two of the three secure training centres inspected were very good. In these, there were wide opportunities for accreditation, the learning environment was attractive and provision well resourced. By contrast, two detention and immigration centres inspected were poorly resourced and accommodation in one was cramped. Despite these difficulties, teacher-pupil relationships in the centres were good. Pupils were well-behaved, keen to learn and supported each other, particularly in relation to resolving language difficulties.</p>

	<p pid="d.552W.9/18" class="indentitalic"> The quality of education and care: Provision for young people in secure settings</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/19" class="indentitalic"> Main Findings</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/20" class="indent">Overall, standards across the range of secure settings remain too variable and the curriculum offered is often too narrow to meet the needs of the young people. Of 13 institutions inspected, two secure children's homes and one young offender institution are inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/21" class="indent">Only one establishment, a secure training centre, is very good and two secure children's homes and one young offender institution are good. There has been an improvement, however, in the management of the young people's behaviour and it is satisfactory overall in the settings inspected. The more effective institutions are successful in meeting the needs of a wide range of young people, many of whom have had little or no experience of educational success. A minority of settings have developed an appropriate range of vocational and academic courses. In these institutions, young people enjoy their education and often make good progress; many experience success for the first time in their lives. However, levels of accreditation remain low in too many institutions and opportunities for progression to more advanced courses are limited. This is particularly pertinent for young people aged 16 and over in young offender institutions. More able young people are often working below their capabilities and few gain GCSE qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/22" class="indent">The range of vocational courses is narrow in too many institutions, restricting opportunities for young people to acquire the skills that will help them to gain employment or access to further training on their release from custody. Teaching of the basic skills of literacy and numeracy is often poor. Lessons fail to motivate or engage young people. In the more effective institutions, literacy and numeracy are linked successfully to vocational work and their life experiences.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/23" class="indent">The needs of young people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities are not always met appropriately. In the better settings, teaching is lively and engaging. Young people are given interesting and challenging tasks that they enjoy. They respond well to good teaching, make sound progress and are justifiably proud of their achievements. The collection of information about the young people's achievements, progress and attendance is improving and is now available to support teaching staff more effectively. However, this information is used effectively in only a small number of institutions. Young people's individual learning plans are not used successfully to plan their work or to monitor their progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/24" class="indent">The more successful settings draw on a variety of resources and external partners to develop creative and interesting educational experiences for young people. External agencies are often effective in raising the young people's aspirations. Most institutions are successful in making the environment as attractive as possible, often in very difficult circumstances. Rewards and incentives are used effectively to motivate young people, but only in a minority of institutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/25" class="indent">In the settings inspected, the management of poor and inappropriate behaviour has improved in recent years and is satisfactory overall. It is good in institutions where the behaviour policy is clearly understood and consistently applied. Relationships between prison and education staff in young offender institutions are generally good. Some aspects of prison life, however, continue to have a negative effect on teaching and learning. For example, movement from residential to education units is often delayed, adversely affecting both punctuality and young people's learning. There are too few opportunities for young people to share their opinions about the education and training they receive.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/26" class="indent">Arrangements for the care and progress of young people about to leave custody are not good enough. Insufficient attention is paid to preparing them for their return to the community. Careers education and guidance are often poor. The lack of appropriate education and training for these young people once they are released is a real concern.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/27" class="indent">In most of the settings inspected there has been steady improvement in leadership and management. Senior managers are now more focused on improving the quality of provision. Self-assessment and the rigour of lesson observations have improved.</p>

	<p pid="d.552W.9/29" class="indentitalic"> Quality and Standards: Educational provision for young people in secure settings</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/30" class="indent">The provision for young people with learning difficulties or disabilities is not always matched to their needs. Staff do not make effective use of individual learning plans in considering the next steps in learning or in tracking the progress of the young people.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/31" class="indent">The more effective institutions work with a range of external partners to plan challenging and imaginative programmes for learners and to raise their ambitions for the future. Staff in most institutions overcome considerable difficulties to make the accommodation as pleasant as possible through, for example, the imaginative use of learners' artwork. Incentives are generally used well to encourage the young people.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/32" class="indent">Increasingly, planned educational provision within secure children's homes is contributing to the five outcomes of the Every Child Matters legislation, especially to 'be healthy', with many units aspiring to the Healthy Schools initiative. However, little focus is given to the Every Child Matters agenda for children and young people in young offender institutions. Limited opportunities for release on temporary licence severely inhibit the preparation of young people to gain employment and so to achieve economic well-being on their return to the community.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/33" class="indent">The management of unacceptable behaviour has improved further in the institutions inspected. Behaviour is good in institutions where the behaviour policy is understood clearly and applied consistently. In young offender institutions, there has been a marked reduction in the number of young people being returned to residential wings from education for poor behaviour. Relationships between prison and residential care staff and education staff across the range of secure accommodation are generally good. Progress in making sure that education and training are given priority within settings is variable.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/34" class="indent">Too often, security issues inhibit access to appropriate provision for children and young people. There remain some aspects of institutional life which have an adverse effect on the quality of educational provision. For example, moving the young people from residential accommodation to teaching areas often takes too long so that they arrive late and learning time is lost.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/35" class="indent">The provision for young people about to return to the outside world remains uneven in quality. Not enough is done to help them prepare for their release and there are not enough opportunities for them to access vocational learning or to develop independent living skills. Links between education and resettlement departments are often tenuous. The quality of careers guidance and education is often inadequate. The failure to provide suitable education and training to young people for the community element of their sentences, or upon release, remains a significant concern.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/36" class="indent">The quality of leadership and management has improved in most of the secure estates inspected. Senior managers now place more emphasis on improving the quality of provision, but in some settings this has not yet resulted in improved outcomes. There is greater rigour in institutional self-assessment and in the evaluation of teaching and learning, but there is still some overestimation of effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/37" class="indentitalic"> Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills Annual Report 2007/08</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/38" class="indentitalic"> Quality and Standards: Educational provision for children and young people in secure settings</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/39" class="indent">Provision of education and training in the four secure training centres was inspected during 2007/08. Of these, education and training are outstanding in one, good in two and satisfactory in the fourth. There were full inspections of seven secure children's homes, of which one is outstanding, three are good and three are satisfactory. There were two full inspections of young offender institutions holding children; both of these institutions are satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/40" class="indent">The improvements reported in last year's Annual Report have been strengthened, especially in the behaviour of children and young people. In most institutions, leadership and management are successful in supporting children's personal and social development. Education in the secure children's homes inspected makes a strong contribution to the Every Child Matters outcomes, with children understanding and following healthy lifestyles and knowing how to stay safe.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/41" class="indent">On arrival in secure institutions, many children and young people have poor attitudes to learning and experiences of it; indeed, many are unused to participating in structured education of any kind. Behaviour is managed more successfully than in the past and improves quickly. Most behaviour is now good in the institutions inspected. This is achieved most effectively where care staff and teachers collaborate and manage behaviour consistently.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/42" class="indent">Initial assessment of children's and young people's levels of literacy and numeracy is well established and effective. Nearly all children and young people enter institutions with levels of literacy and numeracy well below those found nationally for their ages. There has been an appropriate emphasis on improving basic skills and children make very good progress when opportunities for improving literacy and numeracy are linked to subjects across the curriculum. Most young people leave custody with some form of accreditation in these essential skills and, more generally, levels of accreditation are now at least satisfactory in most of the institutions inspected.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/43" class="indent">Teaching and learning are generally best in vocational and practical subjects, where they are consistently at least satisfactory. In the best classes, teachers have high expectations of learners and plan interesting and varied activities. Less successful lessons provide insufficient challenge, the pace is too slow and young people are bored and lose concentration.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/44" class="indent">The range of vocational provision is too often narrow. Most children and young people have too few opportunities to gain work-related skills that will help them move on to further education, employment or additional training on release. Evening enrichment activities are available in most institutions and, in some cases, the skills gained by young people are accredited through external qualifications. Often, these activities add significantly to their enjoyment of education.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/45" class="indent">Guidance and support are generally strengths of the sector. Most institutions have effective initial assessment procedures that identify any additional support needs quickly, although this information is not always used well to inform teaching and learning. Children and young people are helped to settle in quickly through good induction procedures. Target-setting and monitoring of progress have improved; they are now generally good and, in a few cases, outstanding. Some secure children's homes have developed a system of weekly tutorials which are used well to review progress. Teaching assistants generally provide effective support but, in a few cases, they are not appropriately qualified and are unsure of their role.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/46" class="indent">The improvements seen in the last two years in leadership and management are now having a positive impact, especially in the areas of managing behaviour and in guidance and support. Institutions are now producing more evaluative self-assessment reports. Frequently, managers identify the key weaknesses and take decisive action that improves outcomes for young people. Lesson observations by managers are now well established and, in most cases, this has contributed to improvements in teaching and learning. Centres use data more effectively to measure learners' progress and to set challenging targets. Increasingly, institutions are developing procedures to seek the views of the young people and staff, but this is not consistent across the sector. Relationships between care and education staff are generally good, and communication between groups of staff has improved significantly. There is great variation in the quality of resources, especially in terms of accommodation and facilities.</p>

	<p pid="d.558W.2/1">Girls have out-performed boys since GCSE examinations were introduced in 1988. In 2008 69.9 per cent. of girls and 60.9 per cent. of boys achieved 5+ A*-C grade GCSEs. Girls are ahead of boys at all stages of education. The gap in England has been broadly stable over two decades, and is in line with that in other OECD countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.558W.2/2">The reasons are complex but appear mainly related to differences of biology, maturation, and attitudes to learning and reading at different ages. The Department's 2007 research paper &quot;Gender and education: the evidence on pupils in England&quot;, of which there is a copy in the Library of the House, sets out the research evidence.</p>
	<p pid="d.558W.2/3">Two points should be noted: first, boys' GCSE attainment has improved sharply over the past decade, broadly keeping pace with that of girls; second, gender gaps can be minimised by good teaching practice and by the encouragement of reading, ensuring that pupils of both genders make good progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.558W.2/4">Through its &quot;Gender Agenda&quot; programme the Department has been leading a programme of action research activities designed to identify and spread good practice in raising boys' motivation and attainment. An interim report has been published and a final report will be made available at the end of the programme.</p>

Local authorities are responsible for planning provision for their areas. The Department allocates basic need capital to enable authorities to fund new places in response to pupil number growth. To ensure that local authorities can plan strategically, funding is fixed for three years at the beginning of each spending review period (the current period runs from April 2008 to March 2011). In determining basic need allocations, the Department uses local authorities' own pupil number forecasts, expecting authorities themselves to take account of local factors that will influence future pupil numbers such as birth rate, new housing and population migration. The Department relies on the accuracy of local authority forecasts as it does not hold back funds to allow for future changes.</p>

	<p pid="d.561W.0/1">Religious education (RE) is a statutory part of the basic school curriculum. Schools must teach RE according to locally agreed syllabuses or in the case of voluntary aided schools with a religious character, according to the trust deed of the school. Local Standing Advisory Councils for RE (SACREs) have the responsibility to ensure that local syllabuses develop pupils' knowledge, understanding and awareness of Christianity and the major religions represented in the country and reflect the values and traditions of the community. RE encourages respect for those holding different beliefs and helps promote pupils' moral, cultural and spiritual development.</p>
	<p pid="d.561W.0/2">In 2004, the Department with the QCA published a non-statutory framework for RE which has been supported by all the main faith groups and the British Humanist Association. It says that pupils should learn about Christianity throughout each key stage and, by the end of Key Stage 3, pupils should have encountered the other five principal religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism) in sufficient depth. It also recommends that pupils have opportunities to study other religious traditions such as the Baha'i faith, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and secular philosophies such as humanism.</p>

	<p pid="d.563W.2/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>, the Children Act 2004, which followed the Victoria Climbi&eacute; inquiry and the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; Green Paper, has required local authorities to have a single director of children's services with responsibility for education and children's social services. This single officer provides a clear line of accountability for, and strong leadership of, all children's services.</p>
	<p pid="d.563W.2/2">Inspectorates assess the effectiveness of children's services. Until 2008, Ofsted made an annual performance assessment (APA) of each council's children's services. Inspectorates undertook a joint area review (JAR) of children's services in each local authority area during the period from 2005 to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.563W.2/3">From 2009, APAs and JARs will be replaced by a new comprehensive area assessment (CAA), led by the Audit Commission and including Ofsted and other relevant inspectorates. CAAs will report annually on services, including children's services, in each local authority area. Ofsted will lead a programme to inspect children's safeguarding and services for looked-after children, in each local authority area every three years. Inspectors may also decide to carry out inspections on other services, should a CAA report indicate that they are poor and not improving.</p>

	<p pid="d.566W.2/5" class="indent">Please be aware that the framework for inspecting maintained special schools changed in January 2000, September 2003 and September 2005. As a result, there has been no consistent 'inadequate' category over this period. These tables are, therefore, limited to those maintained special schools placed in special measures, as this category has been in place throughout the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="d.566W.2/6" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to right hon. Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="d.590W.0/2">The UK Government recognises that losing the individual's right to opt-out of the 48-hour working week as set by the Working Time Directive, would have a detrimental effect on the hours which firefighters working the retained duty system could be available for duty, especially the substantial numbers who work full time for their primary employer. Many other workers also use this important flexibility and so and we remain firmly of the view that this right should remain. We, along with a majority of other member states are fighting for the retention of the opt-out as this dossier progresses through the European negotiation process.</p>
	<p pid="d.590W.0/3">I am very aware of the widespread concern on this issue amongst retained firefighters, and both from my Department and the Department for Communities and Local Government have worked very closely with the Retained Firefighters' Union and will continue to keep them informed throughout the negotiations.</p>
