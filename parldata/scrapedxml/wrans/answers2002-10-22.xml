	<p pid=".132W.0/2">The BFI finds that the council had implemented improvements since its Best Value Review and the BFI Best Value inspection in October 2001. The introduction of a customer service team has had a positive impact on claims processing speed as this team deals with all telephone enquiries from claimants, which allows processing of claims without interruption. The council had set challenging targets to answering telephone calls quickly and BFI found the service to be efficient.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/3">The report identifies a number of strengths and good practices. The council is commended for the high standard of verifying claims for benefit, recording the required evidence to support the claim and using efficient procedures to control and monitor claims.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/4">The council has effective mechanisms for the identification, classification and recovery of overpayments and is commended for its use of management information for monitoring performance. However, the report notes that a number of cases sampled had been incorrectly classified. The council is recommended to use its powers to recover debt in all appropriate cases to improve the rate of recovery.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/5">The council is also commended for its partnership approach to long-term strategies. The Community Plan has been produced with 15 public, private and voluntary sector organisations after extensive consultation with local people.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/6">The report recognises the council's commitment to fraud prevention, deterrence and detection. Fraud awareness among benefit staff is high and this is reflected in the number of high quality fraud referrals that benefit staff make to the council's fraud investigators.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/7">BFI expresses concern with the lack of management checks on IT security. The council has responded positively to this and has taken immediate steps to rectify the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".132W.3/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on North Ayrshire Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-18">18 September 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/2">The report finds that in the first instance, the council had been delivering an inadequate benefits service. The council needs to take some basic decisions on its operational strategy for delivering benefits, such as the structure, location and management arrangements for benefits administration and counter fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/3">In terms of delivering the service, the report notes that the standards expected for verifying claims to benefit were not being met. Contributory factors included a poorly designed claim form that failed to guide the claimant to complete it accurately, the absence of quality checks to identify weaknesses, insufficient staff training, the lack of a visiting team to undertake targeted checks and a constant backlog of cases. A high percentage of private sector claims were not being referred to the Rent Officer and were thus avoiding the required controls on rent and benefit levels.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/4">The council operates decentralised benefit processing within its housing offices. At the time of the inspection, there were longstanding backlogs of work. The speed of processing was poor but varied across area and benefit type. Claimants were not receiving the same standard of service across the council's area.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/5">The BFI expresses major concerns over the safety and security of the council's IT systems to support the benefits service.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/6">Overpayments have been found to be a particularly weak area of the council's performance. The BFI considers that improvement is needed across all areas, including accuracy, identifying, recording and recovering overpayments. Improvements are also needed on the audit trail for decision making and management information.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/7">The council was not generating the management information needed to manage benefits effectively. For example, in the areas of workflow and capacity, appeals and overpayments.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/8">BFI commends the council for funding Professionalism in Security (PINS) training for its counter fraud staff. At the time of the inspection, fraud investigation was found to be inadequate but the signs were that this would improve. The council needs to develop its Prevention and Detection of Fraud and Corruption policy to include objectives, reporting arrangements, sanctions, review arrangements and how it will evaluate its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/9">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-19">19 September 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/10">The BFI first inspected and published a report on Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council in October 1999. The report made eight major recommendations to improve performance.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/11">This follow up report finds that while progress had been made in implementing these recommendations it had been too little and too slow.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/12">The first inspection made a number of recommendations to improve the council's internal security. Some of these have been implemented but IT access controls remains weak, division of duties is not always appropriate, there is inadequate management checking and insufficient internal audit coverage.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/13">The correct verification of claims was highlighted as an issue at the first inspection and remained inconsistent at the time of the follow up inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/14">Significant improvements were needed to the council's procedures for backdating claims. While some of these had been implemented, the follow up inspection showed there was still a need for improvement, in particular record keeping of applications for backdating. Further improvements were also needed to the council's claim form to ensure that claimants provide sufficient information to allow assessment of the claim.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/15">There had been a noticeable improvement, including the appointment of a new fraud manager, in the council's counter fraud work although much of this improvement took place in the months leading up to the on-site phase of the follow up inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/16">The council dealt speedily with the processing of new and renewal claims, unfortunately, the BFI found that the number of errors entering the system at the time of inputting the information was increasing, with 11 mistakes found in a sample of 40 claims. The problem of a considerable backlog of new and renewal claims had been resolved.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/17">An improved working relationship with the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service (now joined as Jobcentre Plus) is noted in the report.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/18">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/19">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-26">26 September 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/20">The report finds that the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames had made many improvements during the 2 years before the BFI inspection and since bringing the benefits service back in house after a period of outsourcing. In some areas this improvement was significant.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/21">These improvements include reductions in the time taken to process new and repeat claims and notifications of changes in circumstances. However, the council needs to improve further in these areas if it is to achieve its Best Value targets.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/22">Other improvements made by the council include the implementation of the BFI national model claim form and Verification Framework, sustained improvements in key customer services and a reduced backlog of work which has led to reductions in customer complaints.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/23">The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames still needs to improve its verification of claims, the quality of its fraud investigations and become more effective at recovering overpayments. This is critical if the #30.6m of benefit paid to 6,000 claimants is to be brought under tighter control.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/24">The report finds that the council had a clear prosecution policy to deter fraudsters but identifies weaknesses in the quality of fraud investigations. The report acknowledges the successful prosecution of fraudsters in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/25">Overall the report concludes that the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames has established a good platform from which it can make the necessary improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.3/26">In 2000/01, the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames administered approximately #30.6 million in housing benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".135W.2/2">The BFI reports that the council's management of the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit was poor with weaknesses in many areas.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/3">Access to the benefits system was not sound and the council did not ensure that claims were right from day one. Information was not routinely verified or cross checked and management was not monitoring performance. This significantly increased the risk of fraud and error at the outset of the claim.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/4">The council did not detect when payments went wrong and take prompt action to correct them with appropriate penalties to deter a recurrence. Delays in dealing with changes of circumstances have increased the number and level of preventable overpayments.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/5">Considerable delays occurred in the assessment and payment of benefit. Management was not monitoring the processes to ensure that bottlenecks and backlogs were quickly identified as they appeared. This caused hardships to claimants and by failing to make payments on account in appropriate cases the council increased this.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/6">Insufficient resources were devoted to recovering overpayments of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. As a result, the council was failing to control the level of outstanding debt.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/7">The BFI also found that the council's counter fraud performance was poor. Weaknesses were identified in the management of the investigation team and the quality of the investigative work.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/8">The council is commended for its commitment to its anti-poverty strategy and for promoting the take up of benefit. Its dedicated team has helped Enfield residents to receive more than #12 million in new and additional welfare benefits since 1996.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/9">The report concludes that the council needs to improve the management and effectiveness of its working practices within the benefit service in order to deliver its corporate vision.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/10">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on Wakefield Metropolitan District Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-09">9 October 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/11">The report finds that in March 2001, the council completed a Best Value Review of the benefits function. The review identified a need to improve in key areas such as claims processing, management checking and overpayment administration. The report finds performance in these key areas is poor. However, BFI recognises the efforts being made by the council to improve performance.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/12">The council's practices for processing benefit claims differed across its 13 sites, and there was a 6 weeks backlog of work creating queries and complaints. The council was intending to centralise its benefit function as an answer to many of its problems, however insufficient plans for centralisation had been produced.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/13">Whilst the report finds examples of good practices, it found differing levels of performance and procedures across the council. The inconsistent verification of benefit claims and low levels of management checks were identified as key weaknesses, increasing the risk of fraud and error entering the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/14">The council intends implementing the Verification Framework before March 2003 and it was improving its corporate performance measurement framework. These initiatives combined with centralisation should put the council in a position to provide a much improved benefits service.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/15">The report finds very poor performance in the council's administration of overpayments of benefit, with benefit debt increasing and errors being made. However, the council was enhancing its IT system to improve its performance in overpayment administration.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/16">The council had a sound approach to countering fraud and corruption, and had undertaken some good quality fraud prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/17">The report concludes that there is a clear need for the council to improve its benefit performance as the inspection identified many cases of poor performance. However, BFI was encouraged that the council was aware of the challenges it was facing, and with the level of interest shown by elected Members, both in the inspection and the benefit service.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.2/18">In 1999&ndash;2000, Wakefield Metropolitan District Council administered approximately #65.2 million in housing benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.2/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on Babergh District Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-10">10 October 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/2">The BFI first inspected and published a report on Babergh District Council in April 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/3">This report finds that Babergh District Council had made significant improvements since the first inspection. Despite backlogs of work, the council had made progress in its housing benefits administration and counter fraud work. Throughout the inspection, BFI identified improvements and good practices that had been implemented since the first inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/4">The report finds that the council had introduced initiatives to raise awareness of housing benefits among its residents, and had reviewed its Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit claim form.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/5">The council had introduced the Verification Framework, improving the collection and recording of evidence to support new claims for benefit, and it was identifying and checking any inconsistencies to reduce fraud and error. All new claims were subject to a 100 per cent. quality check.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/6">However, the report finds that the council needed to improve its evidence gathering for renewal benefit claims and not make awards before all the necessary evidence was collected.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/7">The report finds backlogs of work, arising from the simultaneous implementation of the Verification Framework and a new IT system for processing housing benefits claims, which were severely affecting the processing times for all claims.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/8">The report finds a marked improvement in counter fraud work, with investigators receiving Professionalism in Security training and a full range of investigations being undertaken. The District Auditor had reported satisfaction with the council's counter fraud measures.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/9">Overpayments had increased since the first inspection, mainly due to the backlogs of work and IT changes. Levels of recovery had dropped and overpayment cases were not well documented or subject to quality checks.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/10">In 2000&ndash;01, Babergh District Council administered approximately #12.8 million in housing benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/11">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/12">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on Swale Borough Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-25">25 September 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/13">The BFI first inspected and published a report on Swale Borough Council in April 2000. The report found that while the council demonstrated some good working practices, the efficiency and security of the benefits system was compromised by a backlog of work and a lack of a clear sense of direction and purpose in its counter fraud strategy. At that time, the council had undergone a period of significant change.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/14">This report finds that of the 40 recommendations made in the April 2000 report, the council had implemented 6 in full, partially implemented 24 and not implemented 10.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/15">The report commends Swale Borough Council for its commitment in clearing the backlog of work, which was having a detrimental effect during BFI's first inspection. This required a heavy investment in increasing and training its staffing on the benefit section.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/16">There have also been improvements in the council's benefit claim form, the levels of verification and the speed of processing claims and notifications of change of circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/17">There were still problems with the council's counter fraud operations. BFI reports that a lack of effective management had hampered the way that the unit operated. The report finds a general lack of management checking and controls to guard the system against fraud, error and abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/18">The report finds significant problems with overpayments not being accurately classified and the situation had worsened since the first report. The council did not always impose the maximum deduction for the recovery of fraudulent overpayments.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/19">The counter fraud operation was not being sufficiently managed and there was minimal management checking and little direction during fraud investigations.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/20">The council's post opening operation was found to be insecure and BFI expresses concern to find that numerous recommendations made in this area in the first report remained unactioned.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/21">In conclusion, the council had only partially delivered the improvements that it said it would in its response to the Secretary of State following the publication of the BFI's first inspection report, published in April 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.2/22">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.2/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on the Erewash Borough Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-26">26 September 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/2">The report finds Erewash Borough Council failing to deliver an adequate and secure benefit service. There were significant weaknesses in the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit and counter fraud work. There were also significant backlogs of work.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/3">At the time of BFI's inspection, the council had been in a state of constant change for over 4 years, and no senior manager was in post with specific responsibility, or expertise in, housing benefits or counter fraud work. This lack of expertise and key personnel had resulted in a complete lack of strategic direction. Council Members were aware of these problems but the council had made slow progress to resolve the issues. The report finds earlier plans had proved to be of limited use and much rested on the appointment of new chief officers.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/4">Despite the serious lack of managerial involvement at a high level, the efforts of benefits staff must not be ignored as they devised procedures, which were a positive measure. They attempted to improve standards by implementing the Verification Framework, expanding customer services and organising occasional landlord forums. Although fragmented, these efforts were a positive step.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/5">There was a serious lack of control of benefits work. There were no quality or management checks, no formal procedures and little training. Staff resources were inadequate.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/6">The introduction of a new IT system was poorly planned and managed, and the system was not used to its full potential. Management information from the housing benefits IT system was unreliable and there were serious flaws in the security of the system.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/7">The report finds errors in all stages of the overpayment process, with little control or monitoring, and no one appointed with specific responsibility for overpayment work.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/8">The council had poor counter fraud performance in all aspects of its operation. Fraud investigations lacked depth and substance and this impaired its ability to prosecute fraudsters.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/9">Erewash Borough Council only fully implemented 9 of 30 recommendations, made by the District Auditor 3 years before the BFI inspection, to improve its counter fraud arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/10">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on East Dunbartonshire Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-07">7 October 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/11">The BFI first inspected and published a report on East Dunbartonshire Council in March 1999. The report found that the council was a poor-performing authority that needed to design and develop a more secure and accurate benefits administration system and improve the quality of its benefits service.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/12">This report finds that the council had responded positively to the findings in the first report and had introduced some improvements in its administration of housing benefits. However, some key recommendations from the first inspection had not been properly addressed and minimal progress had been made in counter fraud work.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/13">The introduction of the Verification Framework in April 2001 had improved the evidence gathering process. However, the use of the same sub-standard claim form that was in place at the first inspection and poor staff training meant that the majority of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit awards were based on poor or inadequate evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/14">There had been minimal improvement in counter fraud operations, which continued to be poor. Despite the introduction of a prosecution policy, no cases had been prosecuted and no other forms of sanctions had been considered. Weaknesses surrounding the council's post opening and cheque dispatch procedures continued to exist.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/15">However, the report finds that the council had significantly improved in the recovery of benefit overpayments from claimants and landlords who were still receiving benefit. The council was less effective at recovering overpayments from debtors who were no longer receiving benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/16">The report concludes that while some progress has been made across benefits administration, it has in the main been slow. There is much to do to address the weaknesses identified at the follow up inspection and for those that remain outstanding from the first inspection. The council agreed to review the range of corporate duties allocated to the Benefits Manager to enable more management time to be given to improving its benefits service</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/17">In 2000&ndash;01, East Dunbartonshire Council administered approximately #12.7 million in housing benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/18">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/19">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) follow up inspection report on St. Helens Metropolitan Borough Council was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-08">8 October 2002</phrase> and copies of the report were placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/20">The BFI first inspected and published a report on St. Helens Metropolitan Borough Council in April 2000. The report found that the council needed to develop a more secure and accurate benefits administration system and improve the overall quality of its benefits service.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/21">This report finds that the council had responded positively and delivered all 16 major recommendations from the earlier BFI inspection. The report finds that the council had made significant progress and had delivered a major programme of change that had significantly raised the standards of its administration of housing benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/22">Since the first inspection, the council had undertaken a Best Value Review of its benefits service and had introduced the Verification Framework. It had also increased management and staffing levels, reorganised the way it delivers benefits, and enhanced its IT systems.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/23">The council had also introduced a new claim form, and had introduced management quality checking to test the quality and accuracy of benefit awards. The council was also actively reducing the backlogs of work that had been affecting processing times and causing overpayments.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/24">The report finds that the verification process had improved significantly with 66 per cent. of cases examined containing proper evidence. Only 30 per cent. of cases were properly verified at the first inspection. The council plans to provide staff training to raise standards further.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/25">The council had introduced a benefits prosecution policy and had significantly improved its counter fraud operations, with the quality of its fraud investigations improving considerably since the first inspection. However, despite these improvements, outstanding overpaid benefit debt had increased and the council had brought few prosecutions against offenders and had made no use of other sanctions.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/26">The report concludes that there is scope for improvement across the council's benefit service but BFI was encouraged by the progress made since the first inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/27">In 2000&ndash;01, St. Helens Metropolitan Borough Council administered approximately #51 million in housing benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/28">The report makes recommendations to help the council address the remaining weaknesses and to further improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>

While a decision on the ship's future has yet to be made, there is no reason at this time to suppose that repairing her will not be worthwhile. We have therefore invited those UK shiprepair companies with the necessary in-depth knowledge and experience of maintaining and repairing Type 42 Destroyers and their systems to visit the ship to make their own assessments of the damage and tender for any repair work. This invitation has been issued without any commitment from the Ministry of Defence to proceed with the repairs should it not be cost effective to do so. One of the companies invited to visit Nottingham on this basis is Fleet Support Limited, the commercial operators of the Naval facilities at Portsmouth.</p>

This has the objective of promoting the emergence of democratically accountable and professional security forces. Contacts have included visits to the United Kingdom by Indonesian politicians, civilian government officials, police and military officers to discuss issues such as defence management, promoting greater transparency and accountability of military expenditure, rules of engagement and the role of the military in support of the civil authorities. United Kingdom visitors to Indonesia have covered similar issues.

	<p pid=".154W.2/1">The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) are statutory advisers to the Department for Transport on the transport and mobility needs of disabled people. The Committee was set up under S.125 of the Transport Act 1985 and it is also recognised in a number of other Acts including the Railways Act 1993 and the Transport Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/2">DPTAC does not employ staff direct. The Department for Transport supports the Secretariat and administrative functions of the Committee and staff from the Department are appointed to those posts. Until the 2000&ndash;01 Financial Year the Committee's costs were not separately identified, but the cost to the Department since then has been: #215K (00&ndash;01) and #265K (01&ndash;02). The budget for this year is #289K and this is likely to remain the same for the following Financial Year.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/3">The Rail Passengers Council (RPC) was set up in its current form by the Railways Act 1993, with its powers and name amended by the Transport Act 2000. The Council along with the Rail Passengers Committees&mdash;whose work it co-ordinates&mdash;is the statutory watchdog protecting and promoting the interests of rail passengers. Its statutory duties are set out in sections 76 and 77 of the Railways Act 1993, as amended by the Transport Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/4">The Council is finalising a new mission statement and long-term goals, on which it will be consulting later in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/5">The Council's mission statement and aims are set out in its annual report. Copies of which are available in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/6">At present the Council employs 21 permanent and fixed term staff. It is currently sponsored by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) and the details of the overall annual budgets for the Council and Committees are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/7" class="indent">97&ndash;98&mdash;#1.6m</p>

	<p pid=".155W.5/1">The Department has had discussions with Transport for London and has received enquiries from other bus operators about the use of water-diesel emulsion fuels in public transport vehicles. The Department is aware that diesel emulsions can deliver some environmental benefits, in particular through reduced NOx and emissions of particulate mass but there is evidence of increased hydrocarbons and ultra-fine particle emissions. There is an emerging view among medical experts that, potentially, ultra-fine particles may have a significant effect on human health. Therefore, until the health effects are clearer, the Department has some reservations about the wider use of these fuels.</p>

	<p pid=".158W.3/2">The Government is committed to ensuring that the aviation industry meets its environmental costs. Since civil aviation is a international industry, the Government's approach is to support multilateral action through ICAO to end the exemption from tax for international aviation fuel. Unilateral action would create market distortions, such as ''tankering'' of extra fuel from aboard to avoid tax, and would have limited environmental benefits. The Government has given an undertaking not to remove zero rating for VAT purposes of international air (and sea) transport. In the consultation document, <i>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom:South East</i>, it is estimated that policies to meet the contribution of aircraft emissions towards climate change would reduce demand by around 10 per cent.</p>

Amendments to the Road Vehicle (Construction and Use) Regulations in 1996 require minibuses or coaches used for the transport of groups of more than three children on organised trips to be fitted with seat belts. In many cases this would include vehicles used for trips to and from schools.

The main purpose of these changes is to simplify the current regulatory structure and align our requirements with those common in the rest of Europe. Whilst these proposals do not differentiate between the uses to which buses and coaches are put they will effect all such vehicles including those used for school transport.</p>

Following consultation, we are in the process of making regulations to increase fees relating to the licensing of operators and the registration of bus services. We are currently consulting on regulatory changes to facilitate the registration of flexibly routed bus services. We are planning to clarify and extend the categories of exemptions to goods O-licensing as soon as consultation has been completed. We continue to keep the systems under review with a view to improvement and the easing of the regulatory burden on industry.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.5/1">There are two main themes to the research being carried out by Transport Direct, those that directly support the Transport Direct programme, and others where we provide a supporting role to other organisations, which will help provide the ambitions of Transport Direct.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/2">We are currently undertaking a programme of market research to support Transport Direct. This will inform us on what features and specific characteristics the service should possess from the point of view of the public. The results of these will be published within the next 2 months and will be available on the department's website. A further research project is planned which will look at usability aspects. The usability of a website can be judged by looking at whether the content is useful to the website user; and whether it is easy to use the website, in terms of how the content is presented and how the information is structured</p>

These include a review of existing traveller information system and a project looking at how cycling can be incorporated into journey planners.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/4">The work on providing a business case for bus real-time is continuing, the business case will quantify the benefit of such systems. Recommendations for the business case are due for completion within the next 2 months.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/5">Transport Direct also has research work to support traveline and Journey Solutions. Work done by these organisations will contribute towards the goals of Transport Direct.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.5/8">This research project is assessing issues that traveline may need to address to ensure effective delivery to the customer. This includes an assessment of extending the future minimum opening hours for traveline; identifying the requirements for existing traveline customers; and establishing the extent of information that needs to be given by traveline if we to encourage greater use of public transport, among public transport users and non-public transport users.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.5/11">The Department for Transport wishes to assess the extent to which the national requirements placed on traveline for the provision of trunk service information (i.e. data about the national rail and coach network) have been achieved. The requirements state that the traveline system must provide answers that are consistent with the information provided by the respective national trunk service information providers (i.e. Go By Coach, Scottish Citylink and National Rail Enquiry Service).</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/12" class="italic">PlusBus Integrated Ticketing</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/13">Train and bus companies have been working together (under the umbrella of an organisation called Journey Solutions) to deliver a national integrated rail/bus ticket, known as the Plusbus Scheme. The principal aim of the research will be to measure awareness of PlusBus; examine customer satisfaction with the product; critically review each step of the PlusBus journey; test effectiveness of promotional components; confirm target market; and measure impact on travel patterns. The work will contribute to the Department for Transport understanding about multi-modal ticketing&mdash;one of the Transport Direct strategic objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".172W.5/1">Customs can seize illegally logged timber only if the species concerned is covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). New EU-wide legislation is needed to empower customs authorities to prevent entry of illegally logged non-CITES timber. The UK is working within the EU to identify what legislation is needed and how it can be introduced. The UK Government has also committed its own central departments and their agencies to procure timber from legal and sustainable sources.</p>

In addition to setting out guidelines on documents for inclusion, the guidance also explicitly requires Departments to ensure that the content of the site as a whole is up to date and current, and where it is necessary to update the content of individual documents, to show the latest date of amendment clearly on the document concerned. Section 1.2.7 deals with the issue of Records management and the OeE currently has a consultation paper out on Archiving websites. The purpose of this draft annex to the Illustrated handbook is to provide government website managers with a framework towards developing within their website management policy suitable procedures and systems to assist in the management, appraisal and preservation of electronic records. A copy of this draft is available online at <a href="http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm">http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm</a>. A copy of the Guidelines for UK Government websites is available at <a href="http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm">http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.0/3">The Department's website carries all the categories of document identified by the Guidelines for UK Government websites, and displays the latest date of amendment clearly on each document. All documents are maintained on the website unless they become out of date or are superseded. We are taking account of the draft annex to the Illustrated handbook in developing our procedures and systems for maintenance of website material.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.2/2">DEFRA therefore let a GB wide research contract entitled ''Design and pilot a multi-species terrestrial mammal monitoring project'' in June 2001, to the British Trust for Ornithology and the Mammal Society.

	<p pid=".176W.2/3">The work will include an analysis of the results, including aspects such as accuracy, repeatability and the utility of the results, for monitoring mammal abundance and distribution and for the potential to assess long-term trends. The pilot scheme concludes in November 2003.</p>

Cost estimates for individual sectors of the industry were not prepared.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.0/2">Cost assessments were also prepared by the National Farmers Union and the Transport and General Workers Union. Defra statisticians also reviewed the results of the September 2001 Earnings and Hours Survey and submitted a paper to the Board showing how this would affect the Board's assessment of the impact of the 2002 proposals. In addition Defra economists prepared a paper for the Board, providing an update on the economic performance of each of the key sectors in the agriculture and horticulture industry. The Board's Secretariat has confirmed that all these papers were considered by a meeting of the Board's Working Party which took place on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-27">27 August</phrase> (immediately prior to the Board's Confirmation meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-29">29 August</phrase>).

	<p pid=".181W.3/2">Local highway authorities are already under a duty to protect the rights of the public to use rights of way. Under the new burdens procedure, highway authorities collectively are being funded for the additional requirements imposed by section 63. The procedures will provide a formal means for any person to draw to the authority's attention paths which are being obstructed and to take court action where they fail to act.

However, allowances were increased last July by at least 50 per cent. in order to meet the needs of our constituents and it may be best to wait until the new system has bedded in before considering whether further increases are merited.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.6/1">By mid 1994, out of Rwanda's population of roughly 8 million at the beginning of the 1990's, some 2 million had become internally displaced and a further 2 million had fled as refugees to neighbouring countries. The Government of Rwanda's policy of national reconciliation and its success in establishing a peaceful and stable country have led to the return of the vast majority of these displaced persons and refugees to their communities.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.6/2">There are three significant returns of displaced persons to Rwanda: of disarmed ex-FAR/Interahamwe soldiers and their families from the DRC; of Rwandan refugees from the eastern DRC, and; of Rwandan refugees from Tanzania.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.6/3">The Government of Rwanda hopes that some 25,000 ex-FAR/Interhamwe will be repatriated as the Pretoria Agreement is implemented. The Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme provides for the return of ex-combatants and their families to their communities, for the counselling of ex-combatants and the communities to which they are returning, and significant economic assistance to ease the reintegration of ex-combatants into society. Special packages of assistance are available for child, female and disabled ex-combatants. The Government hopes that their withdrawal from the DRC will serve to increase the flow of the ex-combatants into the Programme. We judge that the Programme is well designed and well established, and have committed US$5 million to support it. We have also committed US$25 million to the equivalent regional demobilisation programme.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.6/4">UNHCR estimate that there were some 23,000 Rwanda refugees scattered through the Eastern DRC as at July 2002. UNHCR is assisting with the slow but steady return of these refugees to Rwanda. They advise that they have the structures and resources to continue to provide adequate food and shelter for this population.</p>

Tailored packages of assistance are available for child, female, chronically-ill and disabled ex-combatants. This, together with support from existing social and familial networks, should ensure that ex-combatants and their families are very well placed to meet their needs for food and shelter.

	<p pid=".187W.2/1">I have congratulated President Kagame on his commitment to implementing the terms of the Pretoria Agreement with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by withdrawing Rwandan forces from the DRC. The UK has joined with the international community in condemning the renewed outbreak of hostilities by armed groups in the Eastern DRC following the Rwandan withdrawal, and calling upon all those directly involved or involved in supplying the armed groups to cease forthwith.</p>
	<p pid=".187W.2/2">We strongly support Rwandan plans for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of its own soldiers and those Rwandan rebels in Congo who choose to return to Rwanda. We have committed $25 million to the World Bank's Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme for the Great Lakes region, under which Rwanda and the DRC will benefit, and are contributing a further $5 million directly to the Rwandan National Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme. But it is essential that hostilities in the DRC cease immediately, and that the parties to the Inter Congolese Dialogue move rapidly to agreement on an inclusive transitional government, so that a comprehensive demobilisation and reintegration process can get under way.</p>

The commercial sector and governments are expected to import and distribute the bulk of the food requirements. Although some Governments are subsidising maize prices to keep them stable, prices are at historical highs throughout the region. As imports will be insufficient to build up stocks prices will remain high until the next harvest expected from April 2003. Local food prices next year will be determined by the size of the harvest.</p>

	<p pid=".189W.8/1">It is extremely difficult at present to obtain accurate information on the food situation in the hill districts of the Mid and Far West of Nepal, which have traditionally been areas of food insecurity. Recent reports suggest that food supply in those parts of the country has been affected by the poor monsoon this year, the migration of young men from conflict affected areas, and restrictions on movements and on the supply of food by Maoist and Government security forces. For example, in some mountain districts we estimate the millet crop will be only 80per cent. of normal levels.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.8/2">It is too early to say that there will be a humanitarian crisis in the Mid and Far West of the country. The greatest need at present is for more reliable information. DFID is monitoring the situation closely. DFID recently provided #115,000 to increase the capacity of the World Food Programme's Vulnerability and Monitoring Unit.

The very high prevalence of HIV/AIDS will seriously affect progress towards all reproductive health goals. However, Botswana is making huge efforts to deliver good quality prevention programmes and medical care for those who are HIV+.

	<p pid=".195W.2/1">At Tokyo in January we pledged #200 million over 5 years to Afghanistan, we did not divide this in to specific amounts for separate financial years. So far in the current financial year we have disbursed over #33 million of our budget of #55 million. In 2001&ndash;02 we gave approximately #60 million to Afghanistan for immediate humanitarian relief activities, including food aid and support for returning refugees. International support for such appeals has already provided some essential building blocks for longer term reconstruction: for example a polio vaccination programme has reached 6 million children and 3 million children are now back at school.</p>

The 8 ''endangered'' species are Leopard, Chimpanzee, Bonobo, Gorilla, Mandrill, Drill, Diana guenon/monkey and Jentink's duiker.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.2/1">The HIV/AIDS epidemic poses a major threat to food security in Sub Saharan Africa, and has served to contribute to, and greatly exacerbate southern Africa's growing famine.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.2/2">HIV/AIDS is hitting agricultural productivity hard. In just two decades AIDS has killed seven million farmers in Africa and in some countries, households and villages are losing from 10&ndash;50 per cent. of agricultural productivity due to the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.2/3">HIV/AIDS impacts on reduced food availability as workers become too ill to work the land, care for livestock and maintain essential machinery. At a family level food production has fallen by as much as 80 per cent. when the main producer is affected. This is especially true in areas such as Southern Africa, which uses labour-intensive farming methods.</p>

	<p pid=".202W.3/1">The key point of the Court of Appeal's judgment in these consolidated cases, as far as my Department is concerned, is that the legislation enabling the Secretary of State to give guidance to headteachers, local education authorities and appeal panels in relation to the exclusion of pupils from school complies with the <i>Human Rights Act 1998</i>, and in particular with Article 6 of the <i>European Convention on Human Rights</i> (the right to a fair hearing). So far as the guidance applicable to these cases was concerned, the Court went on to hold that neither its content nor the fact that the exclusion appeal panels had a statutory duty to have regard to it in determining the appellant pupils' appeals compromised the pupils' right to a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal. However, the Secretary of State is mindful of the observations which the Court made with regard to using her powers to issue guidance and will bear them in mind when issuing revised guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.3/2">As to the future, I envisage that the Secretary of State will continue to use her statutory powers to give guidance for the purposes of promoting fairness and consistency in decision-making.</p>

	<p pid=".203W.2/1">We believe that schools should be orderly and disciplined places of learning at all times. In that context it is right that teachers and headteachers should have the power to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom. This may mean excluding them from school, for a fixed period or permanently, while maintaining their education in alternative provision.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/2">Since taking office the Government has devoted far greater resources than ever before to supporting teachers in dealing with disruptive behaviour in the classroom. There are now over 1,050 Learning Support Units in schools helping to tackle classroom disruption. Further expansion of our Excellence in Cities (EiC) and Excellence Clusters programmes will provide a further 140 Learning Support Units. The #66m package announced in the Budget will fund, among other things, more Learning Support Units, Behaviour and Education Support Teams and summer activities aimed at improving discipline.</p>

	<p pid=".208W.8/1">The commencement earlier this year of Scotland's new direct ferry link with mainland Europe is a great boost to Scotland's environment with the potential for thousands of miles of lorry trips to be taken off our roads. It is more than just that though; it also improves our competitive position as an exporting nation and as a tourist destination.

	<p pid=".222W.0/2">The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned for, convicted of, or found not guilty by reason of insanity of an offence specified in Schedule One to the Act since the date of its implementation to notify their local police of their names, addresses, dates of birth and intentions to travel abroad for eight days or longer. There is, however, no register of sex offenders, as such; nor are sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act separately identified as such in criminal statistics.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.0/3">The Home Office has issued guidance to chief officers of police and probation in respect of their statutory duty under section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 to make arrangements for the assessment and management of the risk posed by dangerous offenders. The guidance requires information about the number of registered sex offenders in each police area to be published. A copy of the relevant annual report, which reveals there are 713 registered sex offenders in Hampshire, translating to a rate of 40 per one hundred thousand of the population can be obtained from the Hampshire police or Probation Services.

	<p pid=".222W.3/1">The two tables give the information readily available. Table 1 sets out for each police force in England and Wales in 2001&ndash;02 the number of officers in traffic posts (''traffic police''). Traffic police are defined as ''staff who are predominantly employed on motorcycles or in patrol vehicles for the policing of traffic and motorway related duties''. The definition does not include accident investigation, vehicle examination or radar duties. No records are kept centrally of which forces organise their traffic posts into dedicated traffic enforcement divisions or which forces have disbanded dedicated traffic enforcement divisions.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.3/2">Table 2 sets out for each force in England and Wales the net cost of traffic and road safety for the past two years, showing each force's spend on these as a proportion of the force budget. The table shows that, over the two-year period, spend on traffic and road safety increased as a proportion of the force budget in a significant number of forces.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.3/3">A thematic inspection report on road policing by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, published in 1998, identified an intelligence-led model for this activity, integrating traffic policing with other core activities and making more effective use of police resources. As forces increasingly adopt this approach, the number of dedicated traffic officers may reduce, but this does not necessarily reflect a lower level of enforcement. The increased use of cameras and other technology can allow a reduction in traffic officers whilst maintaining traffic targets/ enforcement levels. It also allows traffic officers to be appropriately targeted elsewhere. Reductions in the numbers of traffic officers, taken by themselves, can therefore be misleading.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.2/1">The table gives details for each force area in England and Wales of the number of roadside checks undertaken, total Vehicle Inspectorate (VI) staff hours worked, hours lost by the VI owing to the lack of a police officer, and total police hours worked. Hours lost by the VI cover circumstances such as where police officers were called away at the time of the check to deal with local emergencies or where officers did not attend as arranged. Numbers of roadside checks where the police gave more than 24 hours' notice of cancellation or where a force could not cover the desired number of checks because a senior police officer decided that the resources needed to go elsewhere are not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.2/2">Much of the increasing demand on the police is generated by the current provision that only an officer in uniform can stop vehicles for such purposes as roadworthiness and emissions tests. The police are not always in a position to supply officers to assist the VI in this way, and the Government recognise that police involvement in VI roadside checks may not be seen as the most effective use of police resources. Provisions in the Police Reform Act 2002 enable Community Support Officers and accredited persons to be given the power to stop and direct vehicles for specific purposes. These include for tests by the VI of vehicles' roadworthiness and compliance with construction and use regulations. The Act also removes the present restriction on traffic wardens' powers to stop, so that they can also undertake such functions. These measures will benefit the VI by enabling them to have a higher level of guaranteed service.</p>

	<p pid=".228W.2/2">Enforcement of criminal parking offences is an operational matter for the police. The Road Traffic Act 1991 provided for the decriminalisation of most non-endorsable on-street parking offences and their enforcement by local authorities. Normally, where there is an infringement a local authority parking attendant would issue a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) to the transgressor. It is a matter for the local authority to ensure parking attendants are doing their jobs properly. Motorists can appeal to an independent parking adjudicator if they wish to dispute the issue of a PCN.</p>

	<p pid=".229W.5/2">Her Majesty's Prison Service has already started an emergency building programme to increase capacity by 2,320 places by March 2003. The programme includes building modular temporary units and ready to use units at existing prisons and the deferment of some wing refurbishment schemes. The first of these schemes is already in operation. The Home Secretary also announced on <phrase class="date" code="">14 October</phrase> that an additional #60 million would be provided to the Prison Service in 2003&ndash;04 to build further places to open next year. Further additional accommodation will be delivered during 2002 and 2004 as part of the expansion programmes at Her Majesty's Prison Hull and Birmingham.</p>

Those who do not require the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) accommodation will also be required to report.

Data on removals by nationality in the second quarter of 2002 are not yet available. This information will be published on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase> on the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration 1.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".240W.2/3">Reflex has posted a senior police officer and a chief immigration officer to Romania as part of a joint project with the Romanian authorities (Reflex Romania), to target organised immigration criminals involved in smuggling and trafficking through the region. It has also established a network of Immigration Liaison Officers (ILOs) who work with other Governments to encourage and support action to disrupt criminal gangs and create a joint intelligence structure. ILOs are already posted at nine key locations across Eastern Europe and the Balkans.</p>

There is no commonly agreed definition of rural areas. Results here use the Office for National Statistics (ONS) District Level Classification in order to provide the urban, suburban and rural breakdown. The ONS classification of areas was revised for authorities in 1999. The revision produced a different hierarchical structure hence there is little direct comparability with the results of the original classification. Therefore, it is not possible to give the figures for the most recent sweep of the British Crime Survey (BCS).</p>

	<p pid=".245W.3/2">UK emissions data for the year 2001 will be finalised in March 2003 and submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in April next year, as required by the UK's international reporting obligations. UK data to the year 2000 reported and published last March show that total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by some 12.8 per cent. over the period 1990 to 2000. Carbon dioxide fell by about 7.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.3/3">Provisional carbon dioxide emissions estimates for 2001 are available. These indicate that emissions have reduced by about 6.1 per cent. between 1990 and 2001. The increase between 2000 and 2001 is attributed to outside temperature differences and an increase in coal consumption linked to an increase in gas prices relative to coal prices.</p>

	<p pid=".246W.0/1">My hon. Friend the Minister for Women in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, has today published a summary of our plans to change existing equality legislation and to introduce new legislation to take forward implementation of the Employment and Race Directives&mdash;<i>Equality and Diversity: The Way Ahead</i>. We intend to make equality legislation as coherent and easy to use as possible. We have produced draft regulations to achieve these changes and are asking for comments on our proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/2">This work builds on our current arrangements for tackling discrimination, and has been shaped by extensive consultation over the last two years. The key features will be:</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/3" class="indent">new legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief and sexual orientation in the areas of employment and vocational training; and</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/4" class="indent">important changes to the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/5">We intend to have new provisions on race, religion and belief and sexual orientation in place in 2003, and on disability in 2004. We also intend to make some modifications to the Equal Pay Act in 2003, following consultation in <i>Towards Equal Pay for Women</i>. We will consult separately on proposals for legislation to prohibit discrimination on grounds of age, as well as the new Equal Treatment Amendment Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/6">In addition, we are committed to getting the right framework to support equality legislation. We are, therefore, also publishing today a separate consultation paper&mdash;<i>Equality and Diversity: Making it Happen</i>. This considers the contribution of equality institutions to making equal opportunities a reality and to promoting equality and diversity across society, and sets out a range of options for future structures for these institutions, including a single equality commission. It considers a range of related issues, including the implications for Scotland and Wales and the regional and local dimension.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/7">We have arranged for copies of these documents and the draft legislation to be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".246W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 17 October</phrase>, I launched a consultation on the design of the equal pay questionnaire. The Employment Act 2002 provides a new power to introduce an equal pay questionnaire into the Equal Pay Act 1970. We are seeking views by <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-10">10 January 2003</phrase> on a draft questionnaire, with the aim of bringing it into effect, subject to Parliamentary approval, in April 2003. The questionnaire will help women who think they may not be receiving equal pay to request key information from their employers before deciding whether to bring a case. In some cases this could lead to resolving or settling a claim rather than taking the tribunal route.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.3/2">The questionnaire is one of a raft of changes we are introducing to speed up and simplify equal pay cases; and it forms part of the Government's drive to close the pay gap between men and women. Also published on the Women and Equality Unit's website is a briefing paper ''Equal Pay and Pay Gap&mdash;Update on Government Action''. This provides an update on Government action to narrow the pay gap and progress made following the Government's response to Denise Kingsmill's report on Women's Employment and Pay (December 2001).</p>

	<p pid=".264W.3/1">The Black advisory group was commissioned in 1983, by the then Minister of Health, to investigate reports of a high incidence of leukaemia occurring in young people living in the vicinity of the Sellafield nuclear site. In their report, Black 1984, the advisory group confirmed that there was a higher incidence of leukaemia in young people resident in the area. They also concluded that the estimated radiation dose from the Sellafield discharges and other sources, received by the local population, could not account for the observed leukaemia incidence on the basis of knowledge available at that time. The uncertainties in the available data led the advisory group to make recommendations for further research and investigation.</p>

European Economic Area nationals are not required to take the international English language testing system examination to register with the General Medical Council.

We anticipate that international recruitment will contribute towards this figure and our international recruitment assumption for consultants and GPs is 1,000 by 2005. We anticipate that by 2005, compared to 1999, up to 35,000 extra nurses may be working in the NHS, who have been trained overseas.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.8/3">In line with the information technology procurement strategy proposed for the national programme for IT in the NHS, a selection process is underway using the NHScat managed services framework to identify and select a single ''prime service partner'' for electronic booking. The successful prime service partner will be contracted to provide and supply software products and planning and implementation services to local health communities jointly with potential systems and services suppliers.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.8/4">All companies on the NHS national framework agreement (NHScat), who were successful in the managed services category, were invited to submit proposals to become the prime service partner for the electronic booking project. The selection process is ongoing. A detailed evaluation was held of the twelve companies listed to provide IT managed services within the NHScat framework. These are BT Health, Computer Science Corporation (CSC), EDS, Elonex, Fujitsu Services, Hewlett Packard, Integris, Specialist Computer Centres (SCC), SX3, Siemens, Unisys, and Viglen. Following that, EDS and BT Health have been invited to put forward detailed proposals as potential IT managed service prime service partners for electronic booking systems. Any award of contract will be subject to successful conclusion of negotiations and approval of a formal business case.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.8/5">The selection process is being conducted under the supervision of the NHS Purchasing and Supplies Agency.</p>

The first, which began in January 2001, is to develop the statistics to support the system, and is being carried out by Warwick University with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The second, which began in August 2001, is an evaluation project, by DTZ Pieda, to identify the practical lessons to be learned from the publication of Version 1 of HHSRS in July 2000. The third, which began in September 2001, is to produce the guidance needed to assist local authorities in the application of HHSRS specifically to houses in multiple occupation, and is being carried out by the Building Research Establishment. Reports on these projects are expected to be published by the end of this year. This work will inform the production of Version 2 of HHSRS, which we expect to commission in time for publication next autumn as part of a comprehensive package of guidance.</p>

However, local authorities in their role as strategic housing authorities are required to assess the type of accommodation required in their areas. Local authorities may also require a proportion of affordable housing as part of new developments, often built by Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and funded by the Housing Corporation. RSLs must ensure that bids for capital investment in social housing fit with local authority and regional priorities and the Housing Corporation's National Investment Strategy.</p>

The consultation period ended last Friday and we will make a further announcement when we have considered the responses. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1010" name="Sally Keeble">the then Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> said in her reply on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-07">7 May 2002</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, Hansard (col. 21&ndash;22W) these changes will be introduced alongside the wider changes to the local authority capital finance system which required primary legislation; the timing of this is still to be decided.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/2">The proposal is about sharing out funding for investment fairly among local housing authorities. The current arrangements for redistributing the spending power of capital receipts do not apply to all authorities. Debt-free authorities are exempt&mdash;they retain all their capital receipts, and so finance substantially more investment from receipts than other authorities, regardless of their relative need to spend.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/3">There is no good reason for this anomaly. Pooling will ensure that capital resources are better targeted, so that all housing authorities have the access they need to fund new affordable housing and bring their stock up to decent standard. Without this, either investment in housing by the most needy authorities would need to fall, or substantial increases in taxes would be necessary to make good the money that debt-free authorities retain.</p>

	<p pid=".286W.6/1">Planning Policy Guidance Note 1 ''General Policy and Principles'' clearly states that in principle any consideration which relates to the use and development of land is capable of being a planning consideration. Whether a particular consideration falling within that broad class is material in any given case will depend on the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.6/2">The Courts have also held that the Government's statements of planning policy are material considerations which must be taken into account, where relevant, in decisions on planning applications. These statements cannot make irrelevant any matter which is a material consideration in a particular case. But, where such statements indicate the weight that should be given to relevant considerations, decision-makers must have proper regard to them. If they elect not to follow relevant statements of the Government's planning policy, they must give clear and convincing reasons (E C Grandsen and Co Ltd <i>v</i> SSE and Gillingham BC 1985).</p>
	<p pid=".286W.6/3">Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 (revised) (PPG8). PPG8 states that health considerations and public concern can in principle be material considerations in determining applications for planning permission and prior approval. Whether such matters are material in a particular case is ultimately a matter for the courts. It is for the decision-maker (usually the local planning authority) to determine what weight to attach to such considerations in any particular case.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.6/4">However, it is the Government's firm view that the planning system is not the place for determining health safeguards. It remains central Government's responsibility to decide what measures are necessary to protect public health. In the Government's view, if a proposed mobile phone base station meets the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure it should not be necessary for a local planning authority, in processing an application for planning permission or prior approval, to consider further the health aspects and concerns about them.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.6/5">I have no plans to withdraw paragraph 98 from PPG8.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/1">There is increased emphasis in the new PPG3 on securing well-designed residential environments, which offer housing opportunities for all in the community in the most sustainable way. Local authorities and developers are expected to think imaginatively about designs and layouts which make good use of previously developed land in urban areas without compromising the quality of the environment. In determining planning applications, local planning authorities should reject poor design.</p>

	<p pid=".295W.2/1">According to the Department's Survey of Mortgage Lenders, house prices in south-west England rose by 31.8 per cent. during the three years 1999 to 2001. According to HM Land Registry figures the average price of residential property sold in Taunton Deane was #85,097 in 1999 and #109,530 in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/2">Homeownership is affordable for most people. Homeowners are benefiting from low interest rates, low unemployment and robust income growth. For people purchasing a home in south-west England during 2001, total mortgage payments averaged 17.44 per cent. of their income. This compares to 28.42 per cent. of income in 1990, and is lower than 1999 (17.91 per cent.) and 2000 (19.43 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/3">However, we are well aware that there can be serious problems for many first time buyers in areas of high demand. We are committed to improving people's housing choices, and to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home. Our aim is to deliver new affordable housing where it is needed most, in more sustainable forms.</p>

	<p pid=".297W.8/1">At the end of June 2002 81,170 households in England were living in temporary accommodation, including over 6,500 families with children in bed and breakfast hotels, and around 600 people were sleeping rough on any one night.</p>
	<p pid=".297W.8/2">Under the homelessness legislation (Housing Act 1996), a person is ''statutorily homeless'' if they do not have accommodation which they have a legal right to live in, which is physically available to them and which it would be reasonable for them to continue to occupy.</p>
	<p pid=".297W.8/3">In March 2002, the Homelessness Directorate published a report ''More than a Roof'', which outlined the Government's new approach to tackling homelessness funded by #125 million over this year. The Homelessness Act 2002 will also bring about radical change in the way that central and local government, and all other partners, work together to tackle homelessness. For the first time ever, local authorities will be required to carry out a review and develop a strategy for their area that prevents homelessness and provides solutions for people who are, or who may become homeless.</p>

	<p pid=".298W.8/1">The Regional Governance White Paper, <i>Your Region, Your Choice</i>, published in May, sets out the Government's plans to establish unitary local authorities in place of existing county and district councils in those regions where people vote in a referendum for elected regional assemblies. In any region where the Government decides that a referendum should take place, the Boundary Committee for England will carry out a review and recommend the best unitary arrangements for the two-tier parts of that region. A referendum will then be held to see whether people support the creation of an elected assembly. The new unitary arrangements will be implemented if&mdash;but only if&mdash;a majority of those voting in the referendum voted for an elected regional assembly.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.8/2">Where new unitary arrangements are introduced, we would expect that existing police authorities would remain in place. Appointments to these authorities would be made either by unitary districts or by the unitary county council, depending on the new unitary structure.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.8/3">There are currently combined fire authorities in former county areas which have only unitary local authorities; and also in areas where there are one or more unitaries, district councils and a county council. Where changes lead to district-based unitaries in future, we would expect there to be a combined fire authority, but where they lead to a unitary county with no existing or new district-based unitaries, we would expect the county council to remain responsible for providing fire services. This is without prejudice to our consideration of any recommendations on the organisation of the fire service that Professor Sir George Bain's recently announced review might make.</p>
