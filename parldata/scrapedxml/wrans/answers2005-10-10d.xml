The UK argued that the treaty does not apply to the use of nuclear energy for military activities and that therefore it was under no duty to provide the Commission with data on the decommissioning.

	<p pid="d.4W.5/1">The future aircraft carrier project is in its assessment phase, the aim of which is to inform how best to meet our developing capability requirements and to balance the key parameters of performance, time and cost. The complement and displacement of the carriers form part of that assessment and final decisions on these and other main specifications have yet to be taken. Such details, together with estimated costs, are being constantly refined and it would be unhelpful to focus on specific figures until after the main investment decision.</p>

	<p pid="d.7W.2/1">The Government declare forces to NATO and the EU through the Defence Planning Questionnaire and Force Catalogue respectively. The declarations entail that those forces are earmarked as available in principle for potential deployment on NATO or EU operations. Any actual decision to deploy is taken by the Government, voluntarily and on a case-by-case basis. However the Government are committed under article V of the North Atlantic Treaty to deployment in collective defence as required.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/2">The forces declared are shown in the following tables. The tables' slightly different formats reflect the different ways in which NATO and the EU request nations to express their declarations.</p>

	<p pid="d.11W.6/1">Other European defence industries include many similar capabilities to those of the UK defence industry, although these capabilities are not necessarily identical. It is therefore difficult to assess which elements are duplicated and I am unable to provide a list.</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.6/2">The European Defence Agency (EDA) has a number of workstrands under way that are intended to improve the effectiveness of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM), including the possible introduction of a voluntary intergovernmental code of conduct. While this work is not intended specifically at removing duplication, we would expect through a more competitive and efficient EDEM that market forces would have a beneficial impact on surplus capacity and inefficiencies. More generally the EDA intends to look at future demand and capacity in various sectors of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (such as armoured fighting vehicles), as well as member states' national strategies for these areas, which may lead to recommendations for improving the efficiency in these sectors. However it will be for each member state to decide how or indeed whether to take these forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.6/3">Our work to formulate a national defence industrial strategy, recently announced by the Minister for Defence Procurement, will identify those industrial capabilities that we wish to retain within the UK in order to ensure appropriate sovereignty and/or contribute to collaborative efforts. We expect to make a major announcement on this work by the end of 2005, along with our initial conclusions on specific sectors. The strategy is one of many initiatives that contribute to the wider aim of ensuring that the capability requirements of the armed forces can be met, now and in the future, on a cost-effective basis.</p>

	<p pid="d.13W.0/1">We thoroughly considered the request for papers by the Independent Assessor and concluded that they were not required to enable the assessor to carry out his statutory function under the Terrorism Act 2000. In reaching this conclusion, the Ministry of Defence considered whether further analysis of the events on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-12">12 July 2004</phrase> was necessary. The policing of these parades was examined in considerable detail by Keir Starmer QC and Jane Gordon in their special report for the Policing Board published in November 2004. We do not consider, given the action already taken, that any useful purpose would be served by further examination.</p>

People who were conscripted into the armed forces during the Second World War and in the post-war years and who took part in campaigns or operations for which medals were subsequently awarded, had an equal right to receive them as did their regular colleagues.

	<p pid="d.18W.11/1">Eurofighter Typhoon is a world-class aircraft with significant export potential and a number of countries have expressed an interest in the aircraft. In announcing its decision to purchase further F-16 aircraft, the Greek government made clear its intention also to acquire a fourth generation fighter aircraft. The United Kingdom and its Eurofighter Partner Nations believe strongly that Eurofighter Typhoon would meet this requirement. We continue to support our German partners who are leading this campaign.</p>

The majority of this work is now complete and in-service firings of ASRAAM have taken place. Further missile integration onto Typhoon is planned as part of the proposed future capability programme (FCP). The programme is expected to include meteor and stormshadow integration along with upgrades to ASRAAM and AMRAAM.</p>

	<p pid="d.19W.2/1">The UK provides a small amount of training annually for the Ugandan Peoples' Defence Force (UPDF). This training is funded from both the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP) and the Defence Assistance Fund (DAF), and is primarily targeted at increasing national capacity to conduct Peace Support Operations (PSO).</p>
	<p pid="d.19W.2/2">Training activities include the deployment of Short Term Training Teams to Uganda and attendance on relevant courses in UK. Funding has also been provided for Kenyan instructors to deliver a two week PSO package at the Ugandan Staff College. In addition, the UK funded International Mine Action Training Centre in Nairobi has recently commenced the training of 140 UPDF engineers in humanitarian de-mining in preparation for mine clearance operations in northern Uganda, overseen by the UN Development Programme and the Mines Awareness Trust. A similar programme of activities is being developed for 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="d.19W.2/3">Our Defence Adviser in Kampala provides general advice to the UPDF on dealing with the threat from the Lords Resistance Army (LRA) and protecting the civilian population in northern Uganda, including the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in camps. The importance of protecting the civilian population is routinely stressed in contacts with the Ugandan authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.19W.2/4">DfID has separately provided approximately &pound;2.5 million in non-military assistance for conflict resolution efforts in northern and eastern Uganda. In addition, DfID is supporting a number of programmes responding to the plight of vulnerable groups affected by conflict. This includes help to protect children who commute into main towns each night to avoid abduction by the LRA. Furthermore, UNICEF has a protection team based in northern Uganda, which the UK helps finance. This team undertakes specific interventions to make the environment safer for women and children in the IDP camps.</p>

Digital switchover itself does not require any equipment to be thrown away, but its timing may affect the timing of disposal of some equipment such as rarely used televisions that people choose not to adapt. DTI and Defra are commissioning research to model any changes in patterns of waste disposal generated by switchover now that the timescale has been determined. DCMS and DTI will continue to work with Digital UK to ensure that consumer communications do not encourage unnecessary disposal of television equipment.</p>

	<p pid="d.32W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Ministers at the DTI have received a considerable number of representations from members of the public, pressure groups and companies on the structure of the grocery market and the Supermarket Code of Practice.</p>
	<p pid="d.32W.5/2">Competition in the supermarket and grocery sectors is a matter for the independent competition authorities, in this case the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). On mergers, the OFT's role is to refer situations where it believes there is likely to be a substantial lessening of competition to the Competition Commission (CC). It is for the CC to decide whether the merger should be allowed to proceed. The OFT assesses each merger on a case by case basis, so it is not possible to say whether any future mergers will be referred to the CC.</p>
	<p pid="d.32W.5/3">The Supermarkets Code of Practice (the Code) only concerns transactions between supermarkets and their direct suppliers. Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco are statutorily bound by the Supermarkets Code while Morrisons has volunteered to abide by it. The OFT reviewed the operation of the Code in 2003&ndash;04 and again in 2005. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-03">3 August</phrase> they published a report on the final outcome of their 2005 review. This is available on their website at <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/News/Press+releases/200S/l46-05.htm">http://www.oft.gov.uk/News/Press+releases/200S/l46&ndash;05.htm</a></p>

	<p pid="d.35W.8/1">Under the Common Commercial Policy, the European Commission has the right of initiative in respect of trade policy.

	<p pid="d.35W.8/2">To avoid the risk of undermining the community's negotiating position it is not the Government's policy to provide for advance parliamentary scrutiny of UK submissions on EU negotiating positions within the WTO. However, the Government ensures that the WTO negotiating process is as transparent as possible by other means such as ministerial statements on the outcome of important WTO meetings and by contributing to inquiries by committees of both Houses on WTO matters (for example, the Department of Trade and Industry has made a full contribution to the current inquiry by the Trade and Industry Select Committee into the WTO's Services and NAMA negotiations). Furthermore, proposals for community legislation relating to WTO agreement are subject to parliamentary scrutiny under the existing scrutiny arrangements for EU legislation.</p>

The Renewables Obligation, which requires electricity suppliers to source a proportion of their electricity sales from eligible sources of renewable energy, is technology neutral. However, as a market-based mechanism, the Obligation rewards the most cost effective renewable energy sources. As wind energy is the most economically competitive form of renewable technology with scope for expansion, it is likely that most new renewable capacity between now and 2010 will be wind generation (both onshore and offshore).</p>

	<p pid="d.48W.2/1">In accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993, the Wales Office has a Welsh Language Scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, the switchboard serving our Cardiff office answers with a bilingual greeting. If the caller wishes to speak Welsh, the operator will try to connect the call to a Welsh speaker who can deal with the inquiry. If no Welsh speaker is available and able to deal with the inquiry, the caller will be given the choice of a Welsh speaker ringing back, or continuing the call in English. If the caller rings on one of our direct lines but the person taking the call cannot speak Welsh, he or she will try to transfer it to a suitable Welsh speaking colleague. Again, if no-one is available, the caller will be given the choice of a Welsh speaker calling back, or continuing the call in English. There might be times when there is no Welsh speaker available who can answer the query in full, especially if it is complex or specialised. In these cases, the caller will be given the option of discussing the matter in English or writing to us in Welsh&mdash;in which case, they would receive a written reply in Welsh. The switchboard serving our London headquarters may not have Welsh speaking staff. If they receive a call from someone wishing to speak Welsh, the operator will explain that he or she cannot speak Welsh but will offer to try to connect the caller to a Welsh speaker within the department. If none of our Welsh speakers was available, the operator would explain that this was so and offer the caller the option of continuing the conversation in English, or of leaving their details so that a Welsh speaker could ring back later. We have no facilities for dealing with telephone inquiries in Scots Gaelic or Irish Gaelic.</p>

	<p pid="d.49W.3/1">At the Tokyo Conference in 2002, the UK pledged &pound;200 million over five years in development assistance to Afghanistan. At the Berlin Conference in March 2004 this pledge was increased to a total of &pound;500 million over the same time period; by mid-2005, &pound;360 million of this had been spent.</p>
	<p pid="d.49W.3/2">DFID's Afghanistan programme for 2005&ndash;06 will channel &pound;90 million in development assistance into the country. This programme focuses on three areas of work:</p>

	<p pid="d.49W.3/5" class="indent">Livelihoods: to help reduce dependence on the opium economy and to help re-generate rural economic growth. Progress on all three is essential for creating the conditions for longer-term development.</p>
	<p pid="d.49W.3/6">During President Karzai's recent visit to the UK (July 2005), DFID committed to provide &pound;200 million to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund between 2005 and 2008. This fund supports the operating costs of the Government. The UK is the largest contributor to this fund. DFID has also agreed to begin planning with the Government of Afghanistan to draw up a long-term development partnership between the two Governments.</p>
	<p pid="d.49W.3/7">DFID has also channelled around &pound;160 million to Afghanistan through the European Community, the United Nations and the World Bank.</p>

	<p pid="d.50W.2/1">The G8 agreed that additional resources will be focused on low income countries which are committed to growth and poverty reduction, to democratic, accountable and transparent Government and to sound financial management. Where this is the case, it should be up to the country concerned to decide how best to use resources to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are focused on reducing poverty, improving people's access to education, health, water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="d.50W.2/2">The G8 agreed on the importance of an effective monitoring mechanism to track progress and to help ensure delivery on the ground. Prime accountability is from each Government to its own citizens and Parliaments. At country level, mechanisms for monitoring and review will be strengthened. Internationally, the G8 agreed to strengthen the Africa Partnership Forum (APF) so that it can monitor progress effectively. This will be done on the basis of a joint action plan, which we hope will be agreed at the next meeting of the APF in April 2006.</p>

The policy has confirmed that DFID will not make aid conditional on specific policy decisions by partner governments (including in sensitive economic areas such as privatisation or trade liberalisation). The policy is also ensuring that new programme agreements between DFID and partner countries are clear about the shared commitments on which our aid is based, the circumstances in which aid can be withdrawn, the impact we expect from our aid, and the way in which progress will be measured.</p>

	<p pid="d.52W.2/2">DFID is helping those who are displaced in Eastern Burma by funding organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (&pound;500,000), and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in the Wa region (&pound;170,000 to improve food security and help poor people find alternative livelihoods to opium production). DFID is also providing &pound;1.8 million to support Burmese refugees in Thailand. The UK also provides support through the European Commission for the repatriation and re-integration of refugees, and support to displaced populations.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.2/3">Reaching displaced people in Eastern Burma is a challenge because international agencies have limited access to internally displaced people living in sensitive or conflict-affected areas. The International Committee of the Red Cross has gradually increased its access within Eastern Burma over the last three years. The UK continues to work closely with international organisations such as the UN to encourage the Burmese authorities to agree to increased access for development agencies.</p>

	<p pid="d.53W.6/1">DFID takes a very broad approach to sexual and reproductive health. This includes work on maternal, newborn and child health and on HIV and AIDS. DFID information systems provide data on total costs of this work, as shown in the table, without distinguishing between individual consultants and major delivery programmes contracted to consultancy firms through open competition.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.6/2">A full list of the contracts can be found in the document entitled 'DFID, Reproductive Health&mdash;Contracts issued 1999&ndash;2005' of which I have arranged for copies to be deposited in the Libraries of the House. The consultancies range from individual contracts, to the funding of multi year programmes where national and international consultants work on long-term programme management and implementation in developing countries. One example of this is the Nepal Safe Motherhood Project. This complex project helped the Government of Nepal to establish and develop their National Safe Motherhood Programme through financial and technical assistance to the Ministry of Health. This programme, which ran from 1997 to 2004 at a cost of &pound;5.8 million has improved women's access to life saving maternal health services, e.g. emergency obstetric care.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.6/3">Reports are produced through these consultancies serving a number of purposes. Some are produced specifically for country governments, some for DFID monitoring requirements and others relate to specific technical issues. They are not held centrally and to provide them would incur disproportionate cost. However, the DFID website provides up-to-date links on key issues, <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="d.55W.6/1">The annual Departmental Report for the Department for International Development sets out the Department's current spending plans and reports on expenditure for previous years. Each report's analysis of DFID expenditure covers: bilateral aid expenditure, including all forms of direct assistance; expenditure through multilateral institutions; DFID expenditure in support of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the multilateral debt relief initiative, for those years in which these initiatives have been in place. The reports outline DFID's expenditure plans and do not distinguish between pledges and commitments.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/2">DFID's Departmental Report was first published in 1999. Copies of the report from 1999 to 2005 can be found in the Library of the House. Information on DFID expenditure is to be found in: Annex 1, Table 5 of the 1999 and 2000 reports; Annex 2, Table 10 of the 2001 report; Annex 1, Table 4 of the 2002 to 2005 reports.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/3">DFID's Departmental Report 2005 sets out its expenditure plans for 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. The Department's total planned expenditure on bilateral aid programmes and through multilateral institutions for the period 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08 is set out in Table 1. This excludes the UK's share of the EC aid budget which is set against DFID's budget. It also excludes most UK expenditure on debt relief, although DFID's contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund is included. This is because most of our internationally agreed debt relief is provided on bilateral (government to government) debts held by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). Bilateral debt relief that goes beyond what is required by international agreements (such as our 100 per cent. bilateral cancellation policy for HIPC) is funded by DFID. So too is multilateral debt relief, such as under the new G8 proposal and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) for non-HIPCs.</p>

	<p pid="d.55W.6/14">The HIPC initiative provides relief and cancellation of debts owed to multilateral institutions as well as debts to bilateral governments. To date, debt relief worth $56 billion (&pound;30 billion) in nominal terms has been agreed for 28 countries. Other countries are likely to enter the Initiative next year under its extended &quot;Sunset clause&quot;. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that in recent years the HIPC Initiative has freed up around $1 billion a year from debt service payments for the 28 countries that have qualified under HIPC. The UK is the second largest contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, which assists multilateral institutions with the costs of providing debt relief under HIPC. We have pledged a total of $436 million (&pound;240 million) to the Trust Fund ($221 million, plus $88 million of the European Commission contribution in 2000, and a further $95 million, plus $32 million of an EC contribution in 2002). The UK also contributed US$43 million (&pound;24 million) to assist the IMF with its costs of delivering HIPC debt relief.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/15">On bilateral debt, the Government have cancelled the aid debts owed by the poorest countries (not just the HIPCs), worth some &pound;1.2 billion since 1978. In 1999, the Government agreed to cancel 100 per cent. of bilateral debts owed by HIPC countries to the UK when these countries completed the HIPC process. Since most aid debts had already been cancelled, these were generally export credit guarantee debts. For HIPC countries, total UK debt written off so far (to August 2005) is around &pound;1.2 billion; this includes traditional Paris Club debt treatment, as well as the application of our 100 per cent. bilateral cancellation policy under the HIPC Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/16">In 2000, the Government announced that it would not benefit from debt service payments from HIPC countries, and that any payments received from December 2000 would be held in trust and reimbursed to the country once it had successfully completed the HIPC process.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/17">In 2004 the Government proposed greater relief on debts owed by countries to international institutions. The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>, under which we committed to pay our share, 10 per cent., of qualifying countries' debt service payments to the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank and the African Development Fund (AfDF). We expect to spend about $46 million (&pound;25 million) on qualifying countries this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/18">In June 2005, the G8 Finance Ministers endorsed a proposal to cancel all the remaining debts of HIPCs to the IMF, IDA and the AfDF. When agreed by the international community, the deal will be worth about $55 billion (&pound;30 billion) in debt stock cancellations for the current 38 HIPCs. Donors will provide about $49 billion of this over the next 40 years to IDA and AfDF to compensate for foregone reflows. The cost of debt relief at the IMF ($6.1 billion) will be financed from internal resources, although the donors have committed to provide additional resources if needed to ensure that the IMF's ability to assist poor countries is not diminished. Annual resources for poverty reduction freed up by the proposal will be around $1 billion in 2007, rising to around $1.7 billion in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/19">The precise costs to the UK of the G8 proposal are yet to finalised, but are likely to be about $6 billion (&pound;3.3 billion) over the whole 40-year period of implementation. The G8's proposal, when agreed, will supersede the MDRI for HIPCs, although the UK will continue to meet its obligations under the MDRI to qualifying non-HIPC countries. Assistance under the MDRI is likely to be worth $184 million (&pound;100 million) over the period to 2015 for currently qualifying countries, and up to $463 million (&pound;256 million) if all potentially eligible countries qualify.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.6/20">G8 Finance Ministers also reiterated in June their continued commitment to the full implementation and financing of HIPC. The UK already exceeds its commitments under HIPC. Our commitment to HIPC and other bilateral debt cancellation policies continue and were not altered by the G8 Finance Ministers' decisions in June.</p>

Humanitarian assistance for Haiti was provided following requests for support from humanitarian organisations responding to relief needs in the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.0/2">Following the May floods, DFID provided support to Haiti totalling some &pound;418,400, through the following three organisations:</p>

	<p pid="d.65W.0/6">These sums were all fully disbursed to the recipient organisations in support of their relief programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.0/7">DFID also undertook its own assessment and monitoring of the situation and provided further support to the World Food Programme by deploying an air movement officer to help facilitate the transportation of personnel and cargo.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.0/8">Following tropical storm Jeanne, DFID provided two airlifts of emergency relief supplies worth approximately &pound;295,000 to Haiti (tents, Land Rovers, portable generators and radio communications equipment), which were received and delivered by CARE International. A further &pound;150,089 was provided to CARE for logistics support for the tents and for clean-up operations.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.0/9">In addition, DFID provided &pound;150,000 towards the International Federation of the Red Cross's relief operations, and approximately &pound;171,663 to the NGO Action Contre la Faim for water and sanitation work.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.0/10">The total assistance provided is valued at some &pound;766,752 and is fully disbursed.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.0/11">The UK also provided approximately &pound;180,000 of the European Commission's Humanitarian Office (ECHO)'s &pound;1 million assistance package to Haiti after hurricane Jeanne.</p>

	<p pid="d.65W.0/13">Aside from this humanitarian support, the UK has provided other aid to Haiti through its contributions to Haiti's interim cooperation framework, a short to medium term development programme (2004&ndash;06) supported by the Interim Government and the international donor community. The UK is contributing approximately &pound;35 million through its share of the pledges made by the European Commission, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.</p>

	<p pid="d.67W.2/1">DFID relies on the joint united programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for official figures on children affected by HIV. UNAIDS has the global mandate for collating and publishing official statistics on global and sub-Saharan African AIDS epidemics. They publish an annual epidemiological update, which outlines the status of the global and regional AIDS epidemics. However, UNAIDS does not release specific data on future projections, due to methodological constraints. As such, DFID has neither made nor received projections of the number of children infected by HIV in each year up to 2015.</p>
	<p pid="d.67W.2/2">The UK Government have committed to increase its spending on HIV and AIDS in developing countries to at least &pound;1.5 billion over the next three years (2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08); a large part of this will be spent in Africa. At least &pound;150 million has been earmarked for orphans and vulnerable children, 80 per cent. of which will be spent in Africa. For example, we are supporting UNICEF with an estimated &pound;38 million over three years to assist the worst affected countries in east and southern Africa and some post- conflict countries, to take essential steps to develop and implement comprehensive national action plans.</p>

	<p pid="d.68W.2/1">Sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, are some of the most cost-effective and beneficial health service interventions available. However, the unmet need for condoms, and other methods of family planning, is very high. The United Nations population fund (UNFPA) estimates that global condom needs for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is around &pound;9 billion annually. Every year there are 340 million new cases of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Most occur in young people. Many go untreated.</p>
	<p pid="d.68W.2/2">DFID is working to change this situation. We work with governments and others to help poor countries develop and implement their own national strategies to overturn the HIV epidemic and to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights. As for so many other aspects of basic health, improving sexual and reproductive health depends on well functioning health systems and improving the access of people to supplies such as condoms. We believe that effective HIV prevention programmes include providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services including condoms. We also believe that it is important to make special efforts to ensure that those who are most vulnerable have access to these services. This includes sex workers.</p>
	<p pid="d.68W.2/3">DFID provides significant support for reproductive health commodities including condoms, through its country programmes and assistance to multilateral organisations such as the UNFPA. The UNFPA estimates that some one billion condoms supplied by donors were used in developing countries in 2001. Nearly half of these were provided by the UK. For the past 10 years, DFID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms, supporting the distribution of about 150 million condoms annually. We are currently looking at a sustainable long-term response to reproductive health commodity shortages with other donors, in order to provide a more predictable basis for the funding and availability of these essential supplies.</p>

	<p pid="d.70W.6/1">DFID has not had a development assistance programme with Niger during the past 10 years, but does provide significant support through multilateral channels such as United Nations agencies and the EC development programme, of which the estimated UK share amounted to &pound;6.2 million in 2002. We have also provided debt relief, humanitarian assistance and small project support. Details are shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.6/2">Having reached Completion Point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in April 2004, Niger is now benefiting from increased debt relief. From <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> this includes multilateral debt relief of which the cost to the UK is estimated to be around &pound;9.035 million between now and 2015.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.6/3">In February, as part of efforts to strengthen UK/France cooperation on development issues in Africa, DFID agreed to provide an initial &pound;7 million, through the French development programme, in support of Niger's basic education policy, with particular emphasis on getting more girls into primary education.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.6/4">In recent months DFID has made a significant contribution to the food crisis relief operation in Niger. Our total support of &pound;3.25 million is among the top three contributions, and among the quickest. Our funding will contribute to the general feeding of up to 1,700,000 people, nutritional therapy for up to 60,000 malnourished children, emergency health care for up to 1,750,000 vulnerable people, and emergency livestock interventions for up to 21,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="d.73W.2/2">However, DFID has not provided support specifically for parliamentary scrutiny of the terms and conditions of aid agreements but we are currently working with many African countries to support and strengthen parliamentary oversight bodies, e.g. Public Accounts Committees and Supreme Audit Institutions such as National Audit Offices. These are the key links in the formal system of financial accountability in most countries.</p>

In Zambia, a new multi-donor public financial management reform programme, to which DFID is contributing, includes a component to enhance a parliamentary oversight of public resource management. In Uganda, together with other donors, DFID has supported the Office for Parliamentary Development, which has helped to strengthen the parliament, including by the provision of training for parliamentarians.</p>

	<p pid="d.73W.5/1">DFID recognises the importance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank being transparent and accountable to parliaments in developing countries. Clearly, such accountability needs to be at the heart of their relationship.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/2">The main means by which parliaments should engage with the World Bank and the IMF activities is through the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. This is a national strategy for development that sets the agenda, which donors, including the World Bank, should follow in each country.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/3">In the past, parliamentary engagement in the PRS process has often been weak. However, over the past two years, DFID country offices have begun to support stronger involvement of parliamentarians in the PRS process. DFID is providing support for parliamentary engagement in Malawi and Tanzania, where an independent monitoring group was established to oversee the joint commitments made around the PRS.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/4">At board meetings, DFID encourages the World Bank and IMF to engage with parliaments as much as possible. We also actively push for them to make more of their documents public and will continue to pursue this both at board meetings and in discussions with staff. In fact, in March this year a new World Bank disclosure policy was approved which, among other things, makes board minutes public. The World Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/5">The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS. Since it began in 1996, it has held workshops in a range of countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Indonesia and Uganda to raise awareness among parliamentarians.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/6">The World Bank Institute has also supported the African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption (APNAC) and the Global Organization of Parliamentarians against Corruption (GOPAC) to encourage parliamentary scrutiny and action against corruption.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/7">Outside the PRS, the main means of oversight is the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank. This provides opportunities for parliaments to scrutinise the World Bank and engage more deeply in development policy issues. The independent network has some 450 members from over 90 countries and facilitates direct dialogue between parliamentarians and the World Bank to achieve greater transparency of policies and practices.</p>

	<p pid="d.75W.2/1">In December 2004 the UK agreed a new poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) arrangement with Uganda which provides a grant of up to &pound;145 million over three years to support the implementation of the Uganda Government's poverty eradication action plan (PEAP). We indicated at that time that &pound;40 million would be set aside as PRBS in the financial year 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.2/2">The arrangement links budget support to reforms detailed in the PEAP. It includes criteria on Uganda's political transition to multiparty politics, which will help maintain the stability required to make progress in reducing poverty, alongside criteria relating to macro-economic and sector policies and management. All the indicators are drawn from the PEAP and are designed to ensure our support is transparent and predictable. When our last release of budget support fell due in March 2005 we were concerned by several aspects of the political transition, including that insufficient progress had been made towards establishing a fair basis for a multi-party system. We, therefore, decided to withhold &pound;5 million out of the total of &pound;40 million for the financial year.</p>

	<p pid="d.75W.5/1">The conflict in northern Uganda severely disrupts normal economic activity and for the moment constrains economic recovery. Over 90 per cent. of the population in the districts that are most affected are currently displaced and dependent upon humanitarian relief. We are providing substantial humanitarian support in response to this need. In 2004&ndash;05 we provided over &pound;11 million of emergency assistance which was channelled mainly through the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Red Cross. In 2005&ndash;06 a further &pound;3 million for emergency assistance has already been committed and more is planned. The UK and other donors are discussing with the Government what assistance will be required to support economic recovery in the north once the security situation has sufficiently improved.</p>

This has allowed MITIE to offer a pay increase to their staff from &pound;5.20 to &pound;6.00 per hour funded through internal efficiency savings. The company has made it clear that where posts are lost as part of the efficiency savings, individuals will be offered transfer to other MITIE sites wherever possible.

However, because they are all inherently contaminated with foodstuffs and there are very limited facilities for the separation of waste, there is little opportunity for effective recycling of these items other than by incineration to generate electricity, as presently happens.</p>

The waste management contract is also in the process of being re-tendered by the Parliamentary Estates Directorate and arrangements for the better separation of waste are being reviewed as part of this process.</p>

	<p pid="d.84W.3/1">Cross London Rail Links Ltd. (CLRLL), the company set up to develop and promote the Crossrail project, did consider a Crossrail station at Woolwich during the development of the project, but, based on the then current estimates of cost, passenger numbers and benefits, they concluded that it could not be justified. Powers to construct such a station are therefore not being sought in the Bill introduced into Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.3/2">However, CLRLL are, at the request of the London Borough of Greenwich and other stakeholders, currently undertaking a more detailed study of the costs and benefits of a station at Woolwich, which will be published in due course. This study will assess the case for the station against the Government's integrated transport criteria for new rail schemes and will include a cost benefit analysis.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.3/3">No estimate has been made of the potential cost of constructing a station at Woolwich once Crossrail is operational. However, this would entail closure of the route from Custom House to Abbey Wood for many months, and therefore the cost would be greater than for construction before operation.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.3/4">CLRLL consulted widely including two twelve-week rounds of public consultation on the project. During both rounds, public information centres were held at Woolwich and Abbey Wood, to provide information and seek residents' views.

	<p pid="d.85W.6/1">These four proposals form the commission's third rail package and are intended to help revitalise the European Communities' rail industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.85W.6/2">The planned directive amending directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the community's railways would extend the existing liberalisation of the international rail freight market to cover international passenger services, including cabotage&mdash;the right to pick up and set down passengers on domestic sections of an international route.</p>

	<p pid="d.86W.2/1">Two legislative proposals relating to harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport are currently being negotiated within the EU institutions. The first is a proposal to replace the existing rules on drivers' hours as contained in EU Regulation (EEC No. 3820/85). The second is a proposed directive (known as the &quot;enforcement directive&quot;) to replace the current requirements relating to the levels of checks member states must undertake to ensure compliance with the driver's hours rules.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/2">The transport council reached a political agreement on both these proposals on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-11">11 June 2004</phrase>, and the Common Positions were formally adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-09">9 December 2004</phrase>. Under the Common Position on driver's hours the main changes proposed for the core provisions on driving and rest times are:</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/3" class="indent">an increase in the minimum uninterrupted daily rest period from 8 to 9 hours (plus changes to the way total daily rest is taken);.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/4" class="indent">a reduction in the maximum driving time per calendar week from 72 hours to 56 hours;</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/5" class="indent">at least one regular weekly rest period of 45 consecutive hours must be taken during any two consecutive weeks, and either another regular weekly rest period or a reduced weekly rest period (at least 24 hours) which can be taken anywhere provided the reduction is compensated for within three weeks;</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/6" class="indent">an uninterrupted 45 minute break after 4&frac12; hours driving or, alternatively, a break of 5 minutes for every &frac12; hour driving (or part thereof)&mdash;subject to a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum driving time of 4&frac12; hours.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/7">The Council is also seeking through this piece of legislation to rectify significant gaps in the associated Regulation on digital tachographs by setting down requirements for drivers to enter data about non-driving work and for companies to download data and make it available at, or from, their premises. It will also provide a revised date for the introduction of the digital tachographs.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/8">The Common Position on the enforcement directive would require increased numbers of checks both on vehicles by the roadside and at company headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-13">13 April 2005</phrase> the European Parliament, at 2nd Reading, requested many amendments to both Common Positions&mdash;some relating to the changes mentioned above. Under the co-decision procedure the Council and European Parliament will now seek to reach agreed texts through conciliation. This process is scheduled to be completed in December.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/10">Once the EU legislation is adopted, the Government will prepare Regulations for the implementation of those measures that are not directly applicable.</p>

	<p pid="d.87W.2/1">The European Commission's proposed directive is currently being scrutinised by the European Parliament. As significant amendments have already been proposed (notably the removal of reference to self handling) it is too early to speculate on measures to be introduced. However, an explanatory note setting out the initial UK Government viewpoint and our detailed assessment of the potential impact of the Commission's initial proposal are now available on the Department for Transport website.</p>

	<p pid="d.90W.8/2">As part of our Road Safety Strategy, we consulted in 2002 on a number of options for improving the safety of new drivers, including changes to the licensing system. Although some support was expressed for the introduction of a full graduated licensing system, the Secretary of State concluded that the skills needed to drive unaccompanied should be demonstrated at the time of the practical test, and that the introduction of new licensing arrangements such as a requirement to take a second practical test or the imposition of restrictions on newly qualified drivers, was not justified.

	<p pid="d.95W.2/1">Investigations have indicated that the surface water problems that occur at specific areas on the predominately four-lane section of M60 between Junction 19 at Middleton and Junction 24 at Denton result from a combination of wide carriageways and the road alignment and crossfall, which cause rainwater to have a long and slow pathway off the carriageway to the drains.</p>
	<p pid="d.95W.2/2">The design of carriageway modifications to improve the surface water drainage between Junction 24 at Denton and the River Medlock has been completed. Remedial works on this section are expected to start during the autumn and continue in 2006. Further assessment is being carried out on the section between the Medlock River and Junction 19 at Middleton, following which any necessary remedial works will be undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="d.96W.2/3">Specifically, in order to measure the traffic impact of hard shoulder running a period of 12 months of operation is expected. Due to the relatively low number of accidents that occur on motorways it is anticipated that three years of 'accident data' will be needed before overall conclusions can be reached on the impact of hard shoulder running on safety. Initial conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the various measures implemented on the M42 are therefore expected in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="d.98W.3/1">For the financial year ending <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's annual accounts showed a capital commitment in relation to the Estates PFI Agreement with Land Securities Trillium of &pound;3.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.3/2">The Vehicle and Operator Standards Agency's MOT computerisation PFI project is off balance sheet.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.3/3">For the Highways Agency, the net book value of on-balance sheet PFI tangible fixed assets as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> was &pound;1,486,286,000. This represents assets held under all on-balance sheet schemes for the Agency. It includes PFI residual interests. PFI assets are valued at the public sector comparator, indexed to December 2004. The value of the liabilities related to on-balance sheet PFI contracts was &pound;866,621,000 as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. &pound;23,889,000 was payable within one year and the balance thereafter. Figures for individual schemes are not separately identified in the Agency's accounts.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.3/4">It is not possible to quantify the proportion of assets and liabilities held on balance sheet, as the value of assets and liabilities off balance sheet for an agency and on balance sheet for the operator is recognised on the balance sheets of the operators. Their accounting policies relating to fixed assets may differ from our own and the value of the liabilities would not include any profit margin. Therefore, figures will not necessarily be comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.3/5">For all the Department's Agencies, the accounting policy for PFI contracts is consistent with UK GAAP as interpreted by Treasury guidance. The public sector complies with UK GAAP. The timetable for converging UK GAAP with International Standards is published on the Accounting Standards Board website and the Financial Reporting Advisory Board has plans that closely align with this.</p>

Where the Government receive applications for grant to support the transfer of specific freight movements from road to rail we are able to assess the environmental benefits using a measure of Sensitive Lorry Miles (SLMs) which takes into account the environmental and social benefits of removing lorry journeys from the road. However, SLMs are route specific and cannot be used to make a general assessment of the benefits of transferring freight from road to rail.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/106" class="indent">These figures must be interpreted carefully and do not represent the personal earnings of the individuals listed in any one year. There are a number of reasons for this.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/107" class="indent">1. The amounts paid to each barrister listed represent payments for work covering many years, for a variety of cases. The amount an individual receives in any year fluctuates widely, and is to a large extent due to the variety of payment processes and schemes used by the Legal Services Commission and the Courts.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/108" class="indent">2. All the figures listed are inclusive of VAT (17.5 per cent) as paid, and disbursements incurred (e.g. travelling). Individuals must pay that VAT to HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/109" class="indent">3. Barristers will typically pay 25&ndash;30 per cent, of fees in professional expenses. Additionally, barristers face the same expenses as any other self employed person, including income tax and National Insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/110" class="indent">A number of other qualifications need to be added to these figures.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/111" class="indent">1. Payments are made after claims are carefully scrutinised by the Legal Services Commission or the Courts, and where necessary adjusted. The Legal Services Commission and the Courts may make payments many years after cases conclude.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/112" class="indent">2. While these figures represent gross payments actually made to the barristers during the year, some of those monies have been (or may in the future be) repaid to the Community Legal Service Fund by other parties. This will happen in cases where the legally aided party wins the case and recovers costs from the opponent. Once those costs are recovered the legally aided party's solicitor refunds some or all of the money to the CLS Fund. As a consequence the figures may not reflect the actual cost of the barristers' fees to the Fund. In some cases where costs are recovered from the losing party the actual cost to the CLS Fund may be very little or even nothing.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/113" class="indent">3. Not all payments could be verified with all the individuals concerned. Cases in dispute, where amounts listed as being paid to individual barristers were identified from records held by the Department and the Legal Services Commission, and the practitioner has no such record, have been included. Where possible, amounts have been verified by practitioners and adjusted where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.2/114" class="indent">4. For the CDS, not all payments are recorded centrally in a way that can be attributed to a barrister. Also not all payments made to barristers are recorded in the database used to compile the list. These include manual legal aid payments and a small number of bills paid on account and payments made in the high court. Therefore, it is possible that the list could change in future following the inclusion of such payments in light of further information and subsequent verification.</p>

	<p pid="d.116W.3/2">According to the survey, opium production in 1997 and 2000 was estimated as follows:</p>

	<p pid="d.116W.3/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-29">29 August</phrase>, the executive director of the UNODC Costa announced provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&ndash;05 from their annual poppy survey. They estimated that opium production was around 4,100 metric tonnes (mt), a decrease of only 100 tonnes (2.4 per cent.) compared to 2004. Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for a significant increase in yield since last year. UNODC will publish their final report in October, but these figures are unlikely to change. The yield figures are disappointing, but the cultivation figures give a better picture of farmers' intentions (a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&ndash;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&ndash;05).</p>

	<p pid="d.116W.6/1">In July 2000, the Taliban imposed a ban on opium poppy cultivation. By July 2001, the tactics they employed had led to a 91 per cent. reduction. This ban was enforced with a combination of fear and bribery, and led to a rise in the price of opium so that those with opium stockpiles profited, many of whom colluded with the Taliban Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.116W.6/2">The lack of a viable central state and war-damaged infrastructure in Afghanistan created conditions in which opium cultivation could thrive once again. Opium is highly profitable for those controlling land, and for the warlords and Governors controlling peripheral parts of this mountainous country. There has been little incentive for them to engage with the embryonic central state and, until recently, government institutions have been unable to impact on the trade. President Karzai, with support from the international community, is working hard to change this and is increasing central government presence in the provinces. The President has made clear that eliminating opium is vital for Afghanistan's future and is key to stability.</p>
	<p pid="d.116W.6/3">Progress has been made. The provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&ndash;05 announced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in August show an estimated 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation over the previous year. Production and yield, however, are expected to be down since last year by only 2.4 per cent. as good weather and an absence of crop disease brought about a significant increase in yield. It is going to take a long time to uproot something so deeply entrenched in Afghanistan's culture and economy. But like the Afghans, the UK has always maintained that we are in this for the long term.</p>

We are working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and other international partners, including the US, who have significant resources to bring to this issue and are very engaged. However, to date, levels of international assistance to the Afghanistan CN effort have struggled to match the scale of the problem. The UK Government are using their G8 lead nation status for Afghanistan CN to press for increased commitments, particularly in G8 and EU fora. We welcome in this respect the G8 Foreign and Home Ministers' recognition of the need for increased finance and capacity-building for CN, when they met in June this year. We are engaged bilaterally with a range of countries who have expressed an interest in providing specific support. We are encouraging them to channel funding through the Government of Afghanistan's CN Trust Fund (CNTF), and to provide mentors for the CN Criminal Justice Task Force and CN Police of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="d.119W.2/1">The Government believe the Council of Europe has an important role to play in promoting and protecting human rights, pluralist democracy and the rule of law throughout its 46 European member states. It is unique in enforcing human rights via its Court and Conventions.</p>
	<p pid="d.119W.2/2">The Council of Europe has a continuing long-term role in helping new democracies establish the institutions needed to uphold common European values.

	<p pid="d.123W.2/1">The Government of Fouad Siniora is committed to addressing the need for political, economic and security sector reforms in Lebanon. The UK stands ready to assist the Lebanese Government to implement these reforms. This was demonstrated by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's participation in a meeting of like-minded Foreign Ministers to support Lebanon on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-19">19 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.123W.2/2">We are concerned by the recent bomb explosions in and around Beirut, which have killed one person and injured over 30. We condemn all such attacks which seek to destabilise Lebanon. The UK supports full implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions 1559 and 1614, both of which promote the sovereignty of Lebanon, and encourages all parties in Lebanon to assist with their implementation.</p>

	<p pid="d.123W.5/1">Romania's accession to the EU will mean that the opportunities and challenges associated with Moldova, including the problems presented by the frozen conflict in Transnistria, will lie on the EU's common external border. This will strengthen the EU's common interest in Moldova. We fully support the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which aims to share the benefits of the EU's enlargement with neighbouring countries and prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours. We continue to encourage Moldova to implement the reforms set out in the jointly agreed ENP Action Plan, which was launched in February this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.123W.5/2">We are also anxious to see progress towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Transnistria and fully support a more active role for the EU in efforts to find a solution. In this context we welcome the appointment and work of the EU Special Representative, the EU's participation as an observer to the five-sided negotiation process, and the decision to send an EU border assistance mission to Moldova.</p>

Independent analysis indicates that the Services Directive will increase EU GDP by 0.5 per cent. bringing high quality services and lower prices to consumers and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. The Government consulted widely on the Directive's implications when the Commission made its original proposal.

	<p pid="d.124W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary last had discussions with the Government of Sri Lanka on the peace process when he met Foreign Minister Kadirgamar in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase>. The tragic assassination of Mr. Kadirgamar on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-12">12 August</phrase> was an unconscionable act of terrorism which we and our international partners have condemned unreservedly. This and the ongoing violence in Eastern Sri Lanka have put the Ceasefire Agreement in Sri Lanka under increasing strain and the peace process is facing its most serious challenge since the Ceasefire Agreement came into force in 2002. It is incumbent on both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the Ceasefire Agreement fully.</p>
	<p pid="d.124W.3/2">In statements on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-19">19 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-26">26 September</phrase> respectively the Tokyo Co-Chairs, including the UK as the EU Presidency, and the EU condemned the LTTE's continuing use of violence and called on the LTTE to take immediate public steps to demonstrate their commitment to the peace process and their willingness to change. An immediate end to political assassinations and the recruitment of child soldiers would be two such steps. It is essential that the LTTE responds. The European Union has also made clear that delegations from the LTTE will no longer be received in any of the EU member states until further notice. The EU is also actively considering the listing of the LTTE as an organisation engaged in terrorism (the UK has proscribed the LTTE since 2001). We also deplore the activities of paramilitary groups which fuel the cycle of violence and unrest. The Government of Sri Lanka have a responsibility under the Ceasefire Agreement to disarm or relocate these groups from the north and east.</p>
	<p pid="d.124W.3/3">We hope that the peace process will be invigorated following the Presidential elections in Sri Lanka on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November</phrase>. We continue strongly to support the efforts of Norway as peace process facilitator.</p>

We have made repeated calls on President Karimov's Government to allow free and fair elections in Uzbekistan. In a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-29">29 December 2004</phrase>, my hon.

This provides a lawyer to unregistered NGOs, assisting them in preparing documentation for registration, and appealing in the case of refusal. We are also sponsoring an International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT) project aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the Uzbek authorities' efforts in tackling the problem of torture.</p>

	<p pid="d.127W.2/1">There is no such proposal.</p>
	<p pid="d.127W.2/2">The burning of waste tallow as a fuel is currently subject to control as a waste recovery operation under Article 10 of the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC). This requirement is supplemented by the requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC) which comes fully into force on <phrase class="date" code="">28 December 2005</phrase>. It will then be necessary for any such plant also to meet the emissions, monitoring and other operating requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive. It is for plant operators to decide whether to invest in any improvements which may be needed to meet those requirements or to switch to a fuel which is not subject to controls under the directive.</p>
	<p pid="d.127W.2/3">In June I wrote to the European Commission expressing the UK view that the existing requirements of the Waste Framework Directive and the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control (96/61/EC) are sufficient to ensure, that the burning of waste tallow as fuel is carried in ways which protect the environment and public and animal health. I called for the Waste Incineration Directive and the Animal By-Products Regulation (1774/2002) to be amended accordingly although, if agreed, there is little prospect of any amendments coming into effect by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.128W.2/1">Under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, it is an offence for anyone to kill or take a badger, or to attempt to do so, except under licence or in strictly controlled circumstances defined in the Act. The Act also makes it an offence to injure, ill-treat or dig for a badger. Additional protection from baiters is provided for all animals under the Protection of Animals Act 1911. And there is a range of offences under the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 which support action against anyone who sets out to inflict unnecessary suffering on any wild animal.</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.2/2">The level of protection provided for badgers is unique for a non-endangered animal. This reflects the concern this Government have about gratuitous acts of cruelty to badgers, which have occurred too often in the past.</p>

A 3 per cent. rate of compulsory EU modulation will transfer funding from CAP Pillar One subsidies to rural development Pillar Two payments in 2005. The rate will rise to 4 per cent. in 2006, and 5 per cent. from 2007 onwards.

The additional national modulation rate in England is necessary in order to finance an expansion of our agri-environment schemes, and in particular to implement entry level stewardship. The Secretary of State announced last year that this national rate of modulation will be 2 per cent. in 2005 and 6 per cent. in 2006, bringing the overall rate in England to 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. in 2005 and 2006 respectively. Modulation will be 100 per cent. match funded by the Exchequer until at least 2006, which doubles the amount of money available for agri-environment measures.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.2/1">Intervention prices have been reduced in CAP reform agreements over the last decade or so. Intervention prices for most commodities have been substantially reduced.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.2/2">The cereals intervention price was reduced by around 35 per cent. over the period 1993&ndash;94 to 1995&ndash;96 and by a further 15 per cent. in the period 2000&ndash;01 to 2001&ndash;02. It now stands at &euro;101.31. From the start of the 2004&ndash;05 marketing year, rye was excluded from the list of eligible crops for cereals intervention, reducing the potential volume of stocks and therefore expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.2/3">The rice intervention price was reduced by 15 per cent. over the period 1997&ndash;98 and 1999&ndash;2000. Under the 2003 reforms it was further reduced by almost 50 per cent. from the start of the 2004&ndash;05 marketing year. It now stands at &euro;150/t and intervention purchasing is limited to 75,000 tonnes of rice per annum.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.2/4">The beef intervention price was reduced by 20 per cent. in 1999. It now stands at &euro;1,560/t.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.5/1">Under the CAP reform agreement reached in June 2003, the main direct payments in the arable, beef and sheep sectors are replaced by the new decoupled Single Payment Scheme (SPS). Ten member states introduced the SPS at the earliest possible date, 2005, and five in 2006. (Separate arrangements apply to the 10 new member states.) Additionally, the direct payment in the dairy sector is being integrated into the SPS between 2005 and 2007. Member states also have the option to re-couple a limited percentage of certain payments when introducing the SPS. For those member states introducing the reforms in 2005, all bar Ireland and Luxembourg have made some use of these options, including the UK in respect of a national envelope for the beef sector in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.5/2">In the second wave of reform agreed in May 2004, a significant part of the production linked payments in the tobacco, hops, olive oil and cotton sectors are also to be decoupled from 2006. In addition, the Commission has recently proposed reform of the sugar sector which would see compensation for changes to the market regime being integrated into the SPS.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.8/2">We want to build on that model, including through the reform of the sugar regime, for which my Department has published a detailed assessment of the European Commission's proposals.

	<p pid="d.133W.2/1">The Government have had concerns about setting a ceiling on individual farm subsidy payments because it would add further distortions to the system.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.2/2">Payment limits would have a disproportionate impact on many of the larger, more efficient farms which are better able to compete in an increasingly globalised and liberalised market, and thus may perpetuate the industry's dependence on subsidy and discriminate against those countries with the best farm structure to compete globally.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.2/3">A ceiling could also discourage the industry from restructuring and divert farmers into adopting a business structure which maximised subsidy by avoiding the impacts of the ceiling, rather than adopting the most efficient, market-based business model to provide long-term economic viability.</p>

This is comprised almost entirely of staff costs, with a small spend on supporting activities including training, monitoring and evaluation to enhance the effectiveness of its media communication activities for the benefit of the public.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.2/2">The Environment Agency places significant importance on disseminating information and advice and accounting publicly for its activities to the widest possible audience in a cost-effective way. It therefore employs dedicated press officers in its head office, and in each of its eight regions, to make the public aware of the agency and its responsibilities, to reinforce its regulatory role and generally to ensure strong coverage of environmental issues. It strives to reach national, regional and local audiences by securing editorial coverage in all types of media.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.2/3">The media is also a vital communication channel during civil emergencies, including flooding and environmental incidents. The Environment Agency's press officers provide a 24 hour service, 365 days of the year, to ensure that important information can always be targeted to appropriate news and other media outlets. In the event of flooding, press officers are in the front line in disseminating warnings, information and advice to the public via the media.</p>

	<p pid="d.138W.2/1">Defra is fully committed to the diversity and equality agenda and has policies 'embedded' throughout its HR policies as well as processes in place to ensure that there is no unfair discrimination on any grounds.</p>
	<p pid="d.138W.2/2">Defra operates in a global market, and the UK is a multi-cultural society. Defra needs representatives from different ethnic backgrounds and different minority groups to compete in business terms. It needs staff who can understand its customers and their cultures, who can communicate with them effectively, reflecting the communities in which Defra works. These include the farming, fishing, food and water industries, together with other industries challenged to meet consumers' requirements, as well as the public itself living within either rural or urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.138W.2/3">Defra's diversity and equality policies are promoted through a number of initiatives. These include funding of specific diversity and equality-related training courses; e-learning diversity training packages; in-house staff networks, which provide support for staff in minority groups; and mentoring schemes for minority groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.138W.2/4">The current staffing figure for the Department's Diversity and Equality Unit is standing at 10, of which three are working on a part-time basis as part of Defra's flexible working opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="d.145W.8/1">I understand from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) that there was a nuclear reactor site at Queen Mary College, East London. Following the reactor's being taken out of use, an independent radiological survey was carried out under the auspices of HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in August 1983. As a result of this survey and an earlier one carried out by the college, waste was removed from the site and decontamination carried out. The site was then delicensed by HSE. In doing so, HSE were required, under the terms of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, to be satisfied that there was no longer any residual danger from ionising radiation at the site. Queen Mary College's period of responsibility under the 1965 Act ended on <phrase class="date" code="1983-11-25">25 November 1983</phrase>.</p>

They assessed that the reactor's former presence do not and will not pose a risk to the Olympic Development. In particular this assessment was made as the facility is no longer in existence and has been safely decommissioned.</p>

	<p pid="d.146W.2/1">There are two types of petrol vapour recovery systems which can be fitted at petrol stations. Petrol Vapour Recovery stage I controls (PVR I) reduce emissions of petrol vapour during the delivery of petrol from road tankers to petrol stations; and stage II controls (PVR II) which reduce emissions of petrol vapour during the refuelling of vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.2/2">PVR I is required at all UK petrol stations with sales above 500 cubic metres of petrol a year. The PVR I controls should prevent all petrol vapour from this source escaping to the atmosphere. Statutory guidance reflects the mandatory requirements relating to the technical standards systems must meet when installed. The guidance also specifies the maintenance regime which must be carried out to ensure PVR I systems continue to operate effectively. Local authorities carry out periodic inspections of petrol stations to ensure compliance with the requirements.</p>

	<p pid="d.151W.3/1">The Department's current estimate for the number of plastic bags given away in England between these dates is 66.8 billion bags. This estimate is based around a figure of 10 billion per annum for UK carrier bag usage, contained within a consultant's report for WRAP in 2005. This figure was cited by in the Scottish Executive's Extended Impact Assessment for the plastic bag levy bill. The figure for England per annum is generated by calculating the proportion of the UK population that live in England (currently 83.5 per cent.) and adjusting the UK figure accordingly. In calculating this figure over several years it has to be assumed that the figures have been constant since 1997 as we do not hold any data relating to the fluctuations in usage over this period.</p>

It is possible that Defra will be able to meet the full cost of operating CPET from within its own financial resources. We will be able to forecast this more accurately in the light of the demands made on the CPET over the coming months. As a contingency measure Defra would be able to call on contributions agreed with some other Government Departments to help with any shortfall during the first three years of operation.</p>

	<p pid="d.160W.5/2">The four US ships are currently docked in Able UK's Graythorp dock on Teesside. Able UK submitted applications for planning permission in January 2005. These applications, which include proposals for the construction and refurbishment of quays, the construction of a cofferdam and new dock gates, are being determined by the relevant planning authority, Hartlepool borough council. The council is currently waiting for Able UK to resubmit the environment statement in support of their applications before they determine the application. Able UK made an application for a waste management licence to the Environment Agency in February 2005. This application also cannot be determined until Able UK's environment statement is completed.</p>
	<p pid="d.160W.5/3">In the meantime, dismantling work is prevented by a condition in the existing waste management licence. The dock facility itself is subject to regular inspection by the Environment Agency in liaison with the Health and Safety Executive. Environmental monitoring indicates that storage of the four US naval ships at Able UK's Graythorp dock has not had a detrimental impact on the environment.</p>

	<p pid="d.161W.3/1">The Government takes the issue of water affordability very seriously but believes that solutions must be explored from a national, rather than a regional, perspective. A steering group was set up last year to look into water affordability issues. The Steering Group reported to Ministers in autumn 2004 and the Government's report into affordability was published in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.3/2">Financial support for families and for pensioners on low and moderate incomes has risen significantly in recent years. The Government will press on with its policy of promoting fairness and using changes to the tax and benefit system to tackle poverty but is not minded to introduce an explicit linkage between the tax and benefit system and water charges.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.3/3">The Government have already taken action, through legislation, to provide protection in the form of a capped bill for vulnerable, low income groups in receipt of a metered supply who might otherwise cut back on water that they could not afford.</p>

	<p pid="d.162W.0/1">Thames Water have taken steps to reduce the rate of leakage across its area of supply. During 2004&ndash;05 the company reduced overall leakage for the first time since 1999&ndash;2000. However, they still failed to meet their overall leakage target of 905 Megalitres/day by 10 Megalitres/day (1.1 per cent.). Reported leakage was 915 Megalitres/day in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.0/2">Despite not meeting their overall target, the leakage targets were met in the area outside of London and in South London. It is the North London area where Thames Water continues to have real problems with the control of leakage and this area remains the main challenge.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.0/3">Ofwat continue to require Thames Water to provide quarterly reports on the progress the company is making with its plan, agreed with the regulator, to restore leakage to its target level and achieve adequate security of supplies. These reports indicate that they are continuing to reduce leakage in line with their current targets. Ofwat has set Thames Water the target of reducing leakage to 725MI/d by 2009&ndash;10.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.0/4">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, and Ministers are kept informed of water company performance on leakage and have raised concerns over Thames Water's previous performance on leakage. The Secretary of State has no plans to meet with Thames Water to discuss leakage while the company continues to make progress in line with targets.</p>

On Africa, we agreed a set of measures to help Africa overcome the huge challenges it faces. This included a doubling of aid to the continent by 2010. In helping to achieve this, a group of the G8 countries agreed to continue to consider innovative forms of finance, such as the International Finance Facility and a levy on plane tickets. A working group will consider the implementation of these.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.7/2">The G8 leaders also agreed to act with urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They agreed an action plan to help do this. One part of this wide-ranging plan is a programme of work to examine urgently the impact that aviation is having on the climate, and the scope for technological and operational solutions. We welcome the European Commission's announcement that it supports the inclusion of the aviation emissions in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="d.167W.11/1">Currently, the identity cards programme is continuing to work with public service providers to gather their requirements as potential user organisations of the identity cards scheme. However, the number of occasions that a person will be asked to verify their identity against the National Identity Register will be a decision for the user organisation themselves. This is likely to be dependent on a number of factors, including the nature of their relationship with the individual (e.g. first time interaction, maintenance of details, transactional relationship) and their own business processes.</p>
	<p pid="d.167W.11/2">As such, it is not possible to provide a final estimate for the number of times the Register will be used to verify the identity of an individual in order to secure the effective and efficient provision of public services until further work is completed.</p>

	<p pid="d.173W.5/1">We have used Home Office statistics on the success of police fingerprint systems and our understanding of the proposed operation of the Identity Card Scheme to model the benefit of identifying scenes of crime fingerprint lifts over and above that of existing police processes.</p>
	<p pid="d.173W.5/2">As more fingerprint lifts are identified, the police are able to eliminate those with legitimate access more quickly from their investigation while developing additional leads on suspects. Some of these leads will result in crime detections and halt criminal careers. This in turn will contribute to reducing economic harm caused by crime, which has also been well researched.</p>
	<p pid="d.173W.5/3">Together, these pieces of research allowed us to quantify the benefits of the ID card in this area at 40 million.</p>

	<p pid="d.177W.3/1">The first generation of biometric passports will contain a single facial image that meets the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and US visa waiver scheme. The introduction of a biometric passport will be undertaken through current arrangements for passport application processing systems and passport book production. Third party suppliers for major components will be assessed in conjunction with the existing prime contractors to ensure value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.3/2">The development of the next generation of passports will consider further biometrics in the form of Iris and Fingerprint in light of evolving ICAO standards and EU requirements and international standards for travel documents. The Procurement strategy for the inclusion of a second biometric is under development and it is too early to determine the extent of external supplier involvement.</p>

	<p pid="d.186W.6/2">Forest of Dean district council is an employer member of the Local Government Pension Scheme as administered by Gloucestershire county council. When carrying out actuarial valuations of individual funds, each actuary sets individual contribution rates for each employers' liabilities and their own work forces, balanced against the overall performance of the fund. At the time of the 2004 valuation, the Gloucestershire county council pension fund had overall assets to meet 70 per cent. of its liabilities. Forest of Dean district council have chosen to phase the increase in its contribution rate over three years and the pension fund's actuary has set an employer contribution rate of 14.9 per cent. (2006), 17.2 per cent. (2007) and 19.5 per cent. (2008) of pensionable payroll as part of a process to secure the county council's pension fund's ongoing solvency.</p>

	<p pid="d.188W.0/1">To enable women to build up their own entitlement to a pension, we have introduced state second pension which means that women are now just as likely as men to be accruing second-tier state pension rights. The national minimum wage has boosted the earnings of female low earners, enabling more women to start building up state pensions. Separating the primary threshold level from the lower earnings limit means that many low earners are now building up basic and state second pension rights without having to pay contributions.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.0/2">To encourage the provision of private and occupational pensions that work for women, we introduced part-time workers regulations which ensure that terms and conditions of employment, including those related to access to occupational pension schemes, do not discriminate against part-time workers. We have also introduced stakeholder pensions to offer a low-cost, portable and flexible pension option which can be particularly suitable for women taking career breaks. Measures in the Pensions Act 2004, such as new rules to increase the pension rights of early leavers, are also beneficial to women.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.0/3">To tackle the inequalities in pension provision which affect women pensioners today, pension credit and other tax and benefit changes have lifted 1.3 million women out of poverty. Fair outcomes for women and carers is one of our principles for future reform, and will be one of the criteria on which any proposals will be judged. As part of the wider national pensions debate an event focussing on women and pensions will be held and a report discussing the issue will be published later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="d.189W.0/1">Under the Private Finance Initiative, the estate of the former DSS, was transferred to the private sector in April 1998 for the provision of fully serviced accommodation. Following the formation of the Department for Work and Pensions, the estate of the former employment service became subject to the same partnership contract (known as PRIME) in December 2003. Within the contract, there are specific clauses that cover environmental impacts, and encourage the private sector partner to develop environmental improvements The Department's Estates partner&mdash;Land Securities Trillium, whose Environmental Management System is accredited to International Standard ISO 14001, works closely with the DWP corporate Sustainable Development Team to identify opportunities for environmental improvements. The Sustainable Development Team contract manages this element of the partnership, and continually assesses performance. Regular partnership meetings are held between the Department and Land Securities Trillium to monitor progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.189W.0/2">The partnership approach has enabled innovative measures to be developed&mdash;such as the use of spend to save projects designed to improve energy and water efficiency across the estate, and a programme to maximise the recycling of paper waste. Full details of all measures can be found within the annual DWP Sustainable Development Report, to which Land Securities Trillium make a full contribution.</p>
	<p pid="d.189W.0/3">The current departmental approvals process includes sustainable development as an overarching commitment that all change programmes need to incorporate into their plans. This will ensure that any future Private Finance Initiatives include sustainable development issues, as PRIME successfully did, from the outset.</p>

	<p pid="d.190W.2/1">Governance processes established across the whole Department ensure that progress is reported and measured on a regular basis. A Diversity and Equality Steering Group meets regularly and is made up of senior civil servants and representatives from across the Department. The group is responsible for agreeing and directing action and priorities across DWP. To support this work, each operational area within DWP has its own action plan and governance arrangement. DWP has published a Race Equality Scheme which sets out our progress to date and priorities for the future. DWP publishes a summary of progress annually and reviews the entire scheme once every three years.'</p>
	<p pid="d.190W.2/2">DWP is responsible for 15 non-departmental public and independent statutory bodies. Three of these associated bodies are subject to both the general and specific duties of the Act with regards to race equality. They are the Disability Rights Commission, the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive. Consequently, this means they have a legislative requirement to publish their own schemes.</p>
	<p pid="d.190W.2/3">The remaining bodies, while not being formally subject to any duties under the Act, have set out statements of intent within the Department's Race Equality Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.190W.2/4">The functions of two of these bodies are linked closely with those of two of the Department's agencies and their functions are included in their race equality schemes. Remploy's functions are included in the Jobcentre Plus Race Equality Scheme and those of the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board are covered by the Disability and Carers Service Race Equality Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="d.192W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning what assessment has been made of the impact of the introduction of the SMS2 IT system on staff and customers. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.192W.2/4" class="indent">May I assume that when referring to SMS2 that you are referring to the Customer Management System (CMS). CMS2 is the IT system that has been implemented to support a number of changes in the way that our customers claim benefits through Jobcentre Plus. These changes are part of a wider programme of service delivery modernisation in Jobcentre Plus that also include, for example, greater use of telephone based contact with our customers and the adoption of standard operating processes.</p>
	<p pid="d.192W.2/5" class="indent">The impact of CMS is part of a wider assessment of Jobcentre Plus modernisation activity and investment. This will be taken forward as part of the annual review of the Jobcentre Plus Integrated Business Case. This review takes place during Spring 2006 and reports formally to Ministers and the Treasury. We are currently working towards a first assessment of CMS to inform the 2006 review of the Jobcentre Plus Integrated Business Case, and this assessment will include a staff survey, currently scheduled for early 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.192W.2/6" class="indent">Customer feedback on our services is gained through the Jobcentre Plus National Customer Satisfaction Surveys, and the results of the 2004 survey were published on 30th September 2004. The 2005 survey commenced in September. The surveys give us a clear picture about how our services are perceived by customers, including how well delivered they are, and how easy or difficult they are to access. However, as these surveys are based on a national sample, of 3000 or so customers, and CMS is still in the process of being deployed on a roll out basis across Jobcentre Plus, the 2005 survey may be too soon to fully capture the impact on customers.</p>

	<p pid="d.198W.0/1">Twelve patients entered an authorised clinical trial at an Oxford hospital, although one of these dropped out before completion. A number of patients were recruited into an authorised clinical trial at a London hospital, but the trial was halted with only one patient completed. No other authorised clinical trials of Aimspro have been conducted in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="d.198W.0/2">The Oxford trial examined the effectiveness of Aimspro in visual impairment associated with optic neuritis. The trial failed in its primary and secondary endpoints, but showed some apparent improvement in peripheral vision. However, the effect was not significantly different to placebo. The results do not support Daval International's claim of &quot;dramatic improvement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.198W.0/3">The manufacture and supply of Aimspro is subject to the manufacturer holding the necessary manufacturing authorisation issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and supported by the MHRA's medicines inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="d.198W.0/4">No instructions have been issued to the manufacturers of Aimspro to stop supplying the drug. None of the product is currently available because the nominated manufacturer is not able to manufacture the product to acceptable standards and remains unlicensed.</p>
	<p pid="d.198W.0/5">No data are available to inform an assessment of the effects resulting from the non-availability of Aimspro.</p>
	<p pid="d.198W.0/6">There are approximately 85,000 multiple sclerosis sufferers in the UK. The Department has no knowledge of the number of those who are waiting to use Aimspro nor of the number of prescribing general practitioners waiting to prescribe Aimspro.</p>
	<p pid="d.198W.0/7">The MHRA has provided Daval International and its nominated contract manufacturer with a considerable amount of help and advice since early 2005 concerning the manufacture of Aimspro. The nominated manufacturer is not currently able to manufacture the product to acceptable standards and remains unlicensed. The MHRA has advised Daval on the use of alternative licensed manufacturers and continues to liaise closely with the company regarding manufacturing and supply issues.The speed with which the product can be made available for use in clinical trials or for supply on a named-patient basis is dependent on the progress that Daval and the manufacturer of Aimspro wish to make.</p>

However, the Healthcare Commission has increased its staffing levels and has refined its processes to improve the way it handles second stage national health service complaints.

	<p pid="d.219W.2/1">The national health service exists primarily for the benefit of people who live here lawfully. Arrangements have been in place since 1982 to charge anyone who is not ordinarily resident here for any NHS hospital treatment received. The current rules are set out in the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended. The Department conducted a wide-ranging review of the operation of the hospital charging regime during 2002&ndash;03. This identified loopholes and implementation difficulties arising from changes in travel and migration patterns since the 1989 regulations were first introduced. Amendment regulations, to close the loopholes and make the regulations easier to operate, came into force in April 2004. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the hospital charging regime is being operated more effectively since that time. No further changes are currently planned.</p>
	<p pid="d.219W.2/2">For primary medical services, a public consultation was carried out last year on proposals to change the rules on access to general practitioner services in order to clarify them and align them as closely as possible with those for secondary care.

Since marketing authorisation for mifepristone was first granted in 1991, the MHRA and CSM have received 47 reports of 79 suspected adverse drug reactions in association with its use. The reporting of a suspected adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that the drug was responsible for that event. Many factors, such as the medical condition that is being treated, other pre-existing illnesses or other medications may play a contributing role.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.9/3">The MHRA has carefully evaluated the yellow card reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of Mifegyne use in the UK and has concluded that they do not affect the balance of risks and benefits of mifepristone and that the safety profile of this medicine is adequately described in the summary of product characteristics provided to health professionals and in the patient information leaflet.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.9/4">The MHRA is aware of recent regulatory action taken in the United States (US) following reports of suspected adverse drug reactions in association with the use of mifepristone in a manner that is not consistent with the approved labelling. However, serious adverse reactions associated with mifepristone have been recently reviewed by the regulatory authorities within Europe and an expert group of the CSM advised that since birth, menstruation and abortion create conditions that are conducive to an increased risk of infection there was currently insufficient data to warrant regulatory action. There has been no contact with the Food and Drug Administration or the manufacturer on this specific issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.9/5">The manufacturer has a legal obligation to provide the MHRA with reports of serious adverse reactions to mifepristone within 15 days of their receipt, including the US/irrespective of the country of origin. Similarly, reports received by the MHRA are sent to the manufacturer within 15 days of receipt. This ensures that both the MHRA and the manufacturer have access to all the available information with which to monitor the safety of mifepristone.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.9/6">As with all marketed medicines, the MHRA will continue to monitor the safety of mifepristone and will take any action to ensure patient safety is maintained.</p>

	<p pid="d.234W.0/1">Solpaflex, in both tablet and gel forms, was first licensed for use in the United Kingdom in 1996, when it was first dispensed on prescription in the community, in England. The licence for the gel form expired in 2001, when the product ceased to be prescribed. The tablet form is still licensed and can be prescribed.</p>

There are no current plans to increase capacity. The Department is currently undertaking a strategic review of the technologies available and further investment may result.</p>
	<p pid="d.237W.2/4">The National Health Service Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) currently has video conferencing facilities in four out of five, or 80 per cent., of its buildings.</p>
	<p pid="d.237W.2/5">NHS PASA continuously monitors usage levels of all video conferencing facilities. There are currently some web camera trials under way for home based workers, but there are no plans to increase the number of conventional video conferencing facilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.237W.2/6">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has video conferencing facilities in all of its four locations.</p>

	<p pid="d.256W.9/1">Promoting equality and diversity are fundamental principles underpinning the functions of each of the 11 Departments in the Northern Ireland administration and the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), and are mainstreamed into departmental processes and decision making. It would not therefore be possible to apportion costs to these activities with any degree of accuracy. However, we estimate that in the 11 Departments of the Northern Ireland administration and NIO there were approximately 135 full-time equivalent (FTE) officials involved wholly or mainly in promoting equality and diversity at a total cost of approximately &pound;4.3 million. The corresponding figure for NIO shows that there were approximately eight FTE officials at a cost of approximately &pound;305,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.256W.9/2">In addition, the budget for the Equality Directorate of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister for delivery of services relating to equality, diversity and good relations the last year was approximately &pound;29 million, including funding for the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, the Community Relations Council and the office of the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People. The Department for Culture Arts and Leisure had a programme budget relating to diversity of &pound;5.3 million last year.</p>

	<p pid="d.264W.5/2">Estimates of the illicit market share for cigarettes and spirits are not made separately for Northern Ireland. Figures for the UK were published by HM Customs and Excise in &quot;Measuring Indirect Tax Fraud&quot; in December 2004, together with a description of the methodology used to derive them. These covered the years 2000&ndash;01 to 2003&ndash;04 for cigarettes and 1999&ndash;2000 to 2002&ndash;03 for spirits. This publication is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.5/3">Because of difficulties in measuring cross-border shopping across the Intra-Ireland border, it is not possible to produce estimates of the illicit market for Northern Ireland in diesel and petrol. However, estimates of the share of these markets in Northern Ireland that are not UK-duty paid for the years 2000 to 2003 were also published in &quot;Measuring Indirect Tax Fraud&quot;</p>

Cash machine charges have also been raised in meetings between Ministers and members of the banking and financial services industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.275W.0/2">The Government believe that people, particularly those on low incomes, should be able to access their cash free of charge. There are over 30,000 free cash machines in the UK. Over 96 per cent. of ATM withdrawals are made at such machines. Other options for obtaining free access to cash include 'cash back' and, for many account holders, free over-the-counter withdrawals at the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="d.275W.0/3">The Government's response to the Treasury Committee's recent report on Cash Machine Charges (the Treasury Committee's Fifth Report of Session 2004&ndash;05) was published by the Treasury Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July 2005</phrase>. The response sets out Government policy on the matter in more detail. Like the Treasury Committee, we see charging cash machines as being a legitimate business model. The majority have been introduced recently in locations where previously there was no cash machine and where there would not be a sufficiently high number of transactions to support a free ATM. The Government does not believe there is evidence to suggest that free ATMs are under threat from charging machines as the number of free ATMs in the UK is still increasing. However, if evidence were found of a significant reduction in the number of free ATMs, then the Government would be concerned.</p>

	<p pid="d.279W.0/1">The Government do not allocate a fixed budget for carer's allowance. Expenditure on carer's allowance is driven by the number of eligible claimants. Expenditure on carer's allowance in Scotland in 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;106.7 million. Expenditure for the United Kingdom in the same period was &pound;1,186.5 million. Depending on their individual circumstances, carers may also be entitled to other social security benefits or tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/2">In England the carers grant was introduced in 1999 and since then has provided an extra &pound;450 million over the past five years, to increase the number of breaks for carers. In 2004&ndash;05 the grant was &pound;125 million. The grant is worth &pound;185 million in 2005&ndash;06 and will continue at this level until 2007&ndash;08 at least. This is an area of devolved policy and therefore the budget for carers in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive.</p>

	<p pid="d.289W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell to Mr. Graham Brady, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning what assessment has been made of the statistical robustness of the methods used by Eurostat to estimate and allocate extra-regio shares of off-shore GDP. (15739)</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/4" class="indent">In 2001, the Office for National Statistics, along with 5 other EU Member States, participated in a Task Force set up by Eurostat to review a number of quality issues concerning Regional Accounts. The Task Force recommended that extra-regio GDP should be shown as a distinct item in the accounts and that regional GDP per head figures should therefore exclude that part of GDP attributed to extra-regio. The ONS considers that the Task Force recommendation is easy to implement and makes statistical sense. Apart from the assessment of the Task Force, I am unaware of any other assessment specifically made of Eurostat's treatment of extra-regio shares of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/5" class="indent">Eurostat's current treatment of extra-regio GDP, however, does not comply with the Task Force's recommendation; they allocate estimates of extra-regio GDP to regions pro rata to their share of national GDP. The Office for National Statistics regards this treatment as inconsistent with the European System of Accounts (ESA) regulation of 1995 and the European Commission's NUTS regulation (2003). The latter regulation specifically identifies extra-regio as a separate statistical entity and therefore any relevant statistics should be shown separately.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/6" class="indent">I should say, to avoid any doubt, that there is no difference between the ONS and Eurostat regarding the method used to estimate extra-regio shares of GDP; the ONS in fact supplies Eurostat with extra-regio estimations based on the 1995 ESA regulation.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/7" class="indent">My predecessor wrote to the Director General of Eurostat earlier in the year to argue that the extra-regio component of GDP should not be allocated to the regions of the Member State, in keeping with the Task Force recommendation and the intention and spirit of the NUTS regulation.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/8" class="indent">Eurostat have agreed that our concerns are well-founded and demand further examination.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.2/9" class="indent">They consider the most appropriate action is to review the issue in the longer term as part of a wide-ranging review of Regional Accounts. They have identified late 2006/early 2007 as the best opportunity to commence such work.</p>

	<p pid="d.293W.3/1">In Budget 2005 the Chancellor announced the creation of an Integrated Business Stream within HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for all activity with respect to charitable organisations and donations, including repayment of tax to charities. In 2004&ndash;05 the HMRC Charities Business Stream employed the equivalent of 20 full-time staff in administering 119,361 Gift Aid claims. Gift Aid claims are processed on a dedicated computer system. Minor updates to that system take place regularly. The last major update of the system was in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.3/2">The HMRC Charities Business Stream employs the equivalent of three full-time staff in relation to the policy maintenance of all direct tax charitable reliefs, including Gift Aid.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.3/3">There are two full-time staff in the Treasury's Charity Tax Unit, which is responsible for developing policy in relation to tax relief for giving to charity and the taxation of charities. Other officials also contribute to work in this area as part of their normal duties. It is not possible to quantify the resource devoted by the Treasury specifically to Gift Aid.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.3/4">When a charity first makes a claim for the repayment of tax under Gift Aid, HMRC is required to complete various security checks. This can cause a delay in making the repayment. However, in 2004&ndash;05 93 percent. of subsequent claims were processed within 10 days.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.3/5">The records maintained by HM Revenue and Customs do not identify individual donations. In 2004&ndash;05 there were 119,361 Gift Aid claims by charities with &pound;625 million repaid in relation to these claims&mdash;an average repayment of &pound;5,236 per claim. A single claim can relate to one donation or many thousands of donations.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.3/6">A charity making a claim for a repayment under the Gift Aid scheme must complete HMRC form R68 (2000) giving the charity's details, the total amount of the claim and the period to which it relates. It must also complete a schedule&mdash;the R68 (New Gift Aid)&mdash;giving details of donors and their donations.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.3/7">Gift Aid legislation does not place restrictions on how often a charity may reclaim tax under the Gift Aid scheme. In practice HMRC will normally accept claims made as frequently as a charity chooses. Where claims are for very small amounts HMRC may ask the charity to restrict claims to one per year.</p>

	<p pid="d.296W.9/1">The UK is committed to enhancing the accountability of the IMF to all of its membership. As a practical example of this, for the past six years, the UK Government have published a report to Parliament on the activities of the IMF. In addition, the UK has pushed for wider transparency from the institution as a whole through, for example, increased publication of IMF documents which has facilitated more accountability by parliaments and civil society, including in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.296W.9/2">As a practical way of increasing the voice of developing countries in the IMF and thus enhancing the responsiveness of the Fund to developing country concerns, the UK, with other donors, has also established a trust fund to build the analytical capacity of sub-Saharan African Executive Directors in order to better enable them to represent their constituencies more effectively at the IMF. The UK will also continue to argue for a package of further reforms and, in particular, an increase in the Basic Vote, to enhance the voice of developing countries within the IMF.</p>

The Report, published in February 2005, estimates the receipts of NICs and payments from the National Insurance Fund for the years 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 and the balance in the fund at the start and end of each year. The Fund provides for state retirement pensions and other contributory benefits, and the Government are determined to continue managing it prudently.</p>

On the basis of the revised dataset this is now estimated to be 3.3 per cent. However, given that HM Treasury estimates of trend growth are based on whole economic cycles, and that the current cycle is now estimated to have started in 1997H1 and not ended, it is not yet possible to give definitive estimates of trend growth over the current economic cycle.</p>

	<p pid="d.314W.5/1">Pension tax simplification replaces the numerous existing tax regimes with a universal regime for tax-privileged pension savings providing greater flexibility to some 15 million pension savers. Currently most pension funds may invest in property, and many do. Under the new simplified regime self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) and small self-administered schemes (SSASs) may invest in all types of property including residential property from <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2006</phrase>. Around 200,000 people, compared to over 15 million pension scheme members, hold these specialist pension vehicles. Creating a single set of allowable investments across all pension schemes fits the requirement to create a single regime for tax privileged pension saving and corrects an existing distortion by giving investors greater choice.</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/2">Using a SIPP to invest in a buy to let residential property or holiday home will have the following consequences:</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/3" class="indent">the property becomes an asset of the pension fund and there is a requirement to put all rental income into the pension fund so it is locked away and cannot be accessed until retirement;</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/4" class="indent">if the property is made available to a member of the scheme or members of their family it will give rise to a benefits in kind tax charge if a market rent is not paid (even if they choose not to use it);</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/5" class="indent">any property bought by the pension fund in most cases will need to be sold before the pension can be drawn, to provide a secured income in retirement;</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/6" class="indent">only 25 per cent. of the capital in the property will be able to be extracted as a lump sum, the remainder will be locked in the pension to be drawn out over the period of retirement;</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/7" class="indent">the restriction on borrowing of 50 per cent. of the value of the scheme's assets will limit the numbers who have or are able to build up sufficient funds in their SIPP to purchase a property;</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/8" class="indent">although any rental income or capital gains from the disposal of the property will be tax free in the pension fund when the money is extracted it will be taxed at 30 per cent. (higher rate tax at 40 per cent. on 75 per cent. of the gain assuming 25 per cent. is taken as a tax free lump sum) which is higher than the rate under the CGT regime payable after the property has been held for seven years;</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/9" class="indent">putting any previously-owned property into the SIPP will trigger any unrealised chargeable gain on the property, and transaction costs such as stamp duty;</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/10" class="indent">maximum tax relief on contributions made in any year is 100 per cent. of UK chargeable earnings, subject to an annual allowance set initially at &pound;215,000. Tax relieved pension savings are also subject to a lifetime allowance initially set at &pound;1.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/11">Therefore, although the measure will increase the number of pension funds that can invest in residential property, these factors will mean that for most people (including the relatively few affected by the liberalisation) residential property will not be an appropriate investment.</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/12">The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) &quot;Simplifying the Taxation of Pensions&quot; published in April 2004, which can be found at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/simplifying-pensions.pdf">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/simplifying-pensions.pdf</a> set out an assessment of the potential impact of the whole pensions simplification package, including the changes to the lifetime allowance and ages at which pensions can be taken, together with allowing residential property into SIPPs and SSASs. These elements cannot easily be separated and therefore the RIA estimates the overall cost of the pensions simplification package to the Exchequer at around &pound;&frac14;billion within four years. Paragraphs 55 and 56 deal specifically with the potential consequences of allowing residential property into SIPPs and SSASs.</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.5/13">The Government will keep this aspect of the tax system, as with all others, under review.</p>

	<p pid="d.316W.6/1">The latest available data is for 2003&ndash;04 and relates to the average (interpreted as the mean) price for sales of Right-to-Buy council properties in England. The estimated mean price for the sale of a Right-to-Buy (RTB) property is &pound;43,000, which would mean there being no Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) on the sale of a property selling for that price. However the mean SDLT payable would not be zero if there were RTB properties which sold for more than the SDLT threshold (&pound;60,000 in 2003&ndash;04). An estimate for the mean SDLT payable is not available although the median SDLT payable will be zero.</p>

In some cases substantially the same scheme may have been disclosed more than once by different promoters, but it is not always possible to establish this before investigations into the scheme users' tax returns have been undertaken. The number of promoters who made disclosures in that period is 100. These figures attest to the success of the disclosure rules.</p>

Moreover, the disclosure rules are designed to help HM Revenue and Customs prevent such loss. The disclosure rules are a success, and disclosures have informed a number of anti-avoidance measures in this year's Finance Bills.</p>

	<p pid="d.325W.8/3">Since 1971, this has developed into Extra Statutory Concession (A19) under which tax can be waived where arrears arise because of the Department's failure to make proper and timely use of information supplied by the taxpayer, so that they could reasonably have believed their tax affairs were in order.</p>

	<p pid="d.327W.15/1">There are no targets for the take-up of working tax credit and child tax credit. Initial analysis suggests that in its first year, child tax credit achieved an estimated take-up rate of 80 per cent. by caseload, considerably higher than the take-up rate in the first full year of working families' tax credit (62 to 65 per cent.) and the first year take-up rate for family credit (57 per cent.).</p>

HMRC and HMT's procurement policy pays proper regard to environmental issues while still securing best value for money. Assessments of environmental impact and against sustainable development criteria are made by the Departments' procurement staff, who consider environmental issues at the start of a procurement. Details of any environmental requirements that suppliers need to be aware of will always be included in our invitation to tender documents. To support the general greening Government policy, we would expect a potential supplier to have environmental management systems in place on the lines of ISO 14001, which is increasingly being adopted by the more responsible sections of industry.</p>

	<p pid="d.330W.9/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/2" class="italic">HM Treasury</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/3" class="indent">The Treasury's five video conferencing (VC) units provide facilities for all the Department's staff (ie 100 per cent.). There are no plans to increase the number of VCs.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/4" class="italic">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/5" class="indent">HMRC currently have 152 VC units and will have 300 by 2007. They are sited to meet demand and as a result multiple VC units are located where there are high concentrations of HMRC staff in locations such as London, Telford, Newcastle, Southend, Liverpool and Manchester. Quoting a percentage figure for the number of HMRC offices which have VC units would not give a meaningful measure of access or usage.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/6" class="italic">Royal Mint</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/7" class="indent">One VC unit is available at the Royal Mint's site (100 per cent.). There are no current plans to acquire more VCs.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/8" class="italic">Office of Government Commerce (OGC)</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/9" class="indent">There are 18 VC units serving all of OGC's offices (100 per cent.). There are no current plans to acquire more VCs.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/10" class="italic">Office for National Statistics</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/11" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has a total of six VC units, with two each at its offices in London and Newport, and one each at its offices in Titchfield and Southport. Therefore 100 per cent. of ONS sites have this facility. We have a provisional plan to increase this by a further facility at the Titchfield site in the next year.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/12" class="italic">National Savings and Investments</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/13" class="indent">Four VC units cover all of National Savings and Investments sites (100 per cent.). There are no plans to extend VC facilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/14" class="italic">Valuation Office Agency</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/15" class="indent">The VOA has six VC units, representing approximately 7 per cent. of our offices with this facility. The agency intends to increase this number to around 12 VC units within a further six-month period.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/16" class="italic">Debt Management Office</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/17" class="indent">The UK Debt Management Office has no VC units and currently has no plans to install any in the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/18" class="italic">Government Actuary's Department</p>
	<p pid="d.330W.9/19" class="indent">GAD does not have any VC units installed. There are currently no plans to install this feature unless demands arise.</p>

	<p pid="d.335W.9/1">Between June 2004 and June 2005 the Department received approximately 1,300 calls from those seeking support on bullying, of which an estimated 70 per cent. are from parents. Unfortunately, since parents and schools contact the Department on an ad hoc basis we are unable to provide more specific data. Those wanting assistance and guidance are also able to make contact electronically, using the Department's dedicated anti-bullying mailbox. Since March 2005, the mailbox has received 13 requests for support directly from schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.335W.9/2">The Department is also involved in funding several prominent organisations, who are actively involved in providing support for schools, parents, children and young people and promoting anti-bullying good practice. The Department therefore often recommends that inquiries are directed to these organisations themselves for a response. According to recent figures, the ChildLine partnership in schools (part-funded by the Department) was contacted by 425 primary schools, 482 secondary schools and 63 other education settings all requesting support with anti-bullying practice over the period. Furthermore, the Anti-Bullying Alliance (an independent umbrella organisation part-funded by the department) reports that 3,505 schools attended ABA training courses and conferences on anti-bullying, or requested an information pack between September 2004 and April 2005, whilst the ABA also gave direct support to 223 local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.336W.2/1">As data on bullying is not collected centrally we do not have statistics relating to the number of cases of bullying in each London borough. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise.</p>
	<p pid="d.336W.2/2">However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack 'Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence', the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. We also offer specific advice to schools on tackling homophobic bullying and are developing advice on racist bullying.</p>
	<p pid="d.336W.2/3">We have raised awareness of the importance of children who are being bullied telling an adult about what is happening, through our public information film 'Tell Someone' and our leaflets and postcards for children and their parents. Our recent 'Beat Bullying' blue wristband campaign was launched in partnership with Radio 1, during the first national anti-bullying week in November 2004. By the end of December, one million children and young people had answered our call to 'Make a Stand, Wear a Band' and make a visible commitment that they are not prepared to tolerate bullying and will stand by their friends.</p>

The Department itself does not currently hold information centrally about the number of foster carers. However, assisting local authorities to recruit and retain foster carers is a key priority for my Department, to ensure that placements which meet the needs of children and young people can be found without delay. A number of national initiatives are already in place or planned to encourage greater numbers of people to become and remain foster carers, including a Fostering Publicity Pack designed to help local authorities to run targeted local campaigns to recruit new foster carers for looked-after children.</p>

	<p pid="d.349W.5/1">The Government's Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase>, sets clear priorities for public funding to support the drive to ensure that employers have the skills they need to be successful, and individuals have the skills they need to be employable and personally fulfilled. Finding a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners is crucial. My Department's policy is that employers should pay a contribution towards the tuition fee costs for all employees undertaking publicly supported training unless those learners are eligible for free provision eg if the learners are studying for a first full level 2 qualification or undertaking a literacy, numeracy or English language course.</p>

Parents are encouraged to check their children and other family members for head lice as need arises, and to arrange treatment with such additional advice and support from the local health care team&mdash;a school nurse, general practitioner, health visitor or local pharmacist&mdash;as is required. If this exercise is undertaken at the same time by all parents of children attending the school, then the spread of head lice can be controlled. Schools are resourced to maintain relations and facilitate discussion with families over a range of issues which, from time to time, impact upon school activities. These discussions may include, in consort with the school health service, the best approach to tackling head louse infestation.</p>

	<p pid="d.350W.8/2">For those schools that need additional, practical, and in some cases, face to face support in order to complete an effective review, they are able to request support and advice from the local authorities' link and human resources advisers and the four unions and associations that are part of RIG. Further support and guidance is also available from RIG in the form of a national RIG helpline, a self-assessment tool for schools to use in identifying any further assistance needed, and a set of Frequently Asked Questions, which is available on partners' websites. This has been complemented by the hosting of six regional workshops by RIG partners for local authorities and head teachers, the focus of which has been the provision of practical support and sharing of best practice which can be shared widely across schools to assist the restructuring process.</p>

	<p pid="d.353W.6/1">Staging the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London will undoubtedly boost our national PE, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL) strategy. We can use the games to inspire children and young people to take up sport and lay the foundations for lifelong participation. Together with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and other partners, we are exploring how we can further utilise the games to enhance the effectiveness of the PESSCL strategy.</p>
	<p pid="d.353W.6/2">The Government are investing&mdash;including lottery funding&mdash;over &pound;1.5 billion, in the five years to 2008, to deliver the PESSCL strategy. An ambitious public service agreement target has been set to increase the percentage of 5 to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality physical education and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006, and then 85 per cent. by 2008. We are on track to meet the target. Longer term&mdash;by 2010&mdash;our ambition is to offer children the chance to spend at least four hours a week on sport.</p>

The Programme was developed with the help of funding provided by the LSC. In 2005/06 the LSC has emphasised its priorities for further education which guarantee a place in education or training for all young people and a focus on support for adults without a solid foundation of employability skills. As part of the normal annual cycle of planning provision, colleges decide on their continued support for local Team Programmes on the basis of their effectiveness in meeting the needs of young people, value for money, quality of provision and contribution to meeting the targets outlined in the college's development plan agreed with their local LSC. I met with the Trust's Chief Executive earlier in the summer and I am confident that through the LSC and local providers we will continue to support Team Programmes that meet the needs of vulnerable young people.</p>

	<p pid="d.356W.0/1">The Department for Education and Skills does not itself undertake private finance initiative (PFI) projects. PFI projects for the provision of schools are delivered through contracts between local authorities and private sector contractors.</p>
	<p pid="d.356W.0/2">However, my Department gives high priority to sustainability and environmental impact in all school building projects. We want all new school buildings to meet the highest environmental standards, whether procured through the private finance initiative or conventionally. To that end, we have worked with the building research establishment to develop a new specific environmental assessment methodology (BREEAM) for schools. This was launched in 2004. Further information on the schools BREEAM method is available at <a href="http://www.breeam.org/schools.html">http//www.breeam.org/schools.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.356W.0/3">It is now a condition of capital funding from my Department that all major new build and refurbishment projects valued at &pound;500,000 for primary schools and &pound;2 million for secondary schools and involving rebuilding or complete refurbishment of more than 10 per cent. of the floor area of a school should be subject to this BREEAM assessment. This includes PFI projects. All these projects must aim to achieve a 'very good' assessment under the schools' BREEAM. This is a tough new requirement for schools that will ensure that environmental sustainability is considered in design and construction.</p>

	<p pid="d.366W.0/16">The Government believe that truancy sweeps are an effective tool to raise the profile of school attendance in the community and help to stop those pupils who may be in the early stages of drifting into the habit of truancy. They also reinforce the message to pupils and their families that school and local authorities take the issue of attendance seriously. Since nationally co-ordinated sweeps began in 2002, some 92,000 pupils have been stopped: 37,000 (nearly 40 per cent.) of them were out of school without a valid reason and 42 per cent. (almost 16,000) of those without a valid reason were with an adult.</p>

	<p pid="d.368W.0/2">Vocational certificates of education (or vocation A-levels) replaced advanced GNVQs in 2000 but have now been redesigned for 2005 as general certificates of education in applied subjects. Just under 40,000 16&ndash;18 year-olds finished there VCE in 2003&ndash;04. Given how recently these were introduced the Department has not made the type of assessments requested.</p>

A relatively small entry of 113,202 sat the first examinations in 2004 and many of the candidates will still be in further education.

	<p pid="d.368W.3/1">Teaching involves a variety of skills and trainee teachers learn how to create lessons where pupils want to learn and where teachers do not need to shout. To meet the rigorous standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), trainee teachers need to demonstrate that they can create such learning environments. Nonetheless, voice care is important for teachers at every stage of their careers. The training leading up to QTS is the very beginning of a teacher's learning about how to teach. Once a teacher has gained QTS they will pursue continuing professional development opportunities throughout their careers including, if their school agrees it is needed, voice care training.</p>

	<p pid="d.369W.0/22">The Department is working towards consolidation of these sites (which run into hundreds) into a small number of sites which specialise in delivering information and services to a particular audience, (e.g. for those working in schools). As well as this the new technical infrastructure, currently in procurement stage, will provide a centralised content management system (CMS) which means that more costs will be centralised, which will deliver better value for money.</p>

	<p pid="d.382W.5/1">We are carrying out a consultation of a revision of the &quot;Building Regulations and Fire Safety Procedural Guidance&quot;, a document which sets out protocols for the communication of fire safety information and views between building control bodies, fire and rescue services and applicants for building regulatory approval.</p>
	<p pid="d.382W.5/2">The revision is necessary to reflect the proposed changes to fire safety law that will be brought about by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. We will review the responses to that consultation when the consultation closes in mid-November and expect to finish the revised document in the spring of next year.</p>
	<p pid="d.382W.5/3">We have also developed, in parallel, in consultation with stakeholders including the chief fire officers' association (CFOA), key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the overall performance of building control bodies. We have liaised with CFOA about the inclusion of a specific KPI on building control bodies' consultation of fire and rescue services in order to measure the perceptions of the fire and rescue services of the value provided by consultation with building control bodies.</p>
	<p pid="d.382W.5/4">It is hoped that the KPIs can be launched on the ODPM website later this year, and included on the Audit Commission's library of local performance indicators website.</p>

Over the first six years, the Government will spend an additional &pound;74 million over and above Fire and Rescue Authority's forecasts for replacing existing controls, as part of its substantial investment in the modernisation of the fire and rescue service. After all nine controls are operating it is expected that there will be annual savings of over &pound;20 million (30 per cent. reduction in annual running costs), recouping the initial investment and freeing up additional resources, which will be available for spending on other local initiatives such as community fire safety. Over the same 15 year period, leaving the control service in the existing 46 controls would cost &pound;1,090 million and would not provide a fully resilient service.</p>

	<p pid="d.396W.5/1">The Local Government Pension Scheme in England is administered by 81 separate pension fund authorities. The Suffolk County Council Pension Fund is the responsibility of the county council; district councils are employer-members. Actuarial valuations of the pension fond take place every three years, as required by the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1997. Contribution rates for each employer are set having regard to the employers' liabilities and the investment programme of the fond. The rates are designed to ensure that Scheme pension funds remain solvent and meet their statutory pension payment responsibilities. Individual local authorities in Suffolk, other than the county council, do not have separate pension funds. The assets and liabilities for the Suffolk county council pension fond for the last three actuarial valuation exercises are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="d.396W.8/1">London is the only region of England which already has a regional fire and rescue control centre. The London regional control centre was planned before the events of 9/11 and before the current resilience criteria were drawn up. Certain improvements to security have been introduced as a result of the events of 9/11.</p>

The procurement section of the 'Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate' was published in October.

The procurement section includes targets mandating Government Departments to implement a sustainable procurement strategy, environmental clauses and an appropriate training programme.</p>

	<p pid="d.401W.2/1">In relation to the legislation for which this Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible, the Housing Act 1985 contains the housing fitness standard which determines whether a dwelling is reasonably suitable for occupation. Under these provisions, local authorities may require owners and landlords of housing accommodation to deal with defects relating to structural stability, serious disrepair (which may include dangerous electrical wiring), sanitation and hygiene. The fitness requirements are to be replaced by a new framework under Part 1 of the Housing Act 2004. The Housing Health and Safety Rating System will enable local authorities to assess whether any of 29 health and safety hazards&mdash;including those relating to poor sanitation or hygiene, structural collapse and electrical safety&mdash;are present in a dwelling, and to require landlords to take action to protect occupiers from such hazards.</p>
	<p pid="d.401W.2/2">The 2004 Act will also enable local housing authorities to impose conditions on properties required to be licensed under the Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) provisions in Part 2, or under the selective licensing provisions in Part 3. Such conditions must include requirements on the licence holder to keep electrical appliances provided by him in a safe condition and proper working order and to supply to the authority, on demand, a declaration of the safety of such appliances. A breach of a licence condition may result in the licence being revoked and/or a fine of up to &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.401W.2/3">Part 1 of the 2004 Act also contains a general duty on local housing authorities to keep the housing conditions in their area under review with a view to identifying any action that they need to take in connection with housing conditions, licensing or renewal.</p>
	<p pid="d.401W.2/4">The requirements of the Building Regulations 2000 and subsequent amendments may apply where a landlord plans to undertake building work as defined in the regulations. This includes work associated with electrical safety, hygiene and structural soundness. Should a building fall into such disrepair that it becomes dangerous, then the Building Act 1984 provides for the landlord to be required, under a court order obtained by the local authority, to remedy the hazard.</p>

ODPM expect to receive a final report from the contractors later this month. Assuming that the final report is positive, we would hope to take forward the debate on the development and application of such systems in managing risk, both within the fire and rescue service-community, the wider fire industry and other interested parties.

	<p pid="d.406W.3/18">These homes are managed by around 250 tenant management organisations (TMO). Research has shown that in most cases TMOs are performing better than their landlord host local authorities and a majority are engaged in community development activities that contribute to the strengthening of their communities and social networks. They are a good example of community empowerment and we want to continue to promote and encourage the development of the TMO sector.</p>

	<p pid="d.406W.6/1">Following the publication of the Audit Commission's report the Housing Corporation, as statutory regulator for registered social landlords (RSLs), has placed both South London Family Housing Association Limited (SLFHA Ltd.) and its parent association, Horizon Housing Group, into supervision. The supervision process ensures that both SLFHA Ltd. and Horizon Housing Group produce and implement action plans to address the weaknesses evidenced by the inspection report findings. The RSLs will remain in supervision until the Corporation is satisfied that all issues have been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="d.406W.6/2">RSLs that are placed under supervision are considered on a case by case basis. If the Housing Corporation was of the view that an RSL in supervision was in such a financial position that public funds would appear to be at risk, no further funding at all would be provided to the RSL until the issues in question were resolved.</p>
	<p pid="d.406W.6/3">In the case of SLFHA Ltd. and Horizon, where the Corporation had confirmed, prior to the imposition of supervision status, that grant would be provided for specific schemes, that grant will still be made. Development schemes for which grant had been allocated to the Horizon Group but where formal confirmation had not been made prior to the imposition of supervision status are in the process of being re-allocated to another RSL. Neither Horizon Housing Group or SLFHA Ltd. will be permitted to bid for any grant funding or take further properties into ownership or management, while they remain in supervision.</p>
