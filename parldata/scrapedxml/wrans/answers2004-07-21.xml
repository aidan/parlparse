	<p pid=".239W.6/1">I can confirm that Ministers at Defra are fully committed to the continued operation of the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales. The Board plays an important role in protecting the interests of agricultural workers including the migrant workers employed on farms.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.6/2">The Agricultural Wages Board as a non-departmental public body was last reviewed in 1999. There is no longer a requirement to undertake reviews at regular intervals and further reviews will be undertaken by this Department as necessary to confirm that the Board is delivering high quality services efficiently and effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.6/3">Following the last review of the Board we announced that some aspects of the Board's operation would be modernised. We plan to introduce these changes through a Regulatory Reform Order. We do not intend to reduce the protection given to agricultural workers. However, one of our objectives will be to align the operation of the Agricultural Minimum Wage legislation and general employment law as closely as possible. This will lessen the burden on employers in agriculture and allow them to benefit from the more flexible approach available under the National Minimum Wage legislation (including the revised output work provisions that will be introduced in October).</p>
	<p pid=".239W.6/4">The Food and Farming Minister Lord Whitty met representatives of the NFU and the Transport and General Workers Union to discuss detailed proposals in January 2003 and November/December 2004. This issue was also raised in a meeting with members of the Transport and General Workers Union on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June</phrase>. A consensus on the way forward is now emerging and we hope to bring forward more detailed proposals for changes to the Agricultural Wages legislation before the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid=".242W.2/1">Sir Don Curry estimated that implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food would cost in the region of an extra &pound;500 million over the following three years.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.2/2">The Government's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SSFF), which builds on the work of the Curry Commission, was launched in December 2002. As part of the 2002 Spending Review, the Government announced a sum of &pound;500 million to implement the strategy. This is in addition to existing spending by Defra and other Government Departments which is already being used to deliver aspects of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.2/3">The additional funding provided covers a number of major aspects of the strategy. These include the new Environmental Stewardship Scheme (Entry Level and Higher Level) and the IT system to underpin all the England Rural Develop Programme (ERDP) schemes; improvements in livestock traceability and other major animal health and welfare measures; and new food chain initiatives such as the Food Chain Centre and English Farming and Food Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.2/4">Regional delivery of the strategy will be facilitated by many public body and industry representatives and these organisations will work together with both resource and funding support to deliver the vision set out in the strategy. They are making use of Government grants, industry support and the resources of Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies, as well as other Government bodies participating in regional steering groups. Existing support programmes, including the ERDP have been targeted to deliver SSFF regional action plans. Hitherto, land-based scheme budgets have not been managed on a regional basis, but they will be in future when the new ERDP IT system is rolled-out next year. Budgets for the three ERDP project-based schemes are managed on a regional basis, and the following table summarises expenditure on these schemes in 2003&ndash;04:</p>

	<p pid=".242W.2/21"><sup>(1)</sup> RES funds are also available to non-farming businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.2/22">Given the number of public and industry bodies contributing to regional delivery, it is not possible to quantify precisely the level of support available to fund regional delivery. Implementation of SSFF is one of the core tasks of the Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies, and their funding from Defra reflects this. Funding for the Government Offices is provided directly by Defra. The current Defra contribution to the RDA 'single pot', administered by DTI, is to enable RDAs to address rural productivity issues, which are a key factor in achieving the outcomes of the national Sustainable Food and Farming Strategy. In addition, Defra is making a further &pound;1.5 million available to the RDAs in the current financial year to assist with the implementation of regional delivery plans. New tasking arrangements for RDAs, which will take effect from April 2005, will include specific reference to contributing to delivering a customer-focused, competitive and sustainable farming and food industry.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.2/23">It is not possible to differentiate precisely between funds that will be spent in rural areas and funds that will be spent in urban areas, but it is clear that the vast bulk will be spent in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".245W.8/1">Defra has received over 3,000 inquiries from small-scale egg producers on the Registration of Laying Flocks Order and the Egg Marketing Regulations. All producers must register with departments in order to obtain an identifying code. Currently small producers with less than 350 birds are exempt from this requirement, provided that the eggs are ungraded and sold direct to the final consumer.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.8/2">Because of enforcement difficulties in other member states, it was agreed in November 2003 that part of the derogation from marking for ungraded eggs be removed. From <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase> farmers selling eggs from their own farms at local public markets will no longer be exempt from the requirement to mark their eggs, irrespective of the number of laying hens kept A Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared on this in November 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.8/3">The cost for small producers to purchase the necessary equipment is low. A hand stamp can be bought for around &pound;30. The time required to register as a producer and then to stamp eggs is unlikely to be significant. The majority of small producers appear to be satisfied that the costs are reasonable and can be borne comfortably.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.8/4">Some producers with fewer than 350 laying hens will therefore have to register for the first time, in order to obtain a distinguishing number. This measure had the support of the majority of other member states. Sales in farm shops and door-to-door do however remain exempt.</p>

	<p pid=".248W.11/4">Defra are currently exploring with the Agency the possibility of developing a comprehensive training package tailored for local authorities.

	<p pid=".249W.5/1">Under Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 the illegal disposal of hazardous waste can incur imprisonment of up to five years on conviction on indictment. This automatically makes it an arrestable offence. Arrest without warrant can occur in relation to arrestable offences or in relation to non-arrestable offences in particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.5/2">It is open to question however, whether it would be possible to justify, by reference to the level of seriousness, making any act of fly tipping by itself an arrestable offence or one attracting a custodial sentence. However, my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, has indicated his intention under the Police Reform Act 2002 to conduct a public consultation on modernising police powers, which includes the intention to rationalise the powers of arrest.</p>

The delay in starting the scheme will mean that waste disposal authorities will have to make steeper annual reductions in the amount of biodegradable waste they landfill in order to meet the first target year of 2010 but they will have more time to plan how to do this.</p>
	<p pid=".252W.5/3">The Government are using the additional time to raise awareness of the scheme within local authorities and to support those who plan to make use of its provisions. A series of regional events will be taking place later this month to explain the scheme to local authorities, waste management companies and other interested parties. In addition, workshops will be arranged early in 2005 to give local authority officers hands-on experience of operating a trading scheme.

	<p pid=".253W.6/1">The Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme requires local authorities progressively to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill. Incineration, with or without energy recovery, provides an alternative to landfill, as does recycling. It is up to local authorities to develop and implement a strategy for implementing the scheme to match their local circumstances, taking into account statutory recycling and composting targets and planning guidance, among other things.</p>
	<p pid=".253W.6/2">Waste Strategy 2000 provided five estimates of waste management options over the period 2000 to 2020. A 'base case' was modelled so that the additional cost of meeting the landfill targets for biodegradable waste and the waste strategy goals could be calculated. The other four models provided different mixes of recycling, composting and incineration and the additional capacity required for those facilities under each option.</p>
	<p pid=".253W.6/3">The actual figures for additional capacity can be seen in annex C in Part Two of Waste Strategy 2000 (table C8 on page 194).

	<p pid=".259W.2/2">The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Scottish Executive, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Northern Ireland administration, the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland has commissioned fact-finding exercises to establish whether there is any substance to the allegations of inappropriate issuing of Packaging Waste Recovery Notes (PRNs) and Packaging Waste Export Recovery Notes (PERNs) by some packaging waste reprocessors and exporters.</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/3">The first fact finding exercise took place last year and investigated the wood packaging waste sector. On completion of the exercise, the fact finding team presented their findings in a report which can be found on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/topics/packaging/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/topics/packaging/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/4">During the course of the exercise the team established that there were no inappropriate operations of the kind that might warrant criminal proceedings. However, some assumptions were being made, for example about the tonnages of packaging waste in mixed loads, that were unrealistic or were made on the basis of insufficient evidence. The team therefore recommended that the amount of wood packaging waste recycled in 2002 should be reduced by 76,400 tonnes. This was done.</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/5">The second fact finding exercise is currently focusing on the plastic packaging waste sector and the findings will be announced shortly.</p>

The Government will continue to provide grant in aid to support British Waterways' Corporate Plan and in particular to help it address its backlog of maintenance and so enable it to meet its freight and other objectives. British Waterways is also eligible for grants from the Department of Transport's freight facilities grant programme towards infrastructure investments that will lead to identifiable transfer of lorry movements from roads.</p>

The Department also paid the accommodation and utilities costs. These were borne within the overall costs for the building (so separate figures are not available). The contract was re-let in 2000, it was let on a self-financing basis. This gave the contractor freedom to operate commercially and it obviated the requirement for a cash subsidy.

	<p pid=".263W.9/1">Neither we nor the CAA maintain a central record of complaints about the safety of particular airlines. We receive very few complaints from the public about the safety of airlines and these are dealt with as they arise. Appropriate action is taken if a complaint reveals any non-compliance with required standards.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.9/2">Article 117 of the Air Navigation Order establishes a Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme for safety related incidents. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the CAA is advised of hazardous or potentially hazardous incidents and defects, and that knowledge of these occurrences is disseminated so that other persons and organisations may learn from them. This enables an assessment to be made by those concerned of the safety implications of each occurrence.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.9/3">Occurrence reports are an important part of our open reporting culture and the fact that an occurrence report has been made is not necessarily an adverse indication about the safety standards of an airline. The MOR scheme aims to ensure the safety of the UK industry but some reports, mainly relating to occurrences en route in UK airspace, do involve foreign aircraft.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.9/4">The tables, which have been placed in the Libraries of the House, set out the number of aircraft the subject of mandatory occurrence reports by state of registry and aircraft type for the years 2002 to 2004. Slight discrepancies exist between the figures because of the way data is recorded. Section 23 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 constrains the Civil Aviation Authority's ability to release information relating to individual companies that it receives under the MOR scheme. I therefore consider that it would be inappropriate for me to undermine those constraints by publishing a list of airlines whose aircraft have been the subject of mandatory occurrence reports.</p>

	<p pid=".266W.3/2">The hooding of detainees for the purposes of arrest or transit was a standard procedure for United Kingdom troops prior to Operation Telic and, as such, was not specifically brought to the attention of Ministers. The UK believes that hooding during arrest and transit is acceptable when there is a strong military reason, for example to offer security to our own forces and locations or to provide protection to the detainee (through the prevention of identification by other detainees).</p>
	<p pid=".266W.3/3">Military commanders became aware that the practice of hooding could be harmful to prisoners, especially if it was applied inappropriately. They judged that these concerns outweighed the military justification for the continued use of hooding as a means of blindfolding, and that the most prudent, immediate response was to introduce a ban.</p>

	<p pid=".272W.0/1">The Department collects statistics on numbers of teachers and support staff in January each year and will be publishing the figures for January 2004 by local education authority in the autumn. These show an increase in full-time equivalent regular teachers in Nottingham City between 1999 and 2003 of 210 (10 per cent.). Schools make changes in their staffing levels every year in response to a range of issues including changing pupil numbers, new school priorities and the resources available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".272W.0/2">The calculation of the Education Formula Spending Share has a floor and ceiling component which ensures that all authorities see a minimum increase per pupil which is in part funded by having a ceiling which imposes a maximum increase per pupil. In 2004&ndash;05 Nottingham City local education authority received the ceiling increase (6.8 per cent. per pupil) which reduced its Education Formula Spending Share by &pound;2.8 million.</p>
	<p pid=".272W.0/3">The funding allocation for each local education authority for 2005&ndash;06 will be announced in the provisional local government finance settlement in the autumn. However, every authority will receive an increase in the Schools Formula Spending Share of at least 5.5 per cent. per pupil. [Primary and nursery schools will receive a minimum funding increase per pupil of 5 per cent. and secondary schools of 4 per cent. where pupil numbers do not change.]</p>

	<p pid=".273W.9/1">All of the Department's post-16 learning and skills sector capital investment is allocated to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The Department does not provide a specific budget to the LSC for rebuilding and refurbishing property in further education colleges at either the local or regional levels. It is for the LSC to determine for itself the right level of capital investment in further education colleges. Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, will write to the hon. Member on this matter. A copy of his reply will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid=".276W.5/5" class="indent">Make support for orphans and vulnerable children a cornerstone of our response, by dedicating at least &pound;150 million over the next three years to address their needs, including through:</p>

	<p pid=".276W.5/12" class="indent">supporting legislative reform to improve the human rights environment&mdash;including anti discrimination legislation, legislation to regulate the conduct of public institutions like the police, and to guarantee individuals access to services.</p>
	<p pid=".276W.5/13" class="indent">Working with the formal justice sector to make justice systems more responsive to human rights concerns and more accessible to vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p pid=".276W.5/14">The UK Government will also support research to build the evidence base and contribute to effective AIDS programmes worldwide. DFID will work to help co-ordination and information sharing between the various research initiatives concerned with the delivery and the impacts of HIV treatment. In particular DFID will support research efforts, which address access to treatment by the poorest and most vulnerable, including women and children.</p>

	<p pid=".277W.5/1">Total bilateral expenditure on water and sanitation represents approximately 6 per cent. of the Department for International Development's (DFID's) total bilateral aid budget&mdash;about &pound;85 million per year over the last three years. DFID channels a significant proportion of its assistance through multilateral channels such as the European Union, the World Bank and UN organisations (&pound;1.3 billion in 2001&ndash;02): of this DFID's contribution to water and sanitation is estimated at around &pound;40 million per annum. DFID supports international initiatives aimed at raising the profile of water and sanitation and achieving better coordination. These include the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council; the Water and Sanitation Programme (attached to the World Bank); and the Global Water Partnership.</p>
	<p pid=".277W.5/2">DFID does not budget on a sectoral basis. DFID's work and resource allocation is shaped by developing country priorities, notably through support to their poverty reduction strategies; by what other donors are doing; and by our comparative advantage. It is therefore not possible to predict with accuracy water and sanitation sector expenditures for future years. DFID recently published a Water Action Plan that outlines our commitment to ensuring that the water and sanitation targets are given the same international priority as the other MDGs.</p>

	<p pid=".278W.2/1">DFID is planning to spend &pound;7.1 million during the next financial year to tackle HIV/AIDS. Most of this is to support the Government of Kenya's National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS. This strategy will work alongside non-governmental agencies to ensure that HIV/AIDS concerns are considered in all relevant Government activity. Among other initiatives, DFID is supporting the equitable delivery of Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART), including a communication strategy to reduce misuse, and Home Based Care especially for orphans. Alongside the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), DFID is also funding the social marketing of condoms, especially in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.2/2">In education, DFID has been training teachers to teach children about HIV/AIDS. This programme was found to delay the age at which both girls and boys have sex and increased the use of condoms by girls. DFID is therefore increasing this activity and expects to cover 5,000 schools over the next year.</p>

	<p pid=".279W.2/1">DFID supports development work in North West Kenya through partners such as Oxfam and Water Aid Kenya (locally known as Maji na Ufanisi). This work includes long-term development and short-term humanitarian assistance carried out in close collaboration with the Kenya authorities and with local communities. The long-term development approach involves strengthening local organisations to press the Government to provide basic services, including roads and water, and at the same time building community capacity to provide services such as bore hole maintenance at local level.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/2">Part of Oxfam's current work in response to the famine in the North West (which is supported by DFID) is the provision of water for domestic use (construction and rehabilitation of bore holes and pan/dams, well protection and other water points) for both domestic and livestock use. As a result of this, the pressure on water in the North West has been reduced even during this period of drought and famine.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.2/1">DFID's programme in Kenya is subject to the same rigorous safeguards as all our development assistance. These are intended to ensure that funds are spent sensibly, in line with our objectives and with minimal risk of fraud or misappropriation. For this reason, DFID is unable at present to provide poverty reduction budget support to the Kenyan Government, since we are not yet convinced that the Government are seriously committed to fighting corruption and are making good progress on their overall reform programme. However, we can make progress on the Millennium Development Goals by supporting specific sectors and projects.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.2/2">DFID is also supporting the central Government systems that are intended to ensure that public financial resources are monitored and used more effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.2/3">DFID, alongside other donors, are also working to strengthen key institutions that are directly involved in fighting corruption. There is to be increased support to the Director of Public Prosecution, Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission and civil society organisations, such as Transparency International, that work to improve the transparency of public resources.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.2/4">In continued dialogue with the Government, the UK has made clear to the Kenyan Government that allegations about unsatisfactory tendering and contracting procedures are serious and need to be fully investigated. DFID has remained categorical that firm action should be taken against those found to have acted corruptly. DFID has continued to press the Government to pass important legislation including the Public Procurement Bill, the Public Financial Management Bill, and the appointment of a credible Head of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.0/1">Substantial progress has been made since 2002 in improving the transparency and accountability of the Palestinian Authority's (PA) financial management systems. This has largely been driven by the Palestinian Finance Minister with donor encouragement.</p>

The World Bank and donors will carefully monitor the use of donor funds. This benchmark approach was also successfully used by the EC in its earlier budget support to the PA. Allegations about the misuse of these funds have been looked at in great detail, but no evidence has been found that EC funds have been used for anything other than their original purpose.</p>

	<p pid=".286W.8/25">VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1995. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 3.8 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".287W.5/1">The complex array of more than 100 DTI business support schemes that existed at the time of the DTI Review in 2001 has been replaced with a tighter, more targeted package of support based on nine business support products. The Department's work to transform its support to business specifically looked at the issue of overlap and duplication and this was addressed so that the new product set are broad in their scope and avoid duplication. The Department's externally led Investment Committee continues to provide independent scrutiny to ensure our investments in business support products deliver the economic and customer benefits we intend, and that we take action to address any weaknesses identified through rigorous evaluation. This work extends to ensuring that there is no overlap or duplication in DTI's business support offering.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/2">With regard to regional development agencies (RDAs), DTI and the RDAs are working together with the specific aim of avoiding any overlap on the provision of business support products. RDAs have committed themselves to ensure that any new business support schemes or initiative they create will not duplicate or overlap existing DTI business support products. RDAs will seek to build on national DTI products by co-funding and tailoring them to meet regional needs where possible.</p>

	<p pid=".289W.6/9" class="italic">Business Support</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/10">DTI has conducted a review of its Business Support schemes ahead of the Spending Review with a view to working to clear high-level strategic objectives, increasing value created through the investment of taxpayers' funds, rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and improving the customer experience in dealing with DTI. Over 100 schemes have been rationalised into 10 new products, the last one of which will be introduced in 2005. The effectiveness of the new products and resultant efficiency savings will be realised over the Spending Review period.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/11">Savings in the order of &pound;20 million are projected by the end of the Spending Review period, as a result of closing inefficient schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/12">In addition, DTI is rationalising its use of third party contractors to deliver the new Business Support products. By consolidation of the contractor portfolio and more effective procurement, further cost savings of approximately &pound;4 million a year are anticipated over the Spending Review period as the DTI's commitment to legacy schemes is exhausted. The level of support provided to business is expected to remain unchanged at around &pound;500 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/13" class="italic">Agencies and NDPBs</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/14">All of DTI's agencies and non-departmental public bodies are tasked with delivering efficiency gains over the Spending Review 2004 period. Over the Spending Review period, DTI expects the agencies and NDPBs to achieve some &pound;15 million savings, the majority of which is cashable. It is anticipated that these savings will be achieved through a combination of continued delivery and increased output within a climate of reduced funding, reduced estate expenditure and reduced unit cost.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/15">As Companies House, Patent Office are trading funds, and NWML is a net funded agency, they do not appear on DTI's Expenditure Limit and their savings are not claimed against the Department's 2.5 per cent. annual efficiency savings target. These bodies are, however, still expected to generate efficiency gains which they intend to achieve through a number of measures i.e. e-delivery, reduced staff costs, and increased output/reduced processing times.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/16">Other than a very small number of Office of Science and Technology posts moving to the Research Councils in Swindon, there are no plans to meet DTI staff reduction targets by relocating posts from the core Department to sponsored agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/17" class="italic">Audit of inefficient spend</p>
	<p pid=".289W.6/18">DTI is committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Department, including its agencies and non-departmental bodies operate efficiently both now and going forward. We have just completed an efficiency project, reviewing efficiency in DTI, which was scrutinised by the Gershon Review. We continually review our activities as part of annual business planning to deliver greater value for money. We therefore have no plan to commission an in-depth audit of past activities&mdash;to do so would be an inefficient use of resources.</p>

	<p pid=".294W.0/1">Sir Peter Gershon's report on his review of public sector efficiency &quot;Releasing resources to the front line&quot; sets out agreed efficiency targets for all Government Departments including DTI.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/2" class="italic">Procurement</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/3">DTI will aim to achieve savings by improving procurement through a combination of developing and implementing better purchasing practice, making better use of resources within technical and economic research, centralising marketing operations and moving to e-procurement, and savings on rent increases and building service costs by rationalising DTI's estate. This rationalisation involves reducing headquarters in London from six to three buildings over the Spending Review period.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/4" class="italic">Back Office rationalisation and abolition of posts</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/5">My department has developed plans that will enable it to deliver more efficiently DTI's priorities and responsibilities, as reflected in the spending plans announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week. These plans will drive forward efficiencies in all areas of my Department's work, including:</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/6" class="indent">the rationalisation and streamlining of all our &quot;back office&quot; services, including the processing of routine financial and personnel work and a reduction in the number of office support service posts following rationalisation of the Department's London estate from six buildings to three; and</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/7" class="indent">the adoption of a new approach to policy work involving the more effective prioritisation of policy projects and the centralised handling of routine policy inquiries and correspondence.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/8">In conjunction with our estate rationalisation strategy, staff will also operate within a flexible workspace arrangement whereby there will be eight desks available for every 10 staff.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/9" class="italic">Business Support</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/10">DTI has conducted a review of its Business Support schemes ahead of the Spending Review with a view to working to clear high-level strategic objectives, increasing value created through the investment of taxpayers' funds, rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and improving the customer experience in dealing with DTI. Over 100 schemes have been rationalised into 10 new products, the last one of which will be introduced in 2005. The effectiveness of the new products and resultant efficiency savings will be realised over the Spending Review period.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/11">Savings in the order of &pound;20 million are projected by the end of the Spending Review period, as a result of closing inefficient schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/12">In addition, DTI is rationalising its use of third party contractors to deliver the new Business Support products. By consolidation of the contractor portfolio and more effective procurement, further cost savings of approximately &pound;4 million a year are anticipated over the Spending Review period as the DTI's commitment to legacy schemes is exhausted. The level of support provided to business is expected to remain unchanged at around &pound;500 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/13" class="italic">Agencies and NDPBs</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/14">All of DTI's agencies and non-departmental public bodies are tasked with delivering efficiency gains over the Spending Review 2004 period. Over the Spending Review period, DTI expects the agencies and NDPBs to achieve some &pound;15 million savings, the majority of which is cashable. It is anticipated that these savings will be achieved through a combination of continued delivery and increased output within a climate of reduced funding, reduced estate expenditure and reduced unit cost.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/15">As Companies House, Patent Office are trading funds, and NWML is a net funded agency, they do not appear on DTI's Expenditure Limit and their savings are not claimed against the Department's 2.5 per cent. annual efficiency savings target. These bodies are however still expected to generate efficiency gains which they intend to achieve through a number of measures i.e. e-delivery, reduced staff costs, and increased output/reduced processing times.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/16">Other than a very small number of Office of Science and Technology posts moving to the Research Councils in Swindon, there are no plans to meet DTI staff reduction targets by relocating posts from the core Department to sponsored agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/17" class="italic">Audit of inefficient spend</p>
	<p pid=".294W.0/18">DTI is committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Department, including its agencies and non-departmental bodies operate efficiently both now and going forward. We have just completed an efficiency project, reviewing efficiency in DTI, which was scrutinised by the Gershon Review. We continually review our activities as part of annual business planning to deliver greater value for money. We therefore have no plan to commission an in-depth audit of past activities&mdash;to do so would be an inefficient use of resources.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.2/1">This Department provides no funding support to any schools sport association. It is Government policy that schools sport associations work closely with, and receive their core funding from, the governing bodies for their sports. DCMS officials and Ministers have held regular discussions with officers of the English Schools Athletic Association and UK Athletics over the past year about the future of competitive schools athletics. This is an issue that will be taken forward over the coming months by UK Sport and Sport England as part of the Foster Review implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.2/2">DCMS, the Department for Education and Skills and Sport England are supporting the secondment of a Development Manager to the National Council for School Sport. He is working with schools sport associations&mdash;including athletics&mdash;to embed competitive school sport in governing body one-stop/whole sport plans and to ensure that schools competition structures dovetail with the new infrastructure being established under the national strategy for PE, School Sport and Club Links.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.2/3">The results of the 2003/04 PE, School Sport and Club Links Survey showed that athletics is the fourth most popular sport in school sport partnership schools (provided in 90 per cent. of schools) and the fourth most popular in terms of links between schools and clubs (32 per cent. of schools with links to clubs). Athletics is one of 22 sports receiving funding from the Club Links programme to increase the number of such links.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.8/1">The North West Development Agency (NWDA) is working closely with Marketing Manchester, the nominated Destination Management Organisation (DMO) for Manchester. DMOs are effectively mini tourist boards that will ensure a strong visitor and market focus to all that is done within the region, and aim to strengthen the connection that exist within the region between businesses and other organisations that make up the tourism sector.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.8/2">Marketing Manchester also has a key role in securing funds for tourism development from the NWDA. Hence any funding for Manchester Central would need to be secured via that route. During 2003&ndash;04 Marketing Manchester received &pound;898,000 to promote and develop tourism within the sub region. A similar amount has been identified to support their work during 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.8/3">Unfortunately at this stage NWDA cannot show a specific breakdown of funding provided to Manchester Central but the impact of NWDA funding to Marketing Manchester will certainly have been beneficial to the Manchester Central tourism product.</p>

	<p pid=".312W.8/6" class="indent">In addition, many work areas in ONS produce regional-level statistics as part of their routine statistical outputs. However, an estimate of the total expenditure across ONS on the production of regional-level statistics would be very approximate and could only be produced at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".312W.8/7" class="indent">The Allsopp Review of Statistics for Economic Policy Making, whose final report was published in March 2004, made a number of recommendations for improving regional statistics in the UK. In the Government's recent 2004 Spending Review ONS was given the objective of implementing the recommendations of the Allsopp Review. As a result a higher level of ONS's resources will be allocated to regional statistics work than has been the case in recent years.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.2/1">The 2002 Spending Review introduced a joint target for the Treasury, Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to improve the growth rate in every English region and over the long term reduce the persistent disparities in growth rates between the regions. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland regional development is substantially devolved.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/2">The Technical Note published after the 2002 Spending Review, available on the Departmental websites, sets out how this target will be measured, looking at regional Gross Value Added per head figures produced by the Office for National Statistics. The 2004 Spending Review has reaffirmed this target, and an updated Technical Note will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-31">31 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/3">It was also announced that the Office for National Statistics will implement the recommendations of the Allsopp Review in full, which in its final report in March, set out the implications of the regional agenda for economic statistics.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/4">In addition, the Treasury and DTI published a consultation document, Productivity in the UK 5, in March on how progress against productivity, and the drivers of productivity, could best be monitored. A full response to Productivity 5 will be made available soon.</p>

	<p pid=".329W.6/1">The Department for Work and Pensions looks at its pay systems every year to inform the annual pay award process. There is no review report; the outcomes are captured in the pay offer we make to staff. Of the five non-departmental public bodies (NDPB), which the Department is responsible for, two&mdash;Remploy and the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority&mdash;complete a yearly review, which they will place in the Library by the end of August 2004. Both the Disability Rights Commission and the Health and Safety Executive are currently reviewing their pay progression arrangements. The outcomes of both these reviews will be placed in the Library when completed. The Rent Service's most recent review was completed in 2002, and we will arrange for a summary to be provided for the Library by the end of August 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.6/2">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is committed to reviewing its pay policies to ensure that they are compliant with the current equal pay legislation and do not either directly or indirectly discriminate against any group of employees.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.6/3">An Equal Pay Audit was completed in January 2002 in accordance with Cabinet Office guidance. This was based on details from the agencies which formed the Department for Social Security. Following the creation of DWP and the consequent alignment of pay policies, the findings from this report are now out-of-date. The Department is currently undertaking an Equal Pay Audit to review existing DWP policies and to inform the further development of its reward strategy. Once this is complete, a copy of the action plan will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.6/4">Although non-departmental public bodies (NDPB) are not committed to completing an equal pay review, they are encouraged by the Department to conduct them. NDPB's staffed by civil servants follow the Cabinet Office commitment (e.g. HSE). Of the five NDPB's that the Department is responsible for, two (the Disability Rights Commission and The Rent Service) have conducted equal pay reviews, and the relevant documents will be put into the library by the end of August 2004. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority has no current plans to complete an equal pay review, as they will cease to exist from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>. Remploy will be making plans to complete an equal pay review on appointment of their new HR Director on the <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-26">26 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.6/5">The final NDPB, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), submitted a draft equal pay action plan to Cabinet Office in 2003. When a finalised version has been agreed that incorporates the findings from a current review of pay progression arrangements it will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".332W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.3/2">Where central and local government departments and their agencies are holding public meetings as a service to the public, they are covered by the service provider provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) and have legal duties under Part 3 of the Act to make reasonable adjustments to enable disabled people to make use of them. In some instances, public meetings may form part of the function of a central or local Government department or its agencies. Currently, the access duties under Part 3 of the DDA do not extend to functions of public bodies. However, a proposal in the draft Disability Discrimination Bill would bring all such functions within the scope of Part 3 of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.3/3">The Government are currently running a campaign to remind service providers of their duties under the DDA. The campaign focuses on the new duties being introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>, which require service providers to make reasonable adjustments to physical features of premises which make access to the service impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.3/4">The Disability Rights Commission (DRC), which is a non-departmental public body of the Department for Work and Pensions, published a revised statutory Code of Practice in 2002 explaining the service provider provisions, including the new duties from October 2004. In addition, the DRC has been working in partnership with the Local Government Association to raise awareness of the implications of the service provider duties for local authorities and to develop guidance on implementing the DDA duties within local authority service provision.</p>

The policy is being continuously enhanced with the proposed expansion of the detention estate; the development of more static reporting centres; the development of Immigration Service staff based at police stations; the rollout of induction centres at the beginning of the asylum process and the piloting of biometric reporting i.e. voice recognition, tagging and kiosk based reporting.</p>

	<p pid=".336W.3/1">The identity cards scheme will be an inclusive scheme, designed to cover everyone who has the right to be in the United Kingdom. It will show that everyone belongs to our society whether they were born here, have chosen to make their home here or are just staying for a while to study or work. It will help people prove their identity to access services such as free health treatment or benefits and give everyone confidence that legal migration will not result in increased fraudulent use of hard-pressed public services. If our communities have confidence in our immigration controls, they will be more welcoming of new arrivals, helping to promote a more cohesive society.</p>
	<p pid=".336W.3/2">The identity cards scheme itself is non-discriminatory as it is intended to cover everyone in the United Kingdom for longer than a specified period (three months). The scheme will not, in general, require people to obtain a specific, additional document as it will be designed to make use of existing documents that will be designated as identity cards. Most members of the identity cards &quot;family&quot; will be enhanced versions of existing identity documents which are very widely held familiar documents that are already used as proof of identity.</p>
	<p pid=".336W.3/3">A partial race impact assessment was published with the draft Bill (CM 6178). This was developed following consultation with representatives of black and minority ethnic groups and research undertaken with these groups. Further assessments will be made as the design of the scheme develops, focusing mainly on how the introduction of ID cards affects the use of existing police powers, how the scheme is administered and its use in relation to access to services and employment.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.2/1">Yes, all payments for passport services are processed as soon as the application is received. There are good reasons for this. On security grounds, so that large sums of money are not held at passport offices. On grounds of regularity, so that passports are only issued to customers who have paid in full and for process efficiency. In processing over 5 million passport applications annually it would be impossible to keep payments with applications throughout the whole issuing process.</p>

It is not UKPS's normal policy to make compensation payments for loss of enjoyment, distress or inconvenience arising from such errors.

	<p pid=".338W.4/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.4/2">This question has been referred to me as I hosted the meeting at Hassop Hall with my Interior Ministry counterparts from France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We discussed a range of issues that relate to co-operation on counter-terrorism. It was a very useful meeting covering a number of areas of joint interest.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.4/3">ID cards can allow travel throughout the EU, so we need to ensure that security standards are on a par with those relating to EU visas, residence permits and passports.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.4/4">We felt that it would be important to look at strengthening ID card security, specifically measures on the incorporation of biometric identifiers, and methods to ensure a more robust issuing procedure.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.4/5">Following on from this we felt that strong support should be given to the Commission's proposals for further action in facilitating the exchange of information on lost, stolen and forged passports between member states and Interpol. This would be on a basis consistent with G8 and ICAO initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.4/6">We discussed how there could be benefits in Europol focusing on a number of clearly defined tasks in the counter-terrorism field. This could be in addition to its main role on organised crime. Analyses of the links between organised crime and terrorism, and the flows of finances that support terrorist organisations were considered. We particularly welcomed presidency ideas concerned with the disruption of these flows.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.4/7">Ensuring our security through co-operation is a key goal for all member states. I believe that through discussion and working together closely we can give impetus to these important areas of work in the EU and deliver real practical outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".342W.8/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office costs in relation to 2003&ndash;04 are not yet available. The salary costs to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of employees working in public relations and publicity came to &pound;1.8 million in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;2.1 million in 2002&ndash;03. These figures exclude the salary costs of employees working on public diplomacy (the objective of which is to promote the UK overseas), recruitment advertising, provision of public information such as travel advice, and production of annual reports. They also exclude costs associated with Press and Public Affairs Officers at overseas posts, which could be provided only at disproportionate costs. Figures for previous years are not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid=".351W.6/1">The national treatment agency (NTA) for substance misuse is developing guidance on models of regional commissioning, to enable implementation of regional systems for the commissioning of residential drug and alcohol misuse specific services (Tier 4). Clear and concise guidance setting out recommended models for regional commissioning of Tier 4 services will be available shortly. This will be used by NTA regional teams to implement local commissioning mechanisms by the end of December 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.6/2">The regional commissioning implementation is part of the NTA's Tier 4 work programme which has been widely consulted on by key stakeholders in the substance misuse field, including voluntary sector agencies. The consensus in consultation was that regional commissioning would lead to more effective and efficient commissioning of Tier 4 treatment, and would improve client access. Although not directly targeted at alcohol specific services, this work is applicable for all substance misuse services.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.6/3">The Tier 4 work programme is advised by an advisory group consisting of a broad range of representatives involved in Tier 4 treatment provision, including voluntary and statutory sector service providers, commissioners and service users.</p>

From the evidence base available it also concluded that the tangible benefits would include:</p>

	<p pid=".367W.12/1">Adverse effects vary greatly with the specific substance and mode of administration.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.12/2">There is a wide range of immediate physical health effects reported including: flushed face and neck; cold sweats; loss of balance, unsteadiness, lack of co-ordination; fainting; headache; nausea and vomiting; confusion, dizziness, disorientation; tachycardia, palpitations; drowsiness, sedation, unconsciousness and risk of accidental injury while intoxicated.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.12/3">There is a range of potential immediate psychological adverse effects reported including: confusional states, disorientation; distorted perceptions, delusions, hallucinations, pseudo-hallucinations, and aggression, agitation or fear.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.12/4">A number of immediate socially significant adverse effects have been reported including: accidents (road traffic accidents, swimming accidents, fires, falls); disinhibition, possibly leading to engagement in high risk behaviour (dangerous driving, unsafe sexual practices), or the risk of becoming a victim of crime; acute intoxication that may possibly result in aggressive and violent behaviour, or disorderly conduct; relationship problems and impairment of educational achievements in adolescents.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.12/5">Adverse effects of longer-term use that have been reported include: peripheral neurological damage and brain damage; renal failure; hepatotoxicity; severe gastrointestinal upset; muscle damage, and in the very long term, for example, 10 years or so, lasting impairment of brain function&mdash;affecting especially control of movement. Some of these effects may be reversible on stopping use.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.12/6">Fatal toxicity varies greatly with the specific substance, and the causes of death can be unclear. A number of causes of death through solvent abuse have been described including: most commonly, cardiac arrhythmia or accident; loss of consciousness and death through choking on vomit; suffocation, for example, if a plastic bag is placed over the head to inhale and asphyxiation from blocked airways, (due to intense cooling in mouth) and laryngeal spasm caused by squirting lighter fuel down throat.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.12/7">Combining use with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants will bring increased risk of asphyxiation and death.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.12/8">Solitary use in potentially dangerous settings may increase risk of injury.</p>

	<p pid=".370W.3/1">The Yellow Card scheme was recently subject to an independent review led by Dr. Jeremy Metters and the recommendations of the review are out to consultation, apart from the recommendation to introduce direct patient reporting, which has been accepted in principle.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.3/2">The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has carefully reviewed the criticisms made in the article by Medawar and Herxheimer in relation to follow up and coding of reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with paroxetine (Seroxat) received through the yellow card scheme. Professor Herxheimer and Mr. Medawar contributed to the Metters review.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.3/3">Yellow cards submitted by health care professionals are held as scanned images and coded data are transposed onto the adverse drug reactions online information tracking (ADROIT) system. This is a relational database of around 500,000 reports, which enables complex analyses to be performed to detect new or changing drug safety hazards. Data from the yellow card scheme cannot be used to quantify the risk of an adverse reaction. Standard operating procedures are in place which ensure quality control of data.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.3/4">Errors in transposition onto the database occur at a low rate and are kept to a minimum by quality checks. These transposition errors do not impact on signal detection and risk evaluation.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.3/5">The standardised terms used for coding were based on what has become the internationally adopted standard in drug regulation, MedDRA&mdash;the medical dictionary for regulatory activities. The ADROIT classification procedure reflects as closely as possible the words used by the reporter rather than introducing further interpretation of the reporter's words. The image of the original yellow card is available alongside the electronic record. This enables the MHRA to assess the totality of the yellow card data, which are routinely examined when risk assessment is undertaken, along with other data sources.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.3/6">The MHRA will respond directly to the authors of the article and a copy of that reply will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".372W.2/2">Advice delivered through the telephone service is subject to the same CLS specialist quality mark assurance that applies to CLS-funded face to face advice. There is also an additional set of quality requirements that apply solely to telephone advice, and telephone contractors are audited against these criteria. A sample of the advice given by the telephone contractors will also be subject to peer review by recognised experts, to ensure that it is of high standard.</p>
	<p pid=".372W.2/3">The statistics generated relating to CLS Direct will give the Legal Service (LSC) an excellent new method of surveying where and how advice is accessed, the areas where demand for advice is greatest, and how this compares with supply. Telephone advice offers an easy means of accessing advice for people with disabilities, people in remote areas and people who have caring responsibilities. The LSC uses client feedback surveys to monitor whether telephone advice is effectively reaching these groups.</p>
	<p pid=".372W.2/4">The number of calls received and cases opened will be monitored to establish trends. The telephone service can be easily scaled up to keep pace with demand. Advice providers within CLS Direct are contracted to deliver an agreed volume of advice hours per year, and one of the criteria the LSC used to select contractors was their ability to expand their number of advice hours if required.</p>

	<p pid=".372W.8/1">From September 2003 the Legal Services Commission (LSC) has been bringing all new eligible cases under contract. Research prior to the introduction of VHCCC contracts suggested that savings of about 30 per cent. might be achieved. The LSC is conducting a survey of non-contracted VHCCC cases in order to establish a benchmark to compare with contracted VHCCC cases. However VHCCC cases are by their nature, long and complex and their attributes vary greatly from case to case. It will therefore be some time before a sufficient number of contracted cases have been completed before sensible comparisons can be made between contract and non-contract cases and before a reliable estimate of the savings can be made. However, the LSC calculates that during 2003&ndash;04 savings of around &pound;26.5 million were achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".372W.8/2">Prior to 2003&ndash;04 a pilot scheme was operated. While relatively few contracts were managed during this period the LSC estimates that savings of around &pound;7 million were realised.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.2/16">The Legal Services Commission cannot separate the cost of immigration and nationality cases from asylum cases, but the vast majority are thought to relate to asylum. The substantial increase in legal aid expenditure has been due, in large part, to the introduction of legal aid for representation at appeal, efforts to reduce the backlog of asylum cases and increases in asylum seeker numbers. Cash figures are expected to remain high in 2004&ndash;05 as work continues to clear immigration and asylum backlogs.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.2/17">We expect that costs will fall in subsequent years as a result of the current lower intake of asylum seekers and measures to control spending.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.2/1">The Legal Services Commission already attaches interest to the majority of debts attributable to it. Cases relating to the statutory charge have since 1988 attached interest. The rate of interest is linked to the Bank of England base rate and currently stands at 5 per cent. simple interest. &pound;50 million of the gross debt due to the Commission relates to interest.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.2/2">Of other debts due to the Commission interest is not sought as they are normally payable immediately. Where it is necessary to pursue them through the issue of court proceedings interest at the standard debt rate (8 per cent.) is claimed.</p>

	<p pid=".378W.2/1">The Government are anxious to ensure that solicitors' time is spent productively at court and at police stations. Last year we consulted on proposals to focus both the court duty solicitor scheme and the police station duty solicitor scheme on those cases where an individual's liberty was at real risk or where an individual's interests could be properly advanced. These changes were introduced in regulations and in the General Criminal Contract on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-17">17 May 2004</phrase>. The Fundamental Legal Aid Review (FLAR) is looking at the efficiencies of the processes for defence solicitors in police stations, as is the Effective Trial Management Programme (ETMP) for the courts.</p>
