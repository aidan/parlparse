	<p pid="b.4W.3/1">The Government are supporting a cross party amendment to the Localism Bill, proposed by the Core Cities Group, which will support greater devolution to help drive economic prosperity and growth across England. This amendment will provide an enabling power to allow for the transfer of public functions and delegation of ministerial functions to cities and other localities to increase their economic competitiveness. Any transfer of powers to particular places would be for the decision of the relevant Secretary of State and subject to discussion and agreement with individual cities and affirmative resolutions in both houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-15">15 November 2010</phrase>, the Chief Secretary said in response to PQ 16752, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-15.615"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 615-16W</phrase>, that the Government had announced a more specific and innovative approach to efficiency and reform across the public sector, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/2">a reduction in administration budgets of 34% across the whole of Whitehall and its arm's length bodies saving &#163;5.9 billion a year by 2014-15;</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/3">radically reducing the number of arm's length bodies across Government; and</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/4">the Efficiency and Reform Group's tough new efficiency regime which will drive savings in procurement, major projects and estate management;</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/5">and that, in result, Departments would no longer be required to report against the previous Government's failed efficiency target.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/6">In August 2011, the Minister for the Cabinet Office announced that the Efficiency and Reform Group's new measures had saved &#163;3.75 billion over 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/7">This impact was assessed using methodologies outlined in the following table. The assessment has been independently verified by Government auditors who found the benefits assertions to be fairly calculated and presented.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/8">These savings are borne out in department accounts. Note 9 &#8216;other administrative Costs&#8217; of the Department's Report and Accounts 2010-11 (page 129) reports that non-pay gross admin costs for the Department reduced from &#163;104 million in 2009-10 to &#163;123 million in 2010-11, once early retirement costs of &#163;64 million were taken into account. Figures in this report are prepared in accordance with HM Treasury's Financial Reporting Manual for central Government Departments and associated Treasury resource accounting and budgeting guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/9">In particular the Department has made significant operational savings, by reducing demand and renegotiating commercial terms, &#163;1.8 million in IT contracts and &#163;2.4 million in temporary staffing and interim labour costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/10">The Department has achieved estimated net property running costs reductions of &#163;9.8 million per annum since the start of the spending review period which includes &#163;1.9 million in Estates requirements in the last financial year. In addition the Department has reduced its Research expenditure by 36% (&#163;10.8 million) in 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.14W.9/1">The current policy of the Secretary of State is set out in paragraph 71 of Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 3, which advises local planning authorities to maintain an up-to-date five-year housing land supply. Where they have not achieved this objective, planning decision-makers are asked to consider planning applications for housing favourably, having regard to general policy safeguards set out in the PPS.

The draft framework may change before it is approved. However, if it was approved as currently drafted, local planning authorities will be set an objective to increase the supply of housing. The draft policy suggests that authorities will identify and maintain a rolling supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide five years worth of housing against their housing requirements. Their five-year land supply should include:</p>
	<p pid="b.14W.9/3">&#8220;an additional allowance of at least 20 per cent to ensure choice and competition in the market for land.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.14W.9/4">If this advice were not to be taken and a planning appeal were to follow, Planning Inspectors would consider the presumption in favour of sustainable development that is also set out in the National Planning Policy Framework. This would indicate that planning permission should be granted at appeal to meet the housing objectives of the framework, unless the adverse impacts of allowing the development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh its benefits, when assessed against the policies in the framework taken as a whole.</p>

One element of this strategy is to establish the public sector as a payment exemplar. Across the public sector the standard payment target is 30 days and we have further extended this target to tier one suppliers to ensure the benefits of prompt payment are felt through the supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="b.32W.8/1">The Government recognise that the carbon price floor will marginally increase consumer bills. The estimated impacts of a carbon price floor on fuel poverty were set out in an impact assessment that was published alongside the Carbon Price Floor Consultation in December 2010. These estimates suggested that a price floor targeting &#163;30/tCO2 would result in an additional 50,000-90,000 fuel poor households in England in 2020.</p>

	<p pid="b.33W.2/1">Recent research suggests that the rate of methane release from the high Northern latitudes that include the Arctic, is around 10 million to 40 million tonnes per year, approximately 2% to 8% of total global methane emissions and 5% to 20% of natural methane emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.2/2">As temperatures increase, the main factors contributing to this Arctic release rate are emissions from wetlands (which are the predominant source), melting permafrost, and methane hydrates beneath the Arctic ocean. Emissions from methane hydrates are, however, considered to be relatively very small and are most uncertain.</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.2/3">Research indicates that the increase in atmospheric methane concentrations since pre-industrial times, and their related temperature effects, have been caused by anthropogenic emissions and not by changes in natural emissions from high Northern latitudes or other sources. Future methane releases from Arctic permafrost and wetlands are highly uncertain but are currently projected to increase as temperatures rise, thereby amplifying global warming and its potential impacts on ecosystems and societies.</p>

It supports the Supply Chain Development Programme which helps Welsh installers to achieve MCS certification and aims to equips them with the tools, techniques and business connections to help them to compete for microgeneration contracts. It has provided interest-free loans for certification fees, subsidized QMS training, signposting to WG training and development and one to one guidance. The programme has also addressed the need to unlock the supply chain of a Welsh labour force working on Welsh homes. A number of events and seminars have been held across Wales to promote the scheme.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" name="Christopher Huhne">the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase>, asked the UK Chief Nuclear Inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, to provide a report to the Government on the implications of the unprecedented events in Japan and the lessons to be learned for the UK nuclear industry. This interim report was presented on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-18">18 May 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.2/2">Dr Weightman's interim report gives a clear indication that the UK's current safety regime remains robust and therefore, so far as is reasonably practicable, the levels of protection currently in place are appropriate compared to the level of risk to ensure safety at the UK's nuclear power plants.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.2/3">Dr Weightman is currently finalising his report and the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) are working with industry on the UK input into the EU Stress Tests. Their progress reports, submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-15">15 September</phrase>, showed that thus far operators and the ONR have failed to find any fundamental weaknesses at the UK's nuclear power plants.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.2/4">The UK are currently actively participating in the efforts of the IAEA to strengthen the international nuclear safety framework with a view to raising standards of safety and thereby reducing the risk of a nuclear accident. However, in the event of a nuclear related accident in another country, the UK has in place measures to respond to such an accident and would invoke its overseas nuclear accident plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.38W.8/1">Reducing or increasing the output of generators is a normal part of National Grid's role to balance supply and demand, and it will pick the most cost effective way to deliver what is required. However, the recent requirement to use wind farms in order to manage the system has raised questions as to whether the current market wide balancing arrangements for wind are appropriate. National Grid has launched a consultation to seek views on the issues involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.38W.8/2">In the short-term, the Secretary of State is proposing to introduce a licence condition to tackle problems that can occur in the balancing market when normal competition is distorted by bottlenecks on the transmission system. Ofgem and DECC have been working closely together to develop this licence condition, which the Secretary of State is able to introduce under powers conferred by the Energy Act 2010. DECC will be consulting on the licence condition shortly, with a view to introducing it in 2012.</p>

NATO is no different and the UK is playing a leading role in ensuring our Alliance remains fit for purpose. In June, Defence Ministers agreed to a more streamlined and more effective Command Structure including the UK keeping the Maritime Component Command at Northwood. We are working to put the new Command structure in place as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.44W.3/3">WEU Mission (Yugoslavia), which has been approved for wear.</p>
	<p pid="b.44W.3/4">European Community Monitoring Mission (Yugoslavia), which has been approved for wear.</p>
	<p pid="b.44W.3/5">European Security Forces: Congo, which has not been approved for wear.</p>
	<p pid="b.44W.3/6">European Security and Defence Policy Service Medal for Operation ALTHEA (Bosnia and Herzegovina), which has been approved for wear (with the exception of the Planning and Support version).</p>
	<p pid="b.44W.3/7">Each new offer of such a medal requires a proposal by the Ministry of Defence, the support of the Committee on the Grant of Honours Decorations and Medals (known as the HD Committee), and the approval of the Sovereign. In general, proposals should demonstrate that those on the operation have endured a period of risk and rigour. However, proposals that would result in &#8216;double medalling&#8217;, which is the simultaneous qualification for a United Kingdom medal and an international organisation&#8217;s medal, are not supported.</p>

	<p pid="b.48W.0/1">The Defence travel contract, which includes providing airline tickets for use by Ministry of Defence (MOD) personnel, was awarded to the Hogg Robinson Group in 2007. The company has negotiated rates with 28 airlines covering 432 domestic and international routes.</p>
	<p pid="b.48W.0/2">No other arrangements are in place for the provision of MOD air travel and personnel are mandated to use the contract which allows discounted air fares to be provided with lower administration costs than if individuals were to book direct through commercial travel companies. Where negotiated rates have been agreed, the contract also offers other benefits including the provision of more favourable terms and conditions of travel, increased baggage allowances and flight cancellations without incurring additional costs. This has resulted in considerable savings being achieved across the MOD. In financial year 2010-11 around &#163;60 million was saved on air travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.7/1">Currently, asylum seekers can apply for permission to work if they have not received an initial decision on their claim within 12 months. This is in line with the requirements of the European Union (EU) directive on the reception of asylum seekers. The Government have no plans to reduce this time period to six months, nor to extend access to the labour market to all asylum seekers who have been refused asylum, but who face a temporary barrier to their return. Extending the permission to work policy in this way risks abuse of the asylum system by economic migrants and detracts from the aim of encouraging those whose claim has failed to return home voluntarily. Our focus, through the Asylum Improvement Project, is on implementing new ways to speed up the processing of applications, while also improving the quality of decision making. Overall, performance has improved in the last year. In particular, we are making decisions more quickly&#8212;consistently deciding over 50% of asylum cases within 30 days&#8212;without sacrificing quality.</p>

	<p pid="b.66W.0/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) offer support to families and friends of British nationals who die overseas and will assign a caseworker with knowledge of the country concerned. Where a death has occurred in suspicious circumstances, which may lead to legal proceedings overseas, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will keep the family informed of developments and offers guidance. Since November 2010 the FCO has been working in partnership with the charity Victim Support (which runs the national homicide service) to ensure that families living in England and Wales get the practical support that they need to deal with the added trauma, complications and costs when a British national is murdered abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.0/2">When a crime, for example a homicide, is committed in another country, the investigation would be the responsibility of the police and judicial authorities in the country where the offence occurred, who will investigate according to their own laws, standards and practises. In most cases, British police have no jurisdiction outside the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.0/3">It is possible that a local UK police force will appoint a Family Liaison Officer (FLO) to liaise with the family. However a FLO will not be deployed in all cases where a British national has died abroad and will only generally be deployed if there is an investigative role for them to perform, for example if the foreign police service is specifically asking for inquiries to be made in the UK. Guidance on the role and criteria for deployment of a FLO is issued to police forces by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) within appendix 3 of the Family Liaison Officer Guidance 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.68W.9/1">Data on knife and sharp instrument offences have been collected by the Home Office via a special additional data collection since April 2007. Data are therefore available only for the last four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.9/2">Data are not comparable across this time period. In 2007-08, the offences covered by the special knife crime collection were: attempted murder, GBH and robbery. These data are presented in table A. In 2008-09, the collection was expanded to include threats to kill, ABH, rape and sexual assaults, therefore data for 2007-08 are not comparable with those for later years. Data from 2008-09 onwards is presented in table B.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.9/3">Furthermore, data for West Midlands police, are not comparable for 2010-11 against earlier years due to changes in their recording of these offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.9/4">Prior to 2010-11, for technical reasons, the West Midlands data return included offences using unbroken bottles and glass, which are outside the scope of the collection. From 2010-11, West Midlands have excluded these offences and data are therefore not comparable with earlier years.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.9/5">Figures for homicides involving the use of a knife or sharp instrument are presented separately as they are taken from the Homicide Index. These are also available only at police force level. The 2005-06 to 2009-10 homicide data for West Midlands and Warwickshire are shown in Table C. The 2010-11 data will be published in January 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.9/6">Data on firearm offences are also only available at police force level. The 2005-06 to 2009-10 firearms data for West Midlands and Warwickshire are shown in Table D. The 2010-11 data for police recorded firearm offences will be published in January 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.9/7">Data on robbery offences are available at local authority level as well as police force level. It is not possible to identify the location of the offence from data held centrally, so data provided are for all robbery offences, not only those committed in the street. Data covering the period from 2006-07 to 2010-11 for Coventry local authority area are presented in table E and West Midlands police force area are shown in table F.</p>

	<p pid="b.75W.5/1">I have assumed that the question relates to persons being held by the UK Border Agency pending removal or deportation. The data provided do not therefore include persons in the community who will be removed from the country in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.75W.5/2">The UK Border Agency keeps records of the number of incidents across its detention estate of self-harm where a person required some form of medical attention. Such attention may involve an examination by a nurse, or in more serious cases, treatment at a hospital. The data do not break down to show the type of treatment required, nor whether they were as a result of suicide attempts, given it is not always clear whether a person intended to take the more serious step of taking their own life.</p>
	<p pid="b.75W.5/3">There were 119 incidents of self-harm across the Agency&#8217;s immigration removal centres which required medical attention between <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-31">31 August 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.75W.5/4">The figure above does not include foreign national prisoners who will be deported at the end of their sentence or detainees being held in prisons or those held in the Agency&#8217;s short-term holding facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.75W.5/5">Children are only now held in very limited circumstances and for short periods, primarily when they have been intercepted at the border with their family or where they are being returned under the ensured return route. There have been no recorded instances in the same period where children being held attempted to harm themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.75W.5/6">The safety of those in the care of the UK Border Agency is taken very seriously, and there are well established systems and policies entitled Assessment Care in Detention and Teamwork (ACDT) to identify and support those who are at risk of suicide or self harm.</p>

	<p pid="b.77W.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated September 2011</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.8/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning what assessment has been made of the effectiveness of the International Passenger Survey to measure the number of student migrants in the UK (71190).</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.8/4">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) uses the International Passenger Survey (IPS) to estimate flows of international migrants into and out of the United Kingdom. The IPS is a continuous voluntary sample survey conducted by ONS. It covers the principal air, sea and Channel Tunnel routes between the UK and countries outside the British Isles.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.8/5">The IPS provides a good measure of the numbers of students arriving into the UK for formal study. Our latest provisional figures for the year ending Dec 2010 show that 228,000 migrants arrived to the UK for formal study. This estimate has a standard error percentage of 3 per cent, which is considered to be a reliable estimate.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.8/6">The current IPS questionnaire is not adequate for accurately identifying emigrants who originally migrated to the UK for study. The IPS records a passenger's main reason for migrating. Therefore a passenger's main reason for emigrating from the UK may bear no resemblance to the person's main activity while they have been resident in the UK. For example, a person who has been studying in the UK may be emigrating to work abroad. This means that it is currently not possible to derive a net student migration figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.8/7">ONS have addressed these limitations by developing a number of changes to the IPS, which will be effective from January 2012. These changes will identify emigrants who have been studying in the UK and thus will enable a net student migration figure to be estimated from the first quarter of 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.79W.8/1">The UK Border Agency has a vital role to play in disrupting trafficking attempts abroad and detecting trafficking both at the border and within the UK. Border staff are trained in child protection issues and to spot human trafficking; multi-agency child safeguarding and investigation teams are in place at the UK&#8217;s major ports; overseas border controls stop criminals and illegal immigrants before they get to the UK; people&#8217;s identities are fixed using biometrics; and alerts and intelligence tools are used to give officers the information they need to intervene. The UK Border Agency also supports the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in pursuing organised criminals involved in trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.79W.8/2">The UK Border Agency is one of the key agencies involved in the national referral mechanism (NRM), the UK&#8217;s framework for identifying and supporting trafficking victims.

	<p pid="b.80W.2/2">While detailed planning continues and the final resource requirements will not be confirmed until early 2012, it is anticipated that a small number of Olympic venue forces, including Dorset, Surrey and the Metropolitan Police Service are likely to require a level of additional support in the form of officers supplied under mutual aid arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.2/3">Requests for mutual aid will be co-ordinated through the Association of Chief Police Officers, Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre (ACPO PNICC). This is the standard mechanism through which the police service manages all such movements of officers to support major events. It is expected that all non-venue forces across the UK, including Humberside police, will be asked to supply resources to the national operation and PNICC will ensure that resource requests are proportionate to the relative size and capacity of the providing force.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.2/4">The Home Office will reimburse donor forces in accordance with the policy prevailing at the time, which will allow them to back fill for officers supplied to support, thereby mitigating any potential impact on local service delivery. I understand that the four forces in the Yorkshire and Humber region are looking at the feasibility of responding to these mutual aid requests in a collaborative manner, though this is a matter for the chief officers and police authorities concerned.</p>

However, length in service is grouped in a series of size-bands, some of which span five years (e.g. 10 to 15 years). Therefore, any calculation of current average length in service from these data would be approximate. Furthermore, these data are not collected by pay increment within each rank.</p>

	<p pid="b.106W.11/1">In the spending review last autumn the Government stated that they will protect the statutory entitlement for concessionary bus travel, ensuring that older people can maintain greater freedom and independence.</p>
	<p pid="b.106W.11/2">Not all England National Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS) passes expire in 2013. Legislation requires that the maximum life of an ENCTS pass is five years from the date of issue, but there is no recommended minimum life. Travel concession authorities (TCAs) are free therefore to set the exact expiry date provided it is no more than five years. Consequently, many passes have an expiry date of less than five years and will be up for renewal before 2013. The Department has always recommended that TCAs consider staggering the expiry dates on passes so that they do not all need to be replaced at the same time. This could be done, for example, by setting expiry dates at monthly intervals by alphabetic distribution of surname, or by date of birth.</p>
	<p pid="b.106W.11/3">The Department will not be providing additional funding for the cost to local authorities of renewing ENCTS passes. Local authorities in England receive funding for the National Concessionary Travel Scheme through Formula Grant funding administered by DCLG. It is expected that some of this funding will be spent on administering the scheme, with the majority being spent on reimbursement to bus operators for carrying ENCTS passholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.106W.11/4">The Department has not made an assessment of the cost to local authorities of renewing ENCTS passes, and costs will depend on the efficiency of each TCA's individual renewals process.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated September 2011</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.2/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what the unemployment rate is for (a) professional managers and senior officials, (b) skilled workers and (c) unskilled workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.2/4">For the period April-June 2011 the UK unemployment rate for people previously employed as a corporate manager, director or senior official was an estimated 3 per cent. The unemployment rate for people previously employed in skilled and unskilled occupations was an estimated 5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. In each case, the unemployment rate has been based on a denominator comprising the sum of all those currently employed in the occupational group and all those unemployed who reported that their previous job was in that group.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.2/5">Estimates for unemployment are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) with previous occupation based on the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). The structure of the SOC allows the measurement of 'skill levels' for occupations that are similar in terms of qualification, training, skill and experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.2/6">In accordance with the International Labour Organization (ILO) convention, people are classed as unemployed if they are: without a job, and have actively sought work in the last four weeks; or, out of work, have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks.</p>

He set up the independent Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) last year, and has responded to their first review by announcing the abolition of 43 tax reliefs, and consulting on further abolitions. He has committed to improving HMRC's administration of IR35, and will examine reforms to integrate the operation of income tax and NICs. Further OTS reviews, to report before the 2012 Budget, are looking at pensioner taxation, approved employee share schemes and small .business tax issues, including disincorporation relief for small companies and a simpler income tax system for the smallest businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.142W.3/1">Regulation of abattoirs (in England) is shared between DEFRA, which has policy responsibility for animal health and welfare and the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which has policy responsibility for food safety. The FSA also delivers official controls against animal health, including in relation to animal by-products (ABPs), and welfare on behalf of DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.3/2">The Government are committed to supporting and developing British farming and encouraging sustainable food production. This involves providing help to enhance the competitiveness and resilience of the whole food chain, including farms and fish industry, to help ensure a secure, environmentally sustainable and healthy supply of food with improved standards of animal welfare. These principles underpin departmental policy on the regulation of abattoirs.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.3/3">The welfare of animals in abattoirs is currently protected by directive 93/119 which has been implemented by The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, as amended. This makes individual food business operators responsible for the welfare of the animals in the abattoirs they operate. Regulation 1099/2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing will replace directive 93/119/EC from <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-01">1 January 2013</phrase>. The Regulation will be directly applicable in every member state. However Regulation 1099/2009 also allows member states to introduce stricter national rules to maintain welfare protection above the minimum standards provided for in the Regulation, which was in force before the Regulation was made in September 2009. Stricter national rules can also be used to introduce new protection in relation to killing animals outside a slaughterhouse, religious slaughter and farmed game. We are currently considering how Regulation 1099/2009 will be implemented and will consult on draft regulations before they are introduced. Our approach to implementation will be guided by the principles set out above and the Government&#8217;s commitment to reduce regulatory burdens where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.3/4">Regulation of ABPs arising in abattoirs is covered by the EU animal by-products Regulation 1069/2009 and enforced by the FSA, which is responsible for ensuring that operators keep ABPs separate from material fit for human consumption and that ABPs are dispatched from the abattoir for safe use or disposal.</p>

	<p pid="b.143W.9/14">Last year the Department for International Development (DFID) provided &#163;132 million in aid for the DRC. The 2011-12 budget is &#163;146 million. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is taken very seriously to ensure results, value for money and well managed risks. As data is limited and national systems weak in the DRC, DFID is making a significant investment to create bespoke M&amp;E systems across its DRC portfolio. In addition to routine monitoring by programme partners and DFID staff, plans are in place for robust independent evaluations for many of our programmes to verify the results of our interventions. To boost internal capacity in this area, DFID is recruiting an evaluation adviser for its DRC office.</p>

	<p pid="b.144W.2/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID's) programme in Afghanistan is focusing on tackling poverty and helping Afghanistan become a stable and effective state by promoting more inclusive politics, supporting the establishment of effective local government institutions and helping communities resolve their disputes peacefully. DFID is also helping to make the country a better place for business by ensuring that small and medium sized enterprises have what they need to grow and compete. In addition we are working to support the Afghan Government to deliver basic services, such as healthcare and education, for their people. By the end of 2015, DFID support will create 200,000 jobs, provide technical and vocational education and training for 45,000 young people, help more than 100,000 children enrol in school (40% of them girls), and build or upgrade more than 47 km of road across central Helmand.</p>

No precise figures are available. We continue to condemn the practice of farm invasions, which contravenes the South African Development Community ruling of November 2008 and the terms of the Global Political Agreement and demonstrates a lack of respect for the rule of law. We have and will continue to raise this issue with all sides of the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="b.150W.11/1">The Government remain very concerned about the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). It is now a full year since general elections were held and there is still not a new state-level Government in place. Key reforms remain stalled, holding BiH back from further progress towards EU and NATO accession. HMG remains active, with its international partners, in effort to unlock reform progress and ensure compliance with the Dayton Peace Agreement. In this context, HMG welcomed the arrival in September of the new EU Special Representative, Peter Sorensen, marking the launch of a strengthened EU presence in BiH aimed at accelerating the pace and quality of EU-related reform and supporting BiH in its effort to move towards EU membership.</p>

	<p pid="b.156W.8/6">Failure to pay child maintenance is not a criminal offence, so parents can not be prosecuted. However, where a non-resident parent fails to pay maintenance, there are a number of enforcement actions available. Money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's earnings if the non-resident parent is employed, money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's bank or building society account, or action can be taken to recover money through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.8/7">The most serious forms of enforcement are commitment to prison or disqualification from driving. The decision whether to impose these and the length of any order made, is at the discretion of a Magistrates' Court (or Sheriff in Scotland) where they are satisfied that a non-resident parent has &#8220;wilfully refused or culpably neglected&#8221; to pay child maintenance&#8212;but these are not criminal sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="b.159W.5/1">In the Ministry of Justice, the Department's Director of Analysis also carries out the Department's chief scientific adviser role. Therefore there is no separate resource budget allocation for the office of chief scientific adviser in the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice was created in 2007. Our first Director of Analysis was appointed in August 2008 and remains in post. Details of her salary have been made available under the data transparency agenda on the MOJ website. It is between &#163;85,000 and &#163;89,999 per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.5/3">The Director of Analysis draws on staff within the Analytical Services Directorate and beyond as required to fulfil her remit. We do not hold information on the proportion of time spent on the chief scientific adviser&#8217;s duties within the Ministry of Justice. Therefore we have no estimate of the full-time equivalent staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.5/4">The CSA role was established in MOJ in August 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.5/5">We do not have a policy of requiring agencies, non-departmental public bodies or contractors to have a written code of practice or protocol relating to the provision, conduct and quality assurance of scientific evidence and advice. Other arrangements are in place to seek this outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.5/6">Civil service staff in agencies and non-departmental public bodies would be expected to adhere to the Civil Service Code. The code requires them to demonstrate integrity (putting the obligations of public service above personal interests), objectivity (basing advice and decisions on rigorous analysis of the evidence) and impartiality (acting solely according to the merits of the case). We would expect this to lead to independent and robust advice to Ministers and policy makers. Where Government Analysts are in place, the various analytical professions' codes would similarly require the provision of objective, robust and impartial advice delivered to high professional standards. This would often include external peer review of products to ensure their robustness and quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.5/7">In relation to contractors for analytical services, our standard terms and conditions require them to perform the services with reasonable care and diligence. This would include, but not be limited to, applying industry best practice, in accordance with their own established internal procedures and their compliance with any appropriate code of practices on ethical standards.</p>

The MOJ as a Government Department is able to use agreed panel rates with the Treasury Solicitor, rates which are open to all Government Departments. The LSC, as a non-departmental body, cannot use the same framework to procure its advice. However, the LSC does use the Office for Government Commerce procurement framework which represents negotiated hourly rates available to non-departmental bodies when obtaining legal services, without having to revert to negotiations with the private market. Both the Treasury Solicitor panel rates and the rates from the procurement framework are designed to deliver value for money, as both provide for rates lower than private market rates for similar services.

	<p pid="b.165W.5/2">Since this requirement came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1998-11-24">24 November 1998</phrase>, only one Government Bill has, on its first introduction into Parliament, carried a statement under section 19(l)(b): the Communications Bill, which was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November 2002</phrase>. On that occasion, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40212" name="Tessa Jowell">the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell)</phrase> made a statement as the Minister in charge of the Bill that, because of clause 309 of the Bill, she was unable to make a statement of compatibility with the Convention rights. Clause 309, which was ultimately enacted as section 321 of the Communications Act 2003, perpetuated the ban on political advertising and sponsorship in the broadcast media. The contemporary report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the Bill (&#8220;Scrutiny of Bills: Further Progress Report&#8221;, Fourth Report of Session 2002-03, HC Paper 50) discussed further the basis for this statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.165W.5/3">In addition, Ministers have made a statement under section 19(l)(b) in respect of two Government Bills brought from the House of Lords, the provisions in respect of which the statements were made having been introduced by amendments in the Other Place.

Member for Kingston upon Hull East (John Prescott)</phrase>, made a statement under section 19(l)(b); this was in light of the amendment agreed by the House of Lords to prevent the repeal of section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986 (as inserted by section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988), which required local authorities not intentionally to promote homosexuality. Similarly, upon the introduction into this House of the Civil Partnership Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-05">5 July 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the former right hon. Member for Leicester West (Patricia Hewitt)</phrase> made a statement under section 19(l)(b) as result of amendments made by their Lordships that would have permitted family members to register as civil partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.165W.5/4">In both of these cases, the Bill in question bore a statement of compatibility under section 19(l)(a) upon its first introduction into Parliament; and in both cases, the provisions in respect of which the statements under section 19(l)(b) were made no longer formed part of the Bills when they were enacted as the Local Government Act 2000 and the Civil Partnership Act 2004 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.9/1">The Department does not hold the information in the consolidated format you have requested. To provide it would incur disproportionate costs; but we can provide total costs paid to external solicitors and barristers, which can be found in the table.</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.9/5">In circumstances where Counsel is selected off-panel (for example, where leading Counsel is required), nominations are sought from the Attorney-General. Fees in these cases are individually set but the nomination process ensures that higher charging Counsel are unlikely to be retained unless a very cogent business case can be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.9/6">External firms of solicitors are chosen from panels of competitively selected firms on the basis of their ability to provide high quality, value for money legal services. The Government have negotiated fee rates with each of these firms.</p>

	<p pid="b.178W.8/1">I am confident that the London 2012 games will leave behind a significant sporting legacy. We will support elite sport by maintaining public funding for Olympic and Paralympic sport going into the Rio 2016 cycle. We've set out an ambitious programme of bids for major sporting events, with the 2013 Triathlon World Series Final and 2015 Canoe Slalom World Championships secured in Olympic venues, Weymouth and Portland bidding for the World Cup in sailing and the Major Prize of the 2017 World Athletics Championships to be decided in November. Olympic venues and investment in training facilities will support local communities after the games. We are preserving Whole Sport Plans and holding sports to account on meeting challenging participation targets. More than a thousand local sports clubs and facilities will be improved, the nation&#8217;s playing fields protected, and 40,000 new community sports leaders recruited to get more people playing sport through our mass-participation strategy, Places People Play.

	<p pid="b.180W.2/3">To assist with the allocation process, the BOA established a Media Accreditation Committee composed of representatives from a broad spectrum of the written and photographic press respected for their knowledge and experience from Olympic games or understanding of the UK media.</p>

	<p pid="b.180W.2/16">When determining the allocation of accreditations BOA has taken into account, among other things, continuous editorial commitment to Olympic sport throughout the four-year Olympic cycle; history of attending Olympic games; circulation numbers; publication frequency. Throughout this process the BOA's primary purpose has been to ensure that the allocations made are fair given the limited number of accreditations available. The Press Association has been appointed by the IOC as the National Host News Agency for the London 2012 Olympic games (and has also been appointed by the International Paralympic Committee as the National Host News Agency for the 2012 Paralympic games) to service the local and regional press in the UK and they have committed to covering every British athlete at the games. The BOA has also agreed that regional written and photographic press who applied for accreditation should benefit from a small number of passes to be allocated on a pool basis. The distribution of these will be decided by the BOA with guidance from the Newspaper Society, in consultation with regional publishers. The Newspaper Society will be in touch with representatives of regional newspaper groups in the next few months to set up a meeting to discuss practical arrangements over operation of the pool.</p>

Sport England has been working closely with the Asset Transfer Unit to develop a range of support tools and resources aimed at sports clubs, national governing bodies and local authorities. In addition, the Localism Bill includes provisions to give community groups more opportunity to bid to take over assets listed as an Asset of Community Value, if they are made available for sale.</p>

	<p pid="b.188W.2/1">The tourism policy, published in March, includes a range of proposals to help tourism achieve its potential as a central part of Britain's growth strategy. These include initiatives which will help us to capitalise on the Olympic and Paralympic Games and other major events in 2012, increase domestic tourism and improve productivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.2/2">For example, over the next four years VisitBritain will be overseeing the &#8220;You're Invited&#8221; programme, which will make the most of the international interest in the recent royal wedding, as well as next year's Diamond Jubilee celebrations as well as the Olympic and Paralympic Games, showcasing Britain to the world. The programme aims to attract 4 million extra visitors, spending an additional &#163;2 billion in the UK economy, which will support businesses, jobs and growth. The programme is backed by a &#163;100 million marketing fund, funded by the public and private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.2/3">VisitEngland is working closely with local areas and destinations, in line with Government's localism agenda, to grow the value of local tourism economies. They are also currently working on a marketing campaign with destinations across the country, to deliver economic growth from the domestic market, and to support employment and job creation. This will maximise the impact of the unique events of 2012, helping to spread the benefits of the Games outside London and maintain a legacy of domestic tourism growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.2/4">We will also help the industry to improve staff and management skills and prepare for changes in technology and information provision, cut red tape and identify sector specific rules and regulations that are holding the industry back, and improve our visa processes and visitors first experience when they arrive in the UK.</p>

Local authorities have statutory duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to provide sufficient children's centres to meet local need so far as is reasonably practicable, and to ensure there is consultation before opening, closing or making significant changes to services through children's centres.</p>

	<p pid="b.192W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/2">(i) In the Department for Education, the role of chief scientific adviser is carried out by the full-time director of research and analysis. Her basic salary was between &#163;85,000 and &#163;89,999 in 2010-11, and is expected to be between &#163;85,000 and &#163;89,999 in 2011-12. The Department publishes information about the salaries of senior civil servants on its website:</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/3"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/departmentalinformation/transparency/b0065313/disclosure-of-scs-posts-and-salarv-information">http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/departmental information/transparency/b0065313/disclosure-of-scs-posts-and-salarv-information</a></p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/4">The post of chief scientific adviser was established in the Department in 2005. Three people in the Department have held the post of chief scientific adviser in the last five years. The current director of research and analysis, encompassing the chief scientific adviser role, was appointed to the post in August 2008. Prior to that, it was filled on a temporary basis for 11 months, following the departure of the previous chief scientific adviser, and chief economist, in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/5">(ii) Our chief scientific adviser does not have a specific chief scientific adviser's office. There is no specific budget for the chief scientific adviser role. The role is carried out as part of the duties of the director of research and analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/6">(iii) Although there is no specific office supporting the chief scientific adviser, there are approximately 0.15 FTE staff supporting the director of research and analysis in carrying out the chief scientific adviser role.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/7">(iv) The Department is committed to providing scientific advice in accordance with the Government chief scientific adviser's &quot;Guidelines on the use of science and engineering advice in policy making&quot;. All of our analysts are bound by the civil service code and its core values of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. Commitment to these values is required of all members of the home civil service.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/8"><i>(a)</i> The Department's arm&#8217;s length bodies (ALBs), formerly known as non-departmental public bodies, have their own standards and principles which they apply locally to ensure analytical evidence is robust. Where they have produced official statistics, they have been bound by the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) Code of Practice for Official Statistics. A number of activities will be transferring from these ALBs to four new Executive agencies in the Department by April 2012, under the departmental reform programme. The Executive agencies will be bound, as appropriate, by the UKSA Code of Practice for Official Statistics</p>

	<p pid="b.192W.8/12"><i>(b)</i> The Department ensures that all of its research and evaluation contractors have suitable systems and processes to ensure that appropriate standards for the provision, conduct and quality assurance of scientific evidence and advice are met. Potential contractors are required to clearly state in their tenders which codes of practice or protocols they are bound by, these are then considered by the Department's project manager when they are evaluating the tenders. Once a contractor is appointed their work is overseen by a professional Government analyst to ensure quality standards are maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/13">The Department's social researchers, who manage most of the Department's externally commissioned research and evaluation projects, are bound by the Government social research (GSR) code which sets out specific principles to guide the work and behaviour of Government social researchers. The GSR code brings together professional standards and departmental/devolved Administration guidance under seven key principles. Adherence to the code ensures high quality research and analysis for policy and operational delivery research, and analysis that is scientifically rigorous, relevant and valued.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/14">The Department's contractors who are involved in the processing of data that supports statistical publications are bound by principles within the UKSA code where relevant, for example regarding how they handle and store data to ensure security and prevent early release of statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/15">The largest volume of statistical releases and outputs related to my Department's areas of responsibility are produced by or in association with professional statisticians working within the Department itself, who act in accordance with the UKSA code of practice:</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/16"><a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/index.html">http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/index.html</a></p>
	<p pid="b.192W.8/17">Where statistical releases have been assessed by UKSA for compliance with the code their designation as National Statistics compliant with the code has been confirmed.</p>

These arrangements provide continuity for those young people who successfully applied for EMA in 2009/10 and are completing their course of education or training in 2011/12. In these cases, students will get EMA in 2011/12 at the same rate as they did in 2009/10 and 2010/11.</p>

	<p pid="b.197W.0/10">Schools, colleges and other providers have received an allocation of funding for the bursary and are free to determine the scale of discretionary bursaries and the frequency of payments for all awards. The bursary is not necessarily distributed to learners at the start of the academic year but is designed to help at the time of actual need. We have published details of the allocations of funding to schools, colleges and other providers and this can be found at the following website:</p>

The ring fence for this funding was removed in May 2010 and the funding for 2011-12 was included within DFE's Early Intervention Grant. This means that the actual amount spent in 2011-12 could be more or less than the amount allocated. Information about the actual amount spent is not collected. The budget for the next four years has not been decided yet.</p>

	<p pid="b.210W.14/2">The experience of the Academies programme indicates that the support requirements for some promoters, such as new parent groups, could be significant, particularly in the first few months. Some of this function is most appropriately provided by an external organisation, which also distinguishes the roles of promoting and encouraging free school projects from the role of approving them. The Department considered carefully the options for securing the requisite services from an external organisation. Given the need for specialist skills and experience to be in place quickly, it was decided to award a time limited grant to the New Schools Network (NSN).</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.14/3">NSN has championed the development of parent and teacher promoted schools and has been providing advice and support to those interested in establishing new schools, including many of those that have gone on to form the first free schools to open, since 2009. It has also been developing networks among interested groups and individuals. This experience made it ideally placed to fulfil the role and no other organisation had similar experience. The Department has given similar grants in the past, such as to the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, the Youth Sport Trust, Holocaust Educational Trust and the National Literacy Trust.</p>

The change in sources is shown by the dotted line. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 251 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 251 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-00 to 2001-02 and from the RO1 form previously. <sup>(5)</sup> The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources. <i>Notes</i>: 1. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. 2. Base year for real terms prices is 2009-10 financial year.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.216W.5/1">The Department for Education allocates education funding to local authorities via the Dedicated Schools Grant and separate Standards Fund grants. In 2010-11, the Department allocated &#163;4,700 per pupil. This figure relates to pupils aged three to 19. This is slightly higher than the Guaranteed Unit of Funding for 2011-12 (which is &#163;4,602.77) because the 2010-11 allocation included &#163;20 for sixth formers and &#163;80 from the ending of grants which were not mainstreamed this year (such as Targeted Improvement Grant, Music, Foundation Learning and National Challenge). As the Dedicated Schools Grant is a mechanism for distributing funding, a split between primary and secondary schools is not available. But in 2010-11 Devon county council delegated on average &#163;3,251 per pupil to its primary schools and &#163;4,148 to its secondary schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.217W.2/1">The Guaranteed Unit of Funding for Devon in 2011-12 is &#163;4,602 per pupil. The Department for Education allocates this funding to Devon and it is for the authority to delegate this funding to the schools in their area through their local funding formula to best meet the individual needs and pressures of their schools. It also pays for the free entitlement to early education for three and four-year-olds, and for services retained by the local authority, such as support for high needs pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/2">The level of funding of the pupil premium in 2011-12 is &#163;430 per pupil for those pupils known to be eligible for free school meals, &#163;430 per pupil for looked after children and &#163;200 per pupil for service children. According to the figures recorded on the January 2011 School Census, Devon will receive &#163;4.86 million for the pupil premium.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.0/1">The Department is currently consulting on key recommendations of the Review of Education Capital, including on gathering existing condition data and carrying out a full survey of the school estate; and on the implementation of a national contract for maintenance and small capital projects. The consultation will close on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-11">11 October</phrase>. We want to progress swiftly with the collection of condition data and our provisional timetable suggests surveys would start in April 2012 and be completed by late 2013. We will consider the findings of the consultation before making decisions about national contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.0/2">The review proposes that the Department maximises value for money delivered through maintenance and small projects and puts in place a clear national contract to make this happen. Overall, we wish to move to the model the review proposes, but we are aware that there are currently local and regional procurement models in place which claim to be delivering on time and with value for money. Some of these may involve contractual arrangements which cannot immediately be changed. This is why we are consulting on this issue to explore the potential and benefits before implementing any change and we do not want to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.0/3">No information is collected on capital maintenance spend at school level. Local authorities and other local partners make their own decisions on investment maintenance for their buildings based on their own assessment of need. Also, revenue funding can be used to support routine maintenance of buildings.</p>

	<p pid="b.226W.2/1">We are still developing the assessment for personal independence payment and it is too early to say what its impact will be. We do, however, believe that the criteria will take better account of the impact of autistic spectrum disorders than the current criteria for disability living allowance, which do not always reflect the needs of disabled people with mental, intellectual, cognitive and development impairments. For example, the introduction of communication is a significant departure from disability living allowance and one which will ensure we better take into account the effect of impairments that impact on sight, hearing, speech and comprehension.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.2/2">I have met with the National Autistic Society to hear their views on disability living allowance reform firsthand. We hope to continue working closely with them and other disability organisations as we continue to develop the assessment criteria and move towards implementation of personal independence payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.2/3">We published our initial proposals for the assessment criteria in May and sought views from disabled people and their organisations on this draft. As part of this officials met with the National Autistic Society and are currently considering the society's written response to the informal consultation. We also tested the initial draft criteria over the summer to enable us to better understand their likely impact, which included specifically looking at how they affected people with autistic spectrum disorders. Once we have considered both the feedback received and the findings from the testing, we intend to publish a second draft of the assessment criteria later in the autumn.</p>

However, the 5% sample data are generally the preferred source for analysis on disabling condition as information is more complete for disabling condition on the 5% sample (Some recipients of DLA who transferred from the AA system may not have been allocated a specific disabling condition code. This problem can be corrected on the sample data but not on the WPLS data. The number of cases affected is decreasing over time). 4. A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is automatically entitled to DLA. Entitlement is dependent on an assessment of how much help someone needs with personal care and/or mobility because of their disability. These statistics are only collected for administrative purposes. 5. This blood disorders group includes also includes conditions such as anaemia. 6. DLA recipients may be in receipt of both the mobility and care components.

	<p pid="b.226W.8/1">Blackburn House, where Romford Medical Examination Centre (MEC) is situated in the middle of Romford, has no visitor parking on site although there are two parking bays for use by blue badge holders in Eastern road close to the MEC entrance. There are several secure car parks nearby, including the Liberty multi-story car park on Western road, which has designated spaces for disabled drivers.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/2">With regard to disabled access to the MEC, the landlord has recently installed a new entrance door with a release button that will open automatically and there is a security guard available to give assistance to any visitor who requires it.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/3">Within the MEC there is also an accessible toilet, dual height reception counter and a portable induction loop amongst other measures available to assist disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/4">Romford MEC is approved by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as an appropriate location for medical assessments in connection with DWP benefit claims and is a well equipped examination facility.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/5">The MEC is on the second floor of Blackburn House. Atos Healthcare adheres to DWP health and safety advice; when it is identified prior to assessment that a client will be unable to use stairs to safely evacuate in the event of an emergency, they will either be offered a home visit or an appointment at another convenient MEC. This information is identified from the customer's completed employment and support allowance pre-assessment questionnaire on page 3 where claimants are asked if they are able to get up and down stairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/6">It should also be noted that the map/directions provided with the appointment letter do state that the MEC is located on the second floor and that, in the event of an emergency evacuation, it is 36 steps to the ground floor. Claimants who feel that they would have difficulty in negotiating the 36 steps on their own are asked to contact the Appointments Helpdesk for assistance and if appropriate make an alternative appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/7">Depending on where the claimant lives, the Medical Examination Centres at Marylebone, Highgate or Chelmsford could all be within the agreed travelling times.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/8">These MECs all have ground floor facilities. Alternatively, arrangements for a domiciliary visit can be made to carry out the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.8/9">Atos Healthcare are working with DWP to review all non ground floor assessment centres to identify additional ground floor rooms that may become available and, in future the department and ATOS Healthcare have agreed that all new assessment centres will have ground floor assessment rooms.</p>

	<p pid="b.227W.5/1">We are committed to improving choice for and the experience of, families with disabled children. Many parents and carers of disabled children tell us they want to combine paid work with their caring responsibilities, but need access to good quality flexible working. The Government are keen to promote flexible working and have a strong commitment to greater family friendly working practices and have committed, in the coalition agreement, to consult on extending the right to request flexible working to all employees. The public consultation process recently ended and we intend to respond to comments by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.227W.5/2">Jobcentre Plus advisers work closely with parents and carers to help them enter the labour market. Advisers can provide a parent or carer with a 'Better Off Calculation' to illustrate how they can be financially better off in work. This calculation includes those elements of tax credits which provide support with child care, including for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="b.227W.5/3">Advisers also have access to a discretionary fund to provide financial support for child care and replacement care costs, which the parent or carer may need to address, before moving into work. Support for child care costs and replacement care is available to enable parents and carers to take up training and other work preparation support, while funding is also made available to manage the transition to employment once the parent or carer has been offered employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.227W.5/4">In March this year, we published a green paper, 'Support and aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability', which set out what the Government will do to support disabled children and their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.227W.5/5">Local authorities have a statutory duty to secure sufficient child care to meet the needs of parents in their area, to enable them to work, or undertake learning or training leading to work. This duty specifically requires local authorities to secure child care provision for disabled children up to the age of 18, and all local authorities are provided with financial support to meet the duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.227W.5/6">Support for child care costs will be provided in universal credit by an additional element, and we aim to extend support to those working fewer than 16 hours. We are still considering what rates to set.</p>

	<p pid="b.230W.2/2">If the claimant wishes to appeal against the decision to an independent tribunal, they will usually need to do this within one month of the decision they are appealing against, although late appeals may be accepted in some circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.2/3">Under the Welfare Reform Bill proposal to require consideration of revision of a decision before an appeal, the claimant would be required to go through the reconsideration process before being able to make an appeal to the tribunal. This new approach would increase the likelihood that the decision to appeal would be informed by the claimant's view of whether reconsideration had provided them with an adequate &#8216;second opinion&#8217; and a clear justification for the original decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.2/4">The work capability assessment is based on the premise that eligibility for ESA should not be based on the diagnosis of a specific condition, but rather on the way that the condition limits an individual's functional capability. It takes account of fluctuating and variable conditions and people are given every opportunity to explain how their condition affects them as an individual. As part of the WCA, a healthcare professional will provide advice on when they think a claimant's condition may have changed sufficiently that a review of their circumstances is necessary. The Department uses this advice to decide when to reassess claimants.</p>

We are committed to strengthening the links between work experience and apprenticeships. From October this year young people will be able to have their work experience placements extended by up to four weeks where employers make a firm offer of an apprenticeship and that offer is accepted. This will be one of the routes that will help to maximise the number of young people moving off benefits into the 40,000 extra apprenticeships, targeted at unemployed young people, that were announced in the 2011 Budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.236W.5/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.236W.5/2"><i>(a)</i> Standard processes exist within Jobcentre Plus to ensure that changes such as the introduction of new legislation are notified to staff in advance. This includes a four week notice period of any changes to internal guidance and supporting products, to ensure that all staff are fully aware of the scope and affect of the change before the policy or process changes are implemented. A monthly strategic forward look of change, including the impacts on operational capacity to absorb change, is also available to staff.

The primary channel for communicating with this sector is the DWP Adviser and Intermediaries site, which has links to legislation and guidance. Changes are communicated through this site, through direct mailings to national customer organisations and at meetings with representatives of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.236W.5/5"><i>(d)</i> To provide claimants with information about changes to legislation, the Department takes a two-part approach:</p>
	<p pid="b.236W.5/6">For new claimants, information is updated in our printed leaflets, factsheets and forms, and on our Directgov information pages.

Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question.

Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes. 3. Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost and an After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they are. 4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response. 5.

Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes. 4. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are. 5. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response. The sample size for lone parent families in poverty who work is particularly small, so results for this family type should be treated with particular caution. 6. Benefit receipt is based on self-assessment and therefore may be subject to misreporting. The Family Resources Survey is known to undercount receipt of certain benefits. 7. The population groups include subgroups of families and households. Families are defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple and any dependent children; from January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners and cohabitees) are included in the same benefit unit. A household is made up of one of more families. 8. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. 9. Proportions of families and households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point. 10. Numbers of families and households have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 11. &#8220;&#8212;&#8220; indicates less than 0.5%. 12. Poverty has been defined as: Relative low income: households with equivalised households incomes below 60% of contemporary median household income, before or after housing costs. 13. For this analysis, disability is defined as having any long-standing illness, disability or impairment that leads to a substantial difficulty with one or more areas of the individual's life. Everyone classified as disabled under this definition would also be classified as disabled under the Equality Act 2010 (and the Disability Discrimination Act which was in force at the time of the survey). However, some individuals classified as disabled under the Equality Act 2010 would not be captured by this definition, as the Family Resources survey, the source of the households below average income series, does not fully collect this information. 14. No adjustment is made to disposable household income to take into account any additional costs that may be incurred due to an illness or disability, because research shows these vary significantly in level and nature, and there is no general agreement on how to measure these costs. 15. A household or family is defined as workless if no-one within the household or family is classified as working; otherwise the household or family is defined as working, so is wider than just those individuals classified as unemployed. 16. We have excluded households or families that do not contain any working-age adults. The categories specified are not mutually exclusive and the same individuals can be counted in more than one group. <i>Source:</i> Households Below Average Income 1994/95-2009/10, DWP</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.249W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.249W.2/2">The latest employment figures for the quarter May to July 2011 (seasonally adjusted) show a growth over the year of 24,000 in the UK and 51,000 in the East Midlands regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.249W.2/3">This net improvement in employment over the last year has happened despite redundancies occurring both in the East Midlands and the UK. It is unfortunate but there are always redundancies, job losses and separations. Over the last year in the East Midlands, however, these job losses and separations have been more than offset by the numbers being recruited.</p>
	<p pid="b.249W.2/4">So, because there is no direct relationship between redundancies in a specific firm or sector and wider labour market development it is not possible to calculate the cost to the public purse of a specific redundancy. The outcome will depend on the state of the economy, whether the redundant person takes up a benefit and how long they remain on benefit before they leave&#8212;either to go into work or another destination.</p>
	<p pid="b.249W.2/5">Government policy aims to minimise these costs to the public purse and also the problems faced by the redundant workers. It is aiming to establish a system that fosters and delivers growth and also labour market policies that help the people made redundant back into work as soon as possible.</p>

Employers pay statutory sick pay (and in some cases occupational sick pay) but are not required to submit this information to the Government unless they are seeking reimbursement for monies paid under the Percentage Threshold Scheme. Consequently, there is no comprehensive centrally recorded administrative data and there is greater reliance on survey data.</p>
	<p pid="b.250W.5/2">Department for Work and Pensions&#8217; analysis of the &#8220;Employee Health and Well-being at Work Survey&#8221; (DWP Research Report 751) found that in 2009, 4% of employees in Great Britain had absences of more than four weeks. More than four weeks is commonly used to define long-term sickness absence. This equates to around 1 million employees. Breakdowns by nations and regions of England are unavailable due to small sample sizes. Data for other years are also unavailable.</p>

In addition, there are eight Enterprise clubs and 11 Work clubs in the constituency.</p>

Older jobseekers have the same access to a comprehensive menu of individually-tailored help as those aged under 50 years (apart from the specific measures aimed at improving youth employment for jobseekers aged under 25 years). The Work programme will also provide support for those of all ages who are more at risk of long-term unemployment.</p>

Jobcentre Plus will work closely with skills providers at a local level to ensure that the training offered meets the needs of both claimants and employers. Claimants of these benefits can also participate in the sector-based work academies, which offer pre-employment training, work placements and guaranteed interviews in sectors with high volumes of current local vacancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.254W.2/3">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills recently announced greater freedoms for colleges to deliver fully-subsidised training to people on other benefits, as long as the training is linked to helping the individual back into work.

	<p pid="b.255W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> Universal credit will be delivered by DWP drawing on the expertise of HMRC and local authorities. The best of the current capability will be used to deliver the new service, taking the opportunity to modernise and improve it to deliver better efficiency for the taxpayer and better service for claimants. As DWP start to build the organisation to deliver universal credit, and we have yet to settle on the precise detail, it is likely some of those skills will exist within local authorities. We will therefore always look to include local authority staff in our thinking.</p>
	<p pid="b.255W.2/3"><i>(b)</i> The Government's intention is to pay universal credit to the claimant in the majority of cases. The Government believes that this policy will replicate the budgeting skills that people will need when working and will help to break the cycle of welfare dependency that is a feature of the current benefit system. My Department is aware that this will be a big change for housing associations, who are used to receiving housing benefit direct from local authorities under the current scheme. The Government are convinced that, with the right support for tenants and landlords, this policy will not affect housing associations adversely. This support will be tested by a number of projects which the Minister for Welfare Reform, my noble Friend Lord Freud, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-14">14 September 2011</phrase>. The lessons learned from these projects will allow us to refine this support before universal credit goes live in 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.259W.0/1">The Government aims to reduce net migration while ensuring that the UK remains open for business. The changes to the migration system will continue to enable companies to bring in the skilled migrants necessary for growth. A long term approach to addressing the UK's reliance on migrant workers can only be achieved through a significant shift in employer behaviour and working practices. It will require action from employers, the immigration system and through coordinated cross-Government action. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has already begun to take this forward, working closely with relevant Sector Skills Councils and employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.0/2">More widely, we are reforming the skills system so that it delivers the skills needed to return the economy to sustainable growth. As part of our skills strategy, we aim to reduce skill deficiencies at local, regional or sectoral level, so that they are quickly identified and tackled through the demand-led skills system. National Skills Academies, an expanded Apprenticeships programme and greater freedoms and flexibilities for colleges and other learning providers are all contributing to delivering the skills that employers want. The Government have also established the &#163;50 million a year Growth and Innovation Fund to help in tackling the skills shortages that hold companies back. Training to support the unemployed will play its part with more personalised programmes tailored towards local job opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="b.259W.3/1">The Government are taking forward the commitment to end unfair bank charges in the context of a wider strategic approach to strengthen and streamline consumer protections and advocacy, and as part of the joint Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and HM Treasury Consumer Credit and Personal Insolvency Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.3/2">In July 2011, this Department and HM Treasury published a summary of responses to the call for evidence to the review. The evidence shows that there have been significant developments in the market in recent years. As part of the Office of Fair Trading&#8217;s work, banks have committed to introduce measures to improve the transparency of unarranged overdraft charges and many have also revised their charging structures. However, there are still serious concerns about how charges affect consumers, particularly where charges may not be clear or transparent. The Government are working with current account providers to determine the most appropriate course of action to deliver further improvements to consumers. We will, however, regulate to address consumer detriment if suitable alternatives cannot be agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.3/3">The Government will make an announcement on this later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.3/4">In relation to financial transaction charges, the Government supported an amendment to the consumer rights directive to ban payment surcharges that exceed the costs borne by the trader for use of that means of payment. This will address consumer concerns about the high level of fees charged by some businesses when consumers pay by debit or credit card. The directive should be adopted by the EU shortly and will be implemented into UK law.</p>

Those on income based-benefits are eligible for full fee remission. Further education colleges and training organisations also have local discretion to provide fully subsidised courses for people on a wider range of benefits where the training is to help them enter employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.267W.2/2">From August 2011, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment, full Government funding will be provided for ESOL to unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance or in the employment and support allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group. We will also continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.267W.2/3">This Department does not make estimates of the demand for courses.

We do, however, collect information on why a learner has received fee remission for any learning they undertake. From these data we can provide some information on claimants but, this should be used with caution given it does not provide an accurate picture of the full range of benefit entitlements that a person has. Using the fees waived field in the individual learner record we can say for the 2009/10 academic year that 1,700 ESOL enrolments for adult (19+) learners in Coventry local education authority received fee remission as the learner was in receipt of an income-related benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.273W.2/1">This Government fully recognise the importance of UK manufacturing and its key role in rebalancing the economy. Working with business, the Government are taking forward a range of actions to strengthen UK capability in the design, development and manufacture of products and produce. As set out in the Plan for Growth (March 2011) these include actions to improve technology commercialisation, to improve firms access to a skilled workforce, and to improve the image of the sector. In addition, this Department, through UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), is helping to promote UK products and produce to customers abroad, and launched its new strategy in May to help boost economic growth by increasing exports and encouraging foreign companies to invest in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.273W.2/2">Although the Government want to encourage as many jobs and activity in the UK as possible, we operate in a global marketplace, and a large part of the UK's economic success has resulted from our ability to participate in global trade and investment. Favouring domestic suppliers over imports or distorting procurement decisions would damage the long-term prospects of UK companies to compete in world markets and be costly for the UK economy.</p>

			<tr pid="b.286W.3/88"> <td colspan="6" rowspan="1"><sup>(1)</sup> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). This methodology includes a wide range of diseases, injuries and conditions in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Finished admission episodes are identified where an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Admission Statistics record. For each of these episodes, an attributable fraction is applied, based on the diagnostic codes, age group and gender of the patient. Where there is more than one alcohol-related condition among the diagnostic codes, the condition with the largest attributable fraction is used. Where there are two or more codes with the maximum attributable fraction, the code from the earliest diagnostic position is used. This method is employed to avoid double counting of the admission episodes related to alcohol and therefore each episode contributes to one cell in the table. The total number of alcohol-related admissions is arrived at by summing up the number of episodes counted against each alcohol-related condition. <sup>(2)</sup> The data include activity in English NHS hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector. <sup>(3)</sup> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <sup>(4)</sup> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed). <sup>(5)</sup> Data includes only ordinary, day cases and maternity admissions, where the age and sex of the patient was known and where the region of residence was one of the English regions or no fixed abode or unknown. <sup>(6)</sup> International Classification of Diseases. <sup>(7)</sup> Wholly attributable conditions are alcohol-specific by definition and so have an attributable fraction of one. <sup>(8)</sup> The totals shown for T51&#8212;Toxic effect of alcohol, do not include the full breakdown for ICD-10 code T51, only T51.0, T51.1 and T51.9 as these cover types of alcohol most commonly found in alcoholic drinks. <sup>(9)</sup> Partially attributable conditions are those where some but not all cases are a result of alcohol consumption and so have an attributable fraction of less than one <sup>(10)</sup> ICD-10 codes for road traffic accidents: V12-V14 (.3 -.9), V19.4-V19.6, V19.9, V20-V28 (.3 -.9), V29-V79 (.4 -.9), V80.3-V80.5, V81.1, V82.1, V82.9, V83.0-V86 (.0 -.3), V87.0-V87.9, V89.2, V89.3, V89.9. <i>Note:</i> Admission numbers for 2003-03 to 2006-07 have been updated to include records relating to disease codes K73 (chronic hepatitis) and L40 (psoriasis), that were excluded unintentionally from the previous figures. As a result the latest figures are slightly higher than those published in the 2009 report. The minimum effect at a national level is to increase the total number of admissions by 543 admissions (0.07%) in 2005-06, while the maximum effect is an increase of 2,946 (0.37%) in 2006-07. <i>Sources:</i> Figures provided by The Department of Health based on: 1.

	<p pid="b.300W.3/1">The Department uses the Government Procurement Service (formerly Buying Solutions) framework agreements to access services provided by external solicitors. The framework rates for the services provided by the suppliers on these frameworks are on average &#163;183 per hour across the firms, including partners (the rates for whom are higher and are used less regularly). For barristers, the Department is required to use the Attorney-General&#8217;s panel system for Junior Counsel. The latest rates for these panels are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.3/2">Junior Counsel to the Crown&#8212;C Panel: July 2011</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.3/3">Hourly rate: &#163;60 if under five years&#8217; call; &#163;80 if over five years&#8217; call</p>

	<p pid="b.300W.3/9">The Department's efficiency measures govern how professional services are commissioned by officials, including all spend on external legal services. All requirements for external legal advice are assessed by officials in the Department's Procurement, Investment and Commercial Division in conjunction with colleagues in the Government Legal Service before contracts are let with solicitors or barristers.</p>

To date in 2011-12 the Department has spent money on updating information materials for use by health professionals and is intending to run reminder messages on pharmacy bags. These messages aim to encourage people in at-risk groups to be vaccinated against seasonal flu. They will appear on pharmacy bags across 2,225 pharmacies in England and run for four weeks until <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-20">20 November</phrase>. Pharmacy bags will support local campaigns as they target people in at-risk groups in a relevant setting, i.e. when they are collecting their prescription from their pharmacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.308W.5/3">Following last winter, the Department has reviewed the evidence base for mass media campaigns in driving uptake and it is not clear that advertising results in more people being vaccinated. Vaccine uptake rates in 2010 were very similar to previous years. Therefore, the Department is not planning to run a national advertising campaign for seasonal flu vaccination this autumn.</p>

The strategy sets out an ambition to save at least an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15 through earlier diagnosis of cancer and improved access to screening and radiotherapy. To support earlier diagnosis of cancer, the Government have committed over &#163;450 million over the next four years, which includes provision for the funding of awareness activity and measures to support general practitioners to diagnose cancer earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.8/2">The strategy also sets out our commitment to work with a number of rarer cancer-focused charities to assess what more can be done to encourage appropriate referrals to secondary care and to diagnose rarer cancers earlier. Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including a pancreatic cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis and to discuss potential solutions. This will inform our future work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.8/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-16">16 September</phrase>, we announced plans to roll out a regional awareness symptom campaign focusing on lung cancer in October and a national campaign focussing on bowel cancer next year. In addition, there will be local trial campaigns for less common cancers, namely oesophagogastric cancer and the symptom blood in urine (an indicator of kidney and bladder cancers). Work is also under way to test the feasibility of developing a more generic cancer campaign that could apply to all cancer types including pancreatic cancer.</p>

	<p pid="b.311W.6/1">The exposition book 2011-12 sets out the fair shares calculation, which underpins each primary care trust's (PCT) total resource allocation. This calculation takes into account local population characteristics to ensure that each PCT is given a total allocation in line with the relative needs of its population. The total resource allocation for each PCT is calculated using local population characteristics on an overall basis, rather than being calculated as a sum of individual treatment areas. Therefore, the &#163;150 million funding for increased radiotherapy capacity is not listed separately in the exposition book; it is captured as part of the overall resource allocations in the &#8216;Allocations&#8217; tab.</p>
	<p pid="b.311W.6/2">The &#163;150 million is not ring-fenced. Overall baseline allocations are currently set on the basis of a weighted capitation formula, used to determine PCTs target shares of overall national health service resources to enable them to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need. The Secretary of State for Health does not mandate how much individual PCTs are to spend on particular services within these overall allocations. PCTs have local discretion to decide how to use their overall allocation to commission services, including radiotherapy services, to meet the health care needs of their local populations, taking account of local and national priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.313W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.8/2">No recent assessments have been made concerning the prevention of volatile substance abuse. Department for Education research published in February 2011 looked at the costs and benefits of specialist drug and alcohol services for young people. Also, as part of the 2010 Drug Strategy, officials looked at international evidence on preventing substance misuse, consulting widely on the most effective ways of doing so. Government Departments are working closely to ensure commitments made in the Drug Strategy are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.8/3">The non-ringfenced Early Intervention Grant will allow local authorities to prioritise funding according to local need and where it will have the greatest impact.</p>

	<p pid="b.314W.2/1">We continue to monitor the improvements made in stroke services through a variety of mechanisms. Both the National Sentinel Stroke audit and the Stroke Improvement National Audit Programme (SINAP) provide information on various aspects of stroke services. In particular, SINAP provides quarterly information about the care provided to stroke patients in their first three days in hospital that can be used to improve stroke services and so improve outcomes for patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.314W.2/2">Stroke is an integrated measure of performance in the &#8220;Operating Framework for the National Health Service in England for 2011/12&#8221;. Information is collected quarterly on two key markers of good quality stroke care. Local health communities can use this data to help judge where improvements need to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.314W.2/3">In addition, the Stroke Improvement Programme, which is part of NHS Improvement, is working through their networks using evidence-based approaches that are both clinically and cost-effective to go further in improving stroke care across the whole pathway.</p>
