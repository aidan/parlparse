	<p pid="b.661W.3/1">The Government note that the Committee had some concerns with the Government's decision to accept the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Scheme (PEFC) as giving assurance of legal and sustainable timber sources. The Government's response to the Committee focused on the Committee's recommendation that the Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET):</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;should make clear to PEFC that it would be desirable for it clearly and simply to set out the minimum standards it expects all its national members to conform to if it wants continued approval of its scheme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.3/3">The Government are generally satisfied that PEFC, having made changes to its scheme, now has a set of requirements that, if implemented by the national schemes endorsed by PEFC, will adequately assure compliance with Government contract requirements for legal and sustainable timber. However, this assessment was made prior to the process of implementation by national schemes being complete, and therefore a public commitment was made to assess the adoption of these changes by the national schemes endorsed by PEFC within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.3/4">The assessment of changes made is under way but not complete. It has raised concerns with the interpretation some national schemes have made of the PEFC requirement for achieving consensus in the development and revision of standards. In particular, it is not clear that the voting procedures adopted by some of the schemes reviewed would ensure that decisions could be made only in 'the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by any important part of the concerned interests'&mdash;the definition of consensus adopted by PEFC. In the light of further discussions with interested parties the Government have decided that these interim findings merit further scrutiny before resolving the probationary status of PEFC. This will be done as part of a review of the five forest certification schemes first assessed by CPET in 2004. In the meantime, the Government are continuing to accept the PEFC scheme as assuring compliance with Government contract requirements for legal and sustainable timber.</p>

	<p pid="b.664W.3/1">RNAS Yeovilton is the Main Operating Base for the Royal Navy's Lynx and Commando Helicopter Forces and, despite the departure of the Sea Harrier in March of this year, is still the UK's largest (by aircraft number) and busiest military airfield.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.3/2">In 2004 the RAF-led Defence Airfield Review (DAR) identified irreducible spare capacity at RNAS Yeovilton which could be exploited. Following publication of the Review's report in May 2004, a number of Working Groups were formed to take the detailed work forward. The issue of spare capacity at RNAS Yeovilton is being considered by the Programme Belvedere Working Group. Programme Belvedere is responsible for the Joint Helicopter Command basing element of DAR and is currently examining options for the basing of all of the Department's current and future battlefield helicopters. No decisions have yet been made, but the effect of any changes on the local community will be taken into consideration as part of the analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.3/3">The Royal Navy has recently announced the relocation of 727 Naval Air Squadron from Plymouth Roborough Airport to RNAS Yeovilton. As part of its task, the squadron provides Air Experience Flying (AEF) opportunities for younger members of the public. A recent review of AEF concluded that the relocation to RNAS Yeovilton will offer a greater selection of AEF to a much wider audience. The relocation will also result in a small increase in employment opportunities in the local area.</p>

Operational is defined as those Sea King helicopters that are in the forward fleet and non-operational as those in the depth fleet.

	<p pid="b.665W.2/2">Our priority is to provide the most appropriate medical care to injured personnel, and to give them the peace and quiet needed to allow a speedy recovery. We recognise that the emotional support provided by friends and family is of key importance to our injured soldiers, and visit arrangements for their relatives are managed by the welfare officer of the individual's unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.665W.2/3">The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), Birmingham, has allocated six rooms in one wing of the hospital for relatives of service personnel who are listed &quot;Very Seriously Ill&quot; (VSI) or &quot;Seriously Ill&quot; (SI) where relatives can stay whilst visiting a patient. These rooms are provided free. Depending on availability, RCDM also allow families/relatives of non-listed patients to stay in these rooms, but the priority is of course for the relatives of VSI/SI listed patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.665W.2/4">One exception to this is that the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust do not allow children under 16 to stay in this accommodation. This is in line with the practices of the trust concerning child protection issues, since the accommodation contains communal facilities which are deemed inappropriate for children as they are used by other adults staying in the accommodation. RCDM therefore can also provide a list of local B&amp;B accommodation which has been inspected by Defence Medical Welfare Services. If there is a medical recommendation that relatives of a patient should stay with them, the MOD provides travel and subsistence costs for two relatives for up to seven days, although this can be extended if medical advice recommends it. If patients are not listed as VSI or SI, the individual's regiment can also pay for family travel. Such decisions are made at individual regiment level.</p>
	<p pid="b.665W.2/5">The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court also has a facility where family members visiting patients can stay. Costs for this facility are met by DMRC.</p>

The Secretary of State has not therefore discussed the matter with Cabinet colleagues but DCMS officials have liaised with the DTI to keep them informed of developments. Officials were informed by the BBC of the proposal to put the contract out to tender and were notified by the corporation prior to the announcement of the award of the contract.</p>

	<p pid="b.670W.6/2">In Rangoon, the regular representations we receive from a wide range of groups are most frequently concerned with providing support to civil society in Burma. I have also recently received representations from a number of members of the House of Commons arguing for increased support to organisations working with refugees and internally displaced people living near the Thai-Burma border. In response to the increased vulnerability of those internally displaced people, DFID is, with the UN and local community leaders, currently assessing the possibility of providing assistance to these internally displaced people through local community mechanisms. Subsequently, DFID will be carrying out a fundamental review of the level and means of our support to internally displaced people and refugees in Burma.</p>

Representations have recently been made at meetings of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Burma on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase>, 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April</phrase>, and the Burma Forum in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase> on behalf of all of these groups, with the greatest emphasis on internally displaced people living on the Thai-Burma border.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.2/2">In Rangoon, the regular representations we receive from a wide range of groups are most frequently concerned with vulnerable groups living in Burma. I have also received recently representations from a number of honourable members arguing for increased support to organisations working with refugees and internally displaced people living near the Thai-Burma border.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.2/3">In response to the increased vulnerability of those internally displaced people, DFID is, with the UN and local community leaders, currently assessing the possibility of providing assistance to these internally displaced people through local community mechanisms. Subsequently, DFID will be carrying out a fundamental review of the level and means of our support to internally displaced people and refugees in Burma.</p>

	<p pid="b.672W.8/1">Data for the number of cases of Malaria is available from the South African Department of Health's website (<a href="http://www.doh.gov">http://www.doh.gov</a>.za/). The following are the official annual figures for the number of malaria cases, the number of deaths and the case fatality rate in South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.8/2">Approximately 13 per cent. of the South African population are at risk from endemic malaria, another6 per cent. face the risk of epidemic malaria. The provinces of Mpumulanga, Kwa Zulu-Natal and Limpopo suffer the greatest burden of the disease and it is in these provinces where DDT is used, after its reintroduction in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.8/3">The decline in cases in the table starting in 2001 is noticeable, though there are no reports to substantiate the extent to which this effect was due to the re-introduction of DDT. Both the South African Department of Health and the World Health Organisation (WHO) propose that it is a cost-effective prevention strategy for the provinces which provides a prevention service for a population of some 4.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.8/4">DDT use was originally stopped in South Africa because of concerns about its environmental impact. It was reintroduced after careful assessment to demonstrate its effective and safe use. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants states that countries should only use DDT for malaria control under guidance from WHO, which South Africa is doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.8/5">DFID supports the WHO managed Southern Africa Malaria Control Programme, with a grant of&pound;18 million over six years. The project will finish in 2007. WHO has been successful in working with Governments in the region to revise and update their policies concerning all aspects of malaria control, including the safe and effective use of DDT for indoor residual spraying. A significant amount of material can be accessed at <a href="http://www.malaria.org">http://www.malaria.org</a>.zw/</p>

	<p pid="b.674W.5/1">As highlighted in the recent United Nations (UN) report, &quot;Progress for Children: A Report Card on Nutrition&quot;, several key Millennium Development targets may be missed due to nutritional problems of children in developing countries. DFID shares the concerns of the report and is convinced of the critical importance of hunger and malnutrition to achieving, not only the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for hunger (Goal 1), but also to achieving other MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.5/2">Children who are malnourished in their early years never reach their full physical or mental potential, trapping them in poverty. They are less likely to attend school and, when they do, they perform poorly (Goal 2, Education). Women are often disproportionately affected by food shortages as in the family they often eat last and least. Educating girls and ensuring good nutrition empowers women and girls (Goal 3, Gender Equality). Child mortality (Goal 4) is dramatically affected by hunger, and malnutrition is implicated in two thirds of child deaths. A malnourished mother will give birth to a low weight child and is more likely to suffer complications during pregnancy and birth (Goal 5, Maternal Health). Finally, those who are malnourished are more susceptible to disease and are less likely to attend school and be able to afford medicine (Goal 6, Combating Disease).</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.5/3">DFID is working closely with the UN, other development partners and developing country governments to address the affects of malnutrition on the MDGs. DFID continues to respond to humanitarian needs and has committed &pound;40 million to the immediate relief effort in the Horn of Africa and &pound;67 million to the southern Africa crisis. DFID is also putting in place social protection mechanisms or welfare transfers; cash, food or other forms of in-kind transfers. They provide predictable and long-term assistance for the chronically hungry to help people before a crisis develops. This includes a three-year commitment of&pound;70 million to the Productive Safety Nets Programme which got under way in Ethiopia last year and is helping over 7.2 million people fight hunger and malnutrition.</p>

	<p pid="b.675W.2/1">There is no Millennium Development Goal (MDG) which specifically looks at child malnutrition. However, MDG 1 seeks to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger and MDG 4 seeks to reduce child mortality. An indicator associated with MDG 1 is to reduce the proportion of underweight children by half and under MDG 4 there is an indicator to reduce the mortality of under five-year-olds by two thirds.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.2/2">DFID does not make assessments of when individual goals are likely to be reached. However, we draw on data from the United Nations (UN). For both the indicators mentioned, the UN's latest assessment is that across the developing world as a whole, progress is insufficient to meet the targets by 2015&mdash;and in fact both are described as 'lagging far behind'.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.2/3">DFID measures its progress against a set of public service agreement (PSA) targets, which tie in to the MDGs. In our 2005-08 PSA, DFID has adopted targets for selected countries in Africa and Asia. We have targets to reduce under-five mortality rates for girls and boys by 24 per 1,000 live births in Asia and by eight per 1,000 live births in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.2/4">Progress against the PSA targets is assessed twice-yearly in DFID's autumn performance reports and departmental reports. The most recent analysis of progress against the PSA targets was published in DFID's departmental report 2006. The target for Asia was judged off track as the number of live births per 1,000 has reduced only by four. It is too early too tell whether the target for Africa will be reached by 2008, though a reduction of four per 1,000 live births has been achieved to date. The departmental report also gives details of how DFID is seeking to improve off track targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.675W.5/1">More than one quarter of all children under the age of five in developing countries are underweight. Poor nutrition contributes to half of the 11 million child deaths each year. Improving nutrition is essential in tackling poverty and is a critical factor in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At international level the UK Government is one of the biggest donors to UNICEF. DFID has worked closely with UNICEF in the development of its health and nutrition strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.5/2">UNICEF's &quot;Progress for Children: A Report Card on Nutrition&quot;, states that achieving improved nutrition requires action across sectors. DFID's approach to nutrition at country level has always been that it cannot be dealt with in isolation. DFID's support for better nutrition therefore encompasses improved food security, support for agricultural production, fisheries and market access, better water and sanitation, education and strengthening health services for women and children.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.5/3">Particular strategies are implemented in areas of high HIV prevalence, following natural disasters and during conflict. To be successful, programmes to improve nutritional status must be integrated into wider country led poverty reduction strategies.</p>

	<p pid="b.676W.2/1">There is no international agreement on what constitutes state fragility. A common way of estimating fragility is derived from the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA). CPIA scores divide low-income countries into five categories of performance plus an unranked group. The lowest two categories plus the unranked group are used by DFID and other donors as a list of fragile countries. Our understanding of fragility set out in our January 2005 policy paper 'Why we need to work more effectively in fragile states' is therefore similar to that of the &quot;Failed State Index&quot; but not the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.2/2">Our policy on fragile states sets out how we can most effectively tackle the challenges and the underlying causes of weakness. Our approach includes support to early warning systems, analysis to understand the underlying political drivers of fragility and the funding of interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of those states where we work. But aid alone is not enough, and we work with others to help ensure that the international system as a whole works together to reduce fragility and address its causes.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.2/3">In Africa we are working in the Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Sierra Leone&mdash;all states identified by the &quot;Failed States Index&quot;. In each of these we have tailored our support to best tackle the fragility and support poverty reduction and growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.2/4">A copy of the 2005 policy paper is available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.678W.8/1">In 2004-05 fraud across the benefit system was estimated to be less that 1 per cent. of total benefit expenditure at around &pound;900 million; which is less than &pound;1 billion for the first time since systematic measurement of fraud began.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.8/2">We have firm targets to reduce fraud and error in the benefits which are most vulnerable to fraud. The target for reducing fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance for working age people was33 per cent. by March 2004, and 50 per cent. by March 2006. National Statistics published in December 2005 show that by March 2005, we had reduced fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 44 per cent. Looking at fraud alone, this has reduced by more than two thirds compared to the 1998 baseline figure of 10.4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.8/3">We have set a challenging target to reduce levels of housing benefit fraud and error for working age claimants by 25 per cent. by 2006, and to maintain the 25 per cent. reduction by March 2008 against the 2002-03 baseline year. National Statistics published in January 2006 shows that by March 2005, housing benefit fraud has fallen by around 30 per cent. over a two-year period. However, over the same period there has been a 40 per cent. increase in customer error. The net effect of this is that fraud and error for working age claimants is now reported to be 2 per cent. above the baseline.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.8/4">We are also taking steps to reduce customer error. We have an on-going programme of addressing complexity in benefits to make benefit rules easier and simpler for our customers to understand. Our processes and customer handling methods aim to make the claim making process straightforward thus lessening the opportunities for customers to make mistakes or leave out important information.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.8/5">This shows we are getting results in preventing, detecting and deterring fraud. We have achieved this by a variety of methods. In 2004-05, through improved data matching, nearly 300,000 data anomalies were identified. The Targeting Fraud campaign has helped to increase public awareness of the problem of fraud. We now have a more appropriate sanctions regime. In 2004-05, in partnership with local authorities, we imposed nearly 43,000 prosecutions and sanctions&mdash;more than ever before and a fourfold increase since 1998. We have tightened our procedures to root out identity fraud. People are now required to verify their identity before they are allocated a national insurance number or have access to the benefits system. We have maintained the National Benefit Fraud Hotline, and for every &pound;1 spent on its running costs, we identify overpayments of over &pound;9 in defrauded benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.8/6">Despite these good results, we are not complacent and will maintain this hard work. Our efforts in the future will focus on using new technology available to us to stop fraud earlier before it enters the benefit system; increasing our ability to data match to include data from the private sector; exploring the use of new technologies, such as voice risk analysis; the proposed identity card, which will be a useful tool to combat identity and other frauds by verifying identity more effectively; continuing to warn fraudsters and potential fraudsters through the Targeting Benefit Fraud campaign and maintaining the National Benefit Fraud Hotline.</p>

One of the first of those sites is shared with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service Station at Northland Road on the Foyle West Bank and became operational earlier this month.</p>
	<p pid="b.690W.3/2">Initially, one ambulance from Altnagelvin Station will be assigned to Northland Road during daytime hours seven days per week and on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. In addition, when Altnagelvin has more than one ambulance available and the Northland Road location requires cover, the additional vehiclewill be dynamically deployed there. The effectivenessof these arrangements will be reviewed after one month's operation and regularly thereafter. However, preliminary information suggests that ambulance response times have improved in the West of Deny City since the Northland Road site became operational.</p>

	<p pid="b.709W.2/4" class="indent">Water Service recognises that not all of its waste water treatment works are fully compliant with the effluent discharge standards set out in the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.

A major capital investment programme is currently underway across Northern Ireland to address deficiencies in the sewerage infrastructure and to achieve compliance as quickly as possible. Since 2000/01, investment on improvements to waste water treatment works has increased tenfold, from approximately &pound;12 million per year to some &pound;122 million per year in 2005/06. Work has been completed at Londonderry, Omagh and Larne and significant levels of expenditure will continue to be invested as Water Service strives to meet the requirements as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.709W.2/5" class="indent">It is not possible to specify the level of fines that could be imposed by the European Commission on a particular Member State. Such fines take into account the seriousness and duration of the breach of compliance, the ability of the Member State to pay, and the profile of the Member State within the European Union. They may comprise a lump sum and, or, a penalty.</p>

However, a comprehensive customer database is currently being developed in preparation for the proposed introduction of domestic charging from April 2007 and this will identify any domestic properties not connected to the mains water supply.</p>

From the information collected on recorded crime, it is not possible to identify those offences which are alcohol-related. Such offences are not specifically defined by statute and details of the individual circumstances of offences do not feature in the data series.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.9/3">Antisocial behaviour is not measured by incident data but through a measure of people's perceptions of antisocial behaviour in their local area using the data from the British Crime Survey (BCS). The size of the sample in the BCS means that we can not provide reliable data for geographical areas smaller than police force areas. Due to changes in the measure of antisocial behaviour used police force area data that are comparable to the national figures are only available for 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="b.715W.2/1">UK internet service providers (ISPs) continue to lead the world in tackling this issue and the majority are committed to taking all steps available to them to prevent users accessing illegal images of child abuse. This is evidenced, for example, by their commitment to and funding of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and the reduction in the proportion of illegal sites reported to the IWF that are hosted in the UK from 18 per cent. in 1997 to 0.4 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.715W.2/2">Recently, it has become technically feasible for ISPs to block home users' access to websites irrespective of where in the world they are hosted. It is clear from the various meetings that Ministers have had with the ISPs, that the industry has the will to implement solutions to block these websites. Currently, all the 3G mobile network operators block their mobile customers from accessing these sites and the biggest ISPs (who between them provide over 90 per cent. of domestic broadband connections) are either currently blocking or have plans to by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.715W.2/3">We recognise the progress that has been made as a result of the industry's commitment and investment so far. However, 90 per cent. of connections is not enough and we are setting a target that by the end of 2007, all ISPs offering broadband internet connectivity to the UK general public put in place technical measures that prevent their customers accessing websites containing illegal images of child abuse identified by the IWF. For new ISPs or services, we would expect them to put in place measures within nine months of offering the service to the public. If it appears that we are not going to meet our target through co-operation, we will review the options for stopping UK residents accessing websites on the IWF list.</p>

	<p pid="b.720W.9/1">Government Departments and any other agency, including local authorities, with independent prosecuting authority for particular criminal offences are required to notify the police service in the area in which the offence was committed of any intention to prosecute such an offence. The police service enters details of such prosecutions onto the Police National Computer (PNC). Final disposals from courts are entered onto the PNC by the police, regardless of who is the prosecuting authority. The only exceptions to this are Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Royal Military Police who update their own cases onto PNC.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.9/2">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has access to PNC conviction information as part of the disclosure process. In the event of an enhanced disclosure request, the CRB would also cause an inquiry to be made with the local police force who would consider whether or not it is relevant to disclose additional information. This may be non conviction information or intelligence. Guidance is available as to considerations prior to disclosure of such information.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.9/3">The Police National Database, to be delivered by the IMPACT Programme, will facilitate the sharing of operational information between forces by giving authorised officers access to a data repository comprising copies of records held in individual force systems.

One of the requirements of registration is that offenders notify to the police a home address and any other address where more than seven days a year are spent, as well as any changes to this information. Moreover, if an offender claims to be homeless or otherwise of 'no fixed abode' then they must provide the address or location of a place in the UK where they can be regularly found. Failure to supply that information, or supplying false information, is an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="b.726W.2/1">We have reduced the period of time that registered sex offenders are allowed to spend overseas without notifying the police. Now, all registered sex offenders are required to notify the police of any foreign travel of three days duration or more. The police will use that information to decide whether it is necessary to take any action to prevent travel. That action can include applying for foreign travel orders, which we introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The orders can be sought where the police consider that the offender poses a risk of serious sexual harm to children under 16 in an overseas country.</p>
	<p pid="b.726W.2/2">Since 1997, we have been able to prosecute in the British courts those who have offended against children overseas. In brief, if an act is an offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and constitutes an offence in the country where it was committed, then the offender can be convicted and punished for their crimes in this country on their return.</p>

Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is that the registered keeper or person named by the keeper as driver at the time of the alleged offence should be allowed to view photographic evidence on request. If a case went to court, the prosecution would have to furnish the evidence to support the proceedings and relevant material would be disclosed under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996.</p>

Any needs so identified are addressed at local level. The new magistrate is first appraised after sitting for 12 to18 months, and thereafter further training follows as for sitting magistrates.</p>

	<p pid="b.735W.2/1">The Sentencing Guidelines Council promulgates guidelines to enable all criminal courts to approach the sentencing of offenders from a common starting point to promote consistency in sentencing. All courts are required to take the guidelines of the Sentencing Guidelines Council into account when sentencing offenders and have to give reasons for departing from them in any particular case. Discrepancies in sentencing in all criminal courts are therefore minimised through the use of these guidelines. Currently magistrates courts use the Magistrates Courts Sentencing Guidelines issued in 2004 by the Magistrates Association but these are to be replaced by guidelines produced by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. Appealing against sentence to the Crown court is another mechanism for ensuring consistency of sentencing in the magistrates courts. Consistency in sentencing is further promoted through the publication of judgments on appeals to the Court of Appeal from the Crown court.</p>

	<p pid="b.740W.5/1">Following the Chernobyl reactor accident in 1986 preliminary assessments of the radiation doses were carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, now part of the Health Protection Agency (HPA)). In particular, NRPB carried out a study for the European Commission (EUR 11523&mdash;a preliminary assessment of the radiological impact of the Chernobyl reactor accident on the population of the European Community) which was published in 1988. This included estimates of the risks of radiation induced thyroid cancers and total fatal cancers in the population of the European Commission.</p>

Since this time, NRPB has not carried out any further assessments of possible health effects from the Chernobyl accident. However, the NRPB has commented on other papers in the public domain, for example in the response to the &quot;Report of the Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters&quot; which is available on the HPA's website at: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/misc_publications/nrpb_response_to_cerrie_report.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/misc_ publications/nrpb_response_to_cerrie_report.htm</a>.</p>

The effect of the Chernobyl accident on thyroid cancers was also considered in a paper and editorial in volume 37 of the European Journal of Cancer in 1991.</p>

This duty is set out in Schedule 3, Part 7, of The National Health Service (General Dental Services Contracts) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005/3361) and in Schedule 3, Part 7 of The National Health Service (Personal Dental Services Agreements) Regulations 2005 (SI2005/3373).

	<p pid="b.747W.6/2">In relation to Herceptin, the national cancer director has made the Secretary of State aware of the reasons why oncologists specialising in breast cancer have found the preliminary findings of recent trials so encouraging. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.6/3" class="indent">the studies were large trials, involving over 12,000 women, and appeared to have been conducted to a high standard;</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.6/4" class="indent">the findings in relation to disease free survival from all of the studies were remarkably consistent adding to the robustness of the data;</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.6/5" class="indent">both the HERA trial (carried out in Europe) and the combined American trial (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) had reported significant benefits in distant recurrence free survival which could be an early surrogate for improved overall survival in breast cancer trials;</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.6/6" class="indent">in general the absolute benefits of adjuvant therapies are small in the early years but increase over time;</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.6/7" class="indent">the benefits of Herceptin are additional to those seen with standard adjuvant therapies;</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.6/8" class="indent">the cardiac side-effects of Herceptin were well recognised and experience suggested that they were manageable and were outweighed by the benefits of Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.6/9">However, he has also made clear that the data is immature and no-one can therefore be certain of the long term benefits or harms of using Herceptin to treat early breast cancer.</p>

	<p pid="b.751W.6/1">No specific overall assessment has been made of the potential effect on costs of ensuring patient compliance with dosing regimes and effective medicine review processes. However, evidence shows that up to 50 per cent. of prescription medicines for long-term conditions are not being taken as intended, and that adverse reactions to medicines are implicated in 5 to 7 per cent. of hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.6/2">A number of factors would need to be taken into account in making such an assessment. Through improved compliance, patients may benefit more from their treatment, both in terms of length and quality of life. More medicines may be prescribed, but those that are prescribed would be less likely to be wasted. Better management of a patient's condition may reduce the need for more specialist care, including admission to hospital. The provision of effective medication review processes would also have costs in terms of service delivery, for example through payments under the quality and outcomes framework for general medical services or fees to community pharmacists for medicine usage reviews.</p>

	<p pid="b.753W.5/2">For 2005-06, the NHS Bank has developed an incentive scheme whereby the level of overspending carry-forward into 2006-07 is subject to an uplift of 10 per cent. The carry-forward regime and the NHS Bank incentive scheme are operated at strategic health authority (SHA) level. SHAs have discretion over how they apply it to their organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.5/3">The level of carry-forward and the NHS Bank incentive scheme will be factored into the financial planning for 2006-07. The plans for 2006-07 have not yet been agreed by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.757W.6/4" class="indent">overall the balance of risks and benefits of Strattera in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents remains positive;</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/5" class="indent">prescribers should be reminded that Strattera should be initiated only by and under the supervision of a specialist;</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/6" class="indent">warnings on the risk of seizures and electrocardiogram QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm) should be included in the product information; and</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/7" class="indent">the current warnings in the product information about the risk of liver disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviour accurately reflect the available data.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/8">Full guidance on prescribing and the use of Strattera, including possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers (the Summary of Product Characteristics) and patients (Patient Information Leaflet).</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/9">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently published a technology appraisal on methylphenidate, atomoxetine and dexamfetamine for the treatment of ADHD. During the development of this appraisal NICE was fully informed about the European review and the available data on the safety and efficacy of atomoxetine in the treatment of ADHD.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/10">The MAH was also requested to put in place a risk management plan for Strattera, which includes the conduct of new research to better characterise and further investigate its safety profile.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/11">A copy of the report on the risks and benefits of Strattera has been placed in the Library.</p>

The national service framework for renal services notes that because the progression of chronic kidney disease is frequently slow clinicians can often predict the point when the person will need to start renal replacement therapy (RRT), which consists of haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or transplantation.</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.0/1">The national service framework for renal services notes that the total number of people receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been taken as a proxy measure for the prevalence of established renal failure (ERF). However it is generally agreed that in addition there will be people in the general population with ERF which has not been diagnosed and whose need for RRT has not been recognised. People who have been identified as requiring dialysis receive it, on an emergency basis if necessary. Research shows that a third of people present less than a month before requiring RRT.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.0/2">RRT includes transplantation, haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Data on the numbers of people requiring dialysis are not collected or held centrally. Data from the most recent national survey of renal units, commissioned by the Department from the renal registry of the Renal Association, show that in December 2002, 11,789 patients in England were receiving haemodialysis; 4,605 peritoneal dialysis, and 14,104 people had a transplant in the year ending December 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.0/3">For some patients with established renal failure, who are suffering from other, terminal, conditions, haemodialysis may not be an appropriate treatment, as it can add to the distress of these patients without extending life.

	<p pid="b.762W.8/4" class="indent">The latest available Welsh ward electorate counts are for December 2005, the electorate counts for the last available10 years (1996 to 2005) are shown in the attached tables. Table 1 includes wards within the parliamentary constituency of the Vale of Clwyd. Table 2 for the local authority of Denbighshire, includes wards for the whole of the parliamentary constituency of the Vale of Clwyd (as included in Table 1) and also wards which are within part of the parliamentary constituencies of Clwyd South and Clwyd West.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.8/5" class="indent">The ward electorate counts are for parliamentary electors, including attainers. Local government electorate counts are not available at ward level.

	<p pid="b.762W.8/6" class="indent">It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

	<p pid="b.771W.3/1">The Department's guidance, &quot;Child Protection: Preventing Unsuitable People from Working with Children and Young Persons&quot;, provides comprehensive advice on the pre-appointment checks employers should undertake on teachers and other prospective employees. This includes previous employment checks, criminal record bureau (CRB) checks, a List 99 check and, for people who are to be employed as teachers, checks to confirm their teaching status.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.3/2">For individuals working in a number of schools where the local authority is the same, and it is the local authority who is the employer, as long as checks were carried out at the time of the first appointment and there is no gap in employment, further checks should not be necessary. Where employers are different or a gap has occurred each employer must satisfy themselves of an individual's suitability by conducting new checks.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.3/3">Under the new vetting and barring scheme, legislation for which is currently before Parliament in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, a person or organisation who employs a teacher will be required to check that the teacher is subject to monitoring in relation to their work with children by the scheme, and is not barred from working with children. The duty on the employer to check applies regardless of whether the teacher is working in an independent or maintained school and regardless of whether another employer has already made a check. An employer can fulfil their duty to check by obtaining written confirmation from a supply agency that the agency has made the check.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.3/4">For a non-teaching position, working with children or vulnerable adults in a registered setting, a CRB check is also required. As part of this the Protection of Children Act (PoCA) and Protection of Vulnerable Adults (PoVA) lists will be checked and it will record if an individual is barred from this type of work.</p>

	<p pid="b.771W.6/2" class="indent">From the summer of 2006, local authorities will begin a readiness assessment process, involving all relevant local partners. This assessment process will ensure that local areas will be ready to receive the index when it is made available to them. At that time, we will also have the results of the data matching trials which will inform our data sourcing and deployment plans and provide better information about the quality of key data sources and the nature of the task, both locally and nationally, to best ensure that the index data will be of good quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.6/3" class="indent">During the summer and autumn of 2006, there will be a public consultation on draft regulations and statutory guidance to be made under section 12 of the Children Act 2004, which will govern the operation of the index.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.6/4" class="indent">Subject to the will of Parliament, we expect regulations to be in force by early 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.778W.2/1">We estimate that around 42,000<sup>(1,2)</sup> EU students studying at English HEIs will be eligible for loans for fees. Because these loans are new, there are no historic data to help model behaviour, but&mdash;based on the propensity of home students to take out maintenance loans&mdash;we have assumed that 80 per cent. of EU students will take out a fee loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.2/2">The rate of repayment of loans depends on graduates' income, and the cost to Government of making the loans is dominated by a subsidy of the rate of interest. The notion of arrears is different from a commercial loan where repayments are predetermined in value and made to a fixed timetable. Nevertheless, the cost, which for EU loans is estimated to be around &pound;30 million <sup>(2,3)</sup>, includes a factor which reflects late payment.</p>

This plan includes ensuring that equality issues are embedded in key policy areas; sharing good practice with local authorities and recommending that they take specific actions, such as analysing exclusions data and taking remedial action if appropriate; and targeting individual local authorities, where data shows particularly high disproportionality, with support to reduce it.</p>

In addition &pound;49.5 million will be distributed among all local authorities during the financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08 to support the implementation of languages at Key Stage 2. The Department suggested part of this funding could be used to develop links between primary and secondary schools to support programmes.

With our support, the HE sector's Equality Challenge Unit has issued guidance to institutions on dealing with hate crimes and intolerance on campus. The Centre for Excellence in Leadership (CEL) for the FE system has also published the Faith Community Tool Kit. This provides an excellent source of information and advice to help leaders across the learning and skills sector engage effectively with learners and staff from multi-faith communities. It draws out the valuable contribution people's beliefs can bring to their work, workplace or learning.</p>

	<p pid="b.785W.5/2">The number of teachers needed over time will vary from one area to another and schools and local authorities will need to decide how they manage numbers of teacher and support staff posts on the basis of anticipated local needs. In many cases there will be no need for redundancies because natural wastage and reduced numbers of newly-qualified teachers will play an important part in managing staff numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.785W.5/3">To help schools and local authorities who will need to manage the effects of falling rolls we have published a web-based toolkit which offers a range of practical advice and guidance. The toolkit can be found at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/fallingrolls">www.teachernet.gov.uk/fallingrolls</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.785W.5/4">As far as teachers are concerned, the Department's supply modelling has allowed for falling rolls by reducing the number of teacher training places in 2005/06 for both primary and secondary teaching. However, overall judgments on the number of teachers required also depend on other factors such as those leaving and returning to the profession and this will vary from one area to another. Because of these factors and local variations teacher numbers have continued to rise. On a full time equivalent basis, their numbers rose by 3,500 to 435,400 in England in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.790W.2/2">Data supplied to the Department by local education authorities in 2003 showed the following numbers of primary and secondary schools using temporary mobile classrooms:</p>
	<p pid="b.790W.2/3">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to &pound;5.8 billion this year and will rise further to over &pound;6.3 billion by 2007-08. Progress is being made year by year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary classrooms where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>
	<p pid="b.790W.2/4">Modern, high quality mobile or demountable classrooms provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short term need. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.</p>

It is therefore expected that the majority of additional EU nationals who will be eligible to claim maintenance support in 2006/07 would have been eligible even if directive 2004/38 had not come into force. We anticipate the directive will add a small number of people to those who are already eligible to claim maintenance support.</p>

	<p pid="b.806W.2/2">The impact of the positive and negative subsidy system on housing revenue accounts is redistributive. The balance of individual local authority housing revenue accounts is based on assumptions made by central Government, and means that some accounts are in surplus while others are in deficit. These assumptions bear no relationship to local rents or local authority decisions. The subsidy system allows surpluses in some local authorities housing revenue accounts to be used to support other areas where there are deficits. In addition, the Government provide annually a further net contribution to the system of around &pound;200 million, as total deficits are greater than total surpluses.</p>

Where a local authority transfers its housing to an RSL and the receipt it receives is not sufficient to repay the outstanding debt attributable to the housing, the Office will make a one-off payment where the debt is held with the Public Works Loans Board. The one-off payment is made to discharge the Office's continued liability, through the HRA, to pay subsidy on an authority's housing attributable debt that remains after transfer. Since 1997 the Office has repaid &pound;1.787 billion of local authority debt (including early redemption fees) in this way.

	<p pid="b.816W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/2">The following table shows both the total capital receipts the disposal of all housing assets and from right-to-buy sales of local authority dwellings in England in the years from 1997-98 onwards, net of discount and as reported by local authorities. These are capital receipts and not income into the authority's Housing Revenue Account, which is generated by, for instance, rental income.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not estimate future right-to-buy receipts but does estimate future housing capital receipts. Estimates are subject to a number of volatile factors such as the state of the housing market, lending rates, amounts of disposable income and stock condition, and are kept under constant review.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister collects data on total pooled receipts and total amounts set aside by housing authorities. These figures include the amounts arising from right-to-buy sales alongside amounts relating to other housing capital receipts, but the amounts relating to right-to-buy sales are not separately identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/5">The amount of income received by local authorities from the sale of housing assets will not be quite equal to their housing capital receipts less the amount they are obliged to set-aside or pool. Rather, the housing capital receipt, such as a right-to-buy receipt, will first be reduced by, for instance, the administration costs associated with the disposal and any other deduction to the capital receipt the authority may make, such as clawing back the cost of improvement to the asset in previous years. It is the value of this reduced capital receipt that is then used as the basis for the calculation of the set-aside or pooling liability.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/6">As can be seen from the following table, since 1997 the Government have consistently invested more in housing than was received in receipts. In 2004-05 the amount paid to government from all housing receipts (not just right-to-buy) was &pound;1.7 billion. The amount invested in housing was &pound;4.1 billion i.e. almost 2&amp;frac12; times the amount received. The ratio of amount invested to amount received is expected to increase substantially in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/7">Right-to-buy receipts are extremely volatile and difficult to forecast. They are affected by the rest of the housing market and by the nature of the properties available in particular areas. An extrapolation of current trends suggests:</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/8">In 2004-05 ODPM received &pound;53.9 million from debt free local authorities. Treasury received &pound;1.640 billion from with debt local authorities. The remainder was retained by local authorities.</p>
