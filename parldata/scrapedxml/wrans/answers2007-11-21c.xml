At the same time, a limit of &pound;7,000 was placed on the amount of House stationery which could be used by each Member in one year. Detailed rules for both the Communications Allowance and the use of House stationery, approved by the Members Estimate Committee, were published at the time (The Communications Allowance and the use of House stationery, April 2007). The Committee undertook to review the detailed rules in the light of experience. The Committee on Standards and Privileges has recently reported on a number of cases arising from use of the Communications Allowance. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has said that he intends to submit a further report to that Committee on some general issues relating to publications funded from the allowance. The Commission and the Members Estimate Committee will await the Committee's conclusions on this before deciding on a review.</p>

Since the early 1990s, the number of sea anglers had stabilised and possibly increased. Although not quantified, the report suggests that we could see a stable or possibly increasing demand for sea angling in future, with the sector's prospects depending mainly on demand, fish stocks and facilities. These factors are considered in a draft RSA Strategy, which we will shortly consult on.</p>

	<p pid="c.861W.6/1">The UK Government works actively through several international organisations to further the protection offered to dolphins and other cetaceans. These include the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the &quot;OSPAR Convention&quot;) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p>
	<p pid="c.861W.6/2">The UK Government have implemented a comprehensive system of by-catch monitoring under the requirements of the EC Habitats Directive and Council Regulation 812/2004. In 2003, the UK was the first member state to publish a response strategy for the monitoring of small cetaceans by-catch. In December 2004, the UK banned pelagic pair trawling for bass by UK vessels within 12 miles off the south-west coast of England. The Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) regularly reports the results of its research on by-catch monitoring which covers all relevant UK fishery sectors, including the bass pair trawl fishery to the Department, and has recently presented us with their 2006 findings. This report will be submitted to the European Commission and published on DEFRA's website in due course. The Commission evaluate all contributing member states' schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.861W.6/3">The UK Government have identified the potential benefits of acoustic devices, such as pingers, in reducing bycatch of dolphins and other cetaceans in fixed gear fisheries and argued successfully at an international level for these devices to be required in certain fisheries by EU legislation. Prior to enforcing the use of pingers under Council Regulation EC 8121 2004, the UK Government wants to ensure that those we recommend to be used are safe and cost effective for the industry and offer the maximum protection to porpoises.</p>
	<p pid="c.861W.6/4">We have also provided significant funding for collaborative working with other countries to collect information on the distribution and abundance of cetaceans in European Atlantic offshore waters. Other countries participating in this research study are France, Ireland and Spain. The outputs from this work will provide new information on the distribution, abundance and habitat preferences of a number of cetaceans, which include the bottlenose dolphin and common dolphin. This information will be used to assess the threats to dolphins and inform what mitigation measures may be required.</p>
	<p pid="c.861W.6/5">All dolphins are listed in either Appendix I or II of CITES. Under CITES, commercial trade in wild-taken Appendix I dolphins is only allowed in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II dolphin species are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade is regulated. The UK supports the listing of dolphins on the appropriate Appendix and, in 2004, supported the up-listing of the Irrawaddy dolphin from Appendix II to I. Under CITES, countries manage trade in listed species to ensure that their conservation is not threatened by trade. Under that management regime, the UK (and EU) takes strict measures in respect of trade, and keeping in captivity, of all dolphins. Trade in wild-taken dolphins would only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, for example scientific, breeding, or educational purposes (where these would bring conservation benefits to the species concerned). Commercial trade in the EU in these species is strictly prohibited. The UK encourages other countries to adopt similar standards.</p>

	<p pid="c.864W.5/1">The three River class vessels which replaced the six Island class vessels in 2003-04, were leased by MOD to provide the majority of Fishery Protection duties for DEFRA. The Rivers, like the Island class before, are contracted to provide 70 per cent. of the total annual patrol day requirement. The Rivers provide on average 190 to 230 patrol days each year. Their design, their equipment and their crewing is geared to provide a first class fisheries enforcement service in UK and International waters at anytime of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.864W.5/2">The Hunt class vessels that are seconded to the Fishery Protection Squadron for 2 to 3 year periods, are Mine Countermeasure vessels which were designed for that primary role. There have always been three to five Hunts in the Fishery Protection Squadron at any one time, but they have always acted in a supporting role to the Islands and Rivers within the Fishery Protection Squadron. Most of the Hunts provide on average, 50-100 patrol days each year and consequently spend long periods of the year not on fisheries enforcement duties.</p>
	<p pid="c.864W.5/3">The River class vessels, built in the last five years, are much faster vessels than the older Hunts (18yrs plus), with a maximum speed of 22knts compared to a maximum of 15kts on the Hunts and they are able to stay at sea for longer periods. Rivers currently carry out 12 day patrols followed by a two day stand-off whereas the Hunts carry out seven to eight day patrols followed by a two day stand-off.</p>
	<p pid="c.864W.5/4">The River class vessels are equipped and manned to be able to routinely deploy two sea-boats to carry out simultaneous inspections whereas the Hunts are equipped to use one sea-boat. They do exceptionally use two sea-boats if weather and crewing permit.</p>
	<p pid="c.864W.5/5">Rivers have a higher complement of qualified British Sea Fisheries Officers (BSFOs), carrying an average of four at all times whereas the Hunts carry an average of three qualified BSFOs.</p>

	<p pid="c.865W.2/1">In the light of the Net Benefits report by the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit published in March 2004, DEFRA and the devolved fisheries administrations embarked in May 2005 on a programme of reform of the UK's quota management arrangements: the Quota Management Change Programme (QMCP).</p>
	<p pid="c.865W.2/2">We planned to consult on the findings of the QMCP this autumn and were in a position to do so. However, in June 2007, the Scottish Executive announced that it was withdrawing from the QMCP while it considered what quota management arrangements would be best for Scotland. The Scottish Executive has recently indicated that it wants quota management and licensing arrangements in Scotland to be separate from the rest of the UK. This would represent a significant change in UK fisheries management.</p>
	<p pid="c.865W.2/3">While I am prepared to consider this constructively, the Scottish Executive has yet to provide details of its proposals and I have, so far, seen no evidence that separate arrangements would be of benefit to the fishing industry. I have asked my officials to work with the industry and officials in the devolved administrations to examine the issues that separation raises.</p>
	<p pid="c.865W.2/4">The case for other potential reforms of the quota management arrangements, flowing from the work conducted under the QMCP, will also be considered. Any proposed changes to the quota and licensing systems will be subject to consultation with the industry. Until further work has been completed on the Scottish Executive proposals, it is not possible to say when this consultation might take place.</p>

	<p pid="c.866W.5/1">Decisions on day to day quota management, including the negotiation of quota swaps, rests with the Marine and Fisheries Agency. The monetary value of fish being swapped in or out is one aspect taken into account when quota swaps are undertaken. This is normally based on the lease value of the fish involved. The primary concern however is a judgment of the wider socio-economic value of the swap under consideration. The objective is to ensure that a swap provides the greatest benefit to the wider UK industry and/or the inshore fleet as a whole. This process can involve a consideration of the shortage of stocks being swapped in or out, the effects on a particular sector of the fleet or impacts on a community or communities.</p>

A communications strategy is currently being formulated to raise awareness of the new regimes among a number of different sectors. We have commissioned Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS) to carry out research into the attitudes of small businesses in order to understand what methods of awareness-raising would work on this hard-to-reach audience. Results should be available at the end of 2007.</p>

NetRegs is a partnership between the UK environmental regulators&mdash;the Environment Agency in England and Wales, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland. Netregs produces guidance by business type for 105 industries and guidance by environmental topic. NetRegs' main target audience are small and medium sized enterprises and unregulated businesses considered most likely to damage the environment, in particular construction, agriculture and manufacturing.</p>

	<p pid="c.875W.2/1">To date the Government have made available a significant package of up to &pound;57 million to support areas affected by the flooding of June and July 2007. None of this has to date come from the Bellwin scheme. This includes the following assistance provided to local authorities and other public bodies:</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/2" class="indent">Up to &pound;20 million in Flood Recovery Grant for local authorities affected by the floods to support their work in helping those in greatest and most immediate need. &pound;7,390,000 was paid out to local authorities affected by the July floods. Full details of the grant paid out to local authorities is available on the Communities and Local Government website:</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/floodrecovery">www.communities.gov.uk/floodrecovery</a></p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/4" class="indent">&pound;14 million for schools and children's services affected by the floods, of which over &pound;4 million has been paid out to those affected by the July floods. Full details of the grant allocation are given in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/5" class="indent">&pound;10 million for repairs to the local highway with more to come for affected local authorities as claims are submitted.</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/6" class="indent">&pound;1 million which can be drawn on as contingency reserve for use by Jobcentre Plus to support additional demand for Social Fund Community Care Grants.</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/7" class="indent">As of <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase>, the Department for Work and Pensions had paid Community Care Grants totalling &pound;707,000 to people on qualifying benefits to meet the cost of replacing essential household items</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/8" class="indent">&pound;1 million to support rural tourism in England through promoting rural destinations and visitor attractions and a targeted marketing campaign.</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/9">In addition, over &pound;11 million has been made available by Regional Development Agencies for businesses affected in their regions. Regional Development Agencies continue to assess the needs of business in the affected regions and have adapted or expanded their support to meet such demand. Further information is available on the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) website:</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/10" class="indent"><a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/regional/regional-dev-agencies/flood-recovery/page40623.html">www.berr.gov.uk/regional/regional-dev-agencies/flood-recovery/page40623.html</a></p>
	<p pid="c.875W.2/11">Bellwin schemes have been activated nationwide, for all authorities affected by June and July floods, and are amongst the most generous ever. 50 local authorities have registered for assistance for the June scheme and 52 have registered for the July scheme. 20 local authorities have registered for both schemes. Authorities have six months to spend under this scheme and none have yet submitted their claim to Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.884W.0/1">Current Government planning policy for affordable housing in the South East is set out in Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (2001). This states that affordable housing should be provided to meet locally assessed need, and includes a regional monitoring target of around 40 per cent. of total housing supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.0/2">This guidance will be replaced by the new Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) for the South East, which is due to be completed next year. The current draft, prepared by the South East of England Regional Assembly includes an overall regional target of 35 per cent. affordable housing. The draft has been examined in public by a panel of inspectors and their report is currently with the Secretary of State for consideration. The Government will respond to that report by way of proposed changes to the draft RSS for public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.0/3">The targets in the RSS are not intended to be incorporated directly into local planning policies. Government policy requires local authorities to establish local targets, based on an understanding of need, the likely economic viability of land for housing within the area and assessments of the likely levels of finance available for affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.0/4">Planning applications for housing should then be considered against local policy, and affordable housing provision in them is subject to negotiations between local authorities, Registered Social Landlords and private developers.</p>

	<p pid="c.886W.2/1">Local area agreements are an important means of improving the delivery of public services at a local level. They are the mechanism by which central government agrees a range of outcomes and targets with local partnerships. The local area agreement for Gloucestershire was developed through wide consultation in the county. It was signed in March 2007 by the chief executive of Gloucestershire county council on behalf of the county's Local Strategic Partnership, which brings together representatives from the public, private and third sectors. The Local Strategic Partnership has put in place governance structures and performance management arrangements to ensure that the targets in the agreement are achieved. The full text of the agreement can be found at <a href="http://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/laa">www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/laa</a>. It contains a full list of the outcomes and targets agreed as well as of the signatories to the agreement.</p>

	<p pid="c.888W.11/2">The Waste Strategy for England, published in May 2007, includes the Government's Illegal Waste Activity Action Plan, which sets out action proposed and being taken in this area. This includes working with stakeholders to consider how the Flycapture database can be enhanced or improved to enable local authorities to better use data to take action against fly-tipping. This may include extending the scope of the database on a voluntary basis to landowners.</p>
	<p pid="c.888W.11/3">Neither the local authority nor the Environment Agency is under any legal obligation to assist the removal of waste on private land. However, some local authorities are ready to work with landowners to investigate and prosecute repeated incidents of fly-tipping and to tackle specific problems or issues. The Government believe that to place a duty on authorities to remove waste from private land would encourage illegal dumping rather than tackle the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.888W.11/4">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 gave courts the power to make an order against anyone convicted of the main offence of illegal waste disposal to pay for costs incurred by a landowner in removing waste that has been illegally deposited.</p>
	<p pid="c.888W.11/5">In addition, the Environment Agency's National Fly-tipping Prevention Group identifies better ways of preventing and tackling fly-tipping on private land by working closely with organisations like the National Farmers Union, the Country Land and Business Association, Network Rail and the National Trust, and has issued guidance to landowners on how to deal with this problem.</p>

	<p pid="c.890W.5/1">The Government are committed to good mental health and well-being for its personnel, both in-service and after they leave. For veterans, healthcare is primarily the responsibility of the NHS and in recent years there has been a special focus on mental health, with substantially increased investment in therapists and other frontline trained staff in order to improve access to proven psychological therapies. Veterans are benefiting from these improvements along with others suffering mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="c.890W.5/2">We recognise that there are issues about ensuring culturally sensitive care arrangements for those whose mental health may have been affected by their service in the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.890W.5/3">The Government have a number of initiatives in hand to address this. First, in June we announced the extension of the MOD's medical assessment programme based at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, to provide assessments to any veteran suffering from mental health problems as a result of service in operations since 1982. The service offers an expert military assessment for GPs and other civilian health professionals who may be unfamiliar with the military background to a condition and for veterans who are concerned that the service background to their condition may not have been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.890W.5/4">We work very closely with Combat Stress and last year gave &pound;2.5 million in fees and have agreed to a phased increase in the fees we pay, rising to 45 per cent. from January 2008 to enable them to enhance their capability to treat veterans.</p>
	<p pid="c.890W.5/5">For the longer term, the MOD is working with the four UK Health Departments and the charity Combat Stress to pilot a new model of community-based mental health care that will address assessment and treatment of veterans' mental health problems. Implementation of the new model will take place first in six pilot sites around the country. The pilots will run for two years after which they will be subject to full evaluation and, if successful roll out nationwide.</p>

Education and preventative measures to increase awareness at all levels about stress and mental illness begins when armed forces personnel are serving. These include pre-and post-deployment briefings and the availability of support, assessment, and (if required) treatment, both during and after deployments.</p>

More specifically, plans to pilot a new community-based veterans' mental health service on a regional basis, will involve the establishment of networks of expertise in veterans mental health; these will provide specialised assessment and treatment, but also sign-posting to other sources of advice and support. The pilots include plans to communicate availability of the service both locally and nationally.</p>

The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency also operates a freephone helpline: 0800 169 2277 that offers advice on a wide range of issues, including sources of advice and assistance. Advice and assessment is also available through the Department's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) based at St. Thomas' hospital, London, which is advertised both on the MOD's website and through some of the main pathways to care for veterans; the MAP also offers a freephone contact line on 0800 169 5401.</p>

	<p pid="c.898W.9/2">The UK has one of the most rigorous and transparent export licensing regimes in the world. All licence applications are individually assessed on a case-by-case basis against &quot;The Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria&quot;. The criteria cover, in detail, how we assess each case. Some of the key factors considered include: an assessment of the nature and military capability of the equipment; the prevailing circumstances in the proposed country of import; the expected end-use and end-user of the equipment; the human rights record of the importing country; and whether there is a clear risk that the export might be used for internal repression. The criteria also requires us to take into account the risk of military equipment being re- exported or diverted under undesirable conditions. We will not issue an export licence for equipment destined for any country, unless we are satisfied the application meets the high standards of the consolidated criteria.</p>

	<p pid="c.902W.2/2">The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) project is currently in its Assessment Phase. As with all Defence projects, it is not until Main Gate approval has been obtained that decisions such as final vessel numbers are confirmed. It is therefore too early to determine the number of ships that will be built under the MARS project.</p>
	<p pid="c.902W.2/3">The MOD is currently analysing the various options available to best procure the MARS ships, concentrating initially on the fleet tankers which are the most urgently required vessels.</p>

	<p pid="c.908W.2/1">The exact information requested could not be derived as a time series. Instead, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) was used to produce a time series with a broader age range and slightly different qualification categories to those requested. The following table shows the estimates of mean hourly earnings (in &pound;s) by qualifications held for full-time employees aged 23-27<sup>(1)</sup> in England, using LFS spring quarter results from 1995-2007. More rigorous research by the Centre for the Economics of Education on the wage returns to qualifications is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.908W.2/2" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The age range 23-27 was used, because there were too few people aged 25 for the results to be statistically robust.

	<p pid="c.912W.3/2">Local areas, such as those within Faversham and Mid Kent, which wish to market themselves as a tourism destination are advised to work with their Regional Development Agency and its regional tourism partners (in this case, the South East of England Regional Development Agency (SEEDA); Tourism South East; and Kent county council, working with the Kent Tourism Alliance). SEEDA, in collaboration with its partners, has developed a strategy for maximising the benefits of the Olympics in the region, &quot;Compete, Create, Collaborate for a World Class Performance&quot;. This strategy focuses, for example, on the role of the region as a gateway to the UK and as a 'festival region' (thus taking full advantage of the Cultural Olympiad as well as existing festivals). Additionally, SEEDA and Tourism South East, with input from their sub-regional partners, including the Kent Tourism Alliance, will continue to work with VisitBritain by providing detailed content for its themed marketing campaigns and website. VisitBritain is currently developing its marketing and branding plans for 2012.</p>

	<p pid="c.913W.2/1">For the purposes of this commitment the Government have defined 'multi-sport' as access to at least two different sports facilities that are most in demand. In relation to 'good quality' there is no single nationally recognised measure that can be applied to all sports facilities. However, the Active Places sports facilities database (the main tool for measuring the commitment), holds information about the age of facilities and length of time since last refurbishment. We are using these figures as the measure of quality.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.2/2">Using the Active Places database Sport England are undertaking strategic mapping of the Nation's sports facilities and we know that over 90 per cent. of people in England are within 20 minutes travel time of at least two different sports facilities that are most in demand by the public (swimming pools, playing fields, synthetic turf pitches, health and fitness centres, sports halls and golf courses). We know that, of the built sports facilities listed on Active Places: pools, halls, health and fitness and synthetic turf pitches, 65 per cent. have been built or refurbished in the last 10 years. We expect to see these positive figures maintained in future years.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.2/3">The Government take the view that those in urban areas should be within 20 minutes walking distance of a multi-sport environment, while those in rural areas should be within 20 minutes driving distance by car. Urban and rural areas are defined using the &quot;Rural and Urban Area Classification 2004: Introductory Guide&quot;, which was jointly published by The Countryside Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Office for National Statistics, and the Welsh Assembly Government. The rural road travel times are based on the average road speeds derived from the Integrated Transport Network produced by Ordnance Survey. The urban walking catchments are based on a straightline 1.34km distance.</p>

These sub-national analyses of survival from specific cancers are only routinely undertaken for eight cancers; those of bladder, breast (women), cervix, colon, lung, oesophagus, prostate and stomach. Equivalent figures are not available for skin cancer below national level, and there are no plans to produce these or equivalent figures for other cancer sites.</p>
	<p pid="c.921W.5/7" class="indent">However, survival rates by socio-economic deprivation, trends in the rates, and NHS region for 58 cancers including skin cancer diagnosed during 1971-90 in England and Wales were published in <i> Cancer Survival Trends*</i> in 1999. Figures for skin cancer, broken down by region are given in Table 2.</p>

	<p pid="c.922W.2/1">Research undertaken by KPMG for HMRC in 2006 suggested that the total annual burden to business of outsourcing the completion of the land transaction return to solicitors as about &pound;25.5 million. Details of this can be found on the HMRC website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.922W.2/3">Of this, estimates suggest that 76 per cent. of returns are for transactions where no stamp duty land tax is payable. This is equivalent to 0.8 per cent. of the stamp duty land tax yield from non-residential property transactions in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="c.922W.2/4">The planned increase in the notification threshold announced in last month's pre-Budget report would reduce this cost by between &pound;5 million to &pound;6 million, or by approximately a fifth.</p>

HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) were required to issue a CIS 4 to anyone working, or intending to work, as a sub-contractor in the construction industry. There was no other qualifying test, so refusal was extremely rare. Any payment made by a contractor to a CIS 4 holder was subject to a deduction on account of tax which was paid over to HMRC by the contractor. There was no requirement for a tax return specifically connected with the CIS 4. At the close of the former scheme, there were some 1.9 million CIS 4 holders.</p>

	<p pid="c.926W.3/2">The improvement measures that HMRC has put in place are starting to have an impact. In October 2007, the average processing time for VAT registration applications was 28 days and 45 per cent. of applications were processed within the 14 day target. This represents a significant improvement since August 2007 when the average processing time peaked at 42 days. This upturn has taken place against an operational background that continues to present challenges, and alongside the ongoing need to operate pre-registration checks against serious abuse such as Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud.</p>

	<p pid="c.929W.3/1">Many bulk commodities are brought by rail to Afghanistan's borders and then transported by truck around the country. In early 2006 Afghanistan began work on a railway project connecting Hirat city to the Iranian border at Sangan. 60 per cent. of the project is funded by the Iranian Government. Discussion is under way on constructing lengthier railways in Afghanistan. However, there needs to be a very careful economic cost-benefit analysis of any major railway investments to ascertain whether this is the best use of investment resources as compared with other priority investments.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.3/2">The Government of Afghanistan plans to focus on improving roads and airports as priority areas of transport over the next five to 10 years, as outlined in the draft Afghanistan National Development Strategy (AMDS) transport sector plan. Railhead transfer stations at the borders are likely to be improved so that the cost of changing freight from trains to trucks is lowered, thus lowering the cost of Afghanistan's international trade.</p>

	<p pid="c.929W.6/1">We do not have detailed information on the number of kilometres of metalled road constructed in Helmand Province since 2001. However, we are aware of USAID funding for 8 km of metalled road between Lashkar Gah City and Qala-i-Bost and 40 km of metalled road between Lashkar Gah City and the Duari Junction on the provincial border with Kandahar Province. In addition to this, the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) have funded 5.2 km of metalled road in the Lashkar Gah District Centre. Under the DFID supported Helmand Agricultural and Rural Development Programme (HARD-P), 49 km of roads has almost been completed in Lashkar Gah, including Bolan Road (12 km); Qala-i-Bost (14 kms); Lashkari Bazar (8 kms) and Sarkar (17 kms). However, these are not metalled roads as they do not provide the best value for money. The current preferred surface option for the majority of rural access roads is the double bituminous surface treatment (DBST) method.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.6/2">At the national level, nearly 1,500 km of the 4,900 km national (secondary) road network, and several thousand kilometres of tertiary roads, all with gravel surfaces, have been improved. By June 2007, about 2,500 km of the original 2,900 km of paved regional road network had been reconstructed or rehabilitated to national standards and paved with asphalt concrete.</p>

	<p pid="c.936W.6/2"><i> </i>The Government recognise that companies need clarity about the commencement timetable for the Companies Act 2006 so that they can make proper preparation for full implementation. In particular, we wished to avoid companies making changes to their articles of association in the 2008 annual general meeting season in a way which would have required them to hold an extraordinary general meeting if the commencement timetable were changed next year. The Government have therefore decided, in the light of advice from the Registrar of Companies that he can not be absolutely confident of implementing the necessary changes to Companies House systems and processes by October 2009, to announce a change to the timetable now so that companies do not incur unnecessary costs.</p>

In the last three years, there has been an unprecedented demand for new clearances in the industry and many existing clearances have become due for review. This increased demand coincided with a period of high staff turnover in 2004-05 and backlogs accrued. In each of the last two years, however, the OCNS Vetting Unit has produced a very strong performance which has met this increased demand and cleared most of the outstanding work relating to the routine review of existing clearances.

The project focused on enabling disadvantaged young people to take part in positive activities that many young people take for granted by giving them the means to pay for activities. In February 2007 we announced that we would not be proceeding with the pilots because uncertainties around the delivery solution and the potential costs meant that value for money could not be assured. The total cost of the youth opportunity card project, from December 2005 to February 2007, was &pound;2.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.945W.4/3">The work carried out on the youth opportunity card has provided a solid foundation from which to build, and we have continued to work with nine of the pilot local authorities to develop alternative ways of empowering disadvantaged young people to take part in positive activities of their choice. In September I announced that these nine authorities will be piloting different approaches to giving individual disadvantaged young people spending power to pay for positive activities of their choice. All nine pilots are currently expected to start by April 2008 and run until March 2009.</p>

In support of this, the Agency is examining whether any changes will be required to its current data collection and collation arrangements in respect of the location of those applying for indefinite leave to remain applications, and in other categories.</p>
	<p pid="c.948W.5/2">However, any geographical data that is provided will be based on a 'snapshot' of where individual applicants were located on the last occasion that they needed to be in official contact with the Agency. The data will therefore be limited in its application (and this limitation will apply to any data that is derived from address or post code information that the Agency holds).</p>

SSPs must describe in writing the standards, procedures and arrangements which are kept in place to ensure the security of the nuclear premises, nuclear materials, other radioactive material and sensitive nuclear information. These arrangements include the full range of security measures including physical (e.g. fences, intruder detection systems and guards), personnel (e.g. national security vetting) and information security issues. The SSPs must be approved by OCNS before they are adopted. Once adopted sites are regularly inspected by OCNS to ensure compliance with their SSP.

	<p pid="c.958W.0/1">The variations in the four teachers' pay areas, covering Inner London, Outer London, the &quot;Fringe&quot; (extending to certain parts of the home counties), and the rest of England and Wales (as defined in the school teachers' pay and conditions document), are intended to take account of economic circumstances linked to labour market conditions and cost of living pressures within the pay areas. The variations in pay apply to all teacher pay scales. The starting salary for a newly qualified teacher, for example, currently varies from &pound;20,133 for England and Wales, &pound;21,102 for &quot;Fringe&quot;, &pound;23,118 for outer London, to &pound;24,168 for inner London. Full details of pay variations are available in the school teachers' pay and conditions document 2007 (available in the House of Commons Library and at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/pay">www.teachernet.gov.uk/pay</a>).</p>

	<p pid="c.958W.3/1">The official source for employment figures in England is the Labour Force Survey (LFS), but the LFS sample is insufficiently large to produce robust estimates of 16 to 18-year-old employment at local authority level. The Department's estimate of the number and proportion of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) also cannot be disaggregated to regional or local authority level. However, we can give an indication of the number of 16, 17 and 18-year-olds<sup>(1)</sup> in full-time employment and NEET from data provided by Connexions services, and this is provided in the following table. Connexions data has only been available at local authority level since 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.964W.3/2">The development of the Jamaican criminal justice system is a matter of mutual importance to Jamaica and the UK. The Government continue to provide significant support to the criminal justice sector in Jamaica, including through its assistance to the Jamaica constabulary force, and is looking for ways to develop this further. We are hoping to provide further assistance to the reform of the justice sector which the Jamaican government is pursuing. We are also discussing with the Jamaican government ways of co-operating more closely on the issue of rehabilitation of Jamaicans deported from the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.984W.2/1">Ministers and officials have taken account of wider public views on the law of self-defence from a number of sources. This has included paying careful attention to the range of correspondence from the public on this issue, before and after the announcement of a review by the Secretary of State for Justice, received both directly from the public and through Members of Parliament. The review has also considered wider public debate on this subject, including in Parliament, where it has been the subject of four private Members' Bills since 2003. Contributions to those debates have reflected wider public feeling.</p>
	<p pid="c.984W.2/2">In addition, Ministers are discussing this area of the law with practitioners, including the Crown Prosecution Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers, whose officers deal with members of the public directly in these cases. We are also seeking wider views through discussion with members of the Opposition. The Government's aim is to conclude a review in time to bring forward amendments to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill before it completes its consideration in the House of Commons. This swift timetable means that a formal public consultation is not feasible.</p>

	<p pid="c.987W.1/1">The United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) has advised that screening men aged 65 for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) can be recommended in principle. Before making its recommendation, the NSC considered the evidence, merits and costs of introducing the screening programme against its internationally recognised criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.987W.1/2">Detailed work is being undertaken in developing proposals for AAA screening in England, to assess the practical implications.

Data quality<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/>  2. Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br/> An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> 3. Patient counts<br/> Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br/> 4. Health authority (HA) of residence<br/> This derived field contains the code for the HA in which the patient lived immediately before admission.<br/> Resident SHA (Re-SHA) is derived from the patient's postcode in the field home address. (This may not be the area where treatment took place). If home address is not recognised, Re-SHA may be derived from the health authority of residence notified by the hospital.<br/> 5. Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality<br/> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner practice and SHA of general practitioner practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>
