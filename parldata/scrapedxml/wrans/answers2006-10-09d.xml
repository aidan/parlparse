	<p pid="d.11W.2/3" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many telephone calls to the Child Support Agency <i> (a)</i> were received <i> (b)</i> received an engaged tone and <i> (c)</i> were disconnected during the interactive response process for the period April 2002 to June 2006 for (i) all calls and (ii) calls relating to the cases being processed on the CS2 computer system.</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.2/4" class="indent">The latest information is contained in the two following tables. Note that the CS2 computer system did not become operational until March 2003. Therefore it is not possible to provide data for the year 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.2/5" class="indent">Note also that point <i> (c)</i> has been interpreted as referring to the total number of calls abandoned (for example, where the client does not have a National Insurance number to hand and hangs up to go and find it before calling back) or lost during the automated part of the process, as the Agency cannot disconnect a call once it is in the IVR system.</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.2/6" class="indent">Further information on the Agency's telephony performance is available in Table 16 of the latest edition of the Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics. A copy of this document is available in the House Library, as well as on the internet, at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.2/7" class="indent">The Agency has shown a significant and sustained improvement in telephony performance, with respect to waiting times and the percentage of calls answered. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.2/8" class="indent">In the quarter ending June 2006, the Agency answered 97% of telephone calls available to be answered, compared to 91% in the year ending March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.11W.2/9" class="indent">In the quarter ending June 2006, average waiting time for all calls was 24 seconds, down from 59 seconds in the year ending March 2006.</p>

Given that the financial assistance scheme is funded by taxpayers, most of whom do not benefit from a defined benefit pension, we do not believe it would be appropriate or fair to extend the scheme to such an extent.</p>

However, it did not specifically identify a need for independent professional financial advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.23W.8/2">Recognising the importance of information, the White Paper consultation asks for comments on what individuals would need in each proposed approach. The responses will inform the work we are doing in the period before implementation of the new system, when we are actively pursuing three distinct strands of work. Developing the information and communications strategy to support the introduction of personal accounts; continuing our work on improving public understanding of pensions; and working with the FSA and others on the broader financial capability strategy. This work includes testing the workplace as a delivery mechanism for financial information, in particular information about pensions.</p>

	<p pid="d.27W.6/1">During the oral statement I said that both the stock market fall of the late 1990s and rising longevity had cost UK pension funds &pound;250 billion. To clarify, between 1999 and 2002 the market value of occupational pension scheme assets reduced by a total of around &pound;250 billion. We believe this reduction was largely a result of the impact of the stock market fall. Rising longevity would have increased pension fund liabilities during this period, also leading to increases in scheme costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.29W.3/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus does not directly employ staff to provide psychotherapeutic counselling. In Pathways to Work areas, Personal Advisers are able to refer their customers to a Condition Management Programme which can include access to psychological therapies. Although these services are funded by Jobcentre Plus, they are commissioned, and supplied, by local Primary Care Trusts. We are therefore not able to provide details of the number of staff involved.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.3/5" class="indent">In addition, Jobcentres have many local (non-contractual) partnerships with a variety of voluntary and community organisations that offer support to individuals on issues such as coping with life and substance or alcohol abuse. Although counselling is used by some of these organisations, we have no data on whether or not they specifically use trained psychotherapeutic counsellors.</p>

Stakeholder pensions are sold and marketed by the financial services industry. The suitability of a stakeholder pension for any individual will depend on their particular circumstances. Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) show that around 2,880,000 stakeholder pension policies have been sold since their introduction in April 2001.</p>

	<p pid="d.45W.8/1">The BBC, as television licensing authority, is responsible for interpreting the television licensing regulations and for determining licensing requirements in specific circumstances. However, the general position is that free television licences are not available for second addresses, whether permanent or short-term. A person aged 75 or over who is ordinarily resident in a care home that qualifies for the communal Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary licence does not need a separate television licence and the standard fee of &pound;5 per unit of accommodation is waived for their accommodation. An over-75 living in a care home that does not qualify for the ARC concession would be entitled to their own free television licence.</p>

This scheme costs &pound;25 per day per child, of which the Department subsidises half. There is not a set number of allocated places to the Department and places are offered on a first come, first served basis. Waiting lists for these places occur if a date and site become over-subscribed. The Department does not have on-site child care facilities at any of its own premises.</p>
	<p pid="d.48W.6/3">The Department also offers child care vouchers through a salary sacrifice scheme to provide parents with maximum flexibility in choosing the child care most suited to their needs.

	<p pid="d.48W.6/4">The Department has also introduced the Family Life Solutions service for all staff (a free and confidential telephone helpline service offering support to people with caring responsibilities and information on a range of issues, including child care). The cost of this for the Department is approximately &pound;1,500 per year for 520 staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.53W.5/1">In 2001 my Department introduced the Public Library standards, to help to define local authorities' statutory duty. Two of these standards have regard to the lending stock held by libraries, setting targets for items added to the collections through purchase per 1,000 population, and time taken to replenish the stock. Since 2001 there has been significant improvement in these areas primed by these standards, which both aim to encourage the quantity, freshness and condition of the stock that library users find when they visit.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/2">Reader development organisation Opening the Book have been joint funded by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), Arts Council England and the Audit Commission to deliver a stock quality health check of public libraries. This looks in detail at the range and depth of adult fiction and poetry stock in public libraries, and the findings are made available online (<a href="http://www.stockquality.org/stockquality/">www.stockquality.org/stockquality/</a>). This tool continues to enable them to compare themselves with other authorities&mdash;105 of the 149 English authorities did so last year&mdash;and to understand how their existing book selection systems might align their purchasing more closely with the varying needs of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/3">The MLA have also developed a national book purchasing model for public libraries. This was published in August this year under the title Better Stock, Better Libraries. The report outlines how up to 20million of savings can be made for local authorities through joint selection and purchasing, and creates a significant opportunity for authorities to reinvest those savings in improving library services to customers, including their book stock levels. The next stage of the project will develop the proposals in detail and test them fully&mdash;including the costs, risks and benefits&mdash;before they are implemented.</p>

	<p pid="d.54W.2/2">At the time of the Network's introduction, the intention was that it should be free universally at point of use. The majority of the 149 library authorities do not charge for public access to it. However, the decision whether or not to charge for this access rests with the individual authorities. All authorities that do charge offer concessions for particular types of user and some offer free access each day for a limited period.</p>

	<p pid="d.55W.8/2">Under the first and interim licence periods, funding for superdraws was taken from the prize target shortfall. The shortfall was the difference between the amount of revenue that Camelot's 1994 bid anticipated paying in prizes and the actual amount paid. Following the funding of the superdraw, the balance of the shortfall, together with the interest generated on it, passed in full to the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF).</p>

The increased prize payout for a superdraw is now funded jointly by the NLDF and the operator (Camelot) in the proportion that they benefit from incremental sales. Since superdraws use funds which would otherwise be destined for the good causes, individual superdraw events have to be approved by the National Lottery Commission.</p>

	<p pid="d.82W.3/1">The DCA is responsible for maintaining absence data in respect of its staff working at the Scotland Office. Only a small percentage of the staff working at the Scotland Office is employed by DCA, the majority being employees of the Scottish Executive. Of those staff that are employed by DCA, 20 per cent. have been absent due to sickness for fewer than five days on more than two occasions in each of the last three years. In order to protect the identity of those members of staff, given that the 20 per cent. figure is based on a very small group of employees, it is not possible to provide details of the number of staff to whom this 20 per cent. relates.</p>

	<p pid="d.82W.6/1">The number of sickness absence days is recorded by the Department. However the way in which individual absences are managed is not recorded centrally. Managers are expected to manage all instances of employee absence appropriately, whether through rehabilitative or disciplinary channels, but are not required to report on the numbers of staff that are subject to either process. To obtain this information from managers would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.97W.2/1">The change that took place to my Department's performance management procedures on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">Wednesday 1 June 2005</phrase> only related to the record keeping process. From that date, detailed central records of all unsatisfactory performance cases was introduced. The policies and procedures for managing poor performance remain the same. Previously central records were only maintained in cases where staff who received an unsatisfactory report, failed to improve and were subsequently dismissed. Where unsatisfactory performers achieved the required improvement, managers handled the case locally. For this reason, information on the total number of staff who received unsatisfactory reports is only available from <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">Wednesday 1 June 2005</phrase>.</p>

Their compliance with the delegation is regulated by the information fair trader scheme. Where non-compliance is found an action plan will be agreed to implement the recommendations in the information fair trade scheme (IFTS) report. The Office of Public Sector Information will work closely with the IFTS member to action the recommendations and monitor implementation. If the plan is not implemented within agreed timescales then ultimately it is open to the controller to withdraw the delegation of authority.</p>

	<p pid="d.111W.0/1">Several research projects that examine the sexual attitudes and behaviours of BME groups have been commissioned as part of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, details of which are provided at annex 1. The strategy has also drawn upon routinely collected data to inform our understanding of ethnicity and teenage pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.0/2">The evidence suggests that young people from different ethnic groups are more or less likely to experience teenage pregnancy than others. But establishing the precise impact of ethnicity is difficult because: ethnicity is not recorded at birth registration; BME groups are over-represented in deprived areas where higher rates would be expected; and sexual behaviour, knowledge and attitudes may vary considerably within BME groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.0/3">Data on mothers giving birth under-19, identified from the 2001 Census, show rates of teenage motherhood are significantly higher among young women of 'Mixed White and Black Caribbean', 'Other Black' and 'Black Caribbean' ethnicity. 'White British' young women are also over-represented among teenage mothers, while all Asian ethnic groups are under-represented. Girls and young women of Black and Black British ethnicity are also over-represented among abortions under-18. In 2004, Black ethnic groups (which represent around 3 per cent. of all females aged 15-17) accounted for 9 per cent. of all abortions under-18.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.0/4">The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy has a target to halve the rate of under-18 conceptions by 2010 (compared to the rate in 1998). Between 1998 and 2004 (the latest year for which data are available) the under-18 conception rate fell by 11.1 per cent., to its lowest level for 20 years and the under 16 rate fell by 15.2 per cent. The strategy does not have targets to reduce conceptions among different ethnic groups, although local areas are asked to take account of factors that increase the risk of early pregnancy, including social deprivation, poor educational attainment, living in care and ethnicity, in the delivery of local strategies.</p>

	<p pid="d.114W.9/1">The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) collects information on disabled students each year via the HESA Student record. Disability is determined in two ways: by a self-assessment on the part of the student, and by whether a student is in receipt of a Disabled Student Allowance.</p>
	<p pid="d.114W.9/2">HESA's Performance Indicators in Higher Education include the proportion of students in receipt of a Disabled Student Allowance, and the proportion of full-time first degree entrants who do not continue in higher education after first year. Both of these are shown in the tables. However, there is no publicly-available information on non-completion rates specifically for disabled students. Using the data on which the PIs are based, the proportion of full-time first degree disabled students not continuing in HE after first year has been calculated for 2002-03 and 2003-04. These figures are also included in the tables.</p>

	<p pid="d.117W.5/1">There is no national subsidy for pensioners on courses in further education funded through the Learning and Skills Council. However all those on income related benefits and their families do not pay tuition fees for their courses. This includes those pensioners in receipt of the pension credit guarantee. Many pensioners will also benefit from free tuition for courses in literacy, numeracy and language and, where they intend to work, from free tuition for a first full level 2 qualification. Beyond national policy many providers, in both local authorities and FE colleges, have offered fee concessions at their own discretion which may, to varying degrees, be based on age. The following table therefore shows the numbers of learning aims funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in 2004/05 and taken up by learners of State Pension Age, i.e. 65 for men and 60 for women, where fees are waived for whatever reason. Figures are in terms of aims, of which an individual learner may have several, because fee remission applies to individual aims rather than the learner. Additionally, where fees are paid in full by the learner, 75 per cent. of the total tuition cost in 2004/05 for learners in Further Education was still funded by the LSC.</p>
	<p pid="d.117W.5/2">Equivalent figures for 2005/06 will not be available until December 2006.</p>

	<p pid="d.121W.0/1">The cost to the Exchequer of students who drop out from UK universities depends on factors such as the timing of drop outs within academic years, the level of public funding associated with individual courses, students entitlement to student support, whether or not students transfer to other HE institutions and whether or not students return to HE at a later date. It is therefore not possible to give a reliable figure for the cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.121W.0/2">Completion rates for the UK are among the highest in the OECD. The following table sets out the rates of non-completion over the last five years for which information is available. In England, the national rate of projected non-completion has broadly shown a downward trend since 1997/98, but we are committed to continuing to bear-down on rates of non-completion while increasing and widening participation in higher education.</p>

It showed that 56 per cent. of all full time undergraduate students undertook paid work at some time during the academic year. For those undertaking such work earnings were on average &pound;3,250 (after tax). Data by industry sector are not available. The Department plans to repeat the survey in the 2007-08 academic year.</p>

	<p pid="d.128W.8/1">The capital receipt expected to be raised from the approved applications is approximately &pound;613 million. However, because of land price changes from the time that consent is given to the time that the land is sold, and also because some sales may not yet have taken place, it is not possible to accurately assess how much capital has been raised or how much money has actually been spent.</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.8/2">However, it is set out in guidance that any sale proceeds must be re-invested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.131W.2/1">Since 1998, of the 228 applications involving the loss of an area of grassed land capable of forming a school sports pitch, two have been rejected and 46 withdrawn. Applications to dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields are considered against strict criteria which are set out in the Department's guidance. Briefly, these are:</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/2" class="indent">(a) school's needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in the local area, are met;</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/3" class="indent">(b) community needs: that community use of a school's playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary;</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/4" class="indent">(c) finance: that any sale proceeds are reinvested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools, with priority being given to outdoor sports facilities, or are used to help raise standards by improving educational facilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/5">In the case of the two rejected applications, the School Playing Fields Advisory Panel determined, on appeal, that the applications did not meet the published criteria. Applications have been withdrawn either as a result of the panel's preliminary view that the application failed to meet the criteria or as a result of similar advice from officials. In some instances, the applicant itself has withdrawn its application because it realised that it failed to meet the criteria. In every case, however, the reason for withdrawal was that the application failed to meet the criteria for giving consent. A withdrawn case has the same effect as one that is rejected in that the proposed disposal, or change of use, does not happen.</p>

For example, we have commissioned the Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics Network (SETNET) to recruit an extra 6,000 science engineering ambassadors by 2007-08. We have also remitted the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB) to advise on improving the use of current pay flexibilities and incentives to improve the recruitment, retention and quality of science teachers; and on whether science teachers should receive an incentive to encourage them to complete physics and chemistry enhancement CPD leading to an accredited qualification.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.3/1">There is no central record of Government funds given specifically to projects that provide support to children who have experienced sexual exploitation. Support services such as these are delivered through many different funding initiatives, central, local and voluntary and across a wide variety of different organisations in both the voluntary sector and health related services. It is therefore also not possible to identify those projects that have closed within the last two years.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.7/1">In order to be awarded Qualified Teacher Status, all trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the statutory Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN, and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.7/2">The current standards for teachers are under review. Once revised, it is proposed that they will be strengthened to include a standard which requires teachers to know and comply with current legislation on well being of children and young people, one which requires teachers to know and understand the role of others when dealing with children who have special educational needs and/or disabilities, and one which requires teachers to communicate effectively with parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.7/3">Induction Standards require Newly Qualified Teachers to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement, and in consultation with the school's SEN Co-ordinator, can contribute to the planning for individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.7/4">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to discuss their own development needs in performance management reviews, and to address development priorities. This could include strengthening knowledge and understanding of SEN and disability issues. Where schools have identified a need to strengthen knowledge and understanding of SEN/disability, as a school improvement priority, this should be addressed through their school improvement and development plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.7/5">All schools receive a School Development Grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. A wide variety of courses are available covering SEN and disability, ranging from awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers and their schools to determine their own particular training and development needs; the Department does not direct the amount to be spent on in-service training in relation to SEN/disability. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development in SEN/disability.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.7/6">The Department's published SEN Strategy, 'Removing Barriers to Achievement' recognised the important of training and committed us to work closely with the Training and Development Agency for Schools to ensure that initial teacher training and programmes of continuing professional development provide a good grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN. We have commissioned the TDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trainees, newly qualified and established teachers. These initiatives will be implemented over the period 2005-08 at a cost of approximately &pound;1.1 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.7/7">Within this package of measures, we are working to develop and pilot some specialist modules on SEN for the longer initial teacher training courses but it is too early to comment on possibilities of wider adoption.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.7/8">Under the Education (Special Educational Needs) (Information) (England) Regulations 1999, the governing body of every maintained mainstream school must publish prescribed information, including the name of the person who is responsible for co-ordinating the provision of education for pupils with SEN, whether or not the person is known as the SEN Co-ordinator (SENCO). Information on SENCO numbers and status of individual SENCOs is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="d.134W.5/2">The TPS is a defined benefit scheme that provides a pension and lump sum based on salary at retirement. The teachers' pensions regulations contain provision to restrict the salary used to calculate retirement benefits in circumstances where a scheme member has received substantial increase in salary before retirement. This is to safeguard the scheme against a disproportionate level of pension benefits being paid in relation to the contributions that have been received. The regulations do, however, provide for the employer to make a payment to the scheme to cover the actuarial value of the increased retirement benefits and, if that is paid, the full salary would be used. All provisions of the TPS apply equally to all scheme members regardless of where they are employed.</p>

In June 2006, of the teachers who had passed their induction since 2000, 81 per cent. were recorded as being in teaching service. Of the remainder some 16 per cent. were known to have left the profession. The status of four per cent. was unknown. It is not known how many of the teachers who are in teaching service are with the employer with whom they passed their induction, or how many are in a permanent post. The employment status of teachers during any gaps in service prior to finding a permanent post is also unknown.</p>

	<p pid="d.138W.5/10">(1) Manusher Jonno Human Rights and Governance Programme is building the capacity of poor men, women and children to demand their rights and seek more accountable government.</p>
	<p pid="d.138W.5/11">(2) SAMATA is a non-government organisation which helps poor people secure land rights.</p>
	<p pid="d.138W.5/12">(3) Nijera Kori Social Mobilisation is an advocacy programme which promotes greater dialogue between the political elite and civil society, so that poor women and men can better understand and take part in decision-making processes.</p>

Six months after its launch, over half of the CERF funds have already been committed by the UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator to support humanitarian crises across the world. In the unlikely event that other donors did not contribute for a second year to the Fund, we would estimate that the funds might run out in the second quarter of next year.</p>

	<p pid="d.141W.2/1">It is difficult to establish accurate numbers in each year since 2002. According to the Colombian Government, an estimated 1,148,000 people were internally displaced over the period 2000-2003. The Colombian non-government organisation, Consultancy for Human Rights and Development (CODHES), reported 1,247,000 internally displaced people over the same period. CODHES reported some 250,000 displacements in 2004 and similar numbers in 2005. According to Colombian Government figures, the total number of internally displaced people in Colombia is 2.5-3.0 million. NGO estimates suggest the number could be up to 3.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/2">Estimated numbers of refugees from Colombia are not available by year. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are currently 250,000 displaced Colombians in Ecuador (37,000 refugee and asylum seekers), 12,500 in Panama (2,200 refugee and asylum seekers) and 206,300 in Venezuela (6,300 refugee and asylum seekers).</p>

	<p pid="d.144W.2/1">Ituri is one of the areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo most affected by insecurity. Current estimates from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) suggest that there are over 200,000 internally displaced people (IDPs). The worst affected area is around the villages of Gety and Aveba, where over 40,000 people have sought shelter in camps. Attacks on these IDPs and on international non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff by rebel groups make it extremely difficult to provide support for these people, many of whom had been hiding in the surrounding forests for some time. Shortages in food supplies and logistical constraints have compounded a very serious humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p pid="d.144W.2/2">However the situation has now stabilised and food and other support is reaching people in the camps. Food rations supplied by the World Food Programme (WFP) were being distributed in Gety during the visit of one of DFID's humanitarian experts in the second half of September. Additional resources have been allocated to WFP in DRC this year to cover food, transport and logistics costs through the Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF) and the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund. Both these funds were established with strong encouragement from DFID and the UK is a major contributor to both.</p>
	<p pid="d.144W.2/3">The people of Ituri region are likely to continue to suffer from uncertainty and instability and we and our partners in the UN and NGOs will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="d.145W.2/1">To support parents in making their own choices about where and what type of child care they want for their children, the Department for International Development (DFID) offers a number of options.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.2/2">We introduced a salary sacrifice scheme in April 2005. This enables our employees to take part of their salary in child care vouchers and generates a tax and national insurance saving for the employee. This scheme offers the advantage of supporting parents to make their own choices about where and what type of child care they want for their child. From April to July 2006, &pound;36,521.22 was the total value of vouchers obtained by employees through salary sacrifice of which &pound;33,615.68 was exempt from tax and national insurance.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.2/3">DFID also reimburses child care expenses for parents who are required to work or travel on days they would not normally work. 22 employees have been reimbursed this financial year, amounting to &pound;8,641.25.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.2/4">DFID provides a holiday playscheme on site for its employees in London as part of the Westminster Holiday Playscheme. The scheme is administered and run by BUPA Childcare under contract. DFID is one of four sites in Central London open to participating Government Departments. 12 DFID parents have used the playscheme in this financial year, at a cost of &pound;1,365.78. This is half of the total cost of playscheme places, with DFID subsidising parents' costs by 50 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.146W.2/1">DFID's disciplinary procedure is fully compliant with UK legislation and applies to civil servants working in the UK and overseas. We also apply it to our locally appointed staff overseas, who work under local contracts, unless local law dictates otherwise. The procedure covers serious criminal or other unlawful acts, which may be regarded as gross misconduct justifying summary dismissal and, in some case, criminal prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.2/2">DFID did not hold a central disciplinary record until October 2004. There has been only one disciplinary case, in 2005, relating to an unlawful act involving a locally appointed member of staff overseas which resulted in dismissal.</p>

	<p pid="d.146W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is responsible for pension costs for staff leaving on early departure grounds only (excluding ill health retirement). The Department is responsible for meeting the full costs of compensation, including the early payment of pensions until age 60. We are not aware of any recent overpayments of these pensions.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.5/2">Capita Hartshead is responsible for paying all civil service pensions after age 60. Capita Hartshead provides this service under contract to the Cabinet Office who are the managers of the civil service pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.5/3">Pension awards for DFID staff who are members of the civil service pension arrangements are calculated by our pensions administrator, Paymaster. The awards are based on information on salary and service provided by DFID to Paymaster. We are not aware of any errors in the awards calculated.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.5/4">DFID does however pay pensions to former colonial public servants and their dependants. The following tables show the number of overpaid pensions recorded together with those recovered, written off and actively being pursued: (a) in the financial year 2005-06 and (b) in the current financial year, for the period to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.5/5">By far the majority of recorded overpayments relate to part month recoveries resulting from death notifications being received after the current month's pension payment had been made, almost all of which are recovered in a short period of time. Overpaid pensions represent only a very small percentage of the total value of pensions paid.</p>

	<p pid="d.151W.2/1">The policies of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are designed to support country led development strategies, including their public spending plans. These include policies to support economic stability, promote the effective use of higher levels of aid and to build the capacity of public services.</p>
	<p pid="d.151W.2/2">Economic stability is important if poverty is to be reduced. It is a foundation for growth, for avoiding inflation that harms the poor and for ensuring countries can sustain long term investments in public services. All countries face constraints in deciding on appropriate levels of domestic deficits and borrowing. The IMF's dialogue and advice helps countries establish budget policies that achieve and maintain stability. This includes agreeing with countries on the budget limits that are central to their fiscal policies. These limits avoid unsustainable deficits that will force countries to cut back on their future spending. These policies support long-term spending plans that are central to strengthening public services.</p>
	<p pid="d.151W.2/3">The IMF and the World Bank are both committed to helping developing countries manage larger aid flows to support public service investments that reduce poverty. The IMF helps countries with advice on policies to manage the macroeconomic consequences of larger aid flows. It promotes long term predictable aid that can finance higher public spending without excessive borrowing and adjusts the fiscal targets in its programmes to support higher aid backed spending. The World Bank plays a leading role in supporting countries' own poverty reduction strategies. It is a major global provider of aid to finance these strategies. The Bank also plays a central role in helping countries mobilise further aid to support their spending plans by coordinating overall donor support and ensuring aid is provided in an effective manner. The Bank is heavily involved in international efforts to strengthen key public services such as the Fast Track Initiative for education. All these policies provide direct support for public service investments. The IMF and the World Bank have made a further major contribution with the resources they have committed through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. This will help provide developing countries with the long-term predictable funding they need to help finance critical services like health and education.</p>

	<p pid="d.152W.5/1">In March 2006 DFID launched a new Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) policy setting out its renewed commitment to tackling this issue. The overarching priorities of the policy are to:</p>
	<p pid="d.152W.5/2" class="indent">strengthen the international system's and national and regional institutions' capacities to deal with DRR;</p>
	<p pid="d.152W.5/3" class="indent">integrate DRR more effectively into development policy and planning;</p>
	<p pid="d.152W.5/4" class="indent">reduce the vulnerability of the poor to disaster risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.152W.5/5">DFID's DRR work is focused on 14 of the most disaster prone countries from across three regions&mdash;Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. These countries are: Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam, Bolivia, Guyana, Jamaica and Nicaragua.</p>
	<p pid="d.152W.5/6">DFID's priority across all regions over the next 18 months is to integrate DRR more effectively into development programmes within DFID, and also in developing country governments and other development organisations within the international community. DFID staff in disaster-prone countries will be trained in the necessary skills and knowledge to do this. DFID is working in partnership with the international community in pushing this work forward. For example, DFID is providing &pound;4.3 million to the World Bank for a programme to incorporate DRR more effectively into poverty reduction strategies and approximately &pound;15 million to NGOs undertaking community level DRR work in disaster-prone countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.152W.5/7">Regionally, DFID's priorities are, within Africa, to reduce risk and vulnerability. We are working in five African countries to establish food safety net programmes for delivering regular grants of cash and food to the poorest. In Asia, DFID is working to ensure that additional money allocated to the region following the series of major natural disasters in 2004-06 is spent effectively. This has arisen from DFID's commitment to allocate 10 per cent. of its funding in response to each natural disaster for DRR. As a result, DFID is providing &pound;6.5 million for DRR work in the Asia tsunami-affected region, an additional &pound;5.8 million following the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan and &pound;500,000 following the 2006 earthquake in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In Latin America and the Caribbean DFID has been working with its partners to reduce the damaging impacts of rapid onset emergencies such as hurricanes. Throughout the 2005 and 2006 hurricane seasons we have placed a dedicated Humanitarian/DRR adviser in the Caribbean to take forward this work with regional partners.</p>

	<p pid="d.153W.2/1">DFID is committed to reducing the risk of disasters in developing countries and in March 2006 published a new policy on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). A key aim of this policy is to work in partnership with the World Bank to ensure that DRR measures are incorporated into disaster-prone countries' national level planning processes, including Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRSs). To this end DFID will provide &pound;4.38 million over the next three years for a World Bank programme to integrate DRR more effectively into developing countries' planning processes.</p>
	<p pid="d.153W.2/2">DFID also recognises the important role that the UN plays in integrating DRR into wider development. We are therefore providing &pound;3 million over the next three years to the UN's International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), the focal point in the UN system for the co-ordination of DRR. The ISDR has overall responsibility for supporting and implementing the Hyogo Framework (adopted at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in January 2005), a key goal of which is to strengthen and integrate DRR mechanisms into disaster prone countries' development planning.</p>

	<p pid="d.156W.5/1">During the recent conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, despite calls from the UK Government and other international partners for all parties to allow unfettered humanitarian access, it was extremely difficult for agencies to operate effectively. The ceasefire quickly eased the situation and a much worse humanitarian crisis was averted. The aid agencies have been working hard to deliver essential relief. We will undertake a monitoring visit in October to assess the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance by agencies supported by DFID. It is important now to ensure that UN Security Council Resolution 1701 is fully implemented so there is no return to conflict.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.5/2">In the occupied Palestinian territories (oPts), the main obstacle to effective delivery of humanitarian aid is access. The closure regime and restrictions on movement in the West Bank and, particularly, Gaza frequently hamper the delivery of humanitarian aid. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reports that it has incurred more than US$490,000 in staff cost and US$1.3 million in excess storage and other fees due to restrictions imposed by Israel on UNRWA's personnel and movement of humanitarian goods in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.5/3">DFID has seconded two experts to work with the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the oPts. They are supporting OCHA's work on humanitarian access, assisting with monitoring the humanitarian situation and helping to develop a more strategic 2007 humanitarian appeal.</p>

	<p pid="d.157W.2/1">Having visited Beirut to assess the situation for myself the priority for our humanitarian effort is now to ensure safe return for displaced citizens. To this end, DFID has provided over &pound;1.5 million from our &pound;22.3 million commitment for mine and ordnance awareness and clearance programmes. We are supporting NGOs and UN Agencies providing essential sanitation, health and hygiene supplies to refugees and continue to press for safe and secure access for humanitarian convoys to reach those most in need.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/2">A further priority is to repair basic civilian infrastructure, namely water and bridges, to assist Southern Lebanon's recovery from the conflict and to help displaced persons return home. The UK's multilateral contributions to the EU and UN emergency funds will assist the reconstruction process, and work erecting the first UK supplied prefabricated bridge began on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-13">13 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/3">The UK responded positively and quickly to the crisis and aid has been getting through. As long as the current ceasefire holds the humanitarian situation in Lebanon is manageable. Maintaining the ceasefire will require the full implementation of UNSCR 1701.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/4">The situation in Gaza remains difficult. 7,000 people have requested shelter from the UN in response to Israeli shelling and at the height of military operations more than 5,000 were being supported by the UN. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-27">27 August</phrase>, the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) closed the schools which were being used as relocation centres and gave refugees a relocation allowance. UNRWA is still providing relocation allowance for 800 families. Other agencies (especially the International Committee of the Red Cross) are providing tents, water and other services for 300 people.</p>

	<p pid="d.159W.5/1">The Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) has been delivering basic services since July 2006. By the end of September, around 11,900 health care workers, 51,500 of the poorest Palestinian government workers and 40,000 social hardship cases had received basic allowances. The TIM has also provided 1.73 million litres of fuel for hospitals, clinics and water and sanitation facilities in Gaza. This fuel is powering emergency generators to help keep these vital services working after damage to Gaza's only power station in an Israeli air raid. However, the situation in the Palestinian Territories remains very difficult and the security has deteriorated recently. In Gaza many households continue to receive just 6 to 8 hours of electricity per day, and intermittent electricity supply is affecting all key services. Water supply and sanitation services remain limited, with severe implications for health.</p>
	<p pid="d.159W.5/2">The UK has offered to contribute up to &pound;12 million to the TIM and has so far committed &pound;9 million of this to specific programmes. &pound;3 million is providing drugs, medical equipment and other essential supplies to hospitals and clinics. Our second &pound;3 million contribution will finance the operation, maintenance and repair of water, sanitation and electricity services in Gaza and the West Bank. The UK will also make a third contribution to pay allowances to the poorest Palestinian government workers, including teachers, who have suffered a severe loss in income over recent months. This is on top of the UK's share of European Community funding through the TIM, which amounts to a further &pound;9 million approximately.</p>
	<p pid="d.159W.5/3">The European Commission has established a team in Jerusalem to manage the implementation of the TIM. Along with several EU member states, we have seconded expertise to this team.</p>

	<p pid="d.162W.3/1">Since 2001 much of the Government's expenditure related to areas highlighted in the question has been managed through the joint DFID, FCO and MOD conflict prevention pools; the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP) and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP). Both pools receive technical support from the Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU). The PCRU is also a tri-departmental unit involving DFID, the FCO and MOD. The PCRU enables UK Government Departments and the military to work together to support countries emerging from conflict. It provides skilled civilian staff to help kick-start post-conflict recovery. It does not provide funds.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/2">The pools support projects to improve the effectiveness of UK and international support for conflict prevention, through addressing long-term structural causes of conflict, managing regional and national tension and violence, and supporting post-conflict reconstruction where the UK can make a significant contribution, in particular Africa, Asia, the Balkans and the middle east.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/3">Given these arrangements, providing a detailed break down of DFID contributions in the areas (a) to (e) would be difficult and would incur disproportionate costs. Further, they would effectively be limited to administrative costs incurred by DFID in fulfilling its management and oversight obligations. The overall pools budgets for the financial year 2006-07 are provided as follows for information.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.162W.3/6"> <td><i> Pool</i></td> <td><i> Overall pools budgets  (&pound; million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.162W.3/7"> <td>The Global Conflict Prevention Pool</td> <td>74</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.162W.3/8"> <td>Africa Conflict Prevention Pool</td> <td>63.5</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/11">Allocations for 2007-08 for both the GCPP and the ACPP have yet to be agreed and as both are currently being assessed as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review it is difficult to provide forward figures for the financial years 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/12">The Conflict Prevention Pools also fund the UK's contributions to the cost of international peacekeeping (d). In financial year 2006-07 up to &pound;373.3 million has been made available to cover such costs. Due to the unpredictable nature of conflict and post-conflict situations, the funding for peacekeeping missions is determined on an annual basis and as such it is not possible to provide forward estimates for the financial years 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/13">In some cases DFID provides earmarked funds to the areas in question directly through our country programmes. Where this is the case, and where it is possible to break the expenditure down according to categories (a) to (e) in the question, such expenditure is reported as follows by country. In some cases it is difficult to disaggregate funds in the manner requested. Where this is the case an overall expenditure figure is provided.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/14" class="italic"> Afghanistan</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/15">DFID will disburse approximately &pound;102 million in bilateral assistance to Afghanistan in 2006-07. The forecast expenditure for 2007-08 is &pound;113 million. There are not yet forecast figures for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/16">The focus of this aid is on three areas (i) livelihoods, (ii) rural assistance and (iii) state- building; the latter comprising roughly 10 per cent. of annual expenditure. State-building expenditure supports efforts to increase Government capacity in order for the Afghan Government to meet its commitments outlined in the Interim Afghan National Development Strategy and Afghan Compact, both of which were signed at the London Conference in January 2006. DFID Afghanistan does not fund directly areas (b), (c), (d) or (e) outlined in the question. However through DFIDs' partnership arrangements with UN agencies, international financing institutions and civil society organisation funding does indirectly address areas (b), (d) and (e). Disaggregated figures are not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/17" class="italic"> Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/18">DFID has supported a number of initiatives in the DRC aimed at building the capacity of the transition Government in support of the reforms outlined in the peace agreement. This has been achieved by building capacity in the ministries and transition institutions to bring about the first democratic election in DRC which was the centre piece of the global and inclusive accords. Support has totalled some &pound;4.5 million. This includes:</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/29">The vast majority of DFID DRC's contributions to humanitarian assistance are channelled through the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund. The DFID contribution to this fund for this financial year (2006-07) is &pound;1.8 million. The proposed contribution for the next financial year (2007-08) is &pound;0.9 million. Beyond this it is difficult to provide figures, though we are likely to continue to support the fund. Based on disbursements to date, approximately 6 per cent. of the funds have been allocated to the return and reintegration of refugees.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/30" class="italic"> Iraq</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/31">DFID's &pound;45 million Iraq programme for 2006-07 focuses on economic reform; infrastructure; improving power and water services in the south; governance and institution building in Baghdad and the south; and support for civil society and political participation. Projects relevant to the question include the Governorate Capacity Building Project (&pound;20.5 million over three years), support to the centre of Government Programme (&pound;13.25 million over two years) and support to the Political Participation Fund (&pound;5 million over two years).</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/32">DFID also continues to work through the international system, as a member of the donor core group, and as a major contributor to the UN and World Bank Trust Funds for Iraq. DFID is working with the Iraqi Government, the UN, the World Bank, the US and other donors to achieve a more coordinated and Iraqi-led reconstruction and development effort.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/33" class="italic"> Somalia</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/34">On (a), DFID's current efforts are focused on supporting the re-establishment of law and order institutions in Somalia. We plan to commit &pound;620,000 to the UNDP Rule of Law and Security programme in 2006-07. Much of this programme is focused on Somaliland and Puntland, as both are more stable regions with relatively better established institutions. Within the framework of the transitional federal charter for Somalia, DFID is directing its efforts at the establishment of inclusive safety, security and access to justice institutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/35">On (b), DFID has committed &pound;800,000 to UNHCR to support the integration and settlement of internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees. However in the long term, safe return on a larger scale depends on satisfactory resolution of the circumstances that have driven people from their homes in the first place. Our efforts in the meantime are directed to helping to achieve these conditions, for example by providing support to the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/36" class="italic"> Sudan</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/37">Sudan's framework for this financial year and next is &pound;109.8 million. A substantial element of these funds will be used to support most of the activities listed in the question over the next three years, but given the need for rapid and flexible response in post-conflict countries, it is not possible to state with any certainty how much will be allocated to each sector. However, no DFID funding is used for (e).</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/38" class="italic"> Central funding to specialised UN Agencies</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/39">DFID has so far contributed an estimated &pound;26 million to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) this financial year (2006-07). Within this total, DFID contributed &pound;875,000 to support the successful return of 370,000 Liberian IDPs and &pound;1 million in DRC to support their work with IDP returns in that country.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.3/40">A large amount of the funding to UNHCR is un-earmarked (&pound;17 million) to allow UNHCR flexibility over use of funds according to the greatest need among their programmes. We are therefore unable to specify with certainty what DFID funds have been used for returns programmes. It is difficult to predict how much funding will be needed in the international community for the safe return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees in future years as it is difficult to predict the resolution of crises that have forced people to flee their homes in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="d.165W.5/1">Reform of Romania's child welfare system was a priority for the European Community's Phare pre-accession programme over the period 1999 to 2003. The &quot;Children First&quot; programme was launched with a &euro;25 million financial allocation for Child Protection provided under the Phare 1999 programme. Resources of &euro;10 million in 2001, &euro;13 million in 2002 and &euro;11.5 million in 2003 (out of a total of &euro;248.9 million, &euro;265.5 million and &euro;265.5 million respectively for Phare's Romania allocations) were committed to support local authorities to make the transition from old style residential care facilities to providing a range of child protection services including foster care.

	<p pid="d.166W.0/1">To a large extent DFID relies on the UN organisations, including the World Food Programme (WFP), working in the North Caucasus to provide information on the humanitarian situation in Chechnya. An independent, comprehensive assessment of food security and nutrition in Chechnya and Ingushetia, commissioned by the WFP, is due to report later this month. Informed by a large number of household surveys, this will cover food security, nutrition, health services, shelter and economic activity in both republics.

However, at this sensitive time, when Somali parties are in talks under the auspices of the League of Arab States, any military activity by internal or external forces, which could undermine the Khartoum process or bring further suffering to the Somali people, is highly undesirable. Conflict kills, injures and displaces innocent civilians and results inevitably in calls for humanitarian relief which would be better put to rebuilding Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="d.166W.6/1">The White Paper on International Development published this year sets out the UK commitment to increase aid to 0.7 per cent. of gross national income by 2013. It describes how DFID aims to improve aid effectiveness by supporting partner country ownership of development and by working more closely with other donors.</p>
	<p pid="d.166W.6/2">DFID has already worked with other donors to increase cooperation at a country level in Tanzania and Zambia, and is currently working with the Government and other donors to improve working arrangements in Uganda.

	<p pid="d.166W.6/4">Achievement of White Paper objectives also requires that donors act and provide funds in ways that simplify aid delivery to meet the needs of partner countries and that the performance by the UN, World Bank and regional development banks is improved. DFID is working with other donors to reform the support to the UN by pooling funds at country levels, and is pushing for a stronger role for the OECD DAC to monitor and hold donors, countries, multi-laterals and the UN to account on meeting their commitments.</p>

	<p pid="d.167W.5/1">The Darfur Peace Agreement, signed in Abuja on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May</phrase> this year, is a good deal for the people of Darfur. It gives them a greater say in Government in both Darfur and Khartoum, and also grants Darfur a share of the national wealth, including funds to rebuild and develop the region. Most importantly it includes enhanced ceasefire and security arrangements aimed at restoring peace and security to the region.</p>
	<p pid="d.167W.5/2">But insufficient progress has been made on implementing the Agreement, largely because a number of the rebel groups are yet to sign up to it. We are pressing them to do so, including through a diplomatic initiative with the EU, US and others on the ground in Darfur. The Government of Sudan must also fulfil its commitments, particularly on disarming the Janjaweed, as must Minni Minnawi, the only rebel leader to have signed the deal. We are encouraging both the Government of Sudan and Minni Minnawi to reach out to the non-signatories to bring them on board.</p>

	<p pid="d.168W.5/1">The UK Government are immensely concerned about the attacks on aid workers in Darfur since July. We have made it clear to all parties that the fighting must stop and that any attempts to hinder the humanitarian effort are unacceptable. The situation is precarious and has the potential to deteriorate very rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="d.168W.5/2">Because of the rise in attacks, aid agencies have resorted to working remotely from regional centres and using commercial vehicles. This means that programmes are likely to be less effective as specialist staff are not on site. Having fewer international staff near the most vulnerable people increases the likelihood of attacks against them. The reduced presence of specialist health care means that any outbreak of disease, such as cholera could have potentially devastating consequences. We are discussing with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) the possibility of further support to their security and co-ordination role, and we are looking at funding additional security training for our NGO partners.</p>

	<p pid="d.170W.2/1">DFID allocated &pound;75 million for emergency relief and &pound;65 million for recovery and reconstruction to help communities affected by the Indian ocean tsunami of December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/2">DFID emergency relief projects have ended. They were evaluated in late 2005 and the conclusions are in 'Report on DFID's response to the Indian Ocean Disaster', copies of which are in the Libraries of the House and on the DFID website. The report found that DFID's response was broadly successful, that support to UN agencies filled critical gaps in the relief effort, but that DFID needed to be more aware of weaknesses within the agencies.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/3">Most recovery and reconstruction programmes are ongoing. Internal DFID assessments or independent evaluations are routinely used to monitor progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/4">In Indonesia, DFID has committed &pound;25.6 million so far to recovery and reconstruction:</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/5" class="indent">a contribution of $10 million (&pound;5,511,571) to the Multi-Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) in support of the Government of Indonesia's priorities for reconstruction. The MDF funds 16 projects, helping the recovery of communities, infrastructure and transport, capacity building and governance, and sustainable management of the environment. DFID rated the MDF top for both purpose and output in an annual review in August. In the past eight months, two independent evaluations of MDF have been conducted and a third is in progress;</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/6" class="indent">a recent contribution of &pound;6 million to the World Bank's Support for Poor and Disadvantaged areas (SPADA) programme for Aceh for access to justice, improved regulation of private sector investment and better targeting of assistance. It is too early to assess;</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/7" class="indent">&pound;10 million for the livelihoods component of UNDP's Emergency Response and Transitional Recovery (ERTR) programme enabling over 50,000 people to re-engage in income generation activities. An independent evaluation in March judged that ERTR had successfully mobilised funds for reconstruction. DFID's annual review in August concluded that ERTR was achieving its purpose;</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/8" class="indent">a number of smaller initiatives to improve transparency in the management of reconstruction funds, build capacity of local governments and other agencies involved in reconstruction, and help consolidate peace in Aceh. All are covered by routine internal monitoring, the largest (&pound;3 million) is currently being reviewed, and a review in May of the second largest (&pound;0.6 million) concluded that the project was running well.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/9">In Sri Lanka, DFID has committed &pound;2.8 million to improve management of recovery and reconstruction: &pound;1.3 million to the Reconstruction and Development Authority and &pound;1.5 million to the North East Provincial Council. Limited capacity within local and central Government to manage and co-ordinate activities means assistance has been slow to reach some communities or has arrived in insufficient quantity. Furthermore, conflict in parts of Sri Lanka has limited access. Overall, the recovery programme is making progress and much has already been achieved; for example, the fishing industry, which lost over 15,000 fishing boats and on which communities rely, is expected to have recovered to pre-tsunami levels by the end of this year. These shortcomings, as well as progress, are monitored by DFID and are consistent with the findings of most evaluations.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/10">In India, DFID has committed &pound;3 million to a recovery and reconstruction programme co-ordinated by the UN for social equity, restoration of livelihoods, shelter, ecosystem restoration, HIV/AIDS, disaster preparedness, and programme management. DFID are currently undertaking an annual review of progress.</p>

	<p pid="d.172W.5/1">The Government of Uganda has developed an Emergency Action Plan, which is intended to improve the humanitarian situation over a six month period, and it has also recently circulated a draft peace recovery and development plan covering a three year period. Both plans include the resettlement of internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p pid="d.172W.5/2">Donors (including DFID) and UN agencies continue to have extensive discussions with the Government of Uganda on the details of these plans, including resettlement. We greatly welcome the fact that it is possible for people to return home, and donors have made it clear to the Government that we are willing to provide assistance to help ensure that this is successful. In our discussions with the Government, however, we do continue to stress the importance of ensuring that resettlement is voluntary, and done in full consultation with displaced people themselves.</p>

	<p pid="d.173W.2/1">By 2004, 15 years of civil conflict in Liberia had dispersed some 350,000 Liberian refugees across West Africa. About one third, 117,000, returned to Liberia spontaneously through 2004 and 2005 after the peace agreement and deployment of UN peacekeepers. Following elections in October 2005 and the improving prospects for peace and recovery, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) began actively promoting and assisting voluntary repatriation from camps and communities in neighbouring countries. Up to July 2006, 71,000 refugees were assisted to return home, leaving a residual case load of 162,000, of whom 38,000 are in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, mainly integrated with local communities, rather than living in camps. While the rate of return this year has been initially slower than forecast, it is expected to accelerate markedly with the approaching end of the agricultural season and continued investment in basic services in Liberian home communities. UNHCR predict that 70 per cent. of the remaining refugees will have returned home by June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.173W.2/2">The closure of the transit centre in Tabou, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, is a positive move. It had housed 2,400 refugees for several years, though it was designed as a temporary shelter for arriving asylum seekers. Its closure, made possible by the residents finding alternative living and livelihood arrangements in local communities, is good for their dignity and well-being, and signifies the diminished likelihood of further influxes of refugees.</p>
	<p pid="d.173W.2/3">Between 2002 and 2005, DFID provided about &pound;1 million p.a. to support the care and maintenance of Liberian refugees in camps across the region. DFID has also invested significantly in Liberia over the last three years to encourage and assist refugees to return home. &pound;3.5 million p.a. has been allocated to support the restoration of basic infrastructure and services (health, water, sanitation, shelter, education) as well as boosting livelihood prospects. In addition, in 2005 and 2006, DFID has provided &pound;2 million to UNHCR to support the voluntary repatriation of refugees from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ghana.</p>

	<p pid="d.184W.8/2">All applications for the MOD Iraq medal are processed, on an individual application basis, by the Ministry of Defence Medal Office which is part of the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency. Initially there were delays in issuing the Iraq medal, mainly due to the huge demand for it, but also because this coincided with the integration of the Department's individual service medal offices into one tri-service medal office. Currently, applications for the MOD Iraq medal are generally turned around within a period of six weeks.</p>

In specifying the new system, it was agreed by experts in the Equipment Capability Customer area and the Service front line Commands (including RAF aircrew) that a voice capability was not required. The decision was taken because it was assessed that a voice requirement would not enhance peacetime search capability, and could potentially (for example by reducing battery life) reduce the effectiveness of the system.</p>

	<p pid="d.191W.9/1">Where land contamination is being considered under the Town and Country Planning regime, it is recommended that guidance from the former Interdepartmental Committee on the Redevelopment of Contaminated Land and from the Health and Safety Executive, should be taken into account. Appropriate health protection professionals in local authorities, the Health Protection Agency, the Food Standards Agency and the Health and Safety Executive may also be consulted regarding the assessment of potential risks to human health from asbestos exposure. I understand this has been the case at Spodden Valley.</p>
	<p pid="d.191W.9/2">The Environment Agency has made asbestos a priority substance for review as part of its work on developing technical guidance for assessing risks to human health from land contamination. It is working with the Health Protection Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and the Health and Safety Laboratory to further understand the toxicology and behaviour of asbestos in soils. This work will help in developing a toxicological report in the Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment series, and more detailed qualitative risk assessment guidance. This material will support decision-making under part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (&quot;Contaminated Land&quot;), and in connection with planning applications on land affected by asbestos contamination; both of which entail risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.191W.9/3">Reports were commissioned from Atkins by the local authority in connection with their decision on the planning application. They were not intended for submission to my Department, but copies have been provided to the agencies working with the council on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="d.195W.9/1">Process Guidance Note 5/2 (04) did not specify major pollution control improvements for existing crematoria, beyond those contained in previous versions of the guidance issued in 1995 and 1991. It did, however, specify that new crematoria should have equipment fitted to abate mercury emissions.</p>
	<p pid="d.195W.9/2">Following two written consultations (available on the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/closed.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/closed.htm</a>), an amendment to Process Guidance Note 5/2 (04) was issued in January 2005 which specified that 50 per cent. of all cremations at existing crematoria should be subject to mercury abatement by the end of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="d.195W.9/3">The consultation papers estimated that the cost of fitting mercury abating equipment to all crematoria would be likely to increase cremation fees by &pound;55 per cremation. Since the decision was to apply this to only 50 per cent. of cremations, using an innovative 'burden sharing' approach to regulation, it is estimated that the increase should be in the region of &pound;25 to &pound;30. To put this into perspective; figures from the Office of Fair Trading in 2001 put the average cost of a cremation funeral at &pound;1,215 and &pound;2,048 for a burial.</p>

	<p pid="d.199W.3/1">The fuel prices in Table 12 of the Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings 2005 are derived from information produced at six-monthly intervals by Salkent (now Sutherland's Tables). The data given for different regions of the UK are weighted according to the population of the region, and the price of each fuel is averaged over a three-year period (to smooth the effect of short-term variations).</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.3/2">The prices in Table 12 are updated when a new edition of Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is prepared. The calculation of the SAP rating includes a deflator term to adjust for general inflation in fuel prices, thus an increase in price of say 10 per cent. in all fuels would have no effect on the SAP ratings following recalculation of the prices and the deflator term.</p>

	<p pid="d.200W.3/39">Prior to 2004-05 the flood risk management function of the Agency was funded primarily through a combination of grant from Defra for specific projects and levies on local authorities. The latter, which were largely supported by Revenue Support Grant from the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, are not included in the table. Both forms of funding were largely replaced by grant in aid from Defra from 2004-05 onwards.</p>

	<p pid="d.216W.11/1">Under EU law, products or individual ingredients are exempted from carrying a genetically modified (GM) label if they have an adventitious or technically unavoidable GM presence below 0.9 per cent. This provision must be interpreted in the wider context of the EU legislation on the authorisation of GM products, which clearly foresees farmers being able to choose whether to cultivate conventional, organic or approved GM crops. In the coexistence context, measures can therefore be imposed to minimise unwanted GM presence in non-GM crops, but they must not make it disproportionately difficult to grow authorised GM varieties.</p>

	<p pid="d.218W.11/1">There are several diseases that affect the horse chestnut, of which the most serious is known from its symptoms as &quot;bleeding canker&quot;. Bleeding canker can have a number of causes, but the recent upsurge in prevalence of the disease appears to be associated with a bacterium (Pseudomonas syringae) although this has yet to be fully confirmed by the scientists working on it. The increase in disease has been noted in France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands as well as Britain. Research into it is being led by scientists in the Netherlands. Though not necessarily fatal to infected trees, this is a widespread and serious disease. In common with other European countries, we are studying it to learn more about its origins, its impacts, and whether there are methods by which owners of trees could prevent or control infection.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.11/2">We are also monitoring an insect pest, the horse chestnut leaf miner, which is present in southern Britain. This moth has spread across Europe since the late 1970s and appeared in Britain in 2002. Its larvae feed inside leaves with heavy infestations causing shrivelling and falling of leaves. We have no reports from Britain, or elsewhere, that it causes fatal damage on its own. As with bleeding canker, our scientists are in close touch with colleagues across Europe who are investigating this pest.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.11/3">Advice to tree and woodland owners and managers on these and other pests and diseases is available on the Forestry Commission's Forest Research website <a href="http://www.forestresearch.gov.uk">http://www.forestresearch.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="d.221W.12/1">Recycling continues to play an important role in diverting waste from landfill and recovering value from waste, in line with the Government's waste strategy objectives.</p>
	<p pid="d.221W.12/2">Household waste recycling and composting has doubled in the last four years since the publication of Waste Strategy 2000 (and tripled in the last eight years). In 1999, less than 11 per cent. of household waste was recycled; this now stands at 23 per cent. (2004-5), putting us well on course to meet the waste strategy targets of 25 per cent. by 2005-06 and 33 per cent. by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="d.221W.12/3">The recent consultation on the review of the waste strategy included proposals to raise the national targets for household waste recycling and composting to even more ambitious levels, to reach 45 per cent. by 2015 and 50 per cent. by 2020. The revised waste strategy is due to be published this winter.</p>

	<p pid="d.223W.0/1">The primary responsibility for maintenance of all watercourses rests with the relevant riparian owner (a landowner with a frontage along a watercourse).</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.0/2">In England, the Environment Agency (EA) is the principal flood risk management operating authority with permissive powers for the maintenance of watercourses designated as 'main river'. The EA has assumed responsibility for some 1,800 additional watercourse lengths transferred from other operating authorities over the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.0/3">Defra is providing 413 million in grant in aid this year to fund the EA's flood risk management activities, which includes capital improvement projects, maintenance and operation of existing infrastructure, and associated activities such as flood warning and public awareness campaigns. The EA will also spend &pound;53.7 million received from local levy, Internal Drainage Board charges, General Drainage Charges and other income. This figure includes &pound;8.7 million planned use of balances. The total funding for 2006-07 is &pound;466.7 million. This is targeted according to flood risk, rather than whether a watercourse is in an urban or rural area.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.0/4">The EA uses the National Flood and Coastal Defence Database (NFCDD) to monitor the condition of assets, and reviews progress on a quarterly basis. A nationally consistent method of classifying asset condition has been shared with other operating authorities. These other operating authorities are required to use NFCDD to record details of the assets that they manage.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.0/5">Expenditure on the maintenance of watercourses is not held centrally and we could not seek to gather this information without incurring disproportionate cost. It is also the case that maintenance and capital works are not generally classified by rural or urban location and often the distinction will not be clear.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.0/6">Economic considerations are integral to the implementation of the Water Framework directive, for which the EA is the competent authority in England and Wales. This explicitly requires economic considerations and social issues to be considered and taken into account when setting water management objectives. The Collaborative Research Programme is developing methodologies for ensuring a balance between the environmental, social and economic concerns during river basin planning decisions which are part of the Framework.</p>
	<p pid="d.223W.0/7">'Making Space for Water', our new cross-Government strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management, presents an approach that embeds the three pillars of sustainable development, and extends our risk management tools by expanding our flood warning and flood awareness activities. The strategy encourages measures to improve resistance and resilience to flooding, including scoping work on the development and delivery of a pilot on direct aid to individuals. The document is available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environ/fcd/policy/strategv.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environ/fcd/policy/strategv.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="d.226W.2/1">A number of reports have been commissioned by English Nature to look at the ways in which increased access and disturbance may have affected sensitive species of breeding birds within special protection areas. The cumulative effect of these reports is to show that the impacts from increased access and recreational activities vary between species, habitats and areas. It was also recognised that it is still too early to be able to quantify these impacts on habitats.</p>
	<p pid="d.226W.2/2">Although there are concerns about the recreational impacts on breeding and wintering bird populations, it is not yet known whether the access provisions within the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 have led to, or will cause, adverse affects on special protection areas. Further research and monitoring is required to provide a clear assessment of the overall effect of the increased level of access and disturbance in special protection areas which were previously considered not to be at risk.</p>

	<p pid="d.226W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-22">22 September</phrase>, my noble Friend the Minister for Sustainable Farming and Food announced the detail of how almost &pound;500 million of additional support arising from the sugar reform will be incorporated within the English model of the single payment scheme (SPS) over the next seven years. In particular, he confirmed that special arrangements will apply so that, among other things, all the support available in 2006 will be added to the value of entitlements held by UK growers on the basis of their contracted tonnage for quota sugar, for the 2005-06 marketing year. Individual business decisions will determine whether those concerned retain their entitlements or grow sugar beet in subsequent years. It is not, therefore, possible to make meaningful estimates of the sort the hon. Member asks about.</p>

	<p pid="d.236W.3/2">The A36 is part of 'non core' network and caters more for regional and local needs. It is in the process of being de-trunked (i.e. management transferred to the local highway authorities). Until it has been detrunked, the Highways Agency retains responsibility for its maintenance and any safety improvements it. Any other improvements in the Salisbury area would need to be promoted by Wiltshire county council.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.3/3">If Wiltshire county council decided to promote such a scheme, the South West region would need to determine its position within their priorities for major transport infrastructure within a specified regional funding allocation (RFA). The Secretary of State would then consider the advice in light of available funding.</p>

	<p pid="d.258W.8/1">The Department's objective is to encourage and assist people to drive within the posted speed limit at all times. The purpose of deploying speed cameras is to further encourage them to do so at locations where excessive speed is a known danger. Consistent with this aim, cameras operating within the National Safety Camera Programme are required to meet strict visibility and conspicuity rules in order to enhance their deterrent effect.</p>
	<p pid="d.258W.8/2">No assessment has been made of the potential for speed cameras and speed camera warning signs to cause drivers to reduce speed recklessly when seen. We are aware that some speeding drivers check or reduce their speed on the approach to camera sites. However there is no evidence that this is done recklessly. Neither is there evidence that this is a cause of accidents. In any case, drivers who comply with the posted speed limit should not need to reduce their speed when they see a speed camera or camera warning sign.</p>

	<p pid="d.264W.6/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.6/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the (a) wage for (i) full-time male, (ii) full-time female, (iii) part time male and (iv) part time female employees and (b) average household income for working age households was in City of York council area in (1) cash and (2) constant price terms in each of the last 10 years. I am replying in her absence. (88725).</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.6/4" class="indent">Currently average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work. I have attached tables containing statistics on earnings from the ASHE for the years 1997-2005 which are all that is available. The second table shows these earnings statistics expressed in 2005 prices by using the Retail Price Index (RPI).</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.6/5" class="indent">Average household income for working age households by council area is not available. Household income statistics for all households in the UK, based on the Family Resources Survey, are produced by the Department of Work and Pensions. Additionally the Office for National Statistics has produced statistics for wards for 2001-02 only. These estimates are based on a statistical model and are experimental statistics - they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but are not accredited as National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.6/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

An x has been given for estimates with a CV of greater than 20 percent.  <i> Note:</i><i> </i>The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 percent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data. <i> Source:</i> Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, Office for National Statistics.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.280W.3/1">The UK oils strategy, announced in 2001, introduced a number of measures designed to tackle all types of oils fraud including laundering and smuggling. These measures included the introduction of the registered dealers in controlled oils scheme, enhanced law enforcement activity and the creation of a specialist intelligence function. Further details on the UK oils strategy can be found on the HMRC website <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.280W.3/2">Oils fraud forms a profitable criminal enterprise in Northern Ireland, with the proceeds often used to fund other forms of serious crime. It undermines legitimate fuel retailers, and has a debilitating effect on respect for the law by encouraging members of the public into participating in an illicit activity. The latest estimates of revenue loss in the hydrocarbon oils sector are published in &quot;Measuring Indirect Tax Loss-2005&quot;, which was published alongside the PBR. All estimates for Northern Ireland relate to total non-UK duty paid consumption rather than the illicit market. This is because it is not yet possible to split revenue losses between those resulting from the illicit market and those from legitimate cross-border shopping.</p>

The ethnic group question did not contain a separate tick-box response category for 'Kurdish', therefore the count is based on those who wrote in 'Kurd' or 'Kurdish' in the space provided for other ethnic groups. It may underestimate the total Kurdish population, because questions requiring a written response are more likely to be left blank than those with a tick-box.</p>

	<p pid="d.287W.6/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.287W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.287W.6/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the mortality rate amongst a) men and b) women has been in each year since 1976, broken down by socio-economic group. I am replying in her absence. (92032)</p>
	<p pid="d.287W.6/4" class="indent">Before 2001 ONS reported on socio-economic variations in mortality using the Registrar General's social class classification (based on occupation of the deceased). Mortality rates by social class have been published by ONS using data from annual death registrations, and population figures from the decennial census. As populations by social class are only available every ten years, mortality rates based on them cannot be calculated every year. Rates for the periods 1970-1972, 1979-1983 and 1991-1993, were published in a table in the ONS Decennial Supplement, Health Inequalities, which is shown in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="d.287W.6/5" class="indent">Rates are reported only for men, as over half of deaths of women could not be classified to a social class using their own occupation. As the rates are based on occupations recorded in two different data sources (at death registration and in the census) there was also the potential that differences between the two could affect the results. This potential 'numerator/denominator bias' has been limited by restricting analysis to men aged 20-64.</p>
	<p pid="d.287W.6/6" class="indent">From 2001 onwards the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) has replaced social class as the classification used by ONS to routinely report socio-economic status. NS-SEC was also used to code results from the 2001 Census. ONS has not yet published mortality rates by NS-SEC.</p>

	<p pid="d.303W.9/2">Estimates for the level of losses due to VAT fraud are not available. However, estimates of the VAT gap, which includes losses due to fraud and avoidance, are available in the paper 'Measuring and Tackling Tax Losses-2005', published in December 2005. A copy of this paper can be obtained from the House Library.</p>

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has committed significant additional resources to strengthen its strategy for tackling MTIC fraud, and there are now over 1400 staff engaged in that work.</p>
	<p pid="d.304W.2/2">In recent months, the level of VAT repayment claims from those suspected of trading in supply chains associated with MTIC fraud has risen considerably without known economic or commercial reasons. It is therefore only right that HMRC continues to take all necessary and proportionate steps to protect the tax base and satisfy itself that these repayment claims are valid.</p>

	<p pid="d.309W.3/2">As part of the Northern Ireland Improvement Plan we are considering and pursuing several options for the recovery of debt, this includes improved use of enforcement powers and the outsourcing of debt collection via the Department to debt collection experts. In addition, a dedicated team has been set up to deal with non-compliance and the early results of this work indicate an increase in the number of agreements to pay.</p>

	<p pid="d.310W.2/1">The Government remain committed to ensuring that children and young people are involved in decisions that affect their lives. Our aim is to embed a culture of engaging with children and young people. Since the announcement by Lord Rooker we have been consulting with a range of organisations with expertise in children's participation on how best to deliver on that aim. We have had a series of meetings with children and young people, including those who traditionally have been harder-to-reach. I hope to be able to make a fuller statement on these matters in the next few weeks.</p>

	<p pid="d.312W.6/1">Recorded crime statistics are produced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in line with Home Office Counting rules and are broadly comparable with those supplied by police forces in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.312W.6/2">Information on crime levels and public attitudes to crime is gathered through the Northern Ireland Crime Survey (NICS), run by NISRA central survey unit on behalf of the Northern Ireland Office. The survey is also the main vehicle by which the Department is able to (1) identify those most at risk from different types of crime, (2) examine people's attitudes to crime and (3) measure confidence in the police and the wider criminal justice system. By examining crime reporting levels in Northern Ireland the survey also offers comparisons to reporting levels in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.312W.6/3">Results from the Northern Ireland Crime Survey (2003-04&mdash;the last full year for which results are available) showed that 45 per cent. of comparable crimes were reported to the police. This is broadly similar to England and Wales where the British Crime Survey (2003-04) stated that 42 per cent. of such crimes were reported to the police for the same period. Due to its sample size, the NICS cannot be used to produce sufficiently robust crime reporting data to facilitate analysis at district command unit level.</p>
	<p pid="d.312W.6/4">The Northern Ireland Crime Survey also examines reasons for not reporting crime in Northern Ireland. In the most recent survey, only 1 per cent. of respondents who did not report crime gave the reason 'dislike/fear the police', while the most common reasons were 'too trivial/no loss' (33 per cent.), 'police could not have done anything' (32 per cent.) and 'police would not have been bothered/been interested' (24 per cent.).</p>

This situation is equally applicable to the other types of operations listed in the question.

	<p pid="d.325W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Discussions have been on-going for several months between the SEELB and South &amp; East Belfast Trust regarding appropriate educational provision for children receiving treatment at The Child and Family Centre based at Forster Green. These discussions have also included consideration of proposals from the Trust for a new facility on the site which would make provision for children and young people up to the age of 18 years. The meetings have included representation from the Trust, the Education &amp; Training Inspectorate and the school. The most recent meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-29">29 June 2006</phrase>. Further meetings are planned for August and September.</p>
	<p pid="d.325W.2/3" class="indent">Discussions are focused on:</p>

	<p pid="d.325W.2/6">As I have indicated previously, any proposal to close the school will require the SEELB to publish a Development Proposal, which initiates a 2-month public consultation period during which comments, including objections, may be submitted to the Department of Education. The Department will give full consideration to all representations made during this 2-month period, before making a decision on any such proposal.</p>

	<p pid="d.325W.5/1">The Department is working in partnership with a number of agencies to improve hate incident reporting and provide practical support to victims. A new pilot project in South Belfast will record all forms of hate incidents with the aim of collecting information on the nature and extent of hate incidents including attacks on migrant workers. The information collected through this pilot will help inform actions to reduce the incidence of violent attacks. A number of Community Safety Partnerships have also developed welcome packs for migrant workers in a range of languages which provide information on community safety issues and assist their integration into the community.</p>
	<p pid="d.325W.5/2">The Police Service of Northern Ireland has the lead role in protecting minority or vulnerable groups, including migrant workers. The PSNI recently issued a new Hate Incident policy aimed at ensuring an effective, consistent and proactive response to all hate incidents. Important new initiatives in respect of cautioning, supervision, investigation reviews and restorative cautioning have been introduced to further compliment those measures already in place.</p>
	<p pid="d.325W.5/3">In a number of areas where attacks have taken place, the PSNI continue to work with local communities, statutory and voluntary agencies to address the causes of hate incidents. This has included dialogue with local communities to break down barriers and address specific perceptions.</p>
	<p pid="d.325W.5/4">The PSNI Hate Incident and Minority Liaison Officers not only continue to support victims of hate incidents but proactively work with employers to raise important issues such as personal safety and hate incidents. Interpreters (telephone and face-to-face) are available 24/7 to ensure that non-English speakers have immediate access to the police.</p>
	<p pid="d.325W.5/5">Hate crime legislation that became law in September 2004 also includes a statutory requirement for judges to treat racial aggravation as an aggravating factor when sentencing. This gives judges greater powers in sentencing where aggravation is proven.</p>

	<p pid="d.327W.2/1">The murder of Attracta Harron was a horrific act done by Trevor Hamilton, who is now in prison for the rest of his life. None of the agency reports, or the independent case review, suggest that the actions of Hamilton could have been prevented by the agencies. Nonetheless, the arrangements for risk assessment and management of sex offenders have developed considerably since 2003 and further action has already been taken to implement all the recommendations in the agency and independent reports. I have also asked Kit Chivers, Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland to review the implementation of the recommendations and report to me by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="d.327W.2/2">I also intend to legislate in the near future to place these important multi agency public protection arrangements on a statutory footing and extend their remit to include certain serious violent offenders in addition to all sexual offenders. Both types of offenders will always be present in our communities and those who are assessed as continuing to pose a high level of risk will be targeted by the various criminal justice agencies, with the assistance of social services and others, with the aim of reducing the likelihood of harm to the public when an offender finishes his prison sentence and returns to the community.</p>
	<p pid="d.327W.2/3">I am also considering the entire sentencing framework in Northern Ireland and will be making a further statement on this later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="d.336W.5/32">The PSNI continues to attract large numbers of high calibre applicants from throughout the community. With the large number of applications to join the Police Service, the number of suitable candidates is far in excess of the finite number of trainee posts available. This means that candidates of both religious traditions and genders will sadly experience the disappointment of an unsuccessful application.</p>
	<p pid="d.336W.5/33">The latest campaign saw the highest number of applications yet, with 7,691 applicants competing for 220 places. 37 per cent. of these applications were from the Catholic community, which is the highest rate to date, and the number of female and ethnic minority applications has increased.</p>
	<p pid="d.336W.5/34">In terms of religion, the Government believe that the temporary recruitment provisions are necessary and reasonable to correct an historic imbalance in the composition of the PSNI. These exceptional measures are reviewed every three years, with the next, and hopefully final, such review due later this year. This will be subject to detailed review of the policy, extensive consultation, and debate in both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="d.336W.5/35">Catholic composition in the PSNI regulars has increased from 8.3 per cent. to 20.05 per cent. Our goal is to increase Catholic representation to 30 per cent. by 2010-11, the date envisaged by Patten. I am pleased to say that we are on track to meet this, which would not be possible if the 50:50 provisions were not in place.</p>
	<p pid="d.336W.5/36">Although our efforts have focused on the imbalance between the number of Catholics and Protestants in the composition of the Police Service, we also recognise the importance of gender and ethnic minority representation. It is notable that female composition has risen from 13 per cent. to 20.54 per cent. and the ethnic minority background composition compares favourably with the overall level of the working age ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland.</p>

A decision will shortly be taken on whether to extend the Maghaberry unit to 120 cells, in the light of continuing increases in the prison population.

	<p pid="d.344W.6/1">The Northern Ireland Departments, Northern Ireland Office and the Police Service for Northern Ireland have funded a number of projects to tackle racism and race hate crime. However, it is not possible to identify what resources have been allocated to community education and awareness activities as this forms part of a number of projects and information is not held in an appropriate format. Examples of activities that have been supported by the above agencies include campaigns, ethnic awareness events, soccer tournaments, migrant worker handbooks and DVD, information leaflets and distribution of 'Respect Difference' wrist bands.</p>

	<p pid="d.348W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland launched the Household programme on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">Monday 24 July</phrase> as the first initiative to provide funding for homes under the &pound;59 million Environment and Renewable Energy Fund (EREF). Householders are eligible to apply for assistance under this programme, which will provide up to 50 per cent. of the cost of installation of renewable energy systems, including solar hot water systems provided they own the property and it is used primarily for domestic purposes. The grant will be offered on the applicant's choice of technology on a first-come first-served basis. Applicants will need to satisfy themselves in advance that their property is suitable for their chosen technology and obtain two quotations from an approved installer. Advice is available for the schemes managing agent on both these aspects.</p>
	<p pid="d.348W.5/2">Some funding from the Household programme has been set aside to install 500 solar hot water systems in private households that are deemed to be in fuel poverty. Assistance at 100 per cent. of the cost of installation is available for these cases through the Department for Social Development. The criteria used to select homes for this assistance will be based on the eligibility criteria for the existing warm homes scheme as well as conditions relating to the suitability of the property including suitable orientation needed to benefit from the solar energy. Selection will initially be carried out by the warm homes managing agent from the database of homes that have previously received other energy-related assistance under the Warm Homes programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.348W.5/3">In addition to the Household programme, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive will receive funding of &pound;1.8 million over two years under the EREF to install 600 solar hot water panels in their stock. Installation will be applied to dwellings that are in heating conversion schemes and, again, suitability of the property, including suitable orientation, will be the key selection criteria.</p>

	<p pid="d.351W.6/1">While Government have not commissioned any research into the tourism or economic value of genealogy, the culture, arts and leisure sector make a contribution to genealogy tourism as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.6/2">The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) is a unique resource for those interested in genealogy. It holds 54 kilometres of archives, both public records and those deposited by private individuals and bodies. Some 40 per cent. of PRONI on-site users are from outside the UK and most are researching their families. The PRONI website has searchable databases that link catalogue descriptions and images of documents of genealogical value, and more such databases will be made available. PRONI is presently developing an on-line searchable catalogue&mdash;the Electronic Catalogue for Northern Ireland (eCATNI)&mdash;that will provide access to the vast quantity of catalogue descriptions, in many cases down to individual document level. In all, some &pound;1.29 million has been invested in this range of developments. Furthermore, PRONI has been in discussions with a range of genealogical interests within the broader context of the Archives Policy for Northern Ireland, an initiative intended to position archives in Northern Ireland for the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.6/3">Tourist Information Points are a feature within most branch libraries. Most Education and Library Boards hold local history collections and these routinely deal with enquiries on personal family history from visitors from both home and overseas. Boards maintain links with PRONI, regional and local museum services, and a wide range of local and family history groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.6/4">Within the Western Education Board's library service, support is provided for the Centre for Migration Studies which deals with personal family history enquiries from 5,000 annual visitors. The centre maintains links with overseas museums, Irish and family history agencies, tour companies, public library network, and US college network. It is an active member of the Association of European Migration Institutions (AEMI) and hosts the Ulster American Heritage Symposium which is held alternately in the US and Northern Ireland. The only identifiable cost is for the Centre for Migration Studies for which the Western Board receives approximately &pound;100,000 per annum. All other costs are subsumed in the overall running costs of the library service.</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.6/5">The NITB's Northern Ireland Passenger Survey identified that in 2005 11,600 visitors participated in genealogical activity during their visit and for a further 4,000 it was the actual reason for the visit (excludes visitors from/via Republic of Ireland). Numbers have grown by 71 per cent. from 2000-05 with growth mainly concentrated in the &quot;participated&quot; category. No estimate of the value of the sector to the economy is available.</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.6/6">NITB has not allocated identifiable funds to any genealogy specific projects in the past 10 years. However, a range of websites promotes access to genealogy. The NITB consumer website, <a href="http://www.discovernorthernireland.com">www. discovernorthernireland.com</a>, provides background information for potential visitors and links to 10 search organisations in Northern Ireland. Costs are subsumed in the running costs of the website. The Tourism Ireland website also carries genealogy for the island as a whole and references the Irish Genealogical Project as a link which connects to a range of suppliers both north and south.</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.6/7">NITB worked with the Ulster Scots Agency this year in producing the new NITB &quot;American Connection&quot; publication which has genealogy as one of four key themes.</p>

	<p pid="d.354W.0/1">The review of Northern Ireland trust ports completed in 1998 identified a need to improve the public accountability of the trust ports; to extend their commercial powers; and to ease existing financial controls. The Northern Ireland Assembly decided that improvements in public accountability should be put in place before commercial powers were enhanced. Legislation has now been introduced which gives the trust ports enhanced borrowing powers and which improves accountability.</p>
	<p pid="d.354W.0/2">Proposals to legislate to provide extended commercial powers had not been completed when, following a ruling by the Office of National Statistics that certain trust ports within the United Kingdom should be classified as public corporations, it became a requirement from April 2005 that trust ports in Northern Ireland should operate within the public expenditure system. Taking trust ports out of the public expenditure system would require removing the controls relating to public accountability that the Assembly had considered should be in place before extended commercial powers were granted.</p>

	<p pid="d.356W.8/1">It is inherently difficult to establish a direct correlation between open plan working and productivity due to the range of contributory factors that can affect staff performance. There is, however, an overwhelming body of qualitative evidence about the positive impact of open plan working in both public and private sector organisations which has helped inform the decision to introduce it into the Northern Ireland Civil Service. The evidence includes findings from a number of major government departments such as Her Majesty's Treasury, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. For example, in the Treasury following a move to an open plan environment absenteeism reduced by more than 40 per cent.; staff turnover reduced substantially; over 75 per cent. of staff claimed they were much more productive; and levels of stress were perceived to be significantly lower.</p>

	<p pid="d.359W.5/1">The Building Act was amended to allow Building Regulations to be made for &quot;furthering the prevention or detection of crime&quot; in 2004. Since then we have considered the most appropriate way of improving the security of buildings. We are proposing to include Security in the Code for Sustainable Homes, which will be launched later this year. This has the advantage of not taking as long to develop as a regulation, but will not be mandatory. We will monitor the take-up of the Security section of the Code, and review the need for a Building Regulation in due course.</p>

All progress is reported on the DNF website at <a href="http://www.dnf.org">www.dnf.org</a>. Recently most effort has been directed at promoting best practice to underpin the sharing of business information combined with location and to promote this across all communities (local/central Government, utilities and the private sector). This is being achieved in two ways:</p>
	<p pid="d.365W.6/3" class="indent">(1) The publication of case studies showing the benefits of joined up information (examples from Oxford county council, Dudley metropolitan borough council and the Isle of Wight council are now available on the DNF website).</p>

The Technical Guides reflect best practice adopted in the case studies and elsewhere, and are intended for reuse by others so that they too can benefit from sound information management, data integrity and are more readily able to share information with other organisations.</p>

	<p pid="d.366W.2/2">Where repairs or improvements are proposed under the terms of a management scheme the owner will benefit from any resulting increase in the value of the property on expiry of the order. A third party with an interest in a dwelling may be entitled to compensation resulting from any loss they suffer as a result of the making of an Empty Dwelling Management Order.</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/3">The level of compensation in cases where domestic property is acquired compulsorily is a matter of negotiation between the acquiring local authority and the claimant. Where a local authority acquires land compulsorily, it will have an obligation to pay compensation to those legally entitled to claim it. The level of compensation will be in accordance with a number of principles established under statute, case law and guidance, often described as the &quot;Compensation Code.&quot; The open market value of the property acquired, disregarding the impact of the scheme, will form the basis of any award. The claimant may also be entitled to compensation for disturbance costs (removal expenses, fees etc.) and a Home Loss payment. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 introduced new provisions about valuation principles, introduced other kinds of loss payments and allowed an advance payment of mortgage in appropriate circumstances.</p>

The homes will be developed on sixteen publicly owned brownfield sites including one provided by the London Development Agency and the initiative is expected to deliver over 4,500 homes over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="d.370W.2/2">It is too early to provide precise figures across the portfolio of sites because in the majority of cases planning consents, planning agreements and community consultations have yet to be concluded. Estimates show that overall the scheme has the potential to deliver about 1600 market homes, over 2000 low cost home ownership homes and up to 1000 social rented homes. At this stage there are no plans to include sub-market rented homes in the programme. The first of the sixteen sites, Adelaide Wharf in Hackney, is now under construction. Planning consent on schemes in Wandsworth and Croydon has now been granted with work having started or due to start shortly. A rolling programme of planning consents and starts on sites is planned for 2007 and 2008 for the remaining sites.</p>

	<p pid="d.371W.0/1">Fire and rescue authorities in England are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an Integrated Risk Management Plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. It is, therefore, for each fire and rescue authority to determine appropriate fire cover in its area including the number of fire appliances sent to an educational establishment in response to an automatic fire alarm alone or a 999 call.</p>
	<p pid="d.371W.0/2">Decisions on operational proposals are made by the elected members of the authority concerned. They are best placed to act on the professional advice of principal officers and to balance the competing local demands on available resources for the benefits of the communities they serve.</p>

We will promote the voluntary take up of HCRs, and have allocated &pound;4 million to support their take up and testing of Home Information Packs. Therefore Home Inspectors will still be needed and job opportunities for Home Inspectors remain for those who have undertaken training. Moreover, the introduction of Energy Performance Certificates for the private rented properties will further enhance these opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="d.385W.9/1">The home condition report (HCR) will be based on a mid range inspection, similar to the homebuyers survey currently available on the market. home inspectors will be required to complete the HCR in accordance with the inspection and reporting requirements published by the Department of Communities and Local Government on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-14">14 June 2006</phrase>. Home inspectors will decide condition ratings by applying their knowledge of building construction and should only recommend further investigation where they suspect the existence of defects that are either concealed or which cannot be identified within the scope of a visual inspection. Home inspectors will therefore be expected to reach a conclusion about defects in most cases, but where this is not possible, for example where the defect needs specialist advice, the inspector may recommend a further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="d.385W.9/2">The home inspector will report on the following:</p>
	<p pid="d.385W.9/3" class="indent">whether the property is located in an area where naturally occurring radon gas is emitted from the ground;</p>
	<p pid="d.385W.9/4" class="indent">whether it is located in a mining area;</p>

	<p pid="d.393W.5/1">The information requested is not held centrally. Estimates from the English House Condition Survey in 2003 and 2004 indicate that nationally we are ahead of trajectory towards meeting the private sector decent homes target that 70 percent. of vulnerable households in that sector are living in decent homes. Between 1996 and 2004 this targeted percentage has increased from 47 percent. to 66 percent.. The survey also shows that no regions are significantly behind the overall national position.</p>
	<p pid="d.393W.5/2">It is the responsibility of Government Offices to monitor progress in their own regions and satisfy themselves that local authorities have robust policies in place. It is a requirement for local authorities to produce housing strategies that review a wide range of housing-related issues in their areas and to establish their priorities for action including the need to meet this target.</p>

Annex 3 to the statutory code of guidance on the allocation of accommodation (issued in November 2002) provides a list of indicators for the &quot;medical and welfare&quot; reasonable preference category, including, for example, a mental illness or disorder, a physical or learning disability, and chronic or progressive medical conditions.

	<p pid="d.397W.3/2">Judgments about the need for refurbishments require a qualitative approach and are best carried out at local level. However, as part of the, DCMS funded, Framework for the Future Programme, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council commissioned a Library Buildings Survey. Responses were received from 136 of the 149 library authorities in England, representing a 91 per cent. response rate. These results, including projections for the whole sector, were published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-18">18 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.397W.3/3">The survey found that an estimated &pound;760 million is required to make all public libraries in England fit for purpose. Of this sum, &pound;130.8 million is required to address a routine maintenance backlog and &pound;73 million would be necessary to satisfy health and safety, Disability Discrimination Act (excluding reasonable alternative provisions that may be currently in place) and other building regulation requirements.</p>

	<p pid="d.400W.8/1">Information on actual employer contributions is not available. The most recent year for which data is available is 2004-05. From this it has been possible to estimate a pensionable payroll figure of &pound;24.6 billion for all Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) employers. Some 80 per cent. of this figure relates to local authorities only, and on this basis a further estimate of employers' contributions would, in 2004-05 terms, be in the range of &pound;2.4-&pound;2.6 billion in 2005-06, &pound;2.7-&pound;2.9 billion in 2006-07 and &pound;3.1-&pound;3.3 billion in 2007-08. These estimates are derived from annual returns submitted to the Department by LGPS administering authorities in England and Wales.</p>

This will set out how the Government expect participants in the planning process to work towards the reduction of carbon emissions in the location, siting and design of new development. We are also working on proposals with the aim of promoting further the take-up of microgeneartion technology by removing the need to apply for planning permission for certain types of installation. Major energy infrastructure is covered by other consent regimes reporting to the DTI rather than town and country planning. We will consult on any proposed changes in this area once the findings of the Eddington study and the Barker review are clear.</p>

	<p pid="d.405W.5/1">The Government work closely with local authorities on the regeneration of their areas. A normal condition of Government funding for regeneration projects is that an evaluation is carried out to assess whether the project's objectives have been achieved. Also that a forward strategy is prepared to show how the project will be sustained once public sector funding has ceased. It would be for the local authority to decide whether additional money should be provided from the funding that it has available for any further work it considers necessary, taking into account other regeneration priorities in the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.405W.5/2">The Government have introduced local area agreements (LAAs) to enable local authorities and their partners to use pooled funding to take a more flexible approach to delivering priorities. During the early negotiations of local area agreements, many local areas advocated the need for an extra LAA block to cover economic and regeneration issues more explicitly. This was also the view of government and the introduction of a new economic development block was announced in the 2005 budget and came into effect from April this year.</p>

The delivery plan, along with other evidence, will be considered at the Examination in Public of the South East Plan in November.

The PPG3 update 'supporting the delivery of new housing', published in January 2005, added a new paragraph to PPG3. This advocates the re-use of land allocated for industrial and commercial use, where it would be better used for housing and mixed use development unless there is a realistic prospect of the of the allocation being taken up for its stated use in the plan period or that its development for housing would undermine regional and local strategies for housing, economic development and regeneration.</p>

	<p pid="d.410W.5/1">The Department engages with a number of organisations in the Thames Gateway on design issues, including Regional Centres of Excellence, Essex Design Initiative, Kent Architecture, Urban Design London and the Greater London Authorities Architecture and Urbanism Unit. Together, these bodies have considered the existing design skills of local authorities and have in place a range of activities, including guidance and training, to address gaps.</p>
	<p pid="d.410W.5/2">DCLG is also funding specific initiatives through the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and the Academy for Sustainable Communities (ASC). CABE has established a Design Task Group for the Growth Areas, which is a learning network open to individuals in local authorities and local delivery vehicles across the four growth areas. The ASC is establishing a number of &quot;Learning Laboratories&quot; with Regional Centres of Excellence, including one with Inspire East to focus on the Thames Gateway South Essex sub region around Basildon. This will focus on auditing existing skills and identifying and addressing gaps to improve design quality in the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.410W.5/3">As in the rest of England, the majority of local authorities in the Thames Gateway now have a dedicated design champion to promote better quality design in the built environment.</p>

Figures more specific to the Gateway boundary are available for the years 2001-02 to 2004-05. Figures for the period 2005-06 will be available shortly. The Thames Gateway boundary differs from local authority boundaries as it was established to specifically include those areas that contain a high proportion of brownfield land rather than follow the administrative boundary line of the local authorities concerned. The local authority boundaries include for example house building in the rest of Kent and the rest of Essex even where those areas are not part of the Thames Gateway.</p>

Afghan-related UNODC projects which the UK supports include: the annual Afghan Opium Survey; the development of a counter narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force of judges, prosecutors and investigators; capacity building for the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan; the establishment of a high-security prison wing in Kabul; Afghan/Iranian border control; precursor chemical control; opium demand reduction; and the establishment of the Central Asian Regional Information and Co-ordination Centre.

	<p pid="d.415W.0/1">The Taliban derives economic benefits from the drugs trade at the local level. There are longstanding links between the Taliban and traffickers based on personal relationships, tribal loyalties and business interests. They share a common interest in resisting the Afghan government and coalition forces. The Taliban is also attempting to exploit the continued existence of the drugs trade to undermine the central government's authority. In the south, there was evidence earlier this year that the Taliban was encouraging farmers to grow opium poppy and resist Afghan government eradication efforts. The Taliban also received payments from traffickers. However in the north, regional warlords and drug traffickers are more likely to resist the Taliban when this would be in their interests. We continue to assess all links closely and to support Afghan efforts to disrupt these.</p>

	<p pid="d.416W.2/1">Domestic revenues have grown impressively in Afghanistan in recent years, albeit from a low base. In 2002-03 domestic revenues were only US $121 million (3.2 per cent. of GDP) but had risen to US $400 million (5.5 per cent. of GDP) by 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="d.416W.2/2">The UK has actively supported the Afghan Government's effort to raise revenues, specifically through projects in the Customs and Revenue Departments of the Ministry of Finance.

This has also been recognised by the Government of Afghanistan, which has asked the UK to act as lead donor in supporting tax reform. The reforms are an Afghan government-led process implemented by Finance Ministry officials.</p>

The UK is further assisting the Afghan Government in its prioritising of poverty and growth-related spending through technical assistance to the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance and through our contribution to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund.</p>

	<p pid="d.419W.5/1">The regulations on the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) clearly state the conditions on which the Preferences are granted. EU member states and Belarus both agreed to abide by those conditions. However, in 2004 the International Labour Organisation (ILO) concluded that the Belarusian authorities had seriously violated the basic civil liberties of trade union members and leaders. The European Commission subsequently launched its own investigation in 2005 which agreed with the ILO. It is clear Belarus has not met the standards necessary and is facing withdrawal of preferences, after a long and considered process. The Belarusians have had over two years to answer ILO and EU concerns. The decision is based on the clear criteria for GSP and does not form part of the EU sanctions introduced following the fraudulent elections earlier this year. The political implications were not therefore part of the decision making process. Nevertheless, it should send a signal that the EU is serious about the need for Belarus to honour its international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="d.421W.8/1">During President Alvaro Uribe's first four years in office, 2002-2006, his government has been actively involved in talks with the National Liberation Army, a left-wing guerrilla group. The latest round of talks took place in Cuba in April. The government's efforts to begin preliminary talks with the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia, the country's biggest illegal guerrilla group, have so far been consistently rejected.</p>
	<p pid="d.421W.8/2">The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council Conclusions of October 2005 made clear that we and other EU member states consider that the effective implementation of the Law on Justice and Peace, the legal framework covering disarmament, demobilisation and reinsertion of ex-combatants approved by the Colombian Congress in July 2005, will have a positive impact on peace-building in Colombia. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-18">18 April 2006</phrase>, the government announced the completion under this law of the formal process of paramilitary demobilisation, which saw over 30,000 paramilitaries demobilise. We urge other illegal armed groups also to engage in peace talks with the government.</p>
	<p pid="d.421W.8/3">We will continue to monitor the situation and work with our partners to help the Government of Colombia address the challenges it faces as a result of the inter- connected problems of internal armed conflict, illegal drugs trade and human rights abuses.</p>

	<p pid="d.422W.8/1">We remain in close touch with the Government of Sudan, Minni Minawi, leader of one faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement, and the African Union (AU) and are urging them to move ahead rapidly with the implementation of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.422W.8/2">We are looking at what assistance we can offer to the key commissions which will be set up under the agreement. A key part of the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DP A) is securing broader support for it. In August, the UK's Special Representative for Darfur and our Embassy staff in Khartoum began a programme of meetings with non-signatories to the DPA in Darfur to secure their support for the DPA. Our ambassador in Asmara has met non-signatories based in Eritrea. We will go on engaging with these groups. We will also continue to call on all parties to the conflict in Darfur to abide by the DPA and to cease hostilities. We are pressing the AU to investigate all acts of violence and ensure that it publicises and takes action on its findings.</p>
	<p pid="d.422W.8/3">The UK has played a leading role in the planning process for an international recovery programme for Darfur, including providing funding and technical expertise for it. And, we are helping the AU to publicise the DPA and its benefits in Darfur and across Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="d.422W.8/4">The implementation of the security aspects of the DPA will be helped by the deployment of a UN force in Darfur. The UK piloted the negotiations on Resolution 1706, which mandated such a force, through the Security Council, and has been at the forefront of efforts to persuade President Bashir to accept such a force.</p>
	<p pid="d.422W.8/5">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has also launched an initiative with international partners to encourage the Government of Sudan, inter alia, to accept a UN force and to engage properly with the non-signatories. Ministers attended a series of meetings with members of the UN at the UN General Assembly in New York from 18 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-22">22 September</phrase> to discuss Sudan. We are working to bring together a broad coalition of countries to deliver a co-ordinated message to President Bashir.</p>
	<p pid="d.422W.8/6">The AU force in Darfur has the task of implementing the security aspects of the DPA until a UN force can take over. We welcome the AU's decision at its <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-20">20 September</phrase> Peace and Security Council meeting to extend its mandate to the end of the year and to increase the number of troops in Darfur. It is vital that the AU has enough resources to carry out its task. It is important for the UN to provide material and logistical support, as mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1706, as soon as possible, and for the Arab League to make good its pledge of financial assistance.</p>

The UK played a key role in ensuring that the UNMIT mandate provides for robust support for East Timor at this crucial time, following the recent unrest. The Mission will focus on areas with the potential to lead to instability, including reconciliation, policing and capacity-building in governance, as well as crucial support to the elections scheduled for 2007. It also provides for an international police component within the Mission and an international military security force operating separately to the UN Mission.

Better co-ordination across the Commission on existing work in this area could be helpful, and we welcome President Barroso's proposal.

	<p pid="d.428W.5/1">The Government take forced marriage very seriously and carries out a range of activities to combat this abuse of human rights. Our dedicated Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) has a team of caseworkers who help around 300 people a year, both male and female, who are facing forced marriage in the United Kingdom and abroad. If a British national is forced into a marriage abroad, we offer them consular assistance, including help to return to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.428W.5/2">The FMU also develops policy to combat forced marriage. It has produced guidance on dealing with forced marriage for police, education professionals and social services. In September 2005, the unit held a consultation on whether to make forced marriage a specific criminal offence. In response to the consultation, we are taking forward further activities, such as increasing training to professionals who work in this field, increasing the work we do with statutory agencies, making better use of civil remedies and the family courts and ensuring that existing legislation is fully implemented and contains no gaps.</p>
	<p pid="d.428W.5/3">We also work hard to raise awareness of the problem of forced marriage. Staff from the FMU regularly attend events to train professionals around the country. The FMU ran a national publicity campaign from March to July 2006 to raise awareness of the problem of forced marriage and the help available.

	<p pid="d.429W.5/1">In October 2005 the EU Foreign Ministers underlined their support for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms, and called for the start of a formal process at the United Nations at the earliest opportunity. This message was reiterated in a statement made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-02">2 October</phrase> by the EU Presidency at the UN First Committee. The statement committed the EU to supporting the draft resolution currently at the First Committee as a good way of starting this process. The UK will continue to work with the EU and other international partners to secure the necessary support for the draft resolution, to start the formal process towards a treaty at the UN General Assembly.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary has not had any discussions recently with UN counterparts about the appointment of an individual to co-ordinate aid, relief and security efforts in Iraq or Afghanistan. But the UK works closely with the UN Assistance Missions and the UN Special Representatives to both countries. In Iraq the UN, with the Iraqi government, is co-chairing preparations for an International Compact that will provide further co-ordination of international assistance to that country. In Afghanistan, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General co-chairs the Joint Co-ordination and Monitoring Board that helps improve the delivery of international assistance there in line with the Afghanistan Compact and the Afghan National Development Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="d.434W.5/1">Throughout the last nine years, the Government have been committed to finding a just, lasting and peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict. The period has been one of flux alternating between violence and negotiations. Throughout the period, the Government have consistently applied its policy on granting export licences to Israel. Since 1997, we have taken a range of measures designed to ensure the highest standards of responsibility in our export control policies, which includes exports of equipment to Israel. These include the adoption of the EU code of conduct on Arms Exports in 1998. Since 2000, all applications from the UK have been rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Export Licensing Criteria, taking full account of the prevailing circumstances at the time of application. This includes specific criteria whereby we will not issue a licence where there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression, might aggravate existing tensions or conflict in the country of final destination or that the export may be used aggressively against another country. Our Embassies monitor the situation in this region, including how this might affect export licence applications. Details of all export licences approved to Israel are available in the Quarterly and Annual Reports on Strategic Export Controls submitted to Parliament and are subject to detailed retrospective scrutiny by the Quadripartite Committee on Strategic Export Controls. The quarterly and annual reports are available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage">http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage</a>&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=l119522594750.</p>

We continue to have serious concerns about Israel's appropriation of Palestinian land to build a barrier in the Occupied Territories. Israel has legitimate security concerns and we understand the need to protect Israeli citizens from terrorist attacks. We have no objection to the construction of a barrier, provided it is built on Israeli territory. But constructing the barrier on occupied territory contravenes international law. Sections of the current route, where it strays from the Green Line into the West Bank, are therefore illegal. We regularly raise our concerns about the barrier with the Government of Israel.</p>

	<p pid="d.437W.3/1">Estimates vary between as few as 151 dead and as many as 54,700, but the very nature of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) makes it very difficult to make reliable assessments. It is believed that around 100,000 tonnes of food were destroyed by the floods. The Government of the Republic of Korea has agreed to supply this amount in aid.</p>
	<p pid="d.437W.3/2">The food problems of the DPRK arise not only from the decision by the Government of the Republic of Korea to suspend non-emergency food aid, but from lower domestic food production and from lower grain shipments from China. The World Food Programme has estimated that these factors together may cause a food deficit in the DPRK in 2006 of around 800,000 tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="d.439W.2/1">The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established in 1978 under UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 426, with the aim of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area. From 1978 to 2000 UNIFIL helped reduce confrontation between armed groups in south Lebanon and helped to protect the civilian population. It was not until 2000, when Israel withdrew its forces behind a UN demarcated &quot;Blue Line&quot;, that UNIFIL had the opportunity to implement its mandate of confirming Israeli withdrawal.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.2/2">After 2000 UNIFIL continued to play a valuable role in limiting confrontation between Israel and Hizbollah by monitoring violations of the Blue Line and reporting them to the Security Council. Since 2000 there have been occasional exchanges of fire over the border.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.2/3">However, under its previous mandate and with a limited troop deployment, UNIFIL was unable to assist the Government of Lebanon in taking full control of its territory. For this reason, UNSCR 1701 provided for an enhanced UNIFIL mission under strengthened Rules of Engagement aimed at extending the Government of Lebanon's control over the whole of the country. The UK continues to believe that UNIFIL plays an integral role in Lebanon and that there is a strong case for funding its</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.2/4">operation.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.2/5">The UK is committed to paying its obligatory assessed costs to all UN peacekeeping operations, including UNIFIL, and regularly argues within the context of the Security Council and the General Assembly for effective and efficient peacekeeping missions.</p>

	<p pid="d.448W.3/1">We regularly monitor the situation in Chechnya and the wider North Caucasus. Recent years have seen a gradual improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, resulting in the UN downgrading its security classification for Chechnya from Phase 5 to Phase 4 in August. Russian and local security forces have had some success in improving security recently. The death of Shamil Basayev has been followed by an amnesty under which over 200 fighters are reported to have turned themselves in, creating the opportunity for a process of reconciliation that could underpin long-term security.</p>
	<p pid="d.448W.3/2">Following the elections to the Chechen parliament in November 2005, the Chechen Republic now has fully constituted structures of government. We believe that the best guarantee for political stability in Chechnya is for the Russian and local Chechen authorities to work together to strengthen these new institutions, improving their democratic accountability.</p>
	<p pid="d.448W.3/3">The human rights situation in the republic is still deeply troubling and we regularly raise these issues with the Russian government. There are ongoing reports of torture, extrajudicial killing and abductions in Chechnya, which Chechen President Alu Alkhanov has acknowledged are a terrible crime. We believe that security measures which do not respect international human rights law are counter-productive, and that a long-term solution to the region's problems is only possible once an end has been put to human rights abuses.</p>

	<p pid="d.450W.2/1">In August my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister accepted the Chinese invitation for the UK to participate in Shanghai Expo 2010. This is a fantastic opportunity to broaden and deepen the United Kingdom's relations with China. The theme of Expo 2010&mdash;'Better City Better Life'&mdash;is one where the UK has much expertise and experience. Expo 2010 will provide the perfect opportunity to highlight British creativity, diversity and innovation and our contribution to dealing with global challenges such as sustainable development, including climate change. These are challenges that the UK and China have already agreed we need to tackle together.</p>
	<p pid="d.450W.2/2">It is intended that the UK facilities at Shanghai will be jointly funded by the public and private sectors; a model successfully used for the Aichi World Expo in 2005. Once stakeholders have committed funding, a steering committee will be formed to agree the detailed design and content of the UK pavilion. An open competition for the design, build and operation of the pavilion, will be decided by public tender in the course of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.450W.5/1">Singapore is a republic with a parliamentary system of government. The Head of State is the President, currently Mr S R Nathan. General elections are held every five years and presidential elections every six years. The People's Action Party have won every general election since 1959 and currently hold 82 of the 84 elected seats in Parliament. The Workers' Party and the Singapore Democratic Alliance hold the other two elected seats. There is a further opposition MP in Parliament from the Workers' Party who was selected as a non-constituency MP (NCMP), as provided for by Singapore law. The Prime Minister of Singapore, currently Mr Lee Hsien Loong, is appointed by the President as the leader of the majority party in Parliament. All other Ministers are also MPs.</p>
	<p pid="d.450W.5/2">The Singapore legal system is similar to the English common law system. A written constitution provides for the separation of the three organs of state (executive, legislative and judiciary) and is the supreme law of Singapore. It also provides for the independence of the Supreme Court judges and enshrines the fundamental rights of the individual. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and freedom of the press but it also permits restrictions on these rights.</p>

Most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-12">12 September</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Timms, during a visit to Sri Lanka, raised UK concerns on human rights and humanitarian issues with President Rajapake. The Department for International Development last month made a contribution of over half a million pounds (one million US Dollars) in additional funds to the UN and Red Cross to help Sri Lankans displaced by recent violence; this would include those who have fled from the Trincomalee area.</p>

	<p pid="d.453W.8/1">UN Security Council resolution 1612 deals with the recruitment of child soldiers, and calls for the monitoring of this practice in a number of countries including, Sri Lanka. Officials regularly make clear that the use of child soldiers in Sri Lanka cannot be tolerated and will continue to make such representations. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has identified the rights of the child as one of its top three human rights priorities. The UK has supported the establishment of a UN monitoring and reporting mechanism on children affected by armed conflict and is actively involved in the UN Security Council working group on children and armed conflict. We welcome the efforts of the UN Secretary-General's special representative on children and armed conflict, and promote the ratification of the UN convention on the rights of the child and its optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.</p>

	<p pid="d.455W.5/1">The Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) and various UN Security Council Resolutions require the Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed. The DP A also gives the African Union Mission in Sudan a supervisory role in this. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">Friday 23 June</phrase>, the Government of Sudan publicly began disarming a small group of Janjaweed in South Darfur but no further disarmament has taken place so far as we can ascertain. We welcomed this step and call on the Sudanese Government to intensify this work. We also call on them urgently to present a comprehensive plan for neutralising and disarming the Janjaweed, as the DPA requires them to do. We discuss this and other issues on implementing the DPA regularly with both the African Union and the United Nations.</p>

	<p pid="d.456W.0/1">The original allegations of sexual abuse by African Union (AU) personnel were made by Channel 4. The AU established a committee to investigate the allegations which is currently finalising its report.

	<p pid="d.459W.2/1">The security situation in northern Uganda has improved considerably through 2006, but remains fragile. The major threats to safety are from the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), Karamojong warriors, criminals and road accidents. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against travel to the region.</p>
	<p pid="d.459W.2/2">Since April, the numbers of civilians abducted and killed by the LRA has declined significantly. This has been attributed to the initiation of peace talks between the LRA and the Government of Uganda. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-26">26 August 2006</phrase> a cessation of hostilities agreement was signed between the two sides, which offers hope for a longer term peace deal and improvement in the security situation.</p>
	<p pid="d.459W.2/3">The Ugandan Government has announced a plan, which we support, to replace the army with a civilian police force in northern Uganda&mdash;but this has yet to be implemented.</p>

	<p pid="d.463W.3/1">Most recently, we raised issues of concern with the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings and torture when he reported on Uzbekistan to the Human Rights Council at the second session in September 2006. Separately, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-02">2 October</phrase>, the Human Rights Council examined the human rights situation in Uzbekistan in closed session under the 1503 procedure. In November, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) will consider how the situation in Uzbekistan has developed since last year's resolution.</p>
	<p pid="d.463W.3/2">Internationally we have supported the efforts of UN special rapporteurs to work with Uzbekistan e.g. on torture, and on the independence of the judiciary. In December 2005, 74 countries supported an EU-sponsored resolution on the human rights situation in Uzbekistan at the UNGA.</p>
	<p pid="d.463W.3/3">Bilaterally and with our EU colleagues we monitor closely the human rights situation in Uzbekistan. We seek clarification on new developments both from reputable human rights organisations in Uzbekistan and from the Uzbek authorities. We draw human rights cases to the attention of the Uzbek authorities both informally and formally, in meetings, through demarches and through declarations.</p>
	<p pid="d.463W.3/4">The EU provides for human rights discussions with Uzbekistan through its Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Uzbekistan, which covers a range of issues including economic and trade relations. In October 2005, the EU adopted an arms embargo and a visa ban against the Uzbek officials directly responsible for the events in Andizhan in May 2005.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for International Development held a meeting with officials from both Departments to consider UK humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe. The UK remains one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid to Zimbabwe, amounting to over &pound;120 million since 2001. Our assistance does not go through the Zimbabwean government; instead we channel it through UN agencies and civil society organisations, who ensure that it reaches those that need it most.</p>

	<p pid="d.465W.2/1">Officials in London and our Embassy in Harare are in constant contact with Zimbabwean civil society. Zimbabwe's ruinous economic policies have led to an official rate of inflation above 1200 per cent. and rising, unemployment at over 80 per cent., and forced evictions continuing. Peaceful demonstrations are increasing, but Mugabe remains indifferent to his people's suffering, choosing instead to: stifle opposition; silence independent media; ignore international calls for reform; and deny any responsibility for the grave situation the country faces. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-19">19 September</phrase>, I summoned the Zimbabwean Ambassador to express strong concern on behalf of the Government at the violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-13">13 September</phrase> by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions.</p>
