	<p pid="a.1243W.3/2">The Fleet relies on a layered defence approach to defeat an aerial attack. The backbone of the Fleet's ability to defend itself from air attack in the outer layer of maritime air defence will continue to be provided by destroyers. At present, this is achieved using the Type 42 Destroyers equipped with the medium range Sea Dart surface to air missile system. Type 45 Destroyers will gradually replace the Type 42 destroyers. These new ships will be armed with the Principal Anti Air Missile System, enhancing the Fleet's capability to counter the most sophisticated aircraft and anti-ship missiles in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1243W.3/3">In the inner layer of Maritime Air Defence the Fleet's close range air defence capability will continue to be provided by Type 22 and Type 23 Frigates equipped with the Seawolf point defence missile system. Additional air defence capability will also come from a combination of close-in weapon (gun) systems, such as Goalkeeper and Phalanx, and decoys.</p>
	<p pid="a.1243W.3/4">Airborne Early Warning Sea King helicopters will provide the long range detection of airborne contacts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.2/1">A process and outcome evaluation of the pilots over their two-year duration is an integral part of the project. The key measures, advised by national clinical experts, will be the assessment and treatment regimes provided, and the patient (and carer) experience and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.2/2">The costs of running the pilot scheme are not yet available as negotiations for the funding of individual sites are still continuing between the MOD, Department of Health and NHS trusts. The cost of rolling out the scheme nationwide will depend on the outcomes of the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.2/3">The proposed service is advised by clinical and health care experts and reflects the long established intention that veterans' health care is primarily a matter for the NHS. Using NHS best practice and processes, veterans-sensitive evidence-based interventions will be delivered by public, private or charitable providers. These will be modified as necessary in the light of the pilot evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.2/4">In addition, we have recently announced the expansion of our Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) based at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, to include assessment of veterans with mental health symptoms with operational service from 1982 (including veterans of the Falklands campaign). The clinician in charge is a recently retired service military psychiatrist, who will provide support and advice to GPs and other civilian health professionals where the individual is concerned that the service background of their condition may not have been understood within the NHS or where the health professional is seeking expertise on the assessment or treatment of a veteran's condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.5/1">It has been the Government's policy since 1997 to be open and transparent about Gulf veterans' issues, including the publication of all relevant documents. We have identified and published the lessons of the past, accepting that mistakes were made in 1990-91, particularly with regard to medical record keeping. The Government's view is that there are no substantive issues to be addressed by a public inquiry and that, in particular, it would not help to resolve the long outstanding issue of why veterans are ill; only scientific research might do this. We have funded a substantial programme of research designed to address the key candidate causes so far put forward, but recognising that it would not be sensible to duplicate work being undertaken elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.1255W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of 16 to 19 year olds in York were registered as unemployed in January 2007. (151627)</p>
	<p pid="a.1255W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles unemployment statistics for parliamentary constituencies from the Annual Population Survey (APS) following ILO definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1255W.2/6" class="indent">For the 12 months ending in December 2006, the latest available data, there were 1,000 persons aged 16 to 19, resident in the City of York constituency, who were unemployed. This estimate is 16 per cent of the resident population aged 16 to 19. The unemployment rate, which is the number of unemployed expressed as a percentage of the economically active population, in that age group, was 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1255W.2/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1255W.2/8" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). For January 2007, there were 200 persons aged 16 to 19, resident in the City of York constituency, claiming JSA. The corresponding figure for the latest available month, June 2007, is 180.</p>

	<p pid="a.1262W.2/1">Following the South East England regional assembly's adoption of housing growth options in October 2004, SEEDA commissioned work to explore the needs of the region's economy. This identified that maintaining present economic growth rates would require up to 45,000 new houses per annum, and that improvements in productivity and economic activity rates could reduce this requirement to 34,800 new houses per year while maintaining overall growth rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.2/2">On the basis of this work (which was published by SEEDA), SEEDA's board agreed in March 2005 a response to the Regional Spatial Strategy consultation draft (published in April 2005) which made the case for a minimum average level of housing growth of 34,800 units per year 2006-26. The regional assembly adopted a proposed profile of 32,000 units per annum for 2006-11 and 36,000 units per annum for 2011-26.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.2/3">Once the draft RSS was published in April 2006, SEEDA's board reconsidered the evidence at its June 2006 meeting and reaffirmed its support for the housing growth levels given above.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.2/4">On this basis, SEEDA submitted written objections to the draft RSS which were considered by the Panel of Inspectors at the Examination in Public (October 2006-March 2007).</p>

	<p pid="a.1274W.3/14">Workforce planning is a matter for individual trusts to undertake, working with their commissioners and strategic health authorities. Plans need to be, and are, regularly reviewed as circumstances change. North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust has recently provided information to the Department on projected numbers for paramedics. I understands that the trust intend to have 1,347 whole time equivalents in employment as paramedics in 2007-08, 1,361 in 2008-09 and 1,375 in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.1274W.3/15">In 2006, numbers of ambulance staff were collected under new, more detailed occupation codes. This included the introduction of a code for emergency care practitioners and the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust recorded 39 ECPs in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1274W.3/16">More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1276W.8/1">It is estimated that at least 25 per cent. of red cells are given to patients with cancer. Not all of these units are given for direct treatment of cancer. Figures for the actual number of transfusions are not collected, but in 2006-07 the National Blood Service issued 1,864,271 units of red blood cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.8/2">These figures are based on provisional results from the Epidemiology and Survival of Transfusion Recipients study, a National Blood Service study of patients transfused in England in 2001-02. The study is in the final stages and will be submitted for publication soon. However, it is based on data collected five years ago so it is likely that changes in blood use have occurred since then.</p>

	<p pid="a.1289W.14/24">It is the responsibility of local planning authorities to identify and release land for housing as part of the planning process. This means that the requirement for the provision of social housing will need to be negotiated and agreed with the local planning authority. The Government have implemented a number of initiatives to assist with land supply for housing. A register of surplus public sector land held by central government bodies has been established. English Partnerships review the sites on the register to identify those which could have the potential for housing development. As at June 2007, there were over 700 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added as they are identified as surplus by landowners and removed once expressions of interest are received after a site has been marketed.</p>

Training schedules for national health service staff in independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) are agreed locally, subject to meeting accreditation standards. The number of junior doctor training posts available is based on local service requirements and future workforce planning needs in discussions with strategic health authorities, Deaneries and trusts. In the instance where training is attached to activity, which is transferred from the NHS to a Wave 1 ISTC, junior doctors will complete the training in the ISTC.</p>

	<p pid="a.1301W.0/1">Since 2001, the Department and the Home Office have provided for drug treatment in the form of the pooled drug treatment budget (PTB). This funding is allocated to the 149 drug action teams across the country to use, along with local mainstream funding, to provide for treatment and services according to the specific needs of each locality. We do not have information on drug treatment spend prior to 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1301W.0/2">It is for primary care trusts to determine the level of expenditure on alcohol services within their area in line with local priorities. Information is not collected centrally on local spend; however the Alcohol Needs Assessment Project found that around &pound;217 million was being spend on alcohol services during 2003-04. Funds from the PTB may be spent on alcohol services provided that adequate progress is being made on drugs priorities.</p>

The procedures for the latter require that a draft order is published and consulted upon at least three months before the amended order is laid before Parliament.

	<p pid="a.1313W.5/1">The 2010 inequalities targets for life expectancy, cardiovascular disease and cancer are based on narrowing the gap in mortality between the population as a whole and the fifth of local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators (the Spearhead Group), and the primary care trusts that map to them, by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.5/2">Life expectancy has increased for both males and females for England as a whole but it has improved more slowly in the Spearhead areas. In England, average life expectancy for males is 76.9 and for females 81.1, in the Spearhead group it is 74.9 for males and 79.6 for females. The slower rate of improvement in has led to a widening of the relative gap in life expectancy between England and the spearhead group. The latest data for 2003-05, show that the average life expectancy in the Spearhead Group was 2.61 per cent. lower than the England average for males, and 1.91 per cent. lower than the England average for females. Therefore, the relative gap has widened by 2 per cent. for men and 8 per cent. for women since the baseline (1995-97).</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.5/3">However, although the 2010 target for life expectancy is a challenging one, data for 2003-05 also show that some 60 per cent. of the 70 Spearhead areas are on track to narrow their own life expectancy gap with that of England by 10 per cent. by 2010, compared to baseline for either males or females or both. The information is set out in the following table, with comparison data for 2002-04.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.5/4">Data for 2003-05 have also shown continued improvements in CVD and cancer mortality inequalities between Spearhead areas and the national average since the 1995-97 baseline. The absolute gap from circulatory disease has narrowed by 27.9 per cent., and we are on track to meet the 2010 target of at least a 40 per cent. reduction, There has been a 12.7 per cent. reduction in the absolute cancer inequality gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.5/5">Targeted assistance to Spearhead areas is being provided through a variety of programmes such as Communities for Health, Health Trainers, Life Check and smoking cessation as well as on cancer, coronary heart disease and primary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.5/6">The following table shows whether the 70 Spearhead local authorities are on or off track to narrow their share of the life expectancy gap by 10 per cent. for males or females or both by 2010 according to 2003-05 data. The table also shows a comparison to 2002-04.</p>

	<p pid="a.1315W.5/1">Present action to tackle obesity in adults includes the care pathways for national health service primary care professionals and a self-help guide Your Weight Your Health; the National Heart Forum's toolkit Lightening the Load: tackling overweight and obesity; work on foods high in salt, fat and sugar; front of pack labelling as an easy to understand way of helping individuals and families to make healthier food choices; the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire; Local Exercise Action Pilots and the National Step-0-Meter Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1315W.5/3">Regarding steps to tackle underweight, Government advice is that people should consume a healthy balanced diet, which includes a wide variety of foods, is low in fat, based on plenty of fruit and vegetables and starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, and other cereals. The diet should contain moderate amounts of meat, fish, meat alternatives, milk and dairy products and sparing or infrequent amounts of foods containing fat/foods and drinks containing sugar. Eating a balanced diet in combination with physical activity should enable people to maintain a healthy weight.</p>

	<p pid="a.1317W.0/1">The Department does not collect data on waiting times for fitting of digital hearing aids. Since January 2006, the Department has been collecting data on the waiting times for audiology assessments. The latest figures, for May 2007, indicate that there are currently 1,322 people waiting over 13 weeks for assessments in Surrey and 13 people waiting over 13 weeks for assessments in Oxfordshire. In England as of May 2007, 73,381 people are waiting over 13 weeks for an assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.0/2">A National Framework Contract Public Private Partnership with David Ormerod Hearing Centres and Ultravox Holdings plc was in place from October 2003 until March 2007. It was fundamental to the National Framework Contract that the quality of service, and hearing aid, that the patient received mirrored those of the local NHS audiology department. Quality assurance was key in the initiative. Both companies demonstrated their commitment to meeting these standards and invested resources in terms of equipment, IT and staff training in order to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.0/3">Further independent sector capacity for audiology has been procured as part of the Phase 2 Diagnostics Procurement. Providers are subject to ongoing audit and must meet stringent key performance indicators through the delivery of the contract. Independent sector capacity is utilised at a local level alongside NHS capacity and is subject to the same standards and referral procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.0/4">The Hearing Aid Council, which is responsible for standards of professional practice, remains in operation and is working towards transferring its regulatory functions to other bodies in advance of its abolition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1318W.5/15">It is not possible to assess accurately what proportion of transmissions occurred prior to birth, at birth and after birth during this period. In-utero transmission is uncommon, and most transmissions occur during labour and delivery, or through breastfeeding. Infant samples need to be taken within 48 hours of birth to make inferences about timing of transmission, and since the majority of infected infants were born to undiagnosed women, sufficient samples were not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.5/16">If the woman is diagnosed before or during pregnancy, she can be offered:</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.5/17" class="indent">antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy, at delivery, and for the infant after birth;</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.5/18" class="indent">appropriate management of delivery, e.g. planned caesarean section; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.5/19" class="indent">advice not to breastfeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.5/20">If the woman is diagnosed at or shortly after delivery, the infant can still be offered antiretroviral therapy starting as soon as possible after birth, and the woman can still be advised not to breastfeed, both of which will reduce the risk of transmission if the baby was not already infected in-utero.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.5/21">Since the introduction of the routine recommendation of antenatal HIV testing in 2000, the majority of infected pregnant women have been diagnosed prior to delivery. In 2005, the latest year for which data are available, about 95 per cent. of infected pregnant women were diagnosed before delivery. During the 1990s, before antenatal testing was routine, the majority of infected women remained undiagnosed at delivery and therefore appropriate treatment and advice could not be offered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1320W.5/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for managing the home oxygen service locally, including assessing how the new arrangements relate to waiting times, patient safety and emergency supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.5/2">PCTs have access, on the home oxygen website, to a clinical assessment services commissioning framework, which outlines how these services, together with the new home oxygen service, can help reduce waiting times while supporting patients in managing their symptoms at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.5/3">Under the terms of the contract, all suppliers are required to provide information and training on the safe and effective use of oxygen equipment provided to patients and their families. Suppliers also make clear to patients the dangers of using oxygen if they continue to smoke or use equipment close to fires or other naked flames. Suppliers are required to report any incident involving patient safety to PCTs. It is for PCTs to report all serious incidents and to take any appropriate follow up action, whether reported by a supplier, health care professional or a patient, to strategic health authorities and the National Patient Safety Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.5/4">From national service data provided by suppliers, I am able to confirm that all new suppliers are meeting the response time target 99 per cent. of the time for emergency supply. This is a priority service and, under the terms of the contract, all suppliers are required to supply oxygen at home within four hours of receiving an order for emergency supply.</p>

During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 6.Ungrossed Data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> HES, The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1341W.2/2">The 2007-08 national health service operating framework requires local NHS organisations to undertake a review of their maternity services, identify the gaps and barriers to service development and set out their local strategy for delivery of maternity matters.

There have been no standby costs, but some limited expenditure has been incurred in monitoring the circumstances surrounding the recent uncertainty over the future of iSoft. However, this has not been recorded separately and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1354W.8/1">The Department is not responsible for setting curricula for health professional training. However, the Department does share a commitment with statutory and professional bodies to ensure that all health professionals are appropriately trained, so that they have the skills and knowledge to deliver a high quality health service to all groups of the population, whatever their condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.8/2">The Department has funded the production of guidance to support the effective delivery of high quality training on substance misuse, including alcohol, within undergraduate medical education in the United Kingdom. Compilation of Substance Misuse in the Undergraduate Medical Curriculum was overseen by an expert steering group and published by the International Centre for Drug Policy in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.8/3">Although, the Department has not made an assessment of the training, guidance and resources available in the national health service for routine screening of alcohol consumption by pregnant women, midwives routinely ask about alcohol consumption during booked antenatal appointments. The Department has also recently reworded its advice on alcohol and pregnancy. The revised advice states that pregnant women or women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol. If they do choose to drink, to minimise the risk to the baby, they should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week, and should not get drunk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.8/4">The Department has not commissioned or evaluated research into the clinical management of individuals affected by foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the Government welcome the British Medical Association's recently published guide for health care professionals on FASD which will serve to raise awareness of this and provide important advice for diagnosis and those caring for patients affected by this condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356W.3/1">Genital warts is the most frequently diagnosed viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) in genitor urinary clinics in England. In 2006, the highest rates of genital warts were in both the 16-19 and 20-24 year age groups in women and in the 20-24 year old age group in men. Most cases of genital warts are asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously in healthy individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356W.3/2">To tackle the spread of STIs we have set a target that 100 per cent. of patients attending a genitor urinary medicine service are offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours. We are already seeing excellent progress on this. Data from the Genito Urinary Medicine Monthly Monitoring return showed that in May 2007, 85 per cent. of first attendances were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours of contacting a service. This compares with 58 per cent. in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356W.3/3">Last November we launched a new adult sexual health campaign, &quot;Condom Essential Wear&quot;, which aims to normalise condom use among sexually active adults. The campaign focuses on STIs most prevalent in the target 18-24 year old age group.</p>

	<p pid="a.1358W.0/1">The information is not available in the format requested. Figures are available from Hospital Episode Statistics on the number of Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs) in national health service hospitals in England with a primary diagnosis of diseases that can be caused by smoking. It is acknowledged that not all of these FCEs which can be caused by smoking will be attributable to smoking as there are other contributory factors to these diseases. Therefore for England, the relative risks of these diseases for current and ex-smokers, compared to non-smokers can be used to estimate smoking-attributable FCEs. The following tables provide either the number of FCEs that can be caused by smoking or estimates of the number of smoking-attributable FCEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.0/2">Table 1 shows the number of FCEs in England, for people of all ages, with a primary diagnosis of various diseases which can be caused by smoking for 1996-97 through to 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.0/3">Table 2 shows the number of FCEs in England, for those aged 35 and over, with a primary diagnosis of various diseases which can be caused by smoking, and estimates of the number of these which can be attributed to smoking. Figures have been provided for 2004-05, as this is first and most recent year for which data on estimates of diseases which can be attributed to smoking are available. Figures are shown for those aged 35 and over only, because relative risks used to estimate the attributable numbers are only available for this age group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.0/4">Table 3 shows the number of FCEs in Hampshire and Isle of Wight strategic health authority (SHA), for all ages, with a primary diagnosis of various diseases which can be caused by smoking for 1996-97 through to 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.0/5">Relative risks of diseases for current and ex-smokers are not available at SHA level, so analysis estimating the numbers of smoking-attributable FCEs at SHA level cannot be provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.1366W.0/1">Aluminium salts are an essential ingredient of some vaccines in enhancing the protection offered by the vaccine. The safety record of aluminium in vaccines has been demonstrated over more than 50 years of use. There are no serious health risks associated with the small quantities of aluminium in some vaccines. As with many vaccine ingredients, aluminium can cause localised reactions such as redness, swelling and/or tenderness at the injection site.</p>
