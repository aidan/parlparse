	<p pid="b.1445W.10/1">There were 66 responses to the 12 questions asked in the public consultation on the draft of Building Bulletin 100 (BB 100) and a summary of these will be placed on the Department's website early in November. 74 per cent. of respondents agreed with the proposal that sprinkler systems should be installed in a new school if the need for them was indicated by a risk assessment. However, 58 per cent. thought that there needed to be more guidance on sprinklers than was contained in the draft.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.10/2">This finding reinforced the need for the cost benefit analysis study of sprinklers that we had already commissioned form the Building Research Establishment (BRE).</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.10/3">However, we have since asked BRE to carry our further work on developing a risk assessment tool. We also commissioned consultants to carry out a study to establish reliable figures for the costs of installing sprinklers in schools. Their survey covers a minimum of 20 primary and secondary schools, and is analysing both installation costs and maintenance costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.10/4">Both these pieces of work commenced in July and should be complete by the end of October. Data from all of these studies, and substantive responses from the public consultation, will be incorporated into the final draft of BB 100. We expect to publish this early next year.</p>

At present, the A47 in Peterborough does not need resurfacing. Regular inspections will identify if there is a need for resurfacing for safety reasons.

As part of the IOC's contribution to the Games, LOCOG will receive a proportion of revenue from all of the IOC's TOP sponsors but we do not yet know the exact amount.</p>
	<p pid="b.1457W.3/2">My Department has not received any recent representations from McDonalds regarding the sponsorship of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport recently met McDonalds to discuss their sponsorship of coaching.</p>

	<p pid="b.1458W.2/2">Decisions about ownership of local and regional media and newspapers are a commercial matter for relevant parties in the industry. However, where mergers take place within the media, the Secretary of State does have certain powers to intervene to examine public interest issues that may be raised by such concentrations. Full details of the media mergers regime may be found in the Communications Act 2003 sections 373 to 389 (chapter 2 of part 5 of the Act) which amended the Enterprise Act 2002 so as to introduce the new regime. The Communications Act 2003 is published on the OPSI website at: <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030021_en.pdf">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030021_en.pdf</a>. The explanatory notes to the Communications Act 2003 may be found at <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/en2003/ukpgaen_20030021_en.pdf">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/en2003/ukpgaen_20030021_ en.pdf</a>. Separately, the DTI has published guidance on the operation of the media mergers regime explaining how public interest interventions in media mergers would work in practice.

	<p pid="b.1462W.3/1">Violent crime of all types is addressed in the Milton Keynes Community Safety Partnership's (CSP) overall strategy for crime reduction, which is supported by a detailed Basic Command Unit Crime Reduction Plan. The CSP continues to target violent crime through enforcement, prevention, intelligence and communication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/2">The CSP and police have put considerable resources into dealing with violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/3">The CSP runs an effective Joint Tasking and Co-ordinating Group that ensures a multi-agency approach to tackling a range of crime problems. It has a delivery group charged specifically with reducing violence, and has secured funding to reduce racial harassment. The local Racial Equality Council is delivering this work on the CSP's behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/4">The police have a dedicated Public Protection Unit dealing with domestic violence, predatory offenders and serious child abuse. With probation and other partners, they also participate in a multi-agency public protection arrangement to monitor the most dangerous offenders. The most serious violent crimes are investigated by the CID in the Basic Command Unit, and a detective will attend and deal with any robbery offence reported.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/5">Milton Keynes has a vibrant night-time economy, with large numbers of people attracted to the city by its entertainment and leisure facilities. There are a number of initiatives designed to make the city centre a safer place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/6">The police's Operation Debus ensures that resources are deployed to provide a visible presence in hotspot areas and at the times when offences are most likely to occur. The police use Fixed Penalty Notices to intervene at an early stage and prevent escalation of violence. The police issued 378 Fixed Penalty Notices for Public Order Act offences between April 2006 and September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/7">Operation Hangover brings together the resources of Milton Keynes's Licensing and Trading Standards departments and the police to tackle the antisocial behaviour associated with excessive alcohol consumption. To support this both the council and the Thames Valley police have put a lot of effort into communication with license holders about their new responsibilities under the Licensing Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/8">At a national level, the Home Office introduced the Respect Action Plan in January 2006 to reduce antisocial behaviour. The Violent Crime Bill is currently before Parliament. It contains measures to tackle binge-drinking and tackle the harm caused by weapons. Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, a new range of tougher sentences became available for offences committed after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>: special 'public protection'</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.3/9">sentences are available for those convicted of violent offences and assessed as dangerous.</p>

	<p pid="b.1463W.2/1">Home Office Legal Adviser's Branch advises the Home Office on legal issues arising in all aspects of its work. The Branch consists of some 50 lawyers organised into teams of varying sizes, each specialising in different areas of law and policy. In the course of their career in the Home Office, lawyers will usually work in several teams and gain experience in areas of law relevant to the Home Office's work (as well as experience of other areas of public law if they move on temporary secondment or loan to other Government Departments).</p>
	<p pid="b.1463W.2/2">Each team in the Legal Adviser's Branch is headed by a senior lawyer, part of whose task is to guide and supervise the work of more junior members of his or her team. From time to time, where appropriate having regard to the sensitivity, complexity or novelty of an issue, specialist legal advice is obtained from members of the bar (who are selected from a panel appointed by the Attorney-General), from solicitors in private practice (drawn from a list of firms approved by the Treasury Solicitor) or from lawyers in other Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1463W.2/3">All lawyers employed in the Home Office Legal Adviser's Branch hold current professional legal qualifications, and must continue to satisfy the post-qualifying and continuing legal education requirements of their branch of the legal profession. Training courses are available to them through the Government Legal Service as well as through commercial training providers. The Legal Adviser's Branch also runs a series of in- house seminars and training events on matters of current interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1463W.2/4">In addition, as civil servants, members of Home Office Legal Adviser's Branch receive regular reports and assessments on their professional competence and development, in accordance with Cabinet Office and Home Office guidance. Formal reports take place annually and semi- annually, and less formal mentoring and training takes place on a continuing basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1463W.2/5">The Home Office Legal Adviser's Branch is part of the Government Legal Service. The arrangements described above reflect those in place in other major departments in Whitehall.</p>

Our view is that pistol shooting events can take place at the Olympics without the need to change the legislation, using the Home Secretary's existing powers under section five of the Firearms Act 1968. These powers can also be used to allow a small number of potential medal winners to practise ahead of the Games and we have agreed in principle to explore how this might be achieved without endangering public safety. I have no current intention of amending the legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1468W.6/2">People receiving a state pension are entitled to carer's allowance if they satisfy the usual conditions of entitlement. However, since both benefits serve the same purpose of providing a measure of income replacement, they cannot both be paid in full. In practice, the state pension takes precedence as the contributory benefit and is paid in full while only the balance of any carer's allowance is paid if it exceeds the state pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.1468W.6/3">Although this often means that carer's allowance is not paid at all, since 2002 the underlying entitlement to the benefit gives access to the carer's additional amount of &pound;26.35 a week in pension credit and to the carer premium of the same amount in income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1471W.3/1">Helping lone parents develop and maintain their attachment to the labour market not only helps them meet their parental responsibilities, which has positive impacts on their children's health, schooling and prospects in later life, but is also an effective way of moving them and their children out of poverty and ensuring their social inclusion. This is why we are introducing the Work Related Activity Premium (WRAP).</p>
	<p pid="b.1471W.3/2">Lone parents in pilot areas who have been on certain qualifying benefits for at least six months, whose youngest child is aged 11 or over, will be eligible for the WRAP if they agree to take formal steps to return to the labour market. Participants will be paid a &pound;20 a week premium for six months, which will be paid on top of their ordinary Income Support entitlement. If the lone parent stops doing work related activity, or enters work, payment of the premium will end.</p>
	<p pid="b.1471W.3/3">The WRAP will be piloted in seven Jobcentre Plus districts from April 2007. The costs of providing WRAP in the pilot areas will be dependent on the number of lone parents who choose to participate in this voluntary initiative, and undertake work related activity. The pilot areas cover approximately 10 per cent. of the lone parent population and will inform us on the level of take up we can expect if the premium is rolled out nationally at a later date. As the pilot doesn't start until April 2007, any costs in 2006-07 will be pilot start-up costs only.</p>
	<p pid="b.1471W.3/4">The cost of providing the WRAP to each lone parent who volunteers to take part in the pilot will be &pound;520 if they receive the premium for the full 26 weeks. Lone parents moving off benefit and into work will result in savings to Government benefit expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1477W.5/1">The national health service currently uses iSOFT products extensively outside the national programme for information technology (IT) in the NHS. In light of the financial statements made by iSOFT, Connecting for Health reminded all NHS trusts that it was normal best practice to ensure that copies of the software they use is held in escrow allowed within their own locally owned contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1477W.5/2">Connecting for Health, the agency delivering the national programme for IT, does not contract directly with iSOFT. iSOFT is contracted to deliver clinical software to local service providers in three of the five clusters. One of the local service providers, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), has agreed with iSOFT additional rights to step in and undertake the management of development of iSOFT's Lorenzo software in the event that iSOFT fails to meet its agreed delivery targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1477W.5/3">This additional right by CSC adds greater certainty to the delivery of the Lorenzo product for the NHS in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.1483W.9/1">The sale of Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to Saudi Arabia is fully consistent with our policy of supporting the efforts of the Gulf Co-operation Council States, of which Saudi Arabia is the biggest, in promoting regional stability. It also meets the legitimate defence requirements of the Saudi armed forces. Negotiations on the commercial arrangements for the sale are continuing and a full assessment of the financial effects would not be possible until their conclusion. However, as the then Secretary of State for Defence stated in December last year, the deal represents good news for both UK and Saudi industry and will help sustain several thousand UK jobs over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1483W.9/2">The negotiations on the Understanding Document signed last December, which set out the intention to establish greater partnership in modernising the Saudi armed forces, and on the subsequent commercial arrangements for the sale of Typhoon aircraft have been led by this Department. The costs associated with these activities have been recovered from a management fee received from the Saudi Arabian Government. No record has been kept of that element of the management fees used to cover the above costs and one could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

They were announced in the <i> London Gazette</i> at the time. The first recipient was a Corporal in the Balkans in May 1995. Since then there have been a further one in the Balkans, two in Sierra Leone, four in Afghanistan and eight in Iraq. With the recent award to the Royal Irish Regiment the number has increased to 17.</p>

	<p pid="b.1487W.10/1">Despite a legacy of more than 20 years of conflict, Afghanistan has made good progress in reconstruction over the last five years. In January 2005, the Government of Afghanistan launched the interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy and the Afghanistan Compact at the London Conference. This is a major step in setting the overall strategy for development policies including reconstruction. The international community fully supports this strategy and as a result pledged &pound;10.5 billion towards implementation. There are now 60 per cent. more functioning health clinics, nearly 2,000 schools have been built or rehabilitated and 60,000 former combatants have been disarmed. Major road rehabilitation is connecting major urban centres and Afghanistan with its neighbours. Reliable electricity supply is being restored in urban centres and rural electrification programmes are under way. The telecommunications sector is growing fast, connecting businesses and people in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1487W.10/2">DFID support for the National Rural Access Programme (&pound;18 million) is helping to build essential infrastructure such as irrigation schemes, roads and bridges. Under this programme nearly 8,000 km of roads have been built or repaired, as well as schools, health clinics and water schemes. The programme has also generated over 13 million days of labour. DFID support for the National Solidarity Programme (&pound;17 million) is helping local communities through elected Community Development Councils (CDCs) to identify what development is most needed in their areas and then receive grants to undertake their work. The programme has funded over 17,000 projects in the areas of agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power supply, transport and water supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1487W.10/3">None the less, the challenges remain great. While progress has been good there is a long way to go: DFID recognises this. DFID's Interim Strategy for Afghanistan 2005-06 states that the highest immediate priority is to stabilise the country, to ensure the Government are able to deliver services nationwide and to establish the rule of law within a democratic political system that safeguards human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.1487W.10/4">DFID recently participated in a joint evaluation of Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan, 2001-05, with Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden. This focused on assessing the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency impact and coherence of the assistance and identifies the lessons learned. It concluded that assistance to Afghanistan has produced important results to date, but for sustainable impact, long-term development and peace-keeping is needed. I will ensure copies of this are placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1488W.2/1">The world is on track to meet the poverty reduction and hunger goal. The most recent official data at global level show that between 1990 and 2002, the percentage of people living on less than $1 a day in the developing world dropped from 28 to 19 per cent. However, progress across regions varies. The proportion of people in Asia living on less than $1 a day dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion over that period. In sub-Saharan Africa, the goal is seriously off track, and although the poverty rate did not increase, the number of people living in extreme poverty increased by 140 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1488W.2/2">Progress towards the other seven Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is assessed using data up to between 2003 and 2005 depending on the goals. Progress towards these goals varies. For example, reducing child mortality is on track in Latin America, South East Asia and North Africa, and slightly off track in most other regions. There is less progress towards goal 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases), which is seriously off track for at least one of the targets in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Oceania and the Commonwealth of Independent States both in Europe and Asia. Progress towards environmental sustainability is mixed, with most regions off track for some targets and on track for others. On current rates of progress, sub-Saharan Africa will not meet any of the goals by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.1488W.2/3">The recently published 2006 UN Millennium Development Goals Report, which can be found on <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/default.asp">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/default.asp</a>x, gives a comprehensive account of progress to date on each of the goals, and how great an effort remains necessary if they are to be met. DFID's 2006 Departmental Report includes an annex on UK progress towards MDG8. A copy of the report is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1488W.2/4">Because the situation worsened in Africa, the UK has placed Africa at the forefront of our campaign for more and better aid. Of the 25 key countries on which DFID focuses its work, 16 are in Africa. The recent White Paper indicates what DFID sets out to do with respect to governance, basic services, climate change and the international system, which would all help make further progress towards meeting the MDGs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1490W.2/1">Extreme poverty, marginal livelihoods, and other chronic issues lie at the heart of the crisis which affected the Sahel in 2005, with inadequate rainfall, and locust infestation in 2004, adding to the problem. This situation led to deficits in the 2004 harvest, further antagonised by extreme food-price rises, and reductions in the poorest populations' access to food. In 2006, following adequate rainfall and with food production expected to be above the five-year average, the humanitarian situation remains relatively stable, but, owing to longer-term chronic vulnerabilities, the burden of acute childhood malnutrition remains high in some areas, and livelihoods remain precarious. DFID's response is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1490W.2/2" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Niger&mdash;In 2005 DFID was one of the first donors to respond to the crisis in Niger providing &pound;3.25 million to the initial relief effort, and followed up with a further &pound;2 million to aid the recovery process and ease further humanitarian stresses through into 2006. In 2006-07 DFID is providing an additional &pound;1.5 million to continue the response to the high rates of childhood malnutrition that prevail, and to boost food-security through the on-going hungry season, since the legacy of the 2005 crisis persist.. This funding is being provided through United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) who are engaged in continuing relief operations in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1490W.2/3" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Mali&mdash;In 2005-06 DFID provided &pound;550,000 through the World Food Programme's (WFP) emergency feeding programme, which enabled 175,000 children under the age of five to receive vital support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1490W.2/4" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> Mauritania&mdash;Food aid needs remain high. In 2006-07 DFID has contributed &pound;250,000 through the World Food Programme (WFP) to support feeding activities for 50,000 malnourished children and vulnerable mothers in the badly affected agro-pastoral zone in the south east of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1490W.2/5" class="indent"><i> (d)</i> Burkina Faso&mdash;In 2005-06 DFID provided &pound;105,000 through Catholic Relief Services for their emergency food assistance and livelihood protection programme, enabling 57,000 vulnerable people to receive emergency support. DFID will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in the Sahel closely, and will maintain its flexible humanitarian support to short-term emergency, recovery and mitigation needs over the coming year. Simultaneously, DFID is planning to allocate an additional &pound;1.5 million over the next three years to tackle longer-term nutritional vulnerabilities in the Sahel region, and is exploring longer-term options for strengthening food-security.</p>

	<p pid="b.1498W.0/2">OCNS has carried out a thorough investigation of the incident referred to. This investigation included reviewing the existing Transport Security Statement (TSS) for Direct Rail Services (DRS), the nuclear rail freight operating company in question. While as a result of the investigation some minor amendments to the TSS have been made, OCNS remains satisfied that standards detailed within that TSS were sufficiently robust to prevent the theft or sabotage of nuclear material and that DRS was fully compliant with the TSS at that time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1500W.3/2">The Government are already supporting a range of activities seeking to promote energy saving schemes to small and medium-sized enterprises. The Carbon Trust, the independent company set up and funded by the Government to help businesses cut their carbon emissions and increase their energy efficiency, has run an extensive communications programme to publicise its services to small and medium-sized enterprises. Its main campaign of 2006&mdash;&quot;Carbon Costs&quot;&mdash;targeted this group in particular. The campaign highlighted the 20 per cent. of financial savings most enterprises can make through low and no-cost energy saving measures, as well as the environmental benefits of reducing carbon emissions. It ran on national television and other media and was one of the largest campaigns of its kind focused on small and medium-sized enterprises ever seen in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1500W.3/3">The Carbon Trust also promotes interest-free energy saving loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and has significant campaigns planned in this area through the remainder of 2006 and into 2007. I understand that the trust will continue to promote the financial and environmental benefits of energy saving to this group and is planning significant promotional activity at similar levels to this year through 2007 and 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1504W.9/1">EU member states are required to hold oil stocks equal to 90 days' consumption, for use in the event of disruption of global oil supplies. The UK, as a producer, has a derogation reducing its obligation by 25 per cent. and therefore currently has an obligation to hold stocks equal to 67.5 days' consumption. As UK production declines, the derogation will be phased out. This will be a gradual process. We expect the full 25 per cent. derogation to continue until UK crude oil production falls below 25 per cent. of refinery demand, which on current trends will be between 2010 and 2015, and the full 90 days' obligation to be reached when UK production ends. We have not estimated the precise cost to the parties mentioned, but the overall cost of complying with the obligation will increase over time by some 33 per cent. and following a public consultation we are working with industry on a new basis for our stocking system which will ensure that the UK can continue to meet its obligations in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1505W.2/1">The UK derogation reducing by 25 per cent. its EU obligation to hold oil stocks for use in the event of disruption of global oil supplies is based on its status as a producer, not as a net exporter.

	<p pid="b.1508W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October</phrase>, there were six vehicles carrying 14 consignments of calves (totalling 1,167 animals). The consignments were destined for Belgium, France and Spain and spent between nine and a half and 15 hours at Dover port.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.3/2">The ship's departure was delayed for a number of reasons. Its sailing from Dover was originally delayed owing to the late arrival of a vehicle. The vessel then had to leave its berth to accommodate another ferry and, on its return, had to wait for the tide to rise sufficiently for the loading ramp to be used. At Dunkerque, a further delay was caused when the pilot was diverted to other essential duties. On return to Dover, staff from the State Veterinary Service (SVS) re-examined the animals to check their condition before departure. Before this check could be completed, the vessel had to leave berth again to accommodate a ferry before the calves could finally be loaded and the ship could depart.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.3/3">All the calves were considered to be unweaned. During the morning, SVS staff at Dover considered that they needed to be fed and offered liquid. However, there is no staging point in the south-east and no facility within the port to make up warm milk formula. No single UK staging point could take all the animals so the vehicles were sent to the nearest suitable staging point or destination, as appropriate. Four vehicles were served with notices to proceed to a staging point close to the port of arrival and unload the animals for 24 hours' rest, feed and water. Checks are being carried out to confirm if the vehicles went to the staging point as directed. If they did not, it would be an offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.3/4">One calf was humanely destroyed at Dover because it was in a state of collapse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.3/5">SVS staff are working with local authority enforcement officers to determine appropriate enforcement action and potential offences committed. We will also be addressing the broader issues of effective communication and contingency planning with those engaged in the live calf export trade.</p>

	<p pid="b.1515W.0/1">A number of studies have investigated the linkages between the illicit and the legal economies in Afghanistan. The World Bank Country Economic Report &quot;Afghanistan: State Building, Sustaining Growth and Reducing Poverty&quot; and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Selected Issues Paper 2006: &quot;Macroeconomic Impact of the Drug Economy and Counter-Narcotics Efforts&quot; suggest that the opium economy is a major source of investment in durable goods, housing, construction and trade. Income generated in the illicit sector fuels higher consumption (spending) in the economy, creating more demand for locally produced goods and imports. However, they also emphasise that the negative effects of the opium economy&mdash;insecurity, diminished respect for the rule of law and weak state institutions&mdash;undermine the investment climate and reduce the prospects for equitable and sustained growth. Furthermore, a large part of the income generated by exporting opium is invested abroad by traffickers, which is effectively 'capital flight' out of the country. The IMF and the World Bank conclude that, in economic terms, the drug trade causes more damage than benefit to the Afghan economy. It is worth noting since 2002 the growth of the licit sector at double digit rates has meant that opium as a share of total economic activity has declined from nearly 40 per cent. to just over 25 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1515W.3/2">Since 2001, DFID has spent over &pound;390 million on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan. Over this period there has been real progress. Regarding infrastructure, major road rehabilitation is connecting major urban centres and Afghanistan with its neighbours. Reliable electricity supply is being restored. The telecommunications sector is growing fast, connecting businesses and people in Afghanistan. Public services are also improving. There are now 60 per cent. more functioning health clinics, 35,000 lives have been saved from routine immunisations, 6 million children have returned to school, over a third of them girls, and 13,000 girls' and boys' primary and secondary schools have been built. Over 60,000 police have been trained over this period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1515W.3/3">DFID contributes a large proportion of its support through the Government budget. In 2006-07 75 per cent. of our &pound;102 million budget will be channelled in this way. This helps the Government implement their own infrastructure and public service plans. DFID also specifically supports the National Rural Access Programme (&pound;18 million) which is helping to build essential infrastructure such as irrigation schemes, roads and bridges. Under this programme nearly 8,000 km of roads have been built or repaired, as well as schools, health clinics and water schemes. The programme has also generated over 13 million days of labour. Additionally, DFID support for the National Solidarity Programme (&pound;17 million) is helping local communities through elected Community Development Councils (CDCs) to identify what development is most needed in their areas and then receive grants to undertake their work. The programme has funded over 17,000 projects in the areas of agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power supply, transport and water supply.</p>

	<p pid="b.1516W.2/1">Germany has been leading efforts to train and reform the Afghan National Police with assistance from the US. Since August 2002, there have been some considerable achievements. Over 50,000 police of all ranks and branches have been trained at the re-established Police Academy and at five regional training centres. A pay and rank review is under way, aiming to reduce the current top-heavy structure and raise police salaries in order to attract the best candidates. An international conference on border management and police was co-hosted by Afghanistan and Germany in Qatar in February. It endorsed the finding that replenishment of the Law and Order Trust Fund, used to partly fund police salaries, was critical to the success of police pay and rank reform. We support this finding and the valuable work that the international community, in particular Germany and the US, are putting into police training and reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.1516W.2/2">The Afghan National Army has been built almost from scratch since 2001 and we are still in early stages of training and mentoring. Nevertheless, there has been good progress on the training of soldiers: over 28,000 Afghan troops have now been recruited and trained at the Kabul Military Training Centre. The Afghan Minister for Defence recently announced that the five Regional Commands are now operational and there are now 34,000 soldiers, NCOs and officers in the Afghan National Army (ANA). Already the ANA is regularly contributing to resolving conflicts in the UK sectors and we will continue to work closely with it to build its capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1517W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.2/2">A review of the Afghan Government National Solidarity Programme (NSP) assessed in detail women's inclusion in the Community Development Councils (CDCs) that had been established under the programme. The review found that to date there had been insufficient women's participation in the processes of community decision-making and project implementation, and limited allocation of project funds for women. Slow progress in the area of women's participation was attributed mainly to cultural opposition. In some cases only small and unsustainable projects for women were accepted by the communities. However, gradual change is occurring as the NSP gains community acceptance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.2/3">In response to the review, DFID has endorsed the recommendation for more effort to be placed on improving women's participation, but this has to be done gradually to ensure communities do not respond negatively. DFID has also endorsed the recommendation that, where necessary, female-only CDCs can be created. Those female-only CDCs that have already been established have become a forum for discussion on other relevant issues (health, domestic violence, literacy, etc.) that women could not discuss openly before in some mixed gender CDCs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.2/4">One case highlighted in a forthcoming DFID publication of a success story in Afghanistan is that of Aqilah Jan, who is a chair of the CDC in Ghor Province. She believes in the three years since the CDCs started, there have been many changes for women. Many girls are encouraged to go to school and five women are in the CDC and four in the Provincial Council.</p>

	<p pid="b.1517W.5/1">The planting season will begin in the south and east of Afghanistan in the next few weeks. Farmers' decisions on whether or not to plant opium poppy are complex. Economic factors are the main incentive but other factors such as insecurity and weak governance also play a role. While there was a significant increase in the total poppy production this year, in areas of Afghanistan where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved in 2005 were sustained and in some cases improved upon.</p>

We support the right of the Bangladeshi Government to take legitimate measures to maintain law and order, but impunity in the law enforcement and security forces remains an issue of serious concern.

	<p pid="b.1519W.8/1">UK forces' ammunition in Iraq is accessible only to UK personnel The Iraqi security forces (ISF) do not draw their ammunition from UK supplies. Thorough measures are in place to prevent any interference with UK ammunition supplies at all stages in the supply and distribution chain. These include secure containment with restricted access, regular patrols, and thorough auditing. There is no evidence of diversion or unauthorised removal of UK ammunition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.8/2">The UK has gifted infrastructure, vehicles and other equipment, including ammunition, direct to the ISF, in order that they will be able to undertake security tasks with less recourse to Multi-National Forces (MNF). This has taken place under the auspices of project Osiris, which the House has been informed of prior to donations. Thorough measures are in place to avoid the possibility of diversion of this equipment, including checking and logging of stocks on arrival, UK military supervision of hand-over, and checking and recording the identification of recipients. After hand-over, the ISF take full responsibility for the security of equipment, although some routine inventory checks are subsequently still carried out by Multi-National Forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.1520W.2/1">The UN operates in Iraq and monitors the levels of violence and conflict-related deaths. The numbers of deaths cited in the UN Human Rights Reports are taken from Iraqi Ministry of Health figures. Maintaining records of civilian deaths in Iraq is ultimately a matter for the Government of Iraq and we believe they are best placed to monitor the situation. In many conflict situations it would be impossible to make a reliably accurate assessment either of the civilian casualties resulting from any particular attacks or of the overall civilian casualties of a conflict. This is true in the security conditions that exist in Iraq. It is unlikely that an independent body could gain better access than the Iraqi Ministries, including the Ministry of Health, which collates information from some 180 hospitals across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1521W.3/1">Through its contribution to United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, (UNIFIL) the EU is supporting the Lebanese Government in extending their authority throughout the whole of Lebanese territory. EU member states comprise the bulk of troops deployed to UNIFIL acting under its new mandate. The UNIFIL mission is currently under French command. As a result of UNlFIL's efforts so far, the Lebanese army is now deployed in south Lebanon for the first time in 30 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1521W.3/2">The other main area of EU involvement is on managing points of entry, where Germany has taken on a forward role in border, port and airport security. Germany deployed a team of consultants based at the airport to assist the Lebanese with their aviation security shortly after the conflict ended. It has offered advice and equipment to improve management of the Lebanon/Syria border. Germany has also taken on the task of supporting the Government of Lebanon with their maritime security under UNIFIL. This operation took over on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-15">15 October</phrase> from an interim maritime task force comprised of a number of international partners (UK, France, Italy, Greece) which had been carrying out monitoring off Lebanon's shores under an Italian lead. The UK deployed HMS York as part of this arrangement. The EU is also collectively exploring the options for providing enhanced border security and security sector assistance for the wider Lebanese security forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1521W.3/3">The UK's contribution has been a commitment of &pound;2.5 million for security sector assistance. There is currently a Ministry of Defence (MOD) minute before the house detailing UK proposals to supply the Lebanese with 50 vehicles. The MOD is also planning to provide counter-terrorism training and we are looking to identify the equipment and training needs of the security forces and co-ordinating donor responses. We have allocated &pound;320,000 for counter-terrorism assistance in Lebanon, including training for border security, police capacity building and aviation security and assistance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1522W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-20">20 September</phrase>, the Quartet (EU, UN, US and Russia) met in New York and endorsed the continuation and expansion of the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) for a three-month period, and agreed to again review the need for such a mechanism at the end of that period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.5/3">The EU had already expanded the TIM in response to the G8 statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-16">16 July</phrase>. The scope was widened to include more of the poorest Palestinian Government workers. Workers in the medical sector, PA employees who earn less than 2,000 New Israeli Shekels a month, pensioners, and recipients of welfare from the Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs have received allowances through the TIM. This totals 98,000 recipients. Their allowances help them to continue working and provide their families with a modest income, and help to inject money into the Palestinian economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.5/4">In the light of the serious humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, the EU is considering how further to expand the TIM. Officials discussed the issue in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October</phrase>. The plans currently under consideration would increase the number of recipients of TIM allowances considerably while maintaining the rigorous auditing procedures that have been applied so far. The World Bank is expected to provide support for the water, sanitation and electricity sectors and to deliver essential medical supplies in November.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.5/5">As I reported to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October</phrase>, the UK has committed a total of &pound;9 million to the TIM. Of this, &pound;3 million is for allowances to the poorest Palestinian Government workers, &pound;3 million is for essential medical supplies and &pound;3 million is for water, sanitation and electricity. I intend to allocate a further &pound;3 million to the TIM as the need for further funding arises. This is in addition to the UK's contribution to European Community support. European Community support for the Palestinians in 2006 totals more than &euro;340 million. This is considerably more than the European Community has given on average in recent years.</p>

It is vital that investigations are thorough and credible and provide a proper basis, where necessary, for due legal process. We therefore welcome the agreement of the Australian Government to provide forensic technical assistance for the Muttur investigation.
