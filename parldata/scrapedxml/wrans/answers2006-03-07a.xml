Given that the number of VDPs is largely determined by the number of dental undergraduates and there had been no significant increase in admissions to dental schools until we funded a major expansion from autumn 2005, it may, however, be assumed that these figures have remained fairly constant since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="a.1242W.9/1">No assessment has been carried out centrally. It is for primary care trusts in partnership with strategic health authorities, local authorities and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of services for children with dysfluency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1243W.5/1">To minimise abuse and neglect of older people, the Department has been active in promoting better and more consistent standards of care through the publication and implementation of the national service framework for older people and the introduction of national minimum standards (NMS) for a range of services provided to older people in their own homes or in care settings. Employers in regulated social care services have a statutory duty to ensure the safety of older people by training staff to prevent service users from being harmed or being placed at risk of harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.1243W.5/2">We also expect local councils and providers of non-regulated social care to comply by &quot;No Secrets&quot;, a statutory guide for developing a multi-agency framework for prevention and investigation of abuse to vulnerable adults. &quot;No Secrets&quot;, jointly published by the Department and the Home Office in 2000, provides a complete definition of abuse and a framework for councils to work with the police, the national health service and regulators to tackle and prevent abuse occurring. It encourages councils to publicise their adult protection procedures so that all older people are aware of how to seek help if needed. &quot;No Secrets&quot; gives local councils the lead for development of adult protection committees. A copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1243W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase>, I announced that the General Social Care Council is undertaking a consultation on registering the social care work force. This will allow us to set standards for people seeking social care jobs and to take sanctions against people if they fall below those standards of registration. A well-trained and fully registered work force will enable older people, parents and children to have confidence in the people who care for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.2/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) Sentinel programme, began in 2002 following formal Government procurement processes. The expected life of the programme is 10 years and to date has cost around &pound;19 million, which incorporates enhancements to the scope of the original programme. The MHRA is currently using Sentinel to handle all applications for marketing authorisations and variations, for clinical trial certificates and for import and export licences, as well as a range of internal corporate functions, and will soon extend Sentinel to pharmacovigilence, including new capabilities for signal generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.2/3">Recently assessment approval times have lengthened, mainly due to delays in validating applications, and assessment targets are not being met in a proportion of cases although urgent cases are being processed promptly. Some technical problems were encountered when parts of the Sentinel programme were implemented, which is not unusual for a project of this complexity, but those have been or are being resolved. Positive improvements have already been achieved and more are forecast. Sentinel's development is founded in its ability to handle electronic submissions and as industry increases its use of the external portal for this purpose, the workflow will be further streamlined.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.2/4">Sentinel completely revolutionises the MHRA's approach to information management and processing and will put the them in a leading position in its ability to handle electronic submissions, attract revenues from within and outside the United Kingdom and to remain a centre of excellence for medicines regulation. It will enable improved access to information to assist in the protection of public health and provide a better service to all its stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1255W.12/1">There are no current economic sanctions or restrictions on sourcing goods from Burma and so it would be inappropriate for my Department to set special contract terms for goods made in Burma.</p>
	<p pid="a.1255W.12/2">Government policy on trade with Burma is to offer no support to British companies who want to trade there, informing those who inquire about trade with Burma of the grave political situation, the regime's atrocious record on human rights and record of economic mismanagement. This is in line with the common position on Burma adopted by the EU in 1996 and renewed in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1255W.12/3">As far as I am aware there is no evidence to suggest that my Department has purchased any goods from Burma recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.1255W.12/4">As far as policy on forestry is concerned, the Government are working closely with the NGO Global Witness on how best to protect Burma's forests. Their recent report, &quot;A Choice for China&quot; calls for a ban on illegally logged timber. It did not, however, support a ban on all timber from Burma in recognition of the complexity of the problem. Instead, Global Witness called for timber companies not to import illegally logged timber, and for the Chinese Government to suspend importation of logs and processed timber across the China-Burma border. This is pending a review of the legality of all logging operations in Kachin state. Global Witness's work has had a significant impact in Burma, and as a result of their highlighting this problem, the State Peace and Development Council and the Chinese Government have taken steps to clamp down on the illegal trade. According to Global Witness, the destructive logging and vast timber trade on the China-Burma border have come to a near halt over the past four months although it is not clear how permanent such moves will be.</p>

Discussions on the challenge fund focused largely on the principle of participation, with an indicative contribution for the duration of the fund of the order of &pound;300,000-&pound;500,000 based pro-rata on population.

	<p pid="a.1261W.0/1">The Government are aware of the problems associated with private sewers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.0/2">Few records are kept of private sewers and a breakdown of how many houses in each local authority connect to private sewers is not available. It is estimated that up to 50 per cent. of properties in England and Wales connect to private sewers in one form or another. Householders are often unaware that their property is connected to a private sewer or that they are responsible for its maintenance (sometimes jointly with others) until a problem occurs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.0/3">The Government have taken action to tackle the problems associated with private sewers in two stages. The first stage is designed to prevent the creation of further private sewers. A voluntary protocol for the construction of new sewers was introduced in April 2002 which detailed a build standard to make sewers suitable for adoption by water and sewerage companies (WaSCs). A recent review of the protocol conducted on behalf of Government by WS Atkins Consultants Ltd. (Atkins) found that less than 1 per cent. of developers were adhering to it. The Government are currently considering whether the protocol should therefore be mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.0/4">The second stage looks at existing private sewers. Research commissioned from Atkins formed the basis of a public consultation reviewing existing arrangements for private sewers and drains in England and Wales. The consultation sought views on a number of possible solutions to the problems they pose. The majority of respondents favoured transferring ownership of private sewers to WaSCs. The Government published their initial response to the consultation in October 2004, which summarised responses, gave the Government's preliminary views and set out the issues that needed to be addressed before a final decision is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.0/5">Defra held a seminar in January 2005 with over 90 relevant stakeholders to agree sustainable options for transferring ownership of private sewers and lateral drains. The information gathered through discussions at the seminar will inform the Government's final decision. Further information on the seminar is available on Defra's website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.0/6">Defra also commissioned market research to explore customers' possible views on the transfer of private sewers. A qualitative customer survey comprised 20 focus groups across England and Wales and a final report explaining the findings is available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.0/7">The Government intend to publish their decision on how to deal with existing private sewers and lateral drains in England and Wales in the next few months,, but do not rule out further consultation on implementation options should a decision be taken to transfer their ownership to WaSCs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1262W.8/1">The Sustainable Procurement Task force was set up in May 2005 under the Government's Sustainable Development Strategy. The Task Force, under the chairmanship of Sir Neville Simms, is a business led group reporting jointly to DEFRA's Secretary of State and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The Task Force will deliver a Sustainable Procurement National Action Plan to DEFRA and HM Treasury before the end of April 2006, enabling the UK Government to bring about a step change in public procurement such that, by 2009, it can meet the goal in the Sustainable Development Strategy of the UK being recognised as amongst the leaders in sustainable procurement across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.8/2">The Task Force is addressing five key themes: international benchmarking; data and priorities; engaging with the supply base; accountability; and capacity and is building on existing and previous initiatives in sustainable procurement. These include the Market Transformation Programme; the Sustainable Procurement Group; the Quick Wins list published jointly by DEFRA and the OGC; the joint note by the OGC and DEFRA on environmental issues in purchasing; the Framework for the Government Estate, which required every Department to have published a sustainable procurement strategy by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>; the work of the Sustainable Development Commission, Envirowise, WRAP and The Carbon Trust amongst others; the work of the Strategic Supply Chain Group; the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative and the Catering Services Toolkit; the UK's timber procurement policy; and, most recently, the OGC's note on Social Issues in Purchasing. The UK is leading work in the EU on green public procurement under the Environmental Technologies Action Plan. The UK is a member of the OECD Steering Group on Green Public Procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.8/3">DEFRA is working closely with its suppliers to ensure that products, equipment and services supplied to it are from approved recognised sustainable sources; has grouped its commodities and services into categories and is implementing a category management strategy; seeks every opportunity to work collaboratively with the NAO, the OGC and other public and private sector bodies to adopt and implement sustainable best practice. Two recent examples include the cross public sector travel procurement tender and the pan Government printed paper contract.

	<p pid="a.1266W.3/1">The new affordability tariff in Northern Ireland is being introduced in response to particular circumstances which do not apply in England and Wales. A parallel cannot be drawn which might warrant extending the scheme to England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.3/2">Northern Ireland has a public sector water service and there are no household water and sewerage charges. The costs are instead met by local and national taxation. This is set to change in April 2007, when charges will be introduced for the first time. As no charges have been paid before, the Government decided to ease the transition towards full cost recovery, phasing in the charges gradually over a three-year period. The new affordability tariff in Northern Ireland will be based on income and set at a level equivalent to 3 per cent. of the single person's pension credit guarantee, as updated by Parliament each year. The status of the protection will be reviewed after three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.3/3">The water industry in England and Wales is within the private sector and costs are met by charges to customers, a system which is long established. It is not appropriate to subsidise private water companies with taxpayers' money. Subsidies would reduce incentives for companies to improve their performance, and to be accountable to their customers.</p>

The criteria under which the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decides whether to prosecute cases is firstly whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and secondly, whether it is then in the public interest to proceed. The CPS took the view, having obtained advice from independent counsel, that the requirements of both these tests were fulfilled and it was therefore right for the case to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1279W.17/1">Crowding is measured on those services in the West Midlands which are specified by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (CENTRO) and operated by Central Trains. Central Trains count the number of passengers on each train serving Birmingham during the morning and evening peak on two occasions a year. Count data is available from 1999 onwards and the figures have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.17/2">Franchises which are not covered by the Passengers in Excess of Capacity or Passenger Transport Executive capacity regimes are under a contractual obligation to plan their timetable in such a way as to manage passenger demand and prevent overcrowding being concentrated on one route.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.17/3">Network Rail is responsible for developing route utilisation strategies, which seek to balance capacity, passenger and freight demand, operational performance and cost.

	<p pid="a.1280W.2/1">The number of serious personal injury road accidents on motorways and other dual carriageway roads in Great Britain has decreased year on year over the last five years. Casualty figures for 2004 show a 10 per cent. reduction in the number of serious accidents on motorways and a 21 per cent. reduction in the number of serious accidents on other dual carriageway roads, compared to the 1994&ndash;98 baseline averages. This is against a background of increases of 37 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively in the total billion vehicle kilometres travelled on these roads in 2004, compared to in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280W.2/2">Driving in excess of the speed limit amongst car drivers on motorways and non-urban dual carriageways has remained largely constant over the last five years. In 2004, 56 per cent. of cars exceeded the speed limit on motorways, and 48 per cent. on non-urban dual carriageways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280W.2/3">Tackling excessive speed on all roads is a priority for the Government and we work closely with the police to ensure the safe and reliable operation of Great Britain's strategic road networks. For example, the roll out of the Highways Agency Traffic Officer service across England's motorway network is enabling more police time and resources to be used on core police activities, including speed enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1283W.14/1">The location of deployments undertaken by elements of the Royal Logistics Corps (RLC), Royal Signals (R SIGNALS) and Royal Engineers (RE) over the past five years has been placed in the Library of the House. Such deployments are normally conducted at sub-unit level and below, and vary in duration and composition of personnel involved, some involving a number of short visits to theatre. While the length of time between such deployments (or 'Tour Intervals' (TI)) is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost, in general terms the average TI's for each Regiment is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="a.1283W.14/4"> <th></th> <th>Months</th> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.1283W.14/7"> <td>RLC</td> <td>29.3</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.1283W.14/12">Of course, it is recognised that these are &quot;pinch point&quot; trades where the TI's are much shorter. Future Army structures will address these concerns by investing in trade groups that have been in high demand (such as engineers and logisticians), whilst restructuring the Army to better enable Brigade level operations, including ensuring that each deployable Brigade has its own integral enablers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1285W.11/1">The formal framework for discussions between the two Departments is set out in a Concordat, first signed by my predecessor and his Department of Health (DH) counterpart in 2002, and revised in 2005 to include the other UK Health Authorities, which sets out how the Defence Medical Services and the NHS will work together to further their individual and mutual aims of delivering high quality healthcare to both the UK armed forces and NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.11/2">A joint MOD/DH Partnership Board, co-chaired by senior MOD and DH personnel, meets three times a year to monitor the effectiveness of the Concordat and to explore mutual areas of co-operation. I am kept informed of the work of the Partnership Board. In 2005, the Partnership Board approved revised Health Guidance for the NHS covering, among other things, arrangements for the continuing care of service personnel on retirement or discharge from the armed forces. This guidance specifies that, for a very small group who have a significant and debilitating illness at the time of medical discharge, ;it is essential that the MOD is able to engage as soon as possible with the Primary Care Trust of future residence to ensure that there is a seamless transfer of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.11/3">The MOD has work in hand to ensure that there is a coherent response to veterans' mental health issues, co-ordinating inputs from the NHS, Health Departments throughout the UK, the Services and ex-Service organisations including the specialist mental health charity, Combat Stress. In support of these developments, MOD is also working on a number of in-Service initiatives, for example relating to the prevention and management of problems arising out of operational stress and to the need to address issues of stigma and discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="a.1286W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence is exceptional among employers in the extent to which it seeks to maintain contact with and offer support to those who have left service. The Veterans Agency is the focus for maintaining contact and provides a helpline service that offer advice or puts the veteran in touch with Government or non-Government agencies that can offer the assistance sought. Particular assistance is offered to those who are discharged for medical reasons and, where the condition is due to service, pensions may be payable from the War Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme attributable pension; contact is maintained with the leaver to establish eligibility and to ensure that the appropriate payments are made. Those in receipt of a War Pension are provided with practical advice and assistance from the War Pensions Welfare Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286W.5/2">There are wider welfare arrangements in the event of death or serious injury and the Department also works closely with ex-Service organisations to support their work in providing assistance and advice to those who have left the armed forces, particularly where they have welfare needs. Assistance is provided to eligible Service personnel to identify employment opportunities after they have left the armed forces and this can be provided up to two years after discharge. More generally, we are proud of the achievements of our veterans and take a wide range of opportunities to celebrate their successes and to commemorate their sacrifices. We seek to involve veterans closely in these events.</p>

	<p pid="a.1290W.5/1">We are aware that migrant workers arriving in the United Kingdom to work in a range of industries may face difficulties in understanding their rights. We have offered to work with the Governments of all the new EU member states, to prepare bi-lingual &quot;know before you go&quot; leaflets for migrant workers seeking temporary work, giving advice on questions to ask before leaving the country and on legal protections offered to workers including details of the national minimum wage and agricultural minimum wage and the relevant helpline numbers. It is particularly important to reach workers in the host country before they leave as it is often much harder to help workers, who may not speak English and have no accommodation arranged, once they arrive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.5/2">To date we have produced leaflets in partnership with the Portuguese, Polish and Lithuanian Governments and are still in talks with other Governments. These benefited from input from the TUC, the CBI and other stakeholders and have been distributed widely in both the workers' home countries and the UK, for example via Citizen's Advice Bureaux. In Poland, for example, they have been publicised on television and our embassy and the Polish authorities have worked hard to distribute them via job centres, recruitment fairs and other channels. The text of the leaflets is also available on the DTI website:</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.5/3"><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant_workers.htm">http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant_workers.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.5/4">We are currently updating the three leaflets to ensure they contain up to date information on, for example, national minimum wage rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.5/5">HMRC enforce the national minimum wage on behalf of the DTI. Each month HMRC select a sample of employers with workers from the new European Union accession countries who have registered under the Workers Registration Scheme. These employers are inspected to ensure that they are complying with the requirements of the national minimum wage legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.5/6">The Home Office also provide information to workers from EU accession countries. Nationals of the new member states (except Cyprus and Malta) working in the UK are subject to the Worker Registration Scheme. When subject to the scheme, they need to register with the Home Office if they plan to work for more than one month for an employer in the UK. Workers subject to registering with the Worker Registration Scheme receive information on employment rights as a matter of course. A leaflet setting out the rights and responsibilities of nationals from the new member states is available on the Home Office website:</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.5/7"><a href="http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/schemes_and_programmes/worker_registration.Maincontent.0003.file.tmp/Home%20Office%20WRS%2020pp%PROOF.pdf">http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_ uk/en/homepage/schemes_and_programmes/worker_re gistration.Maincontent.0003.file.tmp/Home%20Office%20 WRS%2020pp%PROOF.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.5/8">The Government's decision that nationals from these countries should have, subject to the registration requirements of the Worker Registration Scheme, access to the labour market and freedom to change employers should mean that they are significantly less vulnerable to exploitation than they were previously.</p>

	<p pid="a.1293W.0/2">The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) is wholly owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). NERC science budget allocation has doubled since 1997 to 334 million for this year, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the quality of environmental research in the UK. NERC is responsible for determining the details of how this funding is allocated to specific activities. NERC is currently considering the input from a wide consultation with stakeholders on proposals on how best CEH can contribute on a sustainable basis to UK environmental science in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1293W.0/3">NERC has set out the criteria used in developing the proposals in the CEH Business Plan (available on the NERC website). The proposals were informed by assessments by an international peer review and a moderating panel, leading to recommendations to NERC Council from NERC's Science and Innovation Strategy Board. This included assessment of the science quality, value for money and the fit of the CEH science proposal to NERC's strategy. In addition, there was input from a strategic review of CEH conducted by independent consultants in 2005, which enabled NERC to estimate the likely level of future commissioned research income that CEH could expect to win. NERC also factored in the necessary level of future investment in the facilities for the research carried out by CEH.</p>

	<p pid="a.1293W.3/2">The tree was presented to NPL in 1953 by the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and is derived from a graft from an old tree at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire, the birthplace of Sir Isaac Newton and where, according to tradition, Newton was inspired by a falling apple in developing his theory of gravitation. The tree at NPL is one of a number of similar descendants around the world. Public access to this tree is not possible but a similar, and perhaps more directly related, tree can be seen at Woolsthorpe Manor, which is in the care of the National Trust.</p>

	<p pid="a.1294W.3/1">Under UN Treaties, the Government are internationally responsible for activities in outer space carried on by its nationals, and assumes certain liabilities for damage caused to third parties as a result of those activities. The Department administers the Outer Space Act 1986, which requires that such space activities be licensed. Anyone who carries on a licensable activity gives an unlimited indemnity to the Government against claims. The Department seeks to secure indemnification in part by requiring &pound;100 million insurance cover. If the insurance policy proved insufficient to cover a particular claim, the licensee would be required to indemnify the Government of the excess. However, if the licensee were unable to meet this, the Government would have to fund the remainder from its own resources. Hence, there is a contingent liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.1298W.6/1">We keep under review the use of reduced rates for construction work where these could help support regeneration and renewal, and to date have targeted relief at areas of specific need, such as certain residential conversions (including converting a non-residential property into single household dwellings or converting a house into flats) and the renovation of housing that has been empty for more than three years. These measures have helped bring vacant homes back into use and create new homes through better use of the UK's existing housing stock. However, a blanket reduced rate for all household repairs is unlikely to be an efficient or well-targeted use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1298W.6/2">While agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones.</p>

	<p pid="a.1301W.5/1">PAYE has developed over the years and does not have one computer system, but rather a number of systems that process, hold and support PAYE data. Enhancements have been made to these systems over the last five years, and there is currently one ongoing major upgrade to the PAYE computer support for electronic filing of employer end of year returns. This is the modernising PAYE processes for customers (MPPC) programme. In 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 approximately &pound;27.5 million and &pound;38 million was spent by the project.</p>

	<p pid="a.1302W.3/1">Social exclusion is a problem with many dimensions, which is recognised and prioritised in the Treasury's objectives and closely linked to other aspects of the department's work. Treasury objective 2 is to increase the productivity of the economy and expand economic and employment opportunities for all; Treasury objective 4 is to promote a fair, efficient and integrated tax and benefit system with incentives to work, save and invest. The work of many of the Treasury's teams contributes towards these objectives, working with other Departments where appropriate. For example, the Treasury established the Financial Inclusion Taskforce to increase access to banking, affordable credit and face-to-face money advice. The Treasury's 2006&ndash;07 budget includes &pound;1 million to fund the work of the taskforce and the Treasury team supporting it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1310W.2/2">Current legislation dictates that compensation orders must be prioritised over other sums ordered to be paid on conviction by the courts. From <phrase class="date" code="">27 March</phrase>, new enforcement sanctions will be available to all magistrates courts as part of the national rollout of the Courts Act 2003 fines collection scheme, which will greatly improve the collection and enforcement of all financial impositions, including compensation orders. The Green Paper &quot;Rebuilding Lives&mdash;supporting victims of crime&quot; (December 2005) proposes extending the current Courts Act 2003 Deduction from Benefit Orders sanction to all cases involving compensation, regardless of default. In addition, HMCS is planning further enforcement blitz operations in areas with sizeable amounts of compensation payments outstanding to specifically target monies owed to the victims of crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.1315W.0/2">Correspondence between the UK and other countries relating to mutual legal assistance and extradition is by its very nature confidential and the Home Office would normally neither confirm nor deny that such requests have been received or considered by UK authorities. I am aware that a number of documents relating to this case have apparently been leaked to the press.</p>
	<p pid="a.1315W.0/3">As a result it is clear that advice on extradition matters has been sought and that requests for mutual legal assistance have been received and acted upon. Regardless of this development, and considering the Government's policy to decline to comment on leaked documents, I consider it right to retain the confidentiality of these documents and as such they will not be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1322W.9/1">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) is working closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food (DAF) in the Republic of Ireland in taking measures to deal with the threat of avian influenza. Given the mutual interest in ensuring that any outbreak on the island is identified quickly as a first step to its eradication and recognising the importance of the poultry industry, DARD officials have had frequent contact with their counterparts in Dublin over recent months to exchange information and discuss the respective approaches. These discussions have covered such issues as wild bird surveillance, the assessment of risk, preventive actions taken to date in both jurisdictions, and contingency planning. DAF officials have participated as observers in the exercises DARD has held to test its contingency plan and DARD officials have participated as observers in the Republic of Ireland. DARD has been invited to send an observer to meetings of the recently convened Republic of Ireland's Avian Influenza Expert Advisory Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1322W.9/2">The control of Avian Influenza is based on an EU legal framework, which means that the preventive measures being taken North and South, and the control measures that would be taken in the event of a disease outbreak, are broadly similar. Arrangements are in place to ensure that there is effective communication between the two Departments in the event of an outbreak and to regulate trade in accordance with EU requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1331W.2/1">The Department has issued guidance to schools indicating that wherever possible preference should be given to newly qualified teachers, or experienced teachers seeking to return to employment, rather than prematurely retired teachers, when filling vacancies. Schools have also been advised that they should recruit to vacancies on a permanent rather than temporary basis unless the vacancy is clearly of a temporary nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.2/2">Moreover, following the review of teacher education in Northern Ireland which is being carried out jointly by the Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning, the Departments jointly will be exploring means by which newly qualified teachers can have greater stability in employment during their early years of teaching.</p>

	<p pid="a.1337W.2/1">The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirms that around 40 humanitarian organisations currently work in Chechnya. Not all have a permanent presence in Chechnya and very few have international staff based there. If international staff visit at all, they are usually sent in only for the day. We estimate that these organisations have over a 100 staff, both international and local, working on rotation in Chechnya. But we have no means of assessing with any precision the number of international aid workers who have passed in and out of Chechnya. Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have offices in Chechnya staffed by locals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.2/2">Human rights work complements much of the work done by the humanitarian organisations. We estimate that there are fewer than 10 human rights organisations operating in Chechnya, but there are no accurate estimate of numbers of either organisations or staff operating in the region. Specific human rights NGOs do have local staff in Chechnya, and human rights workers based elsewhere in the Russian Federation regularly travel to Chechnya.</p>

	<p pid="a.1338W.8/1">It was disappointing that the European Court of Auditors (EGA) was unable last November to give a positive Statement of Assurance on the EC Budget for 2004. It is encouraging, however, that there have been noticeable improvements since 2003 with pre-accession expenditure once again being cleared, as it was in 2002, and, for the first time, certain areas of agricultural expenditure also gaining clearance. This has meant that around 35 per cent. of EC Budget expenditure was cleared in 2004 compared with only 6 per cent. in 2003. Much of the European Court of Auditors' difficulty in giving a positive assurance on the EU budget payments as a whole arises in the budget sector managed by the member states, who are responsible for 80 per cent. of spending under the EU budget. That is why, during our Presidency, we encouraged member states to take on a greater share of the responsibility for signing off the accounts. We succeeded in securing an agreement that will contribute to bringing about a step change in the EU's financial management and control at a meeting of EU Economic and Finance Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>. We hope that, over time, implementation of the action points in these conclusions will enable the EGA to give positive Statements of Assurance to the EC Budget in future years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1339W.3/1">Since 2000, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has worked in partnership with leading representatives of national Muslim organisations on the Hajj Advisory Group to organise the annual British Hajj Delegation (BHD). The FCO provides funding for the delegation which this year was approximately &pound;85,000. The BHD is based in Mecca during the Hajj season and provides medical, pastoral and consular assistance to British Muslims at the Hajj. Lord Patel of Blackburn has led the BHD for the last six years. For the most recent Hajj in January 2006, the BHD included 10 volunteers (nine doctors who run a medical clinic and one counsellor) and two members of staff from our consulate-general in Jeddah enabling the FCO to give consular assistance on the ground. This was particularly vital this year following the stampede at Mina which involved the deaths of three British nationals. The medical clinic also operated over a 15-day period during which the doctors assisted over 7,000 of the estimated 25,000 British pilgrims taking part in the Hajj.</p>

These covered possible long-term arrangements for Iran's nuclear programme and other areas of mutual interest. During the course of these negotiations, Iran expressed concern about European export licence decisions. In August 2005, the E3/EU proposed a framework for a long-term agreement covering Iran's nuclear programme and other political, economic and technological issues. In these proposals, the E3/EU expressed their willingness to take part in a joint export control workshop in Tehran, which would allow for exchanges on the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 and national/EC laws. Iran rejected the E3/EU proposals without serious consideration. A few days later Iran resumed uranium conversion activities in violation of the Paris Agreement, since when there have been no further negotiations under the Paris Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.8/2">The UK's national embargo on Iran was introduced in 1993, amended in 1998, and covers all goods and technology on the Military List as well as items entered in Group O (Nuclear List) in Annex 1 of the European Council Regulation (EC) 1334/2000 on the export of dual-use items and technology. There are two exceptions to this embargo, namely (i) goods essential for the safety of civil aircraft and air traffic control systems; and (ii) radioactive material in the form of sources for medical equipment and deuterium labelled compounds for medical use.</p>

	<p pid="a.1342W.2/1">The Kurdish people have a proud tradition of political participation. Following the removal of the former regime, the two Kurdish administrations agreed to form one unified Kurdish Regional Government (KRG). This will be a challenging task&mdash;merging the two governments involves downsizing from 27 to 16 Ministries and reunifying some 400,000 civil servants from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and more than 500,000 civil servants from the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).</p>
	<p pid="a.1342W.2/2">This decision is testament to the Kurds commitment to democratic rule. Nechirvan Barzani, from the KDP, has been named Prime Minister of the KRG and the position of Deputy Prime Minister will be filled by a member from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The KRG continues to play a crucial role in promoting the formation of a government of national unity, and has advocated a strong central government.</p>

These gains will be delivered from a number of distinct projects. Details of the projects, including baselines, are set out in the FCO's Efficiency Technical Note published on our website. Each project will have one or more baseline. For some projects the baselines are straightforward, for instance payments to BBC Monitoring (project 6) were &pound;7.1 million in 2004&ndash;05.

The civil service work force reduction targets in other areas of the FCO in full-time equivalents are 165 by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>, 265 by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase> and 313 by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>.

Where it has deployed there has been a decrease in attacks by all parties, including the &quot;janjaweed&quot; Arab militias. In December 2005, the UK participated in an international assessment mission conducting an in-depth review of AMIS. This concluded that AMIS has had a positive effect on both the security and humanitarian situations in Darfur and recommended further steps to increase its effectiveness. We are working closely with the African Union to ensure these steps are taken. The UK has provided more than &pound;50 million to date to support AMIS.</p>

	<p pid="a.1355W.0/1">Our Welfare Reform Green Paper; &quot;A new deal for welfare, Empowering people for work&quot;; set out our proposals for the future of the welfare state and builds on the success of our welfare to work policies such as new deal and Pathways to Work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/2">The funding for welfare reform has been drawn from the budgets provided to the Department through the 2004 Spending Review settlement which covered the financial years 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. Details are available in The departmental report 2005 (Cm 6539) published in June 2005. The &pound;360 million funding is largely to be spent extending the Pathways to Work programme beyond the pilot areas and covers 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, but may also be used to fund other measures dependent on responses to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/3">While we are still in the consultation phase a detailed costing of the various parts of our proposals is not possible. This is especially the case in relation to the costs for each Pathways to Work scheme as we are looking to the private and voluntary sector to deliver many of the Pathways schemes and it is not possible to provide detailed costs prior to contract negotiations. This is also the case when it comes to the need for additional medical professionals where we are consulting to develop the detail of the new personal capability assessment. Medical Services will be contracting doctors and other health care professionals where required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/4">However, I can tell you that if every current incapacity benefit recipient was given a work focussed interview at least once a year, we estimate the cost would be around &pound;80 million annually. The actual costs would be dependent on the numbers joining and leaving the benefit during any one year. But, although the cost savings from measures outlined in the Green Paper depend to a large extent on the final proposals following the consultation, we know that the existing Pathways pilots are already generating savings, and we expect further savings from further roll-out.</p>

	<p pid="a.1361W.8/1">The Supporting People programme was launched in April 2003 bringing together nine different funding streams that had previously been used to fund housing related support. The Government commissioned an Independent Review into Supporting People which identified that there are wide variations in unit costs between authorities and that efficiencies were available to all authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.8/2">Authorities have been required to carry out a review of all legacy services and it is through this process that efficiencies have been achieved. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also required that all authorities develop five year Supporting People strategies which set out how they intend to take the programme forward in meeting local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.8/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently consulted on the development of a future national strategy for Supporting People and will be looking at the responses to this paper over the coming months. The consultation also asked questions about future funding approaches and an announcement will be made in the summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1362W.8/1">The Government commissioned an Independent Review into the Supporting People programme following significant late growth in estimated costs from &pound;1.4 billion in December 2002 to &pound;1.8 billion by March 2003. The review reported in January 2004 that there are wide variations in unit costs between authorities and that &pound;1.8 billion was too much to pay for the services provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.8/2">Reductions in the Supporting People programme grant reflect the findings of the independent review and subsequent work carried out on value for money including work commissioned into the efficient use of legacy funding and the results of Audit Commission inspections.

	<p pid="a.1362W.11/2">We continue to keep the impact of VAT on different types of building work under review, and have introduced reduced rates where they support our regeneration and renewal objectives. However, while agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones. This means that in order to harmonise the rates of VAT on new build housing and repair, we would first have to give up our current zero rate for construction of new housing. We have no current plans to give up any of our existing construction zero rates.</p>
