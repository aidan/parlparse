	<p pid=".441W.3/1">My understanding is that the possible closure of Ashford over this weekend has yet to be confirmed, and that, currently, the station is scheduled to be open on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-02">Saturday 2 March</phrase>, although possibly closed on the Friday and Sunday. These timings are provisional and therefore subject to change.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.3/2">Although occasional weekend closures are an inevitable consequence of the essential work for the channel tunnel rail link (CTLR) currently being undertaken at and around Ashford, the timing of this particular closure, if confirmed, is particularly unfortunate. I therefore propose to raise the matter with the company building the link, Union Railways.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.3/3">The CTLR project itself remains on time and on budget and when section 1 opens in 2003 the people of Kent will of course benefit from improved international rail services on a purpose-built high-speed line that will free up capacity on existing track.</p>

	<p pid=".449W.5/1">My Department recognises the importance of the role of coastal local authorities in preparing and maintaining contingency plans for responding to shoreline pollution following marine pollution incidents, and in carrying out that response. Since the beginning of 1998, my Department has received representations concerning the introduction of a statutory duty on coastal local authorities to plan for or undertake shoreline clean-ups following marine pollution incidents from: Aberdeenshire council, Ceredigion county council, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Devon county council, Dumfries and Galloway council, Dundee city council, Fife council, KIMO (Kommunenes Internasjonale Milj organisasjon), the Local Government Association, Pembrokeshire county council, Purbeck district council, Shetland Islands council, South Ayrshire council and the Tyne and Wear Emergency Planning Unit. This is a subject which falls within the scope of the Cabinet Office's ongoing review of &quot;The Future of Emergency Planning in England and Wales&quot;, and specifically that review's proposal that existing emergency planning legislation be replaced with a new statutory duty for emergency planning, and my Department has made an input to that review. The result of the review is awaited.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.5/2">The information requested about coastal local authorities which have implemented contingency plans on a voluntary basis has been placed in the Libraries of the House, in the form of a list compiled by my Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency, using data collected in January 2001 (and which are being updated presently). Information about the amount of funding which local authorities have requested to cover the implementation of plans to undertake shoreline clean-ups following marine pollution incidents, and the amounts which local authorities have spent on setting up plans to undertake shoreline clean-ups following marine pollution incidents and on cleaning up shorelines following marine pollution incidents, is not held centrally. No specific grants have been made covering the implementation of shoreline clean-up plans following a marine pollution incident. My Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency does, however, annually provide training courses for local authority officers on oil pollution contingency planning and response, and shorter courses on oil spill response, at no cost to the local authorities involved.</p>

In particular, there are proposals to assist district councils to build their corporate capacity, encouragement for greater county and district collaboration, including in local PSAs, and additional freedoms which will be available to high performing districts in due course. Districts will also benefit from the deregulation proposals, the streamlining of best value and the move to a more proportionate approach to inspection.</p>

	<p pid=".454W.8/1">The Merseyrail franchise operates on a network of lines which are almost entirely separate, physically and operationally, from the rest of the national rail network. The current franchise expires in February 2003. Merseytravel (the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive and Passenger Transport Authority) has brought forward proposals to take Merseyrail services outside the franchising process operated by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), leaving the way open for Merseytravel to offer a local concession (in effect, similar to a franchise) for these services. Having discussed the proposals in detail with both the SRA and Merseytravel I have it in mind to support this approach which will provide local control over this unique local network and will help bring much needed improvements for passengers.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.8/2">I accordingly intend, after consultation, to seek the House's approval to an Order under the Railways Act 1993, which will enable the new arrangements to be given effect. In the meantime the SRA will continue to work with Merseytravel on the future of these services.</p>

The herds affected are those in annual test frequency parishes that have missed the six and 12 month tests carried out after the lifting of movement restrictions put in place after an earlier TB incident. A veterinary risk assessment has shown that these have been historically more at risk of being infected with TB than herds with other types of TB test.

	<p pid=".466W.5/1">By the end of the century there will be half a million tonnes of radioactive waste. Some of it will be potentially dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. Deciding the best way to manage it is one of the greatest environmental challenges we have ever faced. The Government and the devolved Administrations published the consultation paper &quot;Managing radioactive waste safely&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-12">12 September</phrase>. We propose a programme of national debate and research, leading to scientifically sound decisions on the long-term management of radioactive waste which inspire public confidence across the UK. In the meantime radioactive waste is safely stored, and rigorously controlled by regulators including the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.5/2">I gave further details of our policy in oral evidence to the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs inquiry into radioactive waste management at its hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December</phrase>. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March</phrase> and we hope that people all over the UK will let us have their views.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.5/3">Information on the quantity, radioactive components and location of high, intermediate and low level radioactive waste in the UK is published in the &quot;United Kingdom radioactive waste inventory&quot;. A copy of the most recent inventory, for 1998, was placed in the Library of the House and I have sent a copy on CD to the hon. Member. The latest inventory, for 2001, is being completed by Electrowatt-Ekono (UK) under contract to my Department and to UK Nirex Ltd., and will be published later this year. I shall place a copy in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.5/4">Data have not been collected in such a way as to give the quantities of intermediate and high level waste produced in the last 12 months. However, the 1998 inventory gives the total likely arising of the wastes (when expressed in conditioned form) over the 10-year period 2000&ndash;09 as 30,815 and 799 cubic metres respectively. Assuming a uniform rate of arising, then the arisings of high and intermediate level waste in the last 12 months would have been about 3,100 and 80 cubic metres respectively. Intermediate level waste is produced at locations too numerous to list; they are predominantly nuclear licensed sites but also include many hospitals and small users of radioactive sources. High level waste is only produced at Sellafield.</p>

	<p pid=".468W.2/1">Waste composting activities, including the emissions of bioaerosols from waste composting schemes, are regulated by the controls contained in Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. Waste composting activities must be licensed with the Environment Agency or operate under a registered exemption, and must be carried out in a way which does not harm the environment or human health. Under the 1990 Act, the Environment Agency are required to monitor waste sites, and carry out periodic inspections of waste composting schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".471W.2/1">Identification of discrete area nitrate vulnerable zones as presented under Option 2 of the current consultation paper &quot;How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive?&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-20">20 December 2001</phrase>, has required assessments of the status of several different types of water bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.2/2">For surface waters, the primary differences between current and past methodology are that the proposed designations are the result of the application of a more robust statistical methodology used to assess nitrate concentrations, coupled with the use of a more extensive water quality sampling network. Following the European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgment in 2000 that we failed to fully implement the nitrates directive, we were required to cover all waters, not just those used for drinking water supplies. The entire Environment Agency GQA monitoring network is now used. Statistical assessments of nitrate concentrations have been based on a minimum of five years of data, compared to a single year of data in the past. For the first time, trend-analysis has also been used to cover the requirement to protect those waters which may be subject to unacceptably high nitrate pollution in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.2/3">For groundwaters, the 1996 designations of groundwater NVZs were based on monitoring data taken from Public Water Supply boreholes and delineated by groundwater catchments. Following the ECJ judgment, we were required to ensure that the new methodology identifies all groundwater vulnerable to agriculturally- derived nitrate and not just the catchments (zones of contribution) for Public Supply Wells. This was accomplished by combining a statistical assessment of groundwater data with a groundwater vulnerability model derived from an examination of the risk factors associated with land use, rainfall, soil and geological characteristics. The spatial distribution of nitrate values from the monitoring network was used in conjunction with the vulnerability map to define nitrate vulnerable zones.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.2/4">The nitrates directive also requires designation of nitrate vulnerable zones draining into estuarine areas which have been adjudged to be eutrophic and where a significant proportion of nitrogen arises from diffuse agricultural sources. Such areas are identified in England under the proposals for Option 2 for the first time.</p>

However, because of the processing time that has been lost due to industrial action (which was suspended on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-11">11 January</phrase>), it is likely that more claims than usual will be carried over into February.

	<p pid=".478W.8/1">Combating sexual exploitation of children is part of a wider set of issues related to the vulnerability of poor people to the interests of the sex industry and national and international traffickers. It is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's goal is to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that may lead to such abuses. Much of our focus is on reducing the risks of young people being recruited into the industry. With other Government Departments, we are supporting the efforts of Governments and international agencies to strengthen social protection policies and justice systems in line with the international treaty framework covering these issues.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.9/1">Retaining good teachers within the profession is key to continuing to raise standards in schools. Our research has consistently shown that workload is a significant factor in influencing teachers to leave the profession. That is why we have asked the School Teachers' Review Body to consider the findings of the recent PricewaterhouseCoopers study that we commissioned into reducing teachers' workloads. The STRB will report to us by the end of April this year and we have already announced the piloting of 30 school work force pathfinders to test out innovative solutions to reducing work load and bureaucracy in schools. In addition, we made &pound;33 million available in 2001&ndash;02 directly to schools in those parts of the country where problems are greatest to fund local recruitment and retention initiatives. We have recently announced a further &pound;44 million for 2002&ndash;03. More than 3,500 teachers will also receive assistance to purchase homes in areas of high price or demand as part of the Government's &pound;250 million starter homes initiative. We have also announced our proposal to accept the STRB's recently announced recommendations, including a further above inflation pay increase of 3.5 per cent. for all teachers and that good, experienced, teachers should in future be able to receive a &pound;2,148 pay increase on crossing the threshold after five years instead of seven. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out our longer term proposals for teachers and teaching in a pamphlet, &quot;Professionalism and Trust&quot;, published in November 2001.</p>

Member are contained in the Ministry of Defence's Major Road Project Report 2001 under section 2&mdash;&quot;Project Costs&quot;, including information on the forecast receipt of liquidated damages. As to the question of further delay, the Major Project report also noted that the Department was engaged in discussions with BAE Systems over the incremental delivery of the MRA4 capability. These discussions are close to being finalised with the company. Until the negotiations have been completed, it will not be possible to be definitive about the impact, if any, on delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".495W.2/2">There are no viable alternative means of delivery the MRA4 capability. Prior to selecting the MRA4 option, an investment appraisal was conducted that considered a full range of alternatives. The findings were conclusive and confirmed the requirement for MRA4. This view has not changed.</p>

	<p pid=".496W.0/1">As I explained in my statement in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-23">23 January 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-01-23.891"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 891&ndash;902</phrase>, with regard to tax exemption of Army attributable pensions, the error was uncovered by a retired Army pensioner, Major Perry. Our records show that Major Perry first raised the taxation of his service invaliding pension in December 1997. He then went through two stages of appeal at higher levels and at each his arguments were rejected. It was only when he made a further approach that the error was recognised. The issue turned on whether only Service Attributable Pensions were tax exempt or whether, as in Major Perry's case, Service Invaliding Pensions should also be exempt. At the initial appeal stages, the position with regard to the law was misinterpreted and the difference in practice between the Army on the one hand, and the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force on the other, had not become apparent. It was only in 1998 that the correct legal position was recognised and action to remedy the error put in hand. The point at issue was not straightforward. The error should, however, have been recognised when Major Perry first raised his concerns and I can only reiterate our apology to him and those other Army pensioners or their spouses affected.</p>

	<p pid=".496W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence has already reviewed the files of retired Army personnel and Army widows who had been in receipt of an invaliding pension; this involved some 20,000 files. When we identified the error in 1998, we provided information to ex-service and war widows' associations, who responded positively to our request to advertise the error to their members. We do not believe that there are many service personnel or their widows or widowers who have not been identified. None the less, we are keen to ensure that none has been missed. We have therefore provided details to help individuals identify if they might be affected on the MOD website. We intend to undertake national publicity shortly and we will use our service journals and other material which has a wide veterans' readership to ensure maximum coverage of this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".496W.3/2">I do not intend to commission an independent inquiry on this matter.</p>
	<p pid=".496W.3/3">The original error which allowed the taxation of Army attributable service invaliding pensions occurred in the early 1950s. At this distance, we would not expect all the relevant files to have been preserved and the Army personnel concerned will have retired and in many cases be deceased. Given the major changes to the way in which pensions are administered, over the period, I would also not expect there to be lessons of current relevance. I have, however, asked officials to assess whether there are any other pensions areas which may be similarly affected.</p>

	<p pid=".497W.5/1">Neither my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence nor any of his ministerial colleagues have had such discussions. However, the Ministry of Defence's Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit has a full time Gulf Health Liaison Officer based in Washington DC, working with the US Military Veterans Health Co-ordinating Board and its subcommittees. Both directly and through the liaison officer, the MOD maintains close links with the relevant US authorities, including the executive office of the President, the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs on all issues surrounding the complex issue of Gulf veterans' illnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".497W.5/2">No-fault compensations for UK service personnel disabled as a result of their service is provided through the War Pension Scheme (WPS). The WPS applies to all those who have served in the UK forces and is administered by the MOD's War Pensions Agency (WPA). As at <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase>, the WPA had received 1,264 claims for war pension in respect of Gulf veterans' illnesses, of which 1,086 had resulted in an award. Veterans may also be eligible for an Armed Forces Pension Scheme occupational pension and, if they have been medically discharged, this is supplemented by attributable benefits linked to the degree of disability or non-attributable benefits linked to length of service, whichever is the greater.</p>
	<p pid=".497W.5/3">The MOD has about 2,000 active notices from veterans and members of their families of their intention to claim common law compensation in respect of illness allegedly arising from the Gulf conflict.

	<p pid=".498W.8/2">The Trident refit complex forms part of the overall Project D154 works at Devonport, which will provide new and upgraded facilities for the refitting of the Royal Navy's SSNBs and SSNs. A revised incentivised cost-sharing arrangement has recently been agreed with the dockyard owner, DML, for the overall project. The Ministry of Defence's share of costs to completion are estimated to be in the region of &pound;638 million to &pound;659 million excluding VAT.</p>

There is an agreed programme in place to ensure that facilities will be brought on line as required within the overall Vanguard Class (Trident) submarine refitting programme. Each facility will be commissioned and the necessary approval obtained from the nuclear regulatory authorities to meet this programme. There is no question of a particular facility being used without the appropriate regulatory approval.</p>

	<p pid=".507W.15/1">The Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit have recently undertaken a strategic review of the UK's energy policy including the longer- term role for renewable energy. The Government's work on developing environmentally friendly energy generation has continued throughout this period with several new initiatives being implemented to ensure the development of renewable sources of energy and cleaner coal technology.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.15/2">Subject to parliamentary approval, we shall shortly be implementing the Renewables Obligation. In addition, renewables generated electricity has been exempted from the climate change levy and existing Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) contracts have been protected. These measures will create a long-term market incentive for renewables worth over &pound;1 billion per year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.15/3">We are underpinning the obligation with direct Government funding for renewables worth over &pound;260 million between 2001 and 2004 and within this, we are setting up an extensive capital grants programme for offshore wind and energy crops projects, initiating a major photovoltaics demonstration programme, and boosting research and development.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.15/4">We recently implemented an order to allow locational flexibility for NFFO 3, 4 and 5 projects that have not yet been commissioned. This will allow more appropriate locations to be found in order to overcome problems in securing planning permission.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.15/5">We have initiated studies of each UK region's capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. Once all these assessments are completed, it is expected that specific regional targets for renewable energy will be adopted across the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.15/6">The Government are also exploring the scope for upgrading the electricity distribution system to enable the UK's huge renewable energy resources to be exploited to the full. For example, we have commissioned an initial study of the feasibility of an underwater cable to connect parts of the Western seaboard of the UK directly to the National Grid.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.15/7">In the Cleaner Coal technologies arena, the Government are already investing &pound;12 million over the three-year period 2000&ndash;01 to 2002&ndash;03 on research and development. We will also be publishing in the very near future the findings of the review of the case for Government support for Clean Coal Technology power plant.</p>

	<p pid=".508W.3/4" class="indent">Estimates of the total number of people suffering from mental health problems in different regions are not available from current statistical sources. However, estimates of the percentage of adults aged 16 to 74 years living in private households who were suffering from a range of mental health problems can be obtained from the results of a survey carried out in 2000. This survey of psychiatric morbidity among adults in private households was carried by the Office for National Statistics on behalf of the Department of Health, the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.3/5" class="indent">Approximately 8,800 people from all parts of Great Britain participated in the survey that involved personal interviews, which provided assessments of a range of mental disorders. An overview of the results of the survey was published last year in the report &quot;Psychiatric morbidity among adults Living in Private Households, 2000&quot; by Singleton et al., which is available from The Stationery Office or can be downloaded from the National Statistics website (<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">www.statistics.gov.uk</a>). The report presents estimates of the proportion of people suffering from neurotic disorders (such as anxiety and depression), psychotic disorders (for example, schizophrenia and manic depression) and alcohol and drug dependence, by NHS Regional Office area in England and in Scotland and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.3/6" class="indent">It should be noted that, because the assessment instruments used covered different time periods and people may have more than one disorder, it is not possible to add the figures together to give a total number of people with a mental health problem.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.0/1">A key approach of the Customs National Investigation Service (NIS) to tackling diversion frauds between 1995 and 1998 was to allow fraudsters to move goods from excise warehouses while under observation. When enough evidence was obtained the perpetrators would be arrested. The co-operation of warehousekeepers with Customs' investigators was an essential part in this approach. As they could have become liable for duty on these consignments, some of these warehousekeepers were given either explicit or implicit indemnities against liability for the duty evaded. In some cases the NIS conducted retrospective investigations, ie after the fraud had been stopped. The Villiers case was a retrospective investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.0/2">This investigative approach was examined by John Roques in his report on the Collection of Excise Duties in HM Customs and Excise. Mr. Roques concluded that there are circumstances where it is constructive and useful to observe the fraudulent movement of goods but made a three part recommendation on the subject of indemnities (Recommendation 30). This was accepted by Customs. Clearly defined authority levels for risking revenue were introduced in November 2000. A copy of the Roques report which includes the Government's response has been laid in the parliamentary Library.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.0/3">Hauliers played a key role in a number of diversion frauds. In some cases the hauliers were the principals behind the fraud, in others they played a lesser though still essential role. Where the haulier was not the principal, Customs would attempt to identify the principals in order to put as complete a case as possible before the courts. It is ultimately for the courts to determine, on the evidence presented, the respective roles of the defendants.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.2/1">A proactive strategy is in place to reduce suicide and self-harm in prison and make prisons safer for all who live and work there. The strategy target areas of greatest risk, recognising that prisoners under 21 years of age are especially vulnerable, whether or not located in Young Offender Institutions (YOIs). Feltham YOI and Eastwood Park, which holds young women offenders, are among five prisons selected as pilot sites for the installation of safer cells, first night support centres, crisis suites and cells that enable staff to monitor at risk prisoners. Other initiatives, which focus on the early period in custody, include physical improvements to reception and induction areas and removal of ligature points.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/2">The Prison Service is bidding for funds to provide an extra 860 safer cells in 16 YOIs. The under 18 age group will additionally benefit from the Prison Service's joint working with the Youth Justice Board, which is investing &pound;1 million this financial year on safer cells. Work is also in hand on developing an effective cell sharing assessment tool; developing peer and outside support schemes suitable for young people; reducing violence and bullying; and improving identification and assessment of at risk young people and their care plans.</p>

The national strategy is a long-term initiative which aims to deliver neighbourhood renewal&mdash;the process of delivering real change to England's most deprived neighbourhoods. The Government's vision is reflected in their long-term goal: to narrow the gap between deprived neighbourhoods and the rest, so that within 10 to 20 years, no-one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live. It aims to deliver this by enhancing the delivery of economic prosperity, safe communities, high quality schools, decent housing, and better health to the poorest parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".532W.11/3">The national strategy requires a change in the way we approach main Government programmes to ensure they focus on deprived areas. The strategy is being spearheaded by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, a cross-cutting unit based in DTLR and staffed by officials from across Whitehall and the public sector, with secondees from the private and voluntary sectors.</p>

	<p pid=".534W.0/1">Entitlement to Retirement Pension arises when a person attains pensionable age but to be entitled they have to make a claim. They can put off claiming their pension to earn increments. When they claim, each part of the pension is increased by about 7.5 per cent. for each full year of deferral.</p>
	<p pid=".534W.0/2">Currently the maximum period for deferral is five years but from April 2010 there will be no time limit and the incremental rate will increase to about 10.4 per cent. for each full year.</p>

	<p pid=".534W.3/1">Stakeholder pensions are a straightforward, good value, flexible product which need to adhere to certain minimum standards. These minimum standards mean that for many people less advice is necessary than that needed for personal pensions. For example the minimum standards will mean all stakeholder schemes should offer a good basic deal, and the simplification of tax rules means a single tax regime for all defined contribution pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".534W.3/2">As a part of the minimum standards, all stakeholder pension scheme providers are required to provide, within the charge limit, information about the scheme and additional explanatory material. This will help individuals to decide whether a stakeholder scheme would be a good option for them.</p>
	<p pid=".534W.3/3">We recognise that some people will need further advice. The Financial Services Authority (FSA), which regulates promotion and advice, has produced 'decision trees' to help individuals work through key questions on whether or not to join a stakeholder scheme, without necessarily requiring full individual advice. It has issued a consultation paper this month explaining how it proposes to keep them accurate and up-to-date.</p>
	<p pid=".534W.3/4">In some cases there may be a need for individual- specific advice. Scheme providers may give this advice within the charge. It is also open to scheme providers to charge an additional fee for individual advice, or for individuals to seek advice, for a charge, from an independent financial adviser.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.0/3">In designing both office layout and the service experienced by customers, the emphasis has been on eliminating the waiting times, queueing and referrals between offices, which can cause customer frustration and, very occasionally, confrontation. Evidence from the ONE pilots and from other countries suggests that such an approach has a direct and positive bearing on levels of disruptive customer behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.0/4">The new model of service being delivered in Jobcentre Plus offices involves increased telephone contact facilities, booked appointments, dedicated floor managers in every office, nominated personal advisers, swifter benefit assessment while customers look for work and a major investment in IT to help in the jobsearch process.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.0/5">Full risk assessments have been carried out in every Jobcentre Plus office and all of their individual recommendations implemented. In addition to security guards, where these have been recommended, safety measures implemented as a result of risk assessments include installation of closed circuit TV cameras and monitors, provision of discrete safety alarm systems, controlled segregation of staff areas via coded door locks and design of office layout to maximise safety.</p>

	<p pid=".538W.6/1">The Benefits Agency and Employment Service will cease operations from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. They will be replaced by two new organisations&mdash;Jobcentre Plus (for people of working age) and the Pension Service. There are no plans to remove protective screens from Benefits Agency offices in Teesside, during the remaining life of the Benefits Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".538W.6/2">There are 56 Pathfinder offices for Jobcentre Plus already in operation, operating within 16 clusters. None are in the Teesside area. These new-style Pathfinder Jobcentre Plus offices are predominantly unscreened though each cluster of Pathfinder offices retains at least one screened area or office to handle transactions or customers known to present a significant risk. The reaction of staff and customers to the new offices has been overwhelmingly positive and the level of recorded incidents of unacceptable behaviour extremely low. New-style Jobcentre Plus offices will be rolled out nationwide over the next four years though no decisions have yet been taken as to when offices in Teesside will be redesigned. As part of the implementation of the new style Jobcentre Plus offices, trade unions and staff will be consulted on delivery plans and safety arrangements and full risk assessments will be undertaken in each office as has been the case in the Pathfinder offices which are already open.</p>
	<p pid=".538W.6/3">The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has regrettably taken strike action against plans to deliver Jobcentre Plus services from a predominantly unscreened environment. PCS asked their members in the Benefits Agency field organisation and the Employment Service to take strike action on 12 and <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-13">13 December 2001</phrase>. In Teesside all Benefits Agency and Employment Service offices remained open to the public on these days.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.2/1">There is no specified maximum time or distance that patients might be expected to travel to a coronary care unit. Our aim is that in time the national health service should be able to offer all heart patients fair access to the surgical and other specialist services they need in a local unit and within an acceptable time. This is why we have developed a national strategy to expand the capacity to perform heart operations.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.2/2">This capital investment programme means that we are investing &pound;230 million in 12 schemes to provide new and bigger heart surgery facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.2/3">In addition we have announced the patient choice scheme which means that from July appropriate patients who would otherwise have to wait more than six months will be able to choose to be treated in a different hospital so that they get treatment more quickly. This may involve travelling further, but only if the patient decides that is what they want to do.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.5/1">The Department does not hold information centrally on the number of pay beds in the national health service. Laing and Buisson, who publish reviews on the independent healthcare sector, estimate that as of mid-June 2001 there were approximately 3,000 pay beds in the NHS, around 1,400 of which were in dedicated private patient units (PPUs). The remaining 1,600 beds were in ordinary NHS wards.</p>

The Department does collect gross income information under the headings of 'non-NHS private patients' and 'non-NHS other'. No information is available on a net basis. 'Non-NHS patients' includes all income received and receivable for patient care services from private patients. 'Non-NHS other' includes a number of sources such as prescription charges in trusts, Road Traffic Act income (1996&ndash;97 only), amenity bed charges, income from overseas patients which are not covered by reciprocal agreements and income from the capital hip care Centre (from 1998&ndash;99).</p>

	<p pid=".557W.8/2">It is common practice within national health service hospitals to use chemicals to disinfect medical devices such as flexible endoscopes, and some surgical instruments where the device cannot be decontaminated by conventional methods which employ steam at high temperature. The most common chemical used is Gluteraldehyde, of which Cidex is a brand name. Information on which chemicals are used at individual hospitals in England is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".557W.8/3">Gluteraldehyde falls under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations and is subject to strict control and continuous monitoring at local level. An annual risk assessment is required of how this substance is being used in the clinical setting. Where operating procedures suggest that exposure risk from inhalation is high, there is a requirement under the Health and Safety at Work Act to undertake environmental monitoring of the area. Monitoring is carried out by a qualified person with immediate corrective action being taken where necessary. This is included in the Controls Assurance Standards.</p>

	<p pid=".558W.11/2">The SNOMED clinical terms first release is due at the end of January 2002 and, in the national health service, will be for implementation testing only. An evaluation and refinement programme has been funded which will examine implementation issues in both the primary care sector (the ADVENT project) and across a broad range of clinical specialities (multi-professional quality assurance&mdash;MPQA). In parallel, an implementation scoping study will address issues around costs, migration from read codes, supplier involvement, and education and training requirements in the service. This will lead to the development of a costed implementation plan for roll-out of SNOMED CT across the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".564W.0/3">Formal commitment to revenue funding from primary care trusts is a mandatory part of the outline business case (OBC) and full business case submissions. These will not be approved unless it is included. The current Lymington Project has not yet had its OBC approved, although the levels of revenue funding agreed with Southampton and South West Hampshire health authority for the earlier project are included within primary care trust's commitments.</p>

A copy of the terms of reference for this work has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The Law Commission will produce a short paper by the end of March 2002. It will also undertake some preliminary work with a view to a possible further scoping study on defamation and other issues arising from publication on the internet.</p>

The Government subsequently announced that they intended to consult publicly on the perceived abuses of defamation procedures. We have since reconsidered the scope of the project, in the light of the rapidly developing case law in the field, to ensure that it deals aptly with all relevant areas of concern, including those raised by advances in electronic communication.</p>
