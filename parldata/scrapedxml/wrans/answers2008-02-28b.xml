They process this work on our behalf at the Bolton site. The Agency's six regional centres refer clerical cases to the Bolton site. Each of these centres are responsible for clients within regions that are not determined by parliamentary constituency or national boundaries. The information you request on the number of cases referred to the Bolton site is therefore not available. However, what I can tell you is that there are around 23,400 live cases in Bolton.</p>
	<p pid="b.1777W.5/9" class="indent">Child maintenance applications are processed clerically where, due to technical issues, they cannot be advanced on our computer system. The point at which this occurs, and the activity required to work the case through to a successful outcome for clients, varies significantly. Cases processed on the computer system are automatically monitored and information recorded. The extra resources required to replicate this for clerical cases, has instead been focused on improving maintenance outcomes for children. The information you requested on the time taken to progress to each stage is therefore unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1777W.5/10" class="indent">There are currently around 1,035 Agency people in the Falkirk Centre, of whom 106 are currently working on clerical cases. Vertex Data Science Ltd is responsible for employing the necessary staff to deliver the clerical case service from the Bolton site.</p>

	<p pid="b.1779W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-14">14 January 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what percentage of internal reviews of Community Care Grant decisions were successful at each Benefit Delivery Centre and nationally in the latest period for which figures are available; what the average time taken to determine an internal review request on a Community Care Grant decision was at each Benefit Delivery Centre and nationally in the latest period for which figures are available and how many outstanding internal review requests there were on Community Care Grant decisions at each Benefit Delivery Centre in each month between March and August 2007. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/5" class="indent">Over the course of 2007 there has been a very large increase in Crisis Loan applications. Extra resources have been provided and we have now nearly doubled our staffing to meet this rising demand. We have had to temporarily divert staff from review activity until these extra resources were in place. Crisis Loan delivery is a priority and unfortunately this has led to backlogs of reviews occurring in some locations. We are working hard to eradicate these backlogs where they have occurred and have instigated activity to prioritise urgent cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/6" class="indent">An 'internal review' has been interpreted as a review at Jobcentre Plus requested by an applicant, i.e. a first review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/7" class="indent">The percentage of first reviews of Community Care Grant decisions which were successful at each Benefit Delivery Centre and nationally for October 2007 is given in table 1. A first review is defined as successful if the award is increased on review (where the initial decision was either a partial award or a refusal).</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/8" class="indent">The average time taken to determine a first review request on a Community Care Grant decision at each Benefit Delivery Centre and nationally for October 2007 is given in table 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/9" class="indent">The time to determine an individual first review request is measured in whole working days from the date of receipt of the request to the date of the decision, inclusive. The minimum time recorded to determine an individual first review request is one day, even if the request is determined immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/10" class="indent">The number of outstanding first review requests on Community Care Grant decisions at each Benefit Delivery Centre at the end of each month from March to August 2007 is given in table 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/11" class="indent">Copies of the tables have been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.2/12" class="indent">I hope that this is helpful.</p>

The proceeds of &pound;250 million for the DSS Estate in April 1998 were released to HM Treasury. In 2003, the Department and LST agreed a vacant possession value of &pound;140 million for the properties covered by the expanded PRIME contract.

	<p pid="b.1789W.2/2">This current package will build on these existing measures to simplify the claims process for pensioners further by allowing people who apply for pension credit by telephone to also claim their council tax and housing benefit at the same time, without the need to submit a claim form.

	<p pid="b.1790W.8/1">Through the Pensions Bill 2007 currently before Parliament we will introduce a requirement on all employers to automatically enrol workers who are eligible into a qualifying workplace pension scheme. This will help to overcome barriers to saving such as inertia. Our estimates indicate this will result in between six and nine million people newly participating or saving more in workplace pensions, transforming the savings culture in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1790W.8/2">The Bill will introduce for the first time a mandatory employer contribution which will provide a clear incentive to save, and help those on low and moderate incomes to build up their pension funds. Overall annual pension contributions are estimated to increase by up to around &pound;10 billion by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="b.1793W.11/1">There is a range of benefits that can be claimed by parents of children with health problems. Entitlement to disability living allowance is not linked to particular disabling conditions, but on the extent to which a severely disabled person has personal care needs and/or walking difficulties as a result of their disability. Parents can claim disability living allowance for children who have been prescribed drugs for depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as long as their disability meets the above criteria. Parents of children who are awarded the middle or highest rate of the care component of disability living allowance may also qualify for carer's allowance or income support if they satisfy the appropriate conditions of entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1793W.11/2">For disability living allowance, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder fall into three categories of disabling condition. The available information about the number of cases is in the following table. Information about the number of parents who claim carer's allowance or income support for children who have been prescribed drugs for depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is not available.</p>

The sample is a small one, and as a result the estimates have wide margins of error. As such the estimates should not be used to draw conclusions about changes over time in the level of underpayments. They do allow us to say with confidence that the level has remained very low as a percentage of State Pension expenditure over the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1796W.2/1">It is not possible to say how many people in Hendon are entitled to receive a winter fuel payment. This is because not everyone aged 60 or over will be entitled to a payment. A person is not entitled to a winter fuel payment if, for example, they are serving a custodial sentence or have been in hospital for more than 52 weeks. Figures for payments made this winter are not yet available. In winter 2006-07 we made 17,760 winter fuel payments to people in the Hendon constituency and of these 4,090 went to people aged 80 or over, we expect the figures for this winter to be similar.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/2">Cold weather payments provide extra help towards heating costs for the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society, including pensioners receiving pension credit, in periods of exceptionally cold weather.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/3">A cold weather payment of &pound;8.50 is made automatically to people awarded pension credit when the average temperature is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0 degrees Celsius or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. Savings are not taken into account and cold weather payments are paid in addition to winter fuel payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/4">No pensioners in Hendon have received a cold weather payment in the last 12 months as the temperature criterion has not been met.</p>

	<p pid="b.1809W.7/1">It is not possible to forecast accurately how much public money will be spent in 2008-09 on organisations supporting those affected by domestic violence, as support is provided through a mixture of central and local government funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.7/2">The Supporting People programme provides the main source of public funding for housing related support in England. This programme is delivered at a local level and decisions on how much money is spent on services for those affected by domestic violence, or other services, are made by the top tier local authorities, based on a local needs assessment. The 2008-09 allocations for Supporting People amount to &pound;1.686 billion. We do know that top tier local authorities spent &pound;59,333,258 on services for those affected by domestic violence in 2005-06, and &pound;61,645,319 in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="b.1809W.7/4">The Ministry of Justice has allocated &pound;3 million per year over the three years from 2008-07 for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers, whose aim is the safety and support of victims and their children. This is in addition to annual court business costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.7/5">Finally, the Home Office is investing over &pound;20 million over the next three years on tackling violent crime, including domestic violence. Part of this funding will be used to fund multi-agency work to support victims of domestic violence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1817W.0/2">Judaism is one of the three minority religions officially recognised under the Iranian Constitution. While we do have general concerns about freedom of religion and belief in Iran, we understand that the Jewish community has relatively good relations with the wider Muslim community in Iran. The Iranian Jewish community does face some institutional discrimination, but we do not believe that the community faces systematic persecution. We continue to monitor the situation closely and officials in Tehran and London regularly meet representatives of the Jewish community to discuss the situation of Jewish people in Iran. In December 2007 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution about human rights in Iran. The resolution, which was co-sponsored by the UK and all other EU member states, acknowledged and expressed concern at the situation of religious and ethnic minorities in Iran. We will continue to make clear to the Iranian authorities that persecution of individuals on the grounds of their religious beliefs is unacceptable and contrary to Iran's international human rights obligations, and that the rights of Iran's religious minorities should be equal to those of all Iranian citizens.</p>

	<p pid="b.1820W.8/1">This month the European Commission issued its interim report on Romania's progress against the post-accession Justice and Home Affairs benchmarks. The Report concluded that progress has been made on the fight against corruption, but that work remains to be done. A copy of the report is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/cvm/docs/romania_report_20080201_en.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/cvm/docs/romania _report_20080201_en.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.8/3">A fuller report will be issued in June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.8/4">Our embassy in Bucharest reports regularly on judicial reform in Romania. The 'Sunshine Law' refers to the 2003 Romanian Law 52 'Decision-Making Transparency in Public Administration'. This requires that all draft legislation be submitted to the public for consultation and comment prior to passage and publication. This law is key to the integrity of public administration in Romania.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.8/5">In October 2007, following the European Commission's monitoring mechanism report, the Romanian Government adopted an anti-corruption action plan covering judicial reform and the fight against corruption. In order to monitor the measures imposed by the action plan, two inter-institutional bodies have been created, which are presided over by the Minister of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.8/6">Changes to the fiscal code were made in 2006. The fiscal code has no implication on the judicial system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.8/7">The UK provided Romania with practical assistance to support the reforms needed for EU membership including reform of the judicial system and enabling successful bidding for structural funds. This assistance has amounted to an average of &pound;630,000 per annum of direct bilateral assistance for the previous four years. Under the EU's Twinning programme, experts from EU member states are seconded as advisers to Romanian institutions and Government Departments. Currently two UK experts are based in Romania advising on how to manage efficiently the absorption of structural funds and in strengthening the probation service.</p>

In a multilateral forum, reliant on consensus, extended procedural delays can prejudice a substantive outcome even when the majority of states present are committed to achieving real advances. Regrettably, in 2005 a delay often days to agree the Review Conference agenda meant there was not enough time to negotiate a substantive final document.

	<p pid="b.1829W.6/4">The Department does not assess the practical and environmental merits of particular types of insulation materials, as building regulations and guidance do not make specific requirements for such materials. When issuing approved guidance on achieving compliance with the building regulations' energy efficiency requirements for construction work, it relies upon internationally recognised generic insulation performance values for construction materials and a wide range of expert advice on how these materials can be practically assembled into construction elements such as walls, roofs etc.</p>

	<p pid="b.1840W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/4" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on what the most recent estimate is of the number of migrant workers in (a) Teesside, (b) Stockton South constituency and (c) North East England in each of the last three years. I am replying in her absence. (189325)</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on migrant workers for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16 - 64 for men, 16 - 59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/6" class="indent">APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February 2008</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/7" class="indent">The table attached, shows the numbers of working age in employment who were not born in the UK and were resident in Teesside, Stockton South Parliamentary Constituency and North East England, for the twelve month periods ending in June for 2005, 2006, 2007 from the APS. The July to June 2007 APS dataset is the most recent which is currently available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/8" class="indent">Teesside has been formed by combining Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees and Redcar and Cleveland Unitary Authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/9" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important to bear in mind that the APS is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.2/10" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>

Local authorities are welcome to submit innovative proposals to the Department for funding as pilot or demonstration schemes within the major scheme funding regime. During 2006, the Department part-funded a research project to assess the potential role of biomethane as a renewable transport fuel, although this did not examine it's potential in Ultra Light Rail specifically.

It sets out how livestock keepers in the Protection Zone will be able to purchase doses from a vaccine bank through their private vets once vaccine is available. Depending on vaccine availability and the disease situation, once vaccination is progressing broadly across the Protection Zone, the intention is to extend or modify the zone in order to permit further vaccination. This will allow a phased approach as vaccine is delivered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1850W.3/2">The area subject to movement controls has been selected to ensure maximum protection against any further spread of the disease. Bonamia ostreae causes the serious disease bonamiosis in native oyster stocks, but does not have any clinical effect on any other species of shellfish.

The pilot will collect information on a range of indicators including fishing method, catches, discards, marketing and fuel consumption. This, and other information, will help inform the implementation of Fisheries 2027, a long-term vision for sustainable fisheries. DEFRA officials have spoken with a number of fishermen from the above areas who have expressed an interest in participating in the pilot and, in due course, they will be holding meetings in the three pilot areas to discuss details of the Scheme. I have not offered compensation but costs of equipping participating vessels will be met by DEFRA.

	<p pid="b.1853W.2/1">In 2003 the Countryside Agency (now Natural England) let a contract to identify land as defined by Section 15(1) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW). The research considered records available through publicly accessible archives, DEFRA, local authorities and some private sources. From the data obtained, a map was developed that shows where land mapped as open country, registered common land or land dedicated under Section 16 of CROW is affected by one or more Section 15 enactment. That map and associated information is available through Natural England's Open Access website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.2/2">The majority of the cost of mapping land subject to Section 193 of the Law of Property Act 1925 was integral to the costs of preparing maps of registered common land under Section 4(1 )(a) of CROW. The cost of researching and mapping all other categories of land defined by Section 15 of CROW to date has been &pound;260,000.</p>

Seasonal messages are broadcast on DEFRA's intranet to ensure staff turn off equipment over holiday periods. Information and instructions on energy saving measures appear on DEFRA's intranet and there are stickers on computer screens reminding staff to switch off their monitors.

Those countries who have historic rights to fish are laid down in Annex 1 of the Framework Regulation for the Common Fisheries Policy (Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-20">20 December 2002</phrase> on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy), which can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1863W.11/1">The Marine and Fisheries Agency has explored, and will continue to explore, all options to acquire additional quota for the inshore fleet through domestic and international swaps, and via quota contributed to the 10 m and under quota allocations by producer organisations under economic link arrangements. A key determinant on whether or not a swap is agreed is if there is economic benefit for the UK in making the swap. Based on this, two international cross-year swaps have been completed with Germany and the Netherlands to acquire an additional 150 tonnes of valuable North sea sole quota in 2008 for inshore fishermen operating in the southern North sea. Additionally, similar cross year swaps have been agreed to gain 38 tonnes of North sea Whiting and 26 tonnes of Irish sea Plaice for the inshore fleet. Other international swaps have also taken place. These will not have been carried out for the specific benefit of the inshore fleet. However, the inshore fleet will have benefited in many instances from a share of the extra fish gained for the UK as a whole.</p>

Initially, only stone loach were affected. However, as the event progressed, larger fish including trout and grayling, were also found to be dead or dying. Samples were taken by Environment Agency officers and these are currently being analysed at its laboratory. Early analysis has not detected any pollutant which would have caused a fish kill. However, the Environment Agency believes that a spillage of pollution probably entered the river on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-07">7 February</phrase> and was slow-acting in nature.</p>

	<p pid="b.1869W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-26">26 February 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1869W.8/2">As part of its preparations for the comprehensive spending review (CSSR), during the summer of 2007, DEFRA asked the Housing Corporation to provide advice on the feasibility of a potential revenue funding programme to support activity to improve the delivery of affordable rural housing at local level. We always made it clear that this would be considered in the light of the CSR settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1869W.8/3">That advice has now been carefully considered. However, given the Government's undertakings on increases in housing supply generally&mdash;which will benefit rural as well as urban areas&mdash;we have concluded that the value of a small Challenge Fund would not be enough to merit a switching of resources away from other priority areas of DEFRA's business.</p>
	<p pid="b.1869W.8/4">The Government have already set out proposals to increase the supply of housing and will be allocating &pound;8.4 billion across the regions over the next three years. The Housing Corporation will be tasked with spending this money most effectively. The Government's, long-term housing supply and affordability public service agreement (PSA) target specifically covers rural as well as urban affordability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1869W.8/5">In addition, the Housing Green Paper sets out the Government's intention to establish a national target for rural affordable housing. The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) is in the process of developing this target, based on advice from the regional assemblies and the Housing Corporation. It is much more important to ensure that these measures work for rural areas, rather than to focus attention on small packets of funding from DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1869W.8/6">Together with CLG, we remain committed to addressing the affordable rural housing problem. At a national level, the policies and funding to deliver are largely in place, but we want to ensure that it feeds through into delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1869W.8/7">That is why my hon. Friend the Prime Minister has asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> to carry out a review to find out how land use and planning can better support business and deliver affordable housing in rural areas. The hon. Member will report to both DEFRA and CLG in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1870W.2/1">DEFRA was alerted to the establishment of the Scottish Fisheries Council last autumn. The Scottish Fisheries Council was set up to advise Scottish Ministers on their devolved responsibilities. It has no role in relation to English fisheries or reserved UK responsibilities. I would therefore not expect to be involved in discussion of its deliberations, unless there is a particular issue arising from it which my Scottish Executive counterpart wishes to draw to my attention. DEFRA continues to liaise closely with the Scottish Executive and other devolved administrations over UK fisheries policy. I last met devolved Administrations' Fisheries Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February</phrase>, but the Scottish Fisheries Council was not discussed.</p>

This is because this information could compromise our efforts to persuade countries to join (or in some cases not to join) the IWC or to support the UK in its opposition to whaling. As this process is ongoing it is unlikely that we will consider it appropriate to release these details in the medium term.</p>

	<p pid="b.1874W.3/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) posts regularly report back on this issue. The information that we receive informs subsequent discussions that the UK has with countries, whether or not they are members of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Formal replies to ministerial approaches by way of letters are rare, but a lack of response does not necessarily indicate lack of action. I do not believe that any of those who joined the IWC last year actually responded to the letters that had been sent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1876W.2/1">There has been limited assessment made. A study was funded by the Department and carried out by the University of Bristol, covering a small number of accident and emergency (A and E) departments that had established services they termed walk-in centres in or near the major A and E department. A publication based on this was published in the <i> Emergency Medicine Journal</i> in 2007 (using information from 2004). This work did not draw definitive conclusions on the effect of walk-in centres on A and E attendances, and the effect varied from site to site.</p>

Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Data Quality:</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards, During the years that these records have been collected, the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> All Diagnoses count of Mentions:</i><br/> These figures represent a count of all mentions of a diagnosis in any of the 14 diagnosis fields in the HES data set. Therefore, if a diagnosis is mentioned in more than one diagnosis field during an episode, all diagnoses are counted.<br/> <i> Diagnosis Codes Used:</i><br/> F10 - Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br/> K70 - Alcoholic liver disease<br/> T51 - Toxic effect of Alcohol<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data:</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Low Numbers:</i><br/> Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 0 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk).<br/> <i> PCT and SHA Data Quality:</i><br/> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1886W.2/1">Changes in vaccination policy can result in changes to the vaccines offered in the routine childhood immunisation programme. While we aim to keep vaccine wastage to a minimum, such policy changes can lead to some vaccines being written off if they are no longer used in the routine programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.2/2">The reasons why expired vaccines were not used are listed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.2/3" class="indent">Some BCG vaccine was written off following the change in BCG vaccination policy in 2005. The programme changed from a universal to targeted programme, leading to a reduction in demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.2/4" class="indent">In 2005 demand for MMR vaccine increased following the mumps outbreaks in older teenagers. For a short period, the suppliers could only provide additional supplies of MMR vaccine destined for other countries, and hence with different product labelling than UK stock. Even though the vaccine itself was identical to UK licensed product, the labelling difference meant that the vaccine was not licensed for use in the UK. Once further supplies of UK licensed vaccine were received, the unlicensed MMR vaccine was no longer used, leading to write off.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.2/5" class="indent">In 2004 vaccines containing live oral polio were removed from the childhood programme and replaced with three new combination vaccines containing an inactivated polio vaccine. This resulted in the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine; and the tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine becoming redundant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.2/6" class="indent">In 2003 a major Hib catch up campaign was launched using a single antigen Hib (haemophilus influenzae type B) vaccine. This vaccine is not used routinely in the childhood programme, and some stock left over from the Hib catch-up campaign date expired in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="b.1886W.8/1">It is not a matter for the Department to give advice to commissioning bodies on treatment of particular conditions. It is for the Royal Colleges to give advice to practitioners while the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) provides national guidance on promoting good health and preventing and treating ill health. NICE guidance suggests the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprophen in the first instance for the treatment of endometriosis as well as trialling the contraceptive pill. If neither of these treatments work, then NICE recommends surgery to remove endometrial deposits. If conservative methods do not work, and symptoms remain severe then NICE recommends hysterectomy, with or without removal of the ovaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.8/2">The Department currently provides core funding under its section 64 scheme to the National Endometriosis Society (now known as Endometriosis UK) and has also funded Endometriosis UK for a project concerned with developing information services for endometriosis.

	<p pid="b.1889W.6/1">The Department's National Institute for Health Research is funding the following study:</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/2" class="indent">Birmingham Women's Health Care NHS Trust&mdash;Endometriosis and cultural diversity: improving services for minority ethnic women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/3">Research on endometriosis also forms part of the work programme of the institute's Oxford and Hammersmith, St. Mary's and Imperial College Biomedical Research Centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/4">Over the last 10 years, the main part of the Department's total expenditure on health research has been devolved to and managed by national health service organisations. Details of individual NHS supported research projects undertaken during that time, including a number concerned with endometriosis, are available on the archived national research register at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/5" class="indent">https://portal.nihr.ac.uk/Pages/NRRArchiveSearch.aspx.</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/6">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is one of the main agencies through which the Government support medical and clinical research. The MRC is an independent body that receives its grant in aid from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/7">In 2005-06, the MRC spent &pound;2.3 million on endometriosis and the general physiology of the endometrium.</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/8">Recent MRC-funded research projects of particular relevance to endometriosis include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/9" class="indent">Dr. C. M. Becker, University of Oxford&mdash;Transgenic mouse model of endometriosis;</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/10" class="indent">Professor H. Mardon, University of Oxford&mdash;Molecular dissection of extracellular matrix signalling and function in the human endometrium;</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/11" class="indent">Dr. R. Varma, University of Birmingham&mdash;Identification and importance of tumour suppressor genes in endometriosis and endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/12" class="indent">Dr. K. T. Zondervan, University of Oxford&mdash;The genetic epidemiology of endometriosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1889W.6/13">MRC-funded research at the MRC Human Reproductive Sciences Unit in Edinburgh also focuses on uterine biology including endometriosis. Further information about the unit's research can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1890W.2/1">The Department and the national health service promote the benefits of physical activity to professionals and people of all ages and stages of life. The Department is keen to target those individuals most at risk of inactivity for whom the greatest health gains can be made. Primary care trusts are required to have systematic and managed health promotion programmes, including action on exercise, that are responsive to local needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1890W.2/2">The Department is piloting a physical activity care pathway model in a number of general practitioner practices in London. Many sedentary older people will benefit from the care pathway model, which aims to encourage behaviour change and increased physical activity levels through a patient led approach. The care pathway signposts patients to a range of options to increase their activity levels, including exercise referral schemes where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1890W.2/3">Other targeted actions include the national step-o-meter programme, which provides health professionals with free pedometers for loan to adult patients and the Department's local exercise action pilot scheme which included interventions targeted across the life course, including older people.</p>

Cost of treatment totalled &pound;15,051,634 of which &pound;10,585,167 was for visitors and &pound;4,466,467 was for referrals.

	<p pid="b.1903W.2/1">The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) continually oversees the development of the resource allocation formula. ACRA's work programme is set following each allocation round. The elements of ACRA's current work programme were agreed in November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1903W.2/2">The intention was for ACRA to finalise its work programme by autumn 2007. However, although ACRA has made good progress on some major aspects of its work programme, it has requested, and been granted, additional time to finalise the work that it is doing to review the formula. Given the importance of the weighted capitation formula it is crucial that ACRA is given the time required to produce a robust and transparent formula.</p>
	<p pid="b.1903W.2/3">Only when its work programme is completed will ACRA finalise its recommendations to Ministers on potential changes to the funding formula. Ministers will then look at all of ACRA's recommendations and decide how to take these recommendations into account when making allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) for 2009-10 and 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1903W.2/4">We will inform PCTs of the changes to the formula, and the revenue allocations as soon as is practically possible after the completion of ACRA's work programme. The aim is to announce revenue allocations to PCTs for 2009-10 and 2010-11 by the summer 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1910W.2/1">Pace of change policy for revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) is considered by Ministers prior to each allocations round. However, for the 2008-09 revenue allocations, the decision was made to freeze the weighted-capitation formula to give the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) the time it requires to finalise its review of the formula. Therefore, in 2008-09, all PCTs will be given the same uplift of 5.5 per cent. freezing the distance from target for each PCT. The flat-rate increase of 5.5 per cent. on each PCTs' 2007-08 revenue allocation will ensure that every PCT has sufficient growth in funding to honour their service commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1910W.2/2">Until the impact of the new formula on target allocations is known, it would be irresponsible to continue to move PCTs towards their target allocation under the current formula. Any new formula is likely to have an impact on the target allocation for some PCTs. Some PCTs may move from being under target to over target and vice versa. Giving all PCTs the same uplift avoids moving PCTs towards their current target allocation in 2008-09 and then having to reverse this the following year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1910W.2/3">The plan is to make allocations for 2009-10 and 2010-11 by summer 2008 based on a new formula. Pace of change policy has not been discontinued, and decisions will be made on pace of change for 2009-10 and 2010-11 once we have received ACRA's recommendations on the new funding formula.</p>

	<p pid="b.1913W.11/1">In 2002 the Home Office Active Communities Directorate, which is now part of the Office of the Third Sector in the Cabinet Office, set up the Working Group on Insurance and the Voluntary Sector. The Working Group sought to address the concerns of the voluntary sector about the cost of insurance premiums. It included officials from Government and representatives from the insurance industry and the third sector. The work of the group included discussions on personal insurance liability for volunteer drivers. The working group met on a number of occasions and ceased its work in 2005. As a direct result of the groups work two documents were published to help third sector organisations address insurance issues. The first was a risk toolkit produced by Volunteering England and the second a document by the Association of British Insurers. Both provide advice on insurance for volunteers and the third sector. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1917W.3/1">The departmental strategic objectives published in October 2007 set out the Department's aim to be innovative in what we do, and a programme of work is in place which will help ensure we achieve this. For example, rather than having fixed desks and workstations, all staff (including the Permanent Secretary) have been issued instead with lap top computers which will support more effective and flexible working practices. A pool of policy specialists is being created, enabling a quicker response to deal with particular issues. This will all be underpinned through the development of a new set of corporate values and behaviours and a culture that will ensure that DIUS operates innovatively and effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1917W.3/2">The Department is committed to working openly with partners and customers. For example, we now have a Minister with explicit responsibility for listening to students and ensuring the student voice is heard in Government. We are also working with our partners, including students in universities and colleges, on issues such as the redesign of our London office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1917W.3/3">The Department also has the overall responsibility on behalf of Government to promote the commercial exploitation of creativity and knowledge by supporting research and innovation. We aim to create the right environment for innovation through a combination of: investment in the science base; financial support for companies; fiscal incentives for innovation; and through maintaining a world class innovation infrastructure in the UK. In order to lead this work the Department has appointed a Director of Innovation for driving forward its work in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1919W.2/3">In addition the Department has received some 206 written representations since June 2007 about the student loan interest rate. We are not able to say how many of those proposed changes to the method of calculating interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1919W.2/4">We do not believe that it is necessary to change the way interest is calculated. Student loans are not like commercial loans. The Government make no profit but subsidise the interest rate and absorb other associated costs. Interest is charged using a widely recognised measure of inflation, so students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrowed. This is achieved by linking the interest rate for student loans to the annual rate of inflation as defined by the RPI. The interest rate is recalculated each year at the beginning of September using the RPI figure from the previous March. This is the methodology that has always been used. Over time it ensures the student loan interest rate will be equivalent to the rate of inflation but with a time lag.</p>
	<p pid="b.1919W.2/5">For the vast majority of student loan borrowers, who have income contingent loans, any increase in interest rate will not affect borrowers' ability to pay, or the amount that they are liable to pay each month. Repayments are linked to the ability to pay and this amounts to 9 per cent. of earnings above &pound;15,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.1920W.0/1">The vast majority of pharmacy students already study the subject as a first degree rather than as an equivalent or lower level qualification. The redistribution of &pound;100 million by 2010 would enable the same number of pharmacy students to be funded as now but with even more studying the subject as a first degree. In that way we will increase and widen participation which is our top priority. We also value those who have already got a first HE qualification and who want to retrain in a different subject.

The first such review should take place starting in December 2008, in the light of entry data for the 2008-09 academic year.

	<p pid="b.1923W.2/1">The Government have made no estimate of the number of people not registered to vote in each London borough. However, the Electoral Commission undertook a pilot research study in 2007 to examine possible methods for measuring the accuracy and completeness of the electoral register in Greater London.</p>
	<p pid="b.1923W.2/2">I understand from the Electoral Commission that the methodologies used in the London pilot were shown to be unsuitable for drawing firm conclusions about the integrity of electoral registers. This was particularly the case for borough by borough analysis, due to small sample sizes. The pilot study brought to light some key registration trends in Greater London; in particular, it estimated that 80 per cent. of those who were eligible, were registered. Due to small sample base sizes at the borough level, the data is not sufficiently robust at local authority level to provide reliable estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1923W.2/3">Recent changes brought about by the Electoral Administration Act have placed a greater emphasis on getting eligible electors registered. During the annual canvass, Electoral Registration Officers are required to take all necessary steps to ensure that electors are encouraged to register, which include sending the canvass form more than once, making house to house enquiries and inspecting other records that they are permitted to inspect.</p>

	<p pid="b.1940W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/infringements/case_law/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/infringements/case_law/index_en.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.0/3">However HMRC does not keep records of the precise impact any ECJ judgments may have on either litigation pursued solely in the UK courts or on specific decisions that may have been taken in their dealings with individual taxpayers as a result of any such decision. It follows that there are no records held that would indicate what impact, if any, such decisions may have had in terms of paying tax back to private companies. The information requested could not be obtained except at disproportionate cost.</p>
