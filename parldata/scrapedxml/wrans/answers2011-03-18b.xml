	<p pid="b.675W.6/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) primarily categorises projects by type and level of investment required. The largest projects that may be approved by senior officials are category B projects, the value of which depends on the type of project as shown in the following table:</p>
	<table>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/13">The authority to approve category B projects is delegated to a senior committee of representatives of the investment approvals board. These thresholds for approval have been set based on the level of delegated authority from the Treasury, the volume of projects at each level and the need to optimise the level of scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/14">However, since April 2009, all projects valued at over &#163;100 million have also required the approval of the Treasury at either official or ministerial level. Any projects that require the approval of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury are first approved by Ministers at the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/15">The highest value project to have been approved by senior officials in the last three years was a project to provide in-service support to refurbish HMS Vigilant. This was approved in October 2008 at a value of &#163;372 million.</p>

We expect defendants to attend court when summoned, and if defendants fail to appear at court guidance is in place that obliges the court to consider proceeding in their absence. Wilful failure to attend court can be a criminal offence. The Criminal Justice System (CJS) agencies have worked together to ensure defendants get to court and we expect that to continue.</p>

The provisions allow that any individual applying for a CRB certificate can apply to be part of an up-dating service. This would allow an applicant to authorise employers to make a check of the service to identify whether any &quot;new&quot; information was known that would appear on a certificate, should one be issued.</p>

	<p pid="b.685W.0/2">Lesotho is classed as a lower middle income country based on its gross national income per head.

	<p pid="b.688W.9/1">The largest three jurisdictions within the Tribunals Service, Social Security and Child Support, Immigration and Asylum and Employment Tribunals accounted for 92% of receipts for the business year 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.9/2">The Tribunals Service has continued to respond strongly to the significant increase in appeal cases received the First-tier Tribunal-Social Security and Child Support (SSCS). There are always a number of 'live' appeals in SSCS progressing through the stages of receipt, decision and promulgation. This is not the same as a backlog. As the volumes of SSCS receipts have increased, so has the capacity of the Tribunals Service to deal with them. It is increasing its capacity through the recruitment of additional staff, judicial medical tribunal members as well as a range of business improvements. The Statistical Notice<sup>(3)</sup> published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-11">11 March</phrase> shows that there has been a 36% increase in the number of disposals by this jurisdiction from 222,300 in April 2009-January 2010, to 302,700 in April 2010-January 2011. As the Tribunals Service continues to bring additional resources on line, we expect the outstanding caseload to fall and reduce waiting times for tribunal hearings.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.9/3">The First-tier Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber (FTTIAC) has reduced its work in hand by 43% since March 2009 and it stands at 50,300 at the end of quarter two this year. This is the lowest it has been since the inception of the Asylum and Immigration tribunal in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.9/4">The work load in employment tribunals is also high, with 442,700 'live' cases in the system at the end of September 2010<sup>(1)</sup>. A large majority of this total consist of multiple cases. Multiple cases are where two or more people bring cases, usually against a single employer but not necessarily so and always arising out of the same or very similar circumstances. The Tribunals Service counts each person involved as a separate claim but they represent a very much smaller number of cases proceeding through the system. However, the rate of disposals also remains high; in the last complete financial year-2009-10-over 112,000 claims were disposed of, an increase of 22% on the previous year<sup>(2)</sup>. In addition, a range of initiatives have been introduced to deal with the cases that remain. Innovations have included evening sittings at tribunals, piloting ACAS officer involvement at interlocutory hearings to help facilitate earlier resolution between the parties, variations in the listing and case management procedure, and developments of the judicial mediation. The Government are also currently consulting on a range of proposals that will help to streamline the employment tribunal system still further.</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.0/2">There is evidence to suggest that a strong school with good systems and a clear model of school improvement can provide effective help to an underperforming school (Potter, 2004; DfES, 2005; Hill, 2008; Hill and Matthews, 2008, Hill 2010). Federations or chains of schools can also make savings by pooling resources and through economies of scale. For example they are more likely to be able to employ fully qualified and experienced financial and business managers and can share back office administration and maintenance services (Hill, 2010).</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.6/2"><i> </i>The Government expect the adoption system to work effectively for all looked after children who would benefit from this permanence option, and wants to see all local authorities performing at the level of the best. That is why I have set up a Ministerial Advisory Group on Adoption to provide expert advice on a range of practical proposals to improve and share practice. In November 2010, I wrote to directors of Children's Services and lead members to ask them to do everything possible to increase the number of children appropriately placed for adoption, and to improve the speed with which decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.6/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-22">22 February</phrase> I published revised statutory guidance on adoption. This is an important element in the Government's programme of reform to support adoption agencies in removing barriers to adoption and reducing delay. The guidance takes account of recent case law and reflects key messages from the &quot;Adoption Research Initiative&quot;, which provides a robust evidence base for adoption practice, including permanence planning, family finding and matching of children and prospective adopters. I also recently hosted a roundtable event with a group of adopters to hear about their experiences of the adoption process and how it can be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.6/4">In addition, the Family Justice Review is considering what changes are needed to the system including how best to ensure that delays in determining the outcomes of court applications are kept to a minimum. The interim report is due at the end of March and the final report in October 2011. In the meantime, I will continue to discuss with the president of the Family Division how cases can be better handled in the context of the current legal framework.</p>

	<p pid="b.701W.5/1">There are no direct policy implications for the Department from the implementation of the EU Strategic Framework for Education and Training. In line with Articles 165 and 166 of the EU Treaty, the Strategic Framework recognises that each member state is responsible for its own education and training systems and that action at European Union level is limited to supporting member states. The Strategic Framework also proposes changes to the Open Method of Co-ordination (OMC), the process through which mutual understanding and sharing of good practice is promoted across member states. We have not quantified the direct cost to the Department of involvement in the Strategic Framework. It involves a small amount of staff time in fulfilling the UK's contribution, through attending relevant meetings and providing information on UK policies. The Government will continue to examine the proposals from the Strategic Framework, to ensure that they support and supplement domestic policy, and do not increase EU competence in the field of education.</p>

	<p pid="b.705W.3/1">Fairness is at the heart of the Government's agenda. Local authorities have a statutory duty-under section 7 of the Childcare Act-to secure nursery places free of charge, effectively prohibiting top-up fees. This ensures that there are no barriers to accessing the benefits of nursery education for all children, but particularly the most disadvantaged. Parents are free to purchase additional hours and services outside of the hours for which providers receive funding from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.3/2">The Government are listening to the views of early years providers and their representative bodies concerning funding issues and in response are seeking to improve the efficiency with which funding is distributed to providers, through the early years single funding formula, as well as through reducing bureaucratic burdens on providers who deliver free nursery education. Providers around the country are offering an excellent service to parents and their children within existing funding levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.707W.4/1">The 16-18 funding formula for 2010/11 already has an element that ensures disadvantaged students attending schools and colleges, or who are funded as an apprentice, receive a funding premium. The formula has two elements which provide disadvantaged students with a funding supplement. These are the funding linked to the disadvantage uplift within the formula and that for additional learning support.

	<p pid="b.710W.3/2"><i> </i>A table setting out the available information on school closures in the last eight years has been placed in the House Libraries. The Department does not hold any information on the book value of the land relating to these closures. The table only includes those maintained schools which have physically closed and not been replaced. It does not include any schools that have been closed only to be replaced by new schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.710W.3/3">Any land, in the eight years since the school closed, which had not been in use by another school, or which had not been disposed of with the Secretary of State's approval under either schedule 35a of the Education Act 1996 or section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 in the case of playing fields, would meet the requirements specified in paragraph 1 of schedule 13 of the Education Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.710W.3/4">It is not possible to supply information about the availability of specific school sites in the future, since this will depend on future decisions, principally by local authorities. Paragraph 1 of schedule 13 to the Education Bill applies to a situation in which local authority land may become available because a school has closed or is about to close, or is otherwise recognised as surplus to the needs of a school. Paragraph 2 of schedule 13 applies to land specified by the local authority as the site for a proposed new school under the arrangements for new schools in the Bill, and is dependent on future decisions by local authorities that new schools are needed. Decisions on school closures and the disposal of surplus land will normally be taken by local authorities (unless a school is in special measures, in which case a closure can be instigated by the Secretary of State).</p>

The Government have ensured there is enough money within the Early Intervention Grant to maintain a network of Sure Start Children's Centres, accessible to all but identifying and supporting families in greatest need. To date only the EIG funding for the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13 has been announced and is only available by local authority-the figures for Bolton and all other local authorities in England are available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.726W.5/14">Published allocations for Sure Start Children's Centres are not individually ring-fenced within the main revenue block of the SSEYCG and therefore are notional.

	<p pid="b.726W.5/15">In addition to the capital base allocation the Department had been able to offer some carry-forward of unspent SSEYCG capital funding from prior years. Given the unprecedented fiscal deficit the Department restricted carry-forward of SSEYCG capital (which includes Sure Start Children's Centres) to cases where funding was required for the completion of the children's centres programme, or where there was evidence of a contractual commitment either with a building contractor or for goods.</p>
	<p pid="b.726W.5/16">The Department's calculations of carry-forward are predicated on levels of expenditure from prior years. We are awaiting audited financial returns from a number of local authorities, at which point carry-forward for all local authorities will be finalised.</p>

We want employers and the public to have confidence in the profession and to ensure that those who have been barred from teaching are not re-employed as teachers.

The voluntary sector receives money directly from the Department and its arm's length bodies, through the money we give to local authorities and from services commissioned by schools. However, some examples of grants that have in the past been given for purposes that could be deemed strategic include the Children, Young People and Families Grant Fund 2010-11 which allocated some &#163;12 million in grants for capacity building.</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.19/1">It is usual practice for both social and private sector landlords to have a standard term prohibiting criminal activity in their tenancy agreements. If the prohibition is breached, this allows them to seek possession of their property without having to wait for a conviction. Where a written tenancy agreement is not in place, as is possible in the private rented sector, a landlord can rely on ground 14 in schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988 which allows possession where a tenant has been convicted of allowing their property to be used for an illegal purpose.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.19/2">Local authorities may introduce selective licensing schemes in areas suffering from significant and persistent antisocial behaviour. Landlords of privately rented properties within a selective licensing designation will have to be identified to the local authority as 'fit and proper' persons and will be required to take appropriate steps to deal with their tenants' antisocial behaviour. However, licensing is not designed to tackle serious criminal activity, which is a matter for the police.</p>

	<p pid="b.741W.2/1">A person is found to be 'fit for work' if they do not have limited capability for work. They may be eligible to claim jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/2">A key factor in determining eligibility for employment and support allowance (ESA) is the work capability assessment (WCA), which is used to determine a claimant's capability for work.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/3">Following a determination that the claimant has 'limited capability for work', they are placed in either the work related activity group or the support group.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/4">Those placed in the work related activity group are expected to undertake some work-related activity with a view to moving into employment in the short to medium term.</p>

The Remuneration Committee Chair of each bank will write to the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to confirm that the commitment has been met. These banks have also committed to world-leading pay disclosure arrangements which, when taken together with the FSA's sector wide regime, make the UK's disclosure arrangements the toughest of any major financial centre.</p>
