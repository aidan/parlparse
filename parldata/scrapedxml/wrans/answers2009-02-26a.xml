	<p pid="a.904W.5/1">The Causeway Programme is a key element in the continuing modernisation and reform of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. At its inception, total costs were estimated at &pound;42.7 million but a later review of the business case estimated that these would increase to &pound;61 million. The most recent estimate, after reviewing the Programme content, is that total costs will be &pound;58 million. This represents an increase of some &pound;15 million against the original projections. The increased costs have arisen in three main areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.5/2" class="indent">Additional costs arising from the complexity of integrating six agencies' business processes and separate computer systems&mdash;&pound;5 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.5/3" class="indent">Contract changes&mdash;&pound;6 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.5/4" class="indent">Programme development and office costs arising from delay&mdash;&pound;4 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.5/5">Following the end of the Programme, additional enhancements to the system&mdash;originally intended to be part of the Programme&mdash;may be taken forward through one-off projects, subject to stringent cost and benefit analysis.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.5/1">The current system of local authority industrial pollution regulation began in 1991. DEFRA's annual research expenditure on this system varies annually, but on average is around &pound;40,000 a year. Consultations are undertaken periodically, including an annual consultation on the level of fees and charges payable by regulated businesses. In the last six months, separate consultations have been undertaken on a better regulation review of the system, and on the principles to underpin the forthcoming review of statutory guidance notes on pollution standards. Separate data are not held which distinguishes the cost of these consultations from that of managing the system as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.922W.3/2">Along with the regulator OFGEM, the Government are closely monitoring the effects of the credit crunch on the energy sector, particularly on investment plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.924W.8/1">The UK sees diversity of both sources and routes of gas as vital for the EU's security of supply. Recent events have underlined the importance to the EU of being supplied with gas from a wide range of countries. The development of a southern corridor, with the aim of bringing gas through Turkey to the EU from the Caspian region, and in the longer term from the Middle East, is crucial to that end . The UK therefore strongly supports the efforts of the European Commission and fellow EU member states to develop a southern corridor and is actively engaged in these efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.8/2">The Commission's second Strategic Energy Review (SEER2) of November 2008 affirmed the importance of a southern corridor as one of the EU's highest energy priorities and the importance, to that end, of increasing high level political engagement with potential gas supplier countries, such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.8/3">The European Commission and current Czech presidency of the EU have already signalled their intention to make this a priority for 2009 and we shall be working closely with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.8/4">The UK also sees it as important for there to be a diverse selection of routes for gas to enter the EU and for this reason we support the building of new pipelines, under market conditions, to bring gas from established suppliers to the EU such as Norway, Russia and Algeria. In addition to pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), imported by tanker from countries such as Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Algeria, can also play an important role in diversifying gas supply to the UK and other EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.8/5">The UK's own security of gas supply has been improved in recent years by new import infrastructure projects such as the BBL (Netherlands-UK) and Langeled (from Norway) pipelines, expansion of the (Belgium-UK) IUK pipeline and the new LNG import terminal at the Isle of Grain. Two further major LNG import terminals at Milford Haven are expected to be commissioned soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.5/1">A public call for Severn tidal power scheme proposals led to a long-list of 10 schemes including a proposal based on an array of seabed mounted marine turbines. All long-listed schemes have been investigated within the Severn tidal power feasibility study and an analysis, and recommended shortlist for further assessment, were published for public consultation last month. Proposals based on tidal stream turbines have not been recommended for shortlisting. This is because this technology is at such an early stage of development that detailed assessment is not possible. However, the Government are keen to see these technologies developed further so their potential can be better understood. Alongside existing funding for developing innovative technologies, my right Hon Friend the Secretary of State announced new funding of &pound;500,000 for the development of embryonic proposals. This fund will run in parallel with the feasibility study and the development of these technologies will be reviewed before decisions are taken on whether to take forward a Severn power scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/2">I expect to announce the final shortlist in the summer after consideration of comments and any further evidence submitted in response to the consultation. Copies of the consultation document are available in the Library of the House or at:</p>

	<p pid="a.942W.0/1">The cost of the games remains within the &pound;9.325 billion funding package that I announced in March 2007.</p>

An additional &pound;238 million (within the &pound;9.325 billion funding package) will be made available for contingency if required. Work is continuing to finalise the security strategy and plans within these provisions. Decisions on funding will take account of operational needs of the police, fire and rescue and other agencies, affordability and the need to secure value for money. The ODA does not make grant payments to the Metropolitan Police or the London Fire Brigade.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.0/3"><i> (c)</i> Within the funding package, there is a provision of &pound;864 million for Olympic transport projects, which will be delivered by Transport for London (TfL) and other partners. The ODA and TfL have a funding agreement setting out the TfL-led transport projects, facilities, and services required for the 2012 games (in addition to TfL's ongoing Investment Programme). ODA contributions relating to this activity are covered by the funding agreement. The amount of these contributions is subject to agreement on a project by project basis as each Business case is approved. The estimated total contribution is c. &pound;370 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.0/4"><i> (d)</i> Within the &pound;9.325 billion funding package, the London Development Agency (LDA) is directly contributing &pound;250 million of the total London contribution of &pound;1.175 billion (comprising &pound;925 million from GLA of which &pound;625 million is from council tax precepts and &pound;300 million from the LDA; plus the LDA's direct contribution of &pound;250m). The ODA does not make grant payments to the LDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.0/5">The Government have recently published the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympics Games annual report January 2009, which provides a detailed breakdown of the ODA budget. I have also committed to publishing a financial update on a quarterly basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.946W.9/2">The UK has not been approached for, nor provided, support to either military operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). These operations are the result of two regional agreements between the states directly involved in the military action. We welcome the increased regional co-operation between the governments but urge all parties involved to fully respect international law, do all they can to minimise the humanitarian impact and fully co-ordinate with the United Nations Mission in the DRC (MONUC).</p>

	<p pid="a.947W.12/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) uses non-consolidated, non-pensionable bonuses to encourage high performance. We pay annual bonuses to staff in the delegated grades (all except senior managers) based on appraisal evidence of annual performance. The highest rating and bonus award is given only where performance has significantly exceeded challenging objectives and may have radically transformed delivery of policy and/or services. Staff who do not meet performance standards receive no bonus. Total pay-bill for the delegated grades is &pound;181.7 million of which 2.78 per cent. is used for non-consolidated performance payments to staff.</p>

We use variable pay for SMS/SCS staff to reward excellent individual performance and achievement during the year. Variable pay decisions are based on a judgment by pay committees of what an individual has achieved in comparison with peers. Those who have delivered the best results, and shown real leadership in doing so, receive bonuses. Those who have delivered least receive nothing. Departments were authorised to spend a sum equivalent to 8.6 per cent. of their SCS pay budget on bonuses to reward SCS performance in 2008.</p>

The military hostilities and the lack of independent information coming out of the conflict area make it difficult to get accurate information. However, in spite of calls for a 48-hour ceasefire to allow civilians safe passage to government controlled areas, there is little evidence to suggest that there was any significant cessation of hostilities on the ground by either party. In addition, we are aware that a female suicide bomber blew herself up as she travelled with civilians fleeing the fighting while being checked by Sri Lanka government soldiers killing at least 29 people and injuring dozens more.</p>

	<p pid="a.969W.9/1">The Crown Prosecution Service has recently received representations on its policy on prosecuting rape cases. With my approval, the CPS has refreshed its policy statement to reflect those representations, as well as changes in the law and practice, a number of initiatives to assist victims in giving evidence and to address again the myths and stereotypes that are thought to sometimes wrongly influence juries. The refreshed policy statement will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.978W.8/1">The aim of the mobile detention pilot was to test a vehicle with both detention and detainee transport capabilities in a range of operational scenarios to assess how it complements the existing fleet of vehicles. The pilot ran in the East Midlands between <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-29">29 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-31">31 October 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.8/2">The Mobile Detention Facility provides UKBA officers with a secure 'field' location in which to interview suspected immigration offenders, detain them for a short period of time and then transport them as appropriate to their next destination, for example, to an Immigration Reception Centre or Immigration Removals Centre, without relying on the availability of police resources or the deployment of UKBA escorting contractors to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.8/3">During the five week pilot, 22 foreign nationals were encountered of which 14 were interviewed further as suspected immigration offenders of which six were subsequently identified as such and transported to an Immigration Removals Centre. These individuals were processed more quickly using the Mobile Detention Facility capabilities than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.8/4">In addition to this direct benefit, the provision of UKBA staff in the liveried vehicle at remote locations allowed for direct interaction with lorry drivers and members of the public to promote the work of UKBA, raise awareness about deterring so called 'lorry drops' and provide a conduit for the collation of additional intelligence to help secure the UK border.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.8/5">The cost of this pilot was from within existing resources and is commercial in confidence in light of the contractual Non-Disclosure Agreement in place with the vehicle's provider.</p>

	<p pid="a.985W.2/1">The question that was estimated to be in excess of the disproportionate cost threshold was tabled in March 2008 by Baroness Stern (HL2252). It asked how many new imprisonable offences have been created since May 1997. The information was collated manually across the whole of Government therefore my noble Friend Lord Hunt gave an undertaking to write to Baroness Stern in his answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-24">24 April 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-04-24.314"><i> Official Report</i>, column WA314</phrase>, when the information was available.

Member on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-18">18 June 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-06-18.1001"><i> Official Report</i>, column 1001W</phrase>), responsibility for issuing guidance to electoral registration officers (EROs) on electoral registration lies with the Electoral Commission. Guidance issued offers suggestions on increasing registration rates amongst under-represented groups, such as electors with learning difficulties or low levels of literacy. In addition, the guidance advises on the activities that EROs must undertake to meet section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, which placed a new duty on them to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the annual canvass form more than once and making house visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.3/2">The number of people registered to vote in Great Britain as reported by the Office for National Statistics is increasing. Following the 2007 annual canvass the number of parliamentary electors grew by 307,669 to 45,082,854; and the number of local government electors grew by 463,340 to 45,920,503. The Office for National Statistics is expected to publish figures for the 2008 annual canvass by the end of February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.3/3">The Government have no current plans to produce a league table of electoral registration officers' performance. However, the performance standards framework established by the Electoral Administration Act 2006 will allow the collection of data on the performance and activities of electoral administrators, including EROs.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.3/4">The Electoral Commission published a final set of performance standards for Electoral Registration Officers in Great Britain in July 2008, details of which have been laid before the House. One of the standards will provide information on the use of house to house inquiries and canvassers by administrators. The Commission will publish the results of EROs' self-assessments against all of the standards in spring 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.3/5">The Government are not aware of national indicators being previously set in the last 12 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.994W.11/2">A Home Office Research Study<sup>(1)</sup> also evaluated two regimes&mdash;'High Intensity Training' at the Young Offenders Institution at Thorn Cross and a scheme based on the ethos of a 'Military Corrective Training Centre' (MCTC) at the YOI in Colchester. Both schemes were for 18-21 year old males suitable for open conditions. The study of the Colchester scheme concluded that this regime was not successful in reducing reconvictions, but the young people on the Colchester regime had significantly more positive attitudes towards staff and other inmates at the end of sentence and were significantly more hopeful about the future than the control group. The two year reconviction rates for Thorn Cross showed that, while there was no significant difference in the proportion of offenders reconvicted between the experimental and control group, the experimental group took longer to offend and committed significantly fewer crimes.</p>

	<p pid="a.997W.3/1">A persistent young offender (PYO) is a young person aged 10-17 who has been sentenced guilty by any criminal court in the UK on three or more separate occasions for one or more recordable offence, and within three years of the last sentencing occasion is subsequently arrested or has an information laid against them for a further recordable offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/2">This definition is designed to measure the speed and efficiency of the youth justice system; through monitoring the pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for dealing with PYOs in England and Wales from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days. However, the definition is not designed to provide a reliable measure of the level of youth offending over time, and it will give a misleading picture of the true trend if used for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/3">The aforementioned pledge was first met over a full calendar year in 2002 and has been met in all but one calendar year since then. Youth sentencing is therefore now more timely, and for repeat offenders more frequent, than it used to be prior to 1997. As the PYO definition relies on repeat sentencing occasions, a side-effect of the Government's success in bringing much swifter justice to young repeat offenders is that more of them end up being defined as PYOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/4">Table 1 shows the number of PYOs, and the number of offences committed by them, for each police force area in 2008. These 2008 figures are provisional at present as the data for 2008 has not yet been finalised. Final figures for 2008 will be published in March 2009 by the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/5">Table 2 shows the total number of notifiable offences brought to justice, and the proportion of them that are attributable to PYOs, for each police force for 2007 (the most recent year for which these data are available). It is not possible to present a meaningful statistical comparison between police recorded crime and numbers of offences committed by PYOs, because the two measures have different counting bases.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-10">10 December 2008</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Justice announced in a written ministerial statement that the PYO pledge would be dropped with effect from the end of 2008. This is therefore the last year for which PYO statistics will be published and compiled.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/7">Data from the performance management arrangements for the Prolific and other Priority Offender programme provide the number of such offenders identified through partnership arrangements in each police force area. The data are provided in table 3. The data cover the financial year 2007-08 from April 2007 up to March 2008, and are the most recent data available. These figures rely on the accuracy and completeness of the data provided locally by Prolific and Priority Offender schemes.</p>

DFID has a commitment to spending at least 50 per cent. of its aid through Afghan government systems, for example using the World Bank-managed Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. This helps build the Afghan government's capacity to provide services for its citizens. 10 per cent. of our assistance (&pound;14.7 million) is provided to non-Afghan organisations and companies to provide technical assistance and capacity building to the Afghan government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002W.6/1">The UK Government remain committed to helping the DRC Government to hold local elections as soon as feasible and preferably in advance of the national elections in 2011. As the largest bilateral donor supporting the election processes, we are now working to ensure effective future elections by strengthening the Independent Elections Commission, through a grant of &pound;14.5 million to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This will help fund administrative structures; including the establishment of local liaison offices throughout the country and revision of the electoral roll&mdash;developing it in a way that can be regularly updated for any future elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.6/2">The local elections have been delayed due to lack of funding from the DRC Government. The Department for International Development (DFID) is currently working with other donors to ensure the shortfall is met partly by the international community without taking ownership away from the DRC Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1007W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports the overall monitoring of microfinance through the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), a multi-donor partnership working to expand access to finance, including microfinance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1007W.2/2">The most recent detailed research carried out by CGAP on 2003-06 data showed that</p>
	<p pid="a.1007W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;the rates offered by most microfinance institutions (MFIs) compare favourably to informal finance, supplier credit, and the few other alternatives that would be available to MFI clients. In sub-Saharan Africa, interest rates also dropped at a rate of 1.4 percentage points from 2003 to 2006.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1007W.2/4">This is confirmed by DFID research in Malawi where the commercial banking sector reaches less than 5 per cent. of the population and charges interest of about 16-20 per cent.; down from about 30 per cent. five years ago. Most smallholder farmers do not have anything a commercial bank would consider as security: land is not titled and smallholders in Malawi have an exceptionally low asset base. Microfinance is reaching another 5 per cent. of the households and real interest rates from rural microfinance institutions are estimated at around 45 per cent. However 90 per cent. of Malawians have no access to financial services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1007W.2/5">Beyond Malawi, several other household surveys carried out recently in Africa with DFID funding show that the absolute level of interest rate is not one of the detrimental factors that constrain poor people's access to financial services, including microfinance. The promotion of transparency, competition and financial literacy, is very important and in the long run can have a bearing on the level of interest. This is why DFID has recently launched the &pound;4 million Financial Education Fund (FEF), to back the best ideas to help raise financial literacy among poor consumers and small businesses in Africa. The FEF will operate across Africa. In its first round of calls for projects, FEF has received 110 concept notes that are under review.</p>

Although the rate has fallen to 15.6 per cent. of adults aged 15 to 54 years, it remains the main cause of illness and early death. Of those infected, 56 per cent. are women. Because most people in Zimbabwe, as in other highly affected countries, do not know their HIV status, it is difficult to calculate the number of households with at least one HIV positive member. However, households that are affected often experience multiple infections (in one or both parents and possibly in their young children) making HIV catastrophic for the welfare of all members. Although there are no reliable statistics, as many as one in eight households may be affected in some way by HIV/AIDS.</p>

Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br/> <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnoses</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data Quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1020W.5/1">Prior to April 2006, most primary dental services were provided under former general dental service (GDS) arrangements. These were demand-led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much national health service (NHS) work they chose to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="a.1020W.5/2">The former GDS arrangements were replaced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, when primary care trusts (PCTs) were given responsibility for planning and commissioning primary dental services and provided with local, devolved, dental budgets. The primary dental service funding allocations made to Wiltshire PCT for each of the three years since PCTs assumed full responsibility for primary dental care services are in the following table. These are net of income from dental charges paid by patients, which are retained locally to supplement the resources available for dentistry. Actual expenditure levels are determined by the pattern and type of services commissioned by each PCT. PCTs may also dedicate some of their other NHS resources to dentistry if they consider this an appropriate local priority. Allocations are not apportioned by individual constituency areas; PCTs determine the distribution of resources within their area on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1023W.0/1">No discussions have taken place between departmental officials and the Directorate General Enterprise of the European Commission on the potential impact upon small and medium-sized businesses of the setting of maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements under the provisions of article 5 of the food supplements directive.</p>

That is why we have more than doubled the Government funds available for the programme from &pound;57 million in 1997 to &pound;146 million in 2008 with an increase of &pound;10 million in each of the subsequent years making the budget &pound;166 million by 2010.

	<p pid="a.1024W.0/23">The means test used for disabled facilities grants works on the same principle as the tests used for many other means-tested benefits including housing benefit. The test includes as expenditure a range of standard allowances and premiums based on housing benefit and income support regulations. This model not only ensures that the grant goes to those least able to contribute to the cost of the works but also to help ensure that applicants are treated consistently. The Department does not hold records of individuals' contributions. The following link provides greater detail on the means test.</p>

	<p pid="a.1043W.8/1">Although arrangements vary across the Fire and Rescue Service, typically officers on the flexible duty, system are required to work a weekly average of no more than 42 positive managerial hours; and to provide standby cover on an on-call basis which should average not more than 36 hours per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043W.8/2">The amendments voted by the European Parliament in December to end opt-outs from the working time directive's 48-hour weekly maximum; and to the treatment of inactive on-call time as working time could, taken together, have a substantial impact on FRS officers working the flexible duty system. The UK therefore places great importance on retaining the opt-out and other flexibilities agreed by the Council of Ministers in June and will continue to defend them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1044W.0/1">The theme of Holocaust Memorial Day 2009, organised by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, was 'Stand Up to Hatred'. It examined what hatred means; how it can be enshrined in actions, language and legislation; and how each individual can help to make our communities strong and safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044W.0/2">A number of hon. Members attended the national commemoration on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-25">25 January 2009</phrase> at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. These included my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government; and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department. I also attended, and was able to meet with a number of survivors at a reception, where I read a goodwill message from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044W.0/3">In addition to this, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-26">26 January 2009</phrase> I attended the Beth Shalom Centre where I was able to take part in a service marking Holocaust Memorial Day. The Beth Shalom Centre is a place of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust and a place of education, challenge and reflection for people everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044W.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-29">29 January 2009</phrase>, I opened and closed a Topical Debate on the floor of the House of Commons which was dedicated to Holocaust Memorial Day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044W.0/5">Bodies that commemorate the Holocaust and subsequent genocides play a vital role in ensuring that we never allow ourselves forget past atrocities, and help our and future generations to learn from them. The Government are continuing strongly to support such bodies, as well as bodies whose work is associated with the theme of this year's event. This includes core grant funding of &pound;750,000 to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, an increase of 50 per cent. on previous years.</p>

The last review of X-Factor was carried out in 2007 to inform the 2008 AFPRB report. In the report, the AFPRB noted that all the evidence was unanimous and emphatic that X-Factor is an important part of the overall remuneration package for the armed forces. As a result of the evidence gathered, the AFPRB judged that an increase in the level of X-Factor from 13 per cent. to 14 per cent. of base pay was warranted, together with a change to the tapering arrangements for Lieutenant Colonels and equivalent and above. The Government accepted this recommendation which was implemented in full from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. The AFPRB is scheduled to review X-Factor again in 2012 for its 2013 report.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.9/40">The equipment failure reporting system (EFRS) is the mandated system for equipment users to report failures, such as accidental damage, maintenance related failures and breakdowns, or the failure of an item fitted to the vehicle. It does not incorporate the results of subsequent investigations and therefore does not differentiate between what might later prove to have been a problem caused by operator error or damage sustained as a result of operations. Nor does this data record the severity of a failure which might have no discernible impact on operational capability or safety. It is not possible using EFRs to distinguish how many of the EFRs in the 'Others' section were as a result of training, and some of the EFRs raised in Iraq and Afghanistan may have been during in theatre training rather than during the conduct of operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1065W.9/1">It is not only education law which applies to maintained schools and their employees. There is a wide range of legislation which applies to such schools to a lesser or greater extent. It would therefore be a massive, and ongoing, task for the Department to compile such a list, and to try to establish it would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.9/2">Academies are accountable through their funding agreements and legislation. This includes duties under equalities, procurement, employment and health and safety law; all of which are applied to maintained schools in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.9/3">Nevertheless, in relation to education law, the regulatory framework applied to academies is lighter-touch than the framework applied to maintained schools. This is because we wish to give academies flexibility in the way they are run in many areas&mdash;e.g. curriculum content and delivery (although, since 2007 all new academies have to follow the national curriculum for English, Maths, Science and ICT), organisation of the school day, pay and conditions of teachers&mdash;in order to help break through entrenched educational failure and low aspiration. Through offering innovative solutions towards tackling educational under-achievement academies are making significant strides towards improving the attainment of children within our most educationally disadvantaged communities. In 2008, the 36 academies which have been open long enough to have results in both 2007 and 2008 have seen an increase of 11.5 per cent. in the number of pupils at the end of key stage 4 gaining five or more A*-C grades at GCSE and equivalent. This is more than twice the otherwise impressive increase of 4.6 per cent. seen nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.9/4">Copies of our model funding agreement documentation and a list of some of the key legislative requirements on academies have been placed in the Libraries to illustrate how academies are held to account. Copies of open academies' funding agreements can be viewed on the DCSF FOI website</p>

	<p pid="a.1066W.2/1">If a sponsor wishes to withdraw involvement, for whatever reason, once an academy has been opened then the academy trust and DCSF would agree the best way forward. The prime consideration would be the needs of the pupils at the academy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1066W.2/2">Academy financial sponsorship is of two types. More recent academies have sponsorship in the form of contribution to endowment funds. The income from these funds is intended to be used to enhance students' opportunities and widen the academy's role in its community, but does not contribute to the recurrent costs of providing education. Therefore any shortfall in sponsorship contributions, whilst regrettable, does not produce any need for additional support of the academy concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1066W.2/3">Earlier academies have sponsorship in the form of contributions towards the capital cost, and in some cases contributions are complete. Where they are not, and a sponsor has difficulty completing payments on time, we will consider on a case-by-case basis what action to take.</p>

Local authorities have discretion to spend this funding in line with their own particular needs and circumstances, to ensure that the specific training needs of early years staff in each area are met. Initial training and continuing professional development courses for child care practitioners include coverage of behaviour management and child protection issues. This may include training to increase awareness of the ban on physical punishment in child care settings. In addition the DCSF spent &pound;7.5 million each year from 2006 to 2009 to support specific Early Years Foundation Stage training on effective practice without the use of physical punishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.5/2">The Department is providing &pound;8.67 million in 2008-09 for the National Academy for Parenting Practitioners to deliver a combination of research and training to support and develop the parenting workforce. We expect this to bring about a significant change in the supply and quality of the parenting support offered to parents, including increased availability of parenting classes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1070W.0/1">After careful consideration of the House of Lords judgment in Wright, the Government remain satisfied that the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (SVG) Act 2006 is compatible with human rights and in particular with Articles 6 and 8 of the ECHR. The scheme under the SVG Act does not include the feature of provisional listing, which was the focus of the challenge in the Wright case. In particular, whenever the ISA is exercising its discretion to place someone on a barred list, including under the SVG Act 2006 (Transitory Provisions Order) 2009 (SI 2009/12), which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-20">20 January 2009</phrase>, it must first invite their representations and also must send the individual the information on which it intends to rely. This is provided for in paragraphs 3(2), 5(2), 9(2), 11(2) and 16(1) of Schedule 3 to the Act. It would only be where a person had committed an offence which, by its nature, indicated that they posed an immediate risk of harm to the vulnerable (prescribed in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (Prescribed Criteria and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2009, S.I. 2009/37) that they would be barred before being given the right to make representations. This is provided for in paragraphs 1,2,7 and 8 of Schedule 3 to the Act (the offences prescribed under paragraph 1 include the rape of a child, for example). The judgment in Wright acknowledged that an &quot;ex parte&quot; procedure could be justified in such circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072W.6/2">The Children's Plan made a commitment to ensure that all children and young people, no matter where they live and or what their background, can get involved in high quality cultural activities in and out of school, working towards a five-hour offer to match that for sport. The 10 &quot;Find Your Talent&quot; pathfinders that started in September 2008 will, over the next three years, work towards a position where that commitment is a reality.</p>

	<p pid="a.1073W.6/1">The responsibility for ensuring that rigorous standards are maintained over time in A levels rests with the independent regulator, Ofqual. A levels are internationally respected qualifications and claims that they have got easier have been investigated and refuted on numerous occasions. A levels have recently been strengthened further to include additional stretch and challenge for the brightest students and the introduction of an A* grade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.6/2">The Government have made no assessment of the merits of a &quot;recalibration&quot; of A levels, which would only be appropriate if we were to change the purpose of the qualification. We have already announced that we will review A levels in 2013, and can consider any such issues, in consultation with Ofqual, at that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077W.0/2">Internal analysis of the level of agreement between the 2007 key stage 3 (KS3) teacher assessments and national curriculum tests has been undertaken and is provided in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.0/3">Analysis of these data indicates that there is a reasonable match between test performance and teacher assessment data. Where there is not, the teacher assessments are equally likely to be higher or lower than the performance test level achieved. When interpreting these data, it should be borne in mind that national curriculum test and teacher assessment data will not always correlate. This is because tests provide a snapshot of attainment at the end of the key stage whereas teacher assessment takes into account evidence of attainment in a variety of contexts (such as discussion and observation), throughout the year. Both are vital to ensure rounded, and validated, assessments can be made about each child's performance.</p>

This decision is made by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) in line with the code of practice on statistics. Under the code of practice, the QCA is required to provide four weeks notice of its intention to publish. This notification will be made on the QCA website.

	<p pid="a.1079W.5/1">For funding additional school places the Department relied on authorities' own pupil projections for its estimates of the number of children entering primary schools in each local authority area in 2000-01, 2005-06 and 2010-11. Officials are reviewing emerging pupil number trends to inform the spending review period 2011-12 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079W.5/2">Local authorities use a wide variety of methods for forecasting pupil numbers. The different methods entail a broadly similar approach that involves taking current pupil numbers and adding/subtracting the net totals of children entering/leaving the school system. We would also expect authorities to also take account of local factors that will have an impact on pupil projections&mdash;including rising/falling birth rates, population movements in/out of the area, and proposed new housing developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079W.5/3">The Department relies on its own national pupil projections to set the national envelope for recurrent funding. These are linked to ONS (Office for National Statistics) data, which take account of projected population increases. The Department's local authority level projections were used to provide individual indicative allocations and Guaranteed Units of Funding (GUF) at the start of the current CSR period for 2008-11. These indicative allocations become finalised once the latest pupil numbers are known. There are currently no LA level projections formulated for this purpose beyond the current CSR period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-16">16 February 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.2/4" class="indent">Since the introduction of the current school inspection framework (commonly known as section 5) in September 2005, the judgement of a school's overall effectiveness has been made using a four point scale: outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate. Under the previous school inspection framework (commonly known as Section 10), a school's overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.2/5" class="indent">It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from a seven- to a four-point scale. Ofsted's criteria for making inspection judgements about schools are clearly set out in our inspection guidance. Inspectors do not make reference to, or comparisons with, the previous inspection framework. However, for information, Tables A-E list all of the Pupil Referral Units which have been judged outstanding since September 2005 and all those judged excellent or very good between September 2003 and July 2005. These are grouped by academic year and by local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.2/6" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to right hon. Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1084W.5/2">Ofsted does not set minimum nutritional guidelines for school meals. However, the Government have set mandatory nutritional standards for school food. Ofsted does not inspect whether a school is meeting all of the standards but, as part of their regular inspections, expect schools to present evidence about their general approach to food and healthy eating (the 'whole school' approach) and will report on any issues which arise out of self-assessment or as a result of their inspection visit. This contributes to the judgement which Ofsted makes on the extent to which learners adopt healthy lifestyles.</p>

The amount of money allocated to a school depends very much on the individual local authorities' own policy for funding their schools. Different authorities retain varying amounts of funding centrally to spend on behalf of their schools while others chose to give schools more autonomy over how they spend their money by devolving more funding to the individual school.<br/>  3. The pupil numbers used to calculate the per pupil amounts are as reported by the local authority on their Section 52 Budget Statement (Table 2) comprising of the full-time equivalent number pupils registered at the school used for the initial determination of the school's budget share under the local authority's allocation formula.<br/>  4. Included are all local authority maintained primary and secondary schools who are reported by their LA as being open for the entire final year (schools that are reported as either opening or closing during the financial year have been removed).

	<p pid="a.1091W.2/1">Public service agreement 11 of October 2007 set out the Government's commitment to narrow the gap in educational achievement between children from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers. It did not specify principles of validated good practice in schools and child care settings. The Children's Plan set out the Government's policies to extend and mainstream best practice across the whole child care and education system, including through the self-evaluation and Ofsted inspection frameworks. &quot;The Children's Plan - One Year On&quot;, published in December 2008, reported on progress since then in enabling all children and young people to succeed, and set out priorities for 2009.</p>
