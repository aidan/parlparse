Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.1087W.7/2">The Government will not take any decisions on local government finance until it has had the chance to consider Sir Michael's report and recommendations fully.</p>

	<p pid="d.1088W.3/2">In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, our policy is to stamp out the disease as quickly as possible in accordance with the EU directive for the control of avian influenza (2005/94/EU). Culling of the affected flock and any dangerous contacts, together with stringent controls around the affected premises, is the best way of dealing rapidly with an outbreak.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.3/3">However, for certain birds, subject to a veterinary risk assessment, the directive provides for a derogation from the requirement to cull.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.3/4">This derogation extends to officially recognised rare breeds of poultry and other captive birds. Following discussions with the relevant societies for captive birds, the crested canary has been officially recognised for this purpose. It can also be applied to premises such as non-commercial premises, wildlife parks and zoos.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.3/5">Conservation of endangered species is covered separately under the derogation. Species considered threatened under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of threatened species could benefit.</p>

	<p pid="d.1088W.6/1">When the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT) was designed, statistical power calculations were performed which indicated that, to be sufficiently precise to detect a 20 per cent. reduction in tuberculosis (TB) incidence associated with either culling treatment, 50 &quot;triplet years&quot; worth of data would have to be collected.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.6/2">In 2003, the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) detected a statistically significant result for the reactive element of the RBCT that indicated an increase in confirmed TB incidence in cattle in reactive areas compared to survey-only areas. Under agreed operating procedures the ISG was obliged to bring this to the attention of Ministers, who concluded that the reactive culling operations should be discontinued. Reactive culling was suspended in November 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.6/3">By the end of the 2005 planned proactive culling operations, the target of 50 triplet year's of data collection had been achieved, and proactive culling therefore ceased.

The enhancement of his powers to require waste authorities to deliver services in general conformity with his strategy, along with his existing power of direction, will help ensure the strategic vision the Mayor sets out for London is delivered on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="d.1092W.5/2">The Waste and Recycling Forum, announced as part of the package, will be led by the Mayor to co-ordinate activity across different sectors and address the key strategic issues facing London.

	<p pid="d.1092W.5/3">In addition, there will be a dedicated London element to the Waste Infrastructure Development Programme (WIDP), which was announced in May 2006, providing a strong role for the Mayor in working with local authorities and the regions to accelerate the building of new waste diversion infrastructure, allowing London to manage more of its waste within London.</p>
	<p pid="d.1092W.5/4">The Mayor already has a leading role in planning for London's waste treatment needs through the London Plan, where he has set a target for London to be 85 per cent. self sufficient for waste management by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="d.1092W.5/5">This will significantly reduce the pressure on surrounding regions. The Mayor will also have increased powers related to planning and will now have the power to take over and decide on planning applications that are strategically important to London.</p>

	<p pid="d.1093W.5/1">The Weeds Act 1959 enables the Secretary of State to serve an enforcement notice on an occupier of land on which injurious weeds are growing, requiring them to take action to prevent the spread of weeds. It is an offence to fail unreasonably to comply with an enforcement notice served under the Act. The Act also enables the Secretary of State to take default action to clear weeds, where control action has not been taken following the issue of an enforcement notice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1093W.5/2">Defra takes action under the Weeds Act where there is a risk to the welfare of horses and other livestock. Under revised procedures for investigating complaints about injurious weeds, introduced in 2003, Defra has made far greater use of the statutory powers available under the Weeds Act. To date we have issued 134 enforcement notices and taken clearance action in three cases. There have been no prosecutions under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="d.1093W.5/3">The Ragwort Control Act 2003 amended the Weeds Act 1959 and provided for the preparation of a Code of Practice on how to prevent the spread of ragwort. The Code was published in July 2004 and provides comprehensive advice on the control of ragwort. It is available from Defra Publications (telephone: 08459 55 6000) and is on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/horses/topics/ragwort.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/horses/topics/ragwort.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1093W.5/4">The Code and revised enforcement procedures have increased public awareness of the dangers to horses and other livestock from ragwort, and are proving effective in preventing the spread of ragwort where there is a threat to animal welfare. This is illustrated by the fact that, in the vast majority of cases, where Defra has served an enforcement notice, land managers have acted promptly to take action to clear weeds.</p>

The exact gains that developed and developing nations could derive from the Doha round are difficult to calculate, because they depend on a large number of variables. Although the UK has not conducted an independent assessment of the impact of the Doha development agenda, the European Commission has undertaken a full Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) of the possible economic, development, environmental and social impacts of a DDA agreement.

	<p pid="d.1103W.6/1">HM Revenue and Customs judgment that there is not widespread abuse of export controls is based on their assessment of the export control breaches either detected at the frontier or referred or disclosed to them and their evaluation of the intelligence and other information available to them. HMRC does not have a precisely defined numerical threshold for widespread abuse. They regard as abuse those cases where there is evidence of a deliberate breach involving destinations of concern or particularly sensitive goods.</p>

This too was publicised widely in advertisements appearing in national and regional newspapers, on television and radio and online throughout June 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.1105W.2/2">Self-assessment (SA) taxpayers who had the former children's tax credit included in their 2002-03 pay as you earn (PAYE) coding were automatically sent a tax credits claim pack to enable them to claim the new tax credits (NTC), in good time, prior to April 2003. All notices of coding, issued ahead of the new income tax year 2003-04, carried a message and enclosed a letter that explained how IR was changing the way they paid support for children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1105W.2/3">The IR identified potential NIC claimants who did not have employed earnings or did not have children's tax credit in their PAYE coding in 2002-03, but claimed children's tax credit on their 2001-02 SA return by <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>, by comparing data held on their SA and NTC records. That exercise enabled IR to identify and send claim packs to around 675,000 SA customers, who had not already submitted a claim for NTC to enable them to claim tax credits.</p>

In November 2004, the Paris Club group of official creditors agreed with Iraq to cancel $31.1 billion (80 per cent.) of their total $38.9 billion claims on Iraq in three stages;</p>

	<p pid="d.1108W.5/5">The 2004 Paris Club Agreement also included a clause, which required Iraq to seek comparable debt relief from all its other non-Paris Club sovereign and commercial creditors. All Paris Club and some non- Paris Club sovereign creditors have delivered the first two tranches of debt cancellation. Commercial creditors have also delivered comparable debt relief. We expect remaining non-Paris Club creditors to follow suit.</p>

The UK has cancelled &pound;672 million of Iraq's &pound;1,122.8 million debt owed to the UK and will cancel a further &pound;225 million (20 per cent. of UK's original debt stock) in accordance with the terms of the Paris Club agreement.</p>

	<p pid="d.1111W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question about which local authorities have been identified by the Office for National Statistics as being affected by flawed population statistics. (94071)</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.8/4" class="indent">The local authority population estimates are calculated from a number of different components. The data sources upon which these components are based vary in terms of their reliability. The Office for National Statistics recognises this and acknowledges that the most difficult to measure component is migration. ONS therefore accepts that LAs with a rapidly changing population structure will be more difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the mid-year population estimates are the best available and are as accurate as possible given the limitations of current sources.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.8/5" class="indent">In September 2004 ONS revised the population estimates of 15 local authorities, which were identified as being the hardest to count areas in the 2001 Census. These were: Westminster, Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff, Newcastle, Derby, Hartlepool, Middlesborough, Stockton-on-Tees, Kingston upon Hull, Milton Keynes, Sunderland, Wandsworth, Wirral, and Southwark. Details of the LA Studies report can be found here:</p>

	<p pid="d.1111W.8/7" class="indent">There is no conclusive evidence available to suggest that any other LAs have been either under or overestimated. ONS is however continuing to invest resources into researching alternative sources and methodologies and has set up the Improving Migration and Population Statistics Project, details of which can be found here:</p>

	<p pid="d.1112W.2/5" class="indent">As the estimates are made freely available via a number of publication routes, including the internet, it is impossible to list all their uses. However, these uses can be categorised into two broad groups:</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/6" class="indent">Uses where the absolute numbers are of key importance. This may be in terms of allocating financial resources from central government, planning services or grossing up survey results. Some of the main central government uses are concerned with resource allocation and are carried out by the Department for Communities and Local Government for England, and by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/7" class="indent">Uses where the population figures are compared with other figures such as the numbers of births or deaths in the calculation of rates and ratios.</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/8" class="indent">Specific uses include:</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/9" class="indent">Funding allocation between UK countries in the Barnett formula, by the EU to determine structural fund allocations, by the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Welsh Assembly Government for local authorities and Department of Health for Primary Care Organisations;</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/10" class="indent">As a base for calculation of population estimates by marital status, population estimates by ethnic origin, population estimates for private household estimates, and quarterly population estimates;</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/11" class="indent">As a base for population projections, marital status projections, and in household projections;</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/12" class="indent">In the calculation of rates, including mortality rates, morbidity rates, fertility rates, divorce rates, marriage rates and unemployment rates;</p>
	<p pid="d.1112W.2/13" class="indent">To weight or 'gross up' household surveys like the Survey of English Housing and the Labour Force Survey;</p>

	<p pid="d.1114W.8/1">Most foodstuffs are VAT zero-rated, saving consumers approximately &pound;10.6 billion in the last financial year. This zero rate does not however extend to certain beverages, including fruit drinks. Under binding European VAT agreements, made at the time of the UK's accession to the EC and subsequently, the UK can maintain its existing zero rates but successive Governments have agreed not to extend these, or to introduce new ones. It is therefore not possible under these agreements to remove VAT from fruit drinks and other beverages.</p>
	<p pid="d.1114W.8/2">These same agreements do allow the UK to introduce a reduced rate of VAT of not less than 5 per cent. for foodstuffs which are not zero-rated. While all taxes are kept under review, the use of VAT reduced rates have been used where the tax system offers the most effective and best targeted support for our social objectives, when compared with other policy instruments.</p>
	<p pid="d.1114W.8/3">The 2004 Wanless report on public health highlighted difficulties of principle and practice with dietary based tax changes to support public health. To date, the Government have therefore focused resources to encourage healthy eating choices outside the tax system.</p>

	<p pid="d.1118W.6/2">The Curriculum Online website has been designed and updated in consultation with teachers. It has a powerful and innovative search engine that allows teachers to search by subject, title, size of resource (e.g. from a single lesson to whole school) or supplier. Teachers can even search for Foundation resources only, SEN resources only, free/priced resources, or resources for use with an interactive whiteboard. Many products carry independent evaluations and/or teacher reviews to help teachers further in their decision making. The ability to view quotes from several suppliers for the same product can also help teachers to make purchases which offer better value for their money.</p>

	<p pid="d.1121W.0/1">The Teenage Pregnancy Independent Advisory Group's (TPIAG) fourth annual report&mdash;published in September 2006&mdash;included six recommendations, none of which called on Government to introduce compulsory lessons in schools on abortion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1121W.0/2">In her foreword, however, the TPIAG Chair&mdash;Gill Frances&mdash;did argue that pregnant young women and their partners should have access to impartial, evidence-based information on the options open to them, including abortion, to help inform the decision about whether or not to continue with the pregnancy. This is a view with which the Government concurs. TPIAG report that many myths prevail, including the fact that abortion may lead to infertility, which they are concerned may be a contributory factor to repeat abortions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1121W.0/3">The TPIAG Chair also argues that school-based Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) programmes should provide opportunities to convey factual information about abortion. The Government expect all schools to offer comprehensive SRE programmes, in line with its SRE guidance to schools, issued in 2000. Schools are also encouraged to evaluate their SRE programmes against the QCA's end of key stage statements, issued in November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.1121W.0/4">Ministers in the Department for Education and Skills have received a small amount of correspondence from members of the public concerned about press reports, which wrongly said that TPIAG had called for schools to 'promote the benefits' of abortion. This was not the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.1121W.0/5">The TPIAG monitors implementation and makes independent recommendations on the future development of the teenage pregnancy strategy. Government will publish its formal response to TPIAG's report early next year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1121W.0/6">Members of TPIAG are not paid a salary. All members receive a daily rate for attending meetings (110). The Chair receives an annuity of &pound;15,000 a year, including expenses, reflecting the time and commitment put into tackling this important Government priority.</p>

	<p pid="d.1121W.3/1">There has been steady progress on reducing under-18 conception rates since the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was launched in 1999. Between 1998 (the baseline year for the strategy) and 2004 (the latest year for which data are available), the under-18 rate has fallen by 11.1 per cent. and the under-16 rate has fallen by 15.2 per cent. Both rates are now at their lowest levels for 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1121W.3/2">Delivery guidance issued to local authorities and primary care trusts in July 2006 set out what was working in areas with sharply declining rates and requires all areas to reflect these findings in their future plans. A broader strategy document published in September 2006 provided analysis on the underlying causes of teenage pregnancy, to help local areas to target their strategies on young people at greatest risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.1121W.3/3">The strategy includes a challenging public service agreement target to halve the under-18 conception rate by 2010 (compared to the 1998 baseline rate). We envisage that we will continue to need a small team of policy officials within DfES (the Teenage Pregnancy Unit currently has seven members of staff) to drive forward the Strategy. Broad estimates calculate that every pound spent on the Strategy, results in savings of four pounds to the public purse, when assessed over a period of five years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1125W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. I am responding, with his authority, on his behalf.</p>

	<p pid="d.1125W.3/5" class="indent">Information on the Agency's telephony performance is contained in table 16 of the Agency's &quot;Quarterly Summary of Statistics&quot;, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet (<a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp</a>).</p>

A breakdown of this information for the twelve months to June 2006, the latest published information, is in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/7" class="indent">The table shows that, for example, in the month of June 2006:</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/8" class="indent">439,000 calls were received by the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/9" class="indent">437,000 of these calls had a recorded outcome, of which:</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/10" class="indent">13% (57,000) of these calls never progressed to the point at which they were available for staff to answer (for example, because the call was abandoned by the caller during the automated touchtone part of the process).</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/11" class="indent">87% (380,000) of these calls were available for staff to answer, of which:</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/12" class="indent">98% (373,000) of these calls were actually answered.</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/13" class="indent">2% of these calls were abandoned by the caller.</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/14" class="indent">Calls were answered, on average, 21 seconds after becoming available to staff to answer, which is measured from the point at which the call leaves the automated touchtone part of the process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1125W.3/15" class="indent">It should be noted that the Agency's telephony performance has greatly improved over the last year. The average time to answer calls decreased from 54 seconds in July 2005 to 21 seconds in June 2006 while the percentage of calls answered that were available for staff to answer increased from 92% to 98% over the same period.</p>

'Calls for which outcome not recorded' are those which were received but for which, due to problems with the management information system, the eventual outcome was not recorded. Some of these calls would have been answered, and others would have been abandoned. The volume of such calls has decreased significantly in the last 3 years as management information systems have improved. 4. 'Calls for which outcome recorded' are those which were received and for which there is management information to track the eventual outcome. 5. Other ineffective calls are those that result in a ring tone but no reply, fail due to network technical problems, or are answered by a BT message but do not connect to the CSA system. 6. IVR denotes the automated touch tone part of the process where clients enter their details via the telephone key pad. Once callers have cleared this part of the process, they enter a queue to be answered by a CSA person. 7. The percentage of calls abandoned in the queue refers to the percentage of total calls received, for which the outcome is recorded, that were abandoned once in a queue to be answered by a CSA person. 8. The percentage of calls answered that were available to CSA people to answer refers to calls answered as a proportion of those that were connected to the queue for an agent (post IVR where appropriate). 9. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand, and percentages to the nearest 1 per cent. Components may not sum to totals due to rounding.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.1128W.5/3" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions:</p>
	<p pid="d.1128W.5/4" class="indent">What arrangements are made for recipients of child support payments when a payment is not made due to a failure at the Child Support Agency and considerable hardship is likely to be faced as a result;</p>
	<p pid="d.1128W.5/5" class="indent">What system is in place to notify recipients of child support payments that their payment will not be made due to failure within the Child Support Agency; and</p>

	<p pid="d.1128W.5/7" class="indent">The Agency has a number of processes in place to ensure that no clients will be disadvantaged by any failings of the CSA in respect of payments due to clients once the required maintenance has been received from the non-resident parent. These processes apply whether this failing is because of system problems or caseworker delay. If problems with the Agency's IT systems prevent case progression, then the case can be progressed clerically. If IT system problems simply prevent the payment from being made, the payment can be processed clerically to ensure that the payment is still issued.</p>
	<p pid="d.1128W.5/8" class="indent">If a case is progressed clerically both the parent with care and the non-resident parent will be informed that their case is being progressed by a specialist team. However, in cases where systems failures simply prevent the payments due, the issue is only identified at the point the payment fails to reach the parent with care, and the Agency is informed of that failed payment. Once the Agency has been made aware that the payment has not reached its destination, the payment will be made as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.1128W.5/9" class="indent">In the event of such a failure the Agency has a tightly controlled process in place to consider compensation for financial loss as a result of Agency maladministration. This includes any bank charges that may have occurred due to the fault of the Agency. The Agency currently has a Special Payments Team in place to deal with financial redress due to maladministration.</p>
	<p pid="d.1128W.5/10" class="indent">I have received a letter from you about a particular case where a payment to one of our clients was delayed. We have replied to your letter separately.</p>

	<p pid="d.1130W.0/15" class="indent">What mechanisms have been put in place to safeguard data protection by Vertex when handling Child Support Agency cases; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/16" class="indent">The Agency has put in place a robust contract management process to measure the Vertex's performance in managing its clerical cases. This will be achieved through monthly performance and quarterly meetings, where performance will be reviewed and discussed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/17" class="indent">The term of the contract awarded to Vertex was 19 months; this ends in March 2008. Work to the computer system is continuing over 2006/2007 to rectify existing defects. The IT system will be working effectively before the end of the contract with Vertex to enable these cases to be put back onto the system.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/18" class="indent">It is planned that Vertex will initially manage 22,500 cases on behalf of the Child Support Agency increasing to 34,000 cases over the life of the contract. To date around 13,500 cases from four of the Agency's six business areas have already transferred to Vertex. The remaining cases are due to transfer later this month.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/19" class="indent">The award of the contract for the management of the Child Support Agency's clerical cases was not a Ministerial decision; it was a decision of the Agency. However, Ministers were made aware as soon as the decision had been made.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/20" class="indent">The Criteria used for the tendering process (which was conducted in line with European and Government Procurement Rules) for the contract for the management of clerical cases, and the basis for the decision to award the contract to Vertex was:</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/21" class="indent">The ability to deliver the overall solution</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/22" class="indent">Bulk case processing experience</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/23" class="indent">Operational flexibility/contingencies</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/24" class="indent">Supplier understanding of Clerical Cases Management Service</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/25" class="indent">Management Controls</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/26" class="indent">There were initially seven companies involved in the tender process for the management of clerical cases. By the final stage of the process the number of companies had been short-listed to three.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/27" class="indent">The decision to award the contract to Vertex was based on pre-determined and agreed criteria that reflected the quality of scheme required against best value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/28" class="indent">It is not possible for me to quantify the commercial value of the contract to Vertex. The generic contract cost to the Department for Work and Pensions is in the region of &pound;23 million for the life of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/29" class="indent">The Agency delivered comprehensive training to Vertex trainers over a 3-week period. The Vertex trainers then took this training to their own people who would be managing the clerical cases. Since then the Agency has provided approximately 100 people to Vertex to help consolidate this training and to assist in the early weeks of transition.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/30" class="indent">The Agency has rigorous procedures in place to prevent the mis-use of data in its possession, including the requirement for all employees to sign confidentiality agreements, and the random checking of system access by designated managers. The Department for Work and Pensions has over 20 detailed Information Technology (IT) Security and Data Protection policy documents which the Agency must comply with. These cover a diverse range of security matters, from Anti Virus Policy, Monitoring Official Systems Policy, the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the Freedom of Information Act. Vertex staff are bound by the same rules and policies as the Agency's employees.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130W.0/31" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.1137W.5/1">A range of electronic sensors may be installed in new road schemes. The most common sensors installed under the road surface are inductive loop detectors. These provide traffic data and operate traffic signals and other traffic management systems such as MIDAS (Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling), the queue protection system that operates on some motorways. The guidelines for the provision of loop detectors are contained in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, HD20/05 &quot;Detector Loops for Motorways&quot; and the standards for their installation are contained within MCH 1540 &quot;Specification for the Installation of Detector Loops on Motorways and All-Purpose Trunk Roads&quot;.

	<p pid="d.1141W.2/1">Early indications from our monitoring are that hard shoulder running has increased capacity by 13 per cent. and significantly improved journey times without any adverse effect on safety. However, in order to obtain a statistically significant measure of the traffic impact of hard shoulder running, a period of at least 12 months of operation will be required. Due to the relatively low number of accidents that occur on motorways, at least three years of 'after accident' data will also be needed before an overall conclusion can be reached on the impact of hard shoulder running on safety.</p>

	<p pid="d.1152W.0/1">The Legal Services Commission holds data on the number of solicitors' offices with legal help contracts, as each office requires a separate contract. For example a single firm might have five offices and that would be recorded as five contracts.</p>

Some of this latter group will be paid for certificated family work. This gives a total of 3,108.</p>
	<p pid="d.1152W.0/3">During the financial year 1997/98 there were a total of 10,601 active legal aid offices funded by the Legal Aid Board, with 86 per cent. doing &quot;matrimonial work&quot; giving a figure of 9,117 offices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1152W.0/4">The figures show a drop in the number of such offices of some two-thirds since 1997-98. The majority of those that stopped undertaking family work were not full-time specialists. In particular, the introduction of civil contracting in 2000 was intended to ensure that only the best quality specialists did the work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1152W.0/5">The continuing decline in numbers since then has been caused by the introduction of more rigorous quality assurance procedures, which have removed those service providers who are failing to deliver quality legal services.</p>

	<p pid="d.1160W.3/1">The House does not have access to records of when mail is received at Nine Elms. The House authorities do monitor the two contracts with regard to mail screening and internal mail delivery. Both of these contracts have key performance indicators. These show that all of the mail collected from Nine Elms on a given day is delivered within the Palace of Westminster by 2 pm that day, with over 60 per cent. of the day's mail delivered within the Palace by the 8 am delivery and over 75 per cent. by the 10 am delivery. Regular checks are made of the processes involved. A monitoring group made up of Officers from both Houses meets monthly to consider the performance against the contracts and the indicators have been met consistently in recent months following changes made by both contractors during the first full year of the new contracts. These changes have been aimed at maximising the volume of mail in the parliamentary deliveries in the early part of the day.</p>

They are based on the figures which have appeared annually in the taxes and benefits analysis, but have been adjusted to 2004-05 prices using the all items retail prices index. Receipts of cash benefits have also been shown as a percentage of average gross household income for households in the bottom income decile.</p>
	<p pid="d.1162W.6/7" class="indent">There has been some cyclical variation in receipts of cash benefits by this group of households, although there is no clear long term trend. However cash benefits constitute a declining proportion of gross income for these households. This is because of trend increases in real incomes from other sources such as wages and salaries and occupational pensions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1162W.6/8" class="indent">Cash benefits include contributory benefits such as the state retirement pension, and incapacity benefit, as well as non-contributory benefits such as income support, child benefit, housing benefit, and disability living allowance. Tax credits are only partially included since for households paying some income tax, the tax credits are initially treated as negative tax, rather than a benefit. Only after the tax credit has eliminated any income tax liability, is any further tax credit receipt treated as a benefit.</p>
	<p pid="d.1162W.6/9" class="indent">It should be remembered that these results are based on a sample survey and so there is some uncertainty surrounding the estimates for any one year. The bottom income decile is likely to contain some households who have low income but high wealth, and so can sustain a standard of living higher than that which would be suggested by their income alone.</p>

	<p pid="d.1166W.0/1">Good progress has been made in rolling out the national bowel cancer screening programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/2">The programme consists of five programme hubs across England which will invite men and women to participate in the screening programme, send out the faecal occult blood (FOB) testing kits, analyse the returned kits and send out results. Ninety to 100 local screening centres will provide endoscopy services for the 2 per cent. of men and women who have a positive FOB test result.</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/3">The five hubs have been confirmed as:</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/4" class="indent">Rugby&mdash;West Midlands and the North West&mdash;began operations in July 2006;</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/5" class="indent">Guildford&mdash;Southern&mdash;began operations in September 2006;</p>

	<p pid="d.1166W.0/8" class="indent">Nottingham&mdash;Eastern.</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/9">All five hubs will be operational by March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/10">In addition to the hubs, the first six local screening centres have now been confirmed. Wolverhampton and Norwich began sending out invitations in July 2006, and South Devon and Liverpool began sending out invitations in September 2006. St. Mark's London is due to begin sending out invitations in October 2006, with St. George's London following in November 2006. The other eight sites due to become local screening centres in wave one of the programme, that is 2006-07, will be confirmed as soon as possible, when they have satisfied quality and capacity criteria.</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/11">We will be writing to the new strategic health authorities (SHAs) shortly for them to bid for their local endoscopy units to become local screening centres as part of Wave two of the programme in 2007-08. It is up to SHAs to decide where local screening centres should be located for the benefit of their own populations.</p>
	<p pid="d.1166W.0/12">The bowel cancer screening programme is an ambitious project, and one of the first of its kind in Europe. When fully implemented, it will detect around 3,000 bowel cancers every year. We are committed to implementing this important programme.</p>

Most practices that provide primary dental services are independent contractors, and their NHS contract payments&mdash;which are based on the recommendations of the Doctors and Dentists Pay Review Body&mdash;already cover not only the dentists' net income but also the expenses incurred in providing NHS dental services. Additional grants to practices to improve facilities, and which may enhance the practice assets, are often made on the basis of a shared investment between the PCT and the contractor.</p>

	<p pid="d.1174W.2/1">The principal reason for any change to the capital values of the schemes at the University Hospitals of North Staffordshire National Health Service Trust, the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust, Tameside and Glossop Acute Services NHS Trust, Walsall Hospitals NHS Trust and the South Devon Healthcare NHS Trust was that the review of private finance initiative (PFI) schemes led the trusts concerned to reconsider how their schemes could best be structured in order to deliver services in the most cost-effective way and ensure their long-term viability. A key part of this work was an assessment of the capacity assumptions to ascertain if these were realistic and properly suited to the needs of the local health economy; and a review of the estate in terms of current and planned building stock to ensure optimal use.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174W.2/2">In consequence all the schemes, with the exception of those at the Salford Royal NHS Trust and the Tameside and Glossop Acute Services NHS Trust, underwent structural changes, details of which have been published and are available locally.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174W.2/3">All the figures quoted are on a like-for-like basis except those given in relation to Salford Royal NHS Trust, Tameside and Glossop Acute Services NHS Trust and University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. The difference between the capital values given for the schemes at Salford Royal NHS Trust, and Tameside and Glossop Acute Services NHS Trust is because the capital values given in the August press release were at 2004-05 prices, and those given in the answer given by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the Member for Liverpool Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-08">8 February</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-02-08.1325"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 1325-27W</phrase>, were at final construction outturn prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174W.2/4">The February figure for the scheme at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust was the public sector comparator cost at preferred bidder stage which equated to a PFI outturn cost of &pound;761 million. In addition building cost inflation and retail price index increases for the two years slippage in forecast financial close date took the cost to &pound;911 million prior to the review commencing.</p>

	<p pid="d.1175W.0/2">Where it was felt that a scheme was neither configured in the most cost effective way or financially sustainable in the long-term, changes to the scheme that would improve its affordability and cost-effectiveness were discussed and worked through with the trust.

	<p pid="d.1178W.10/1">Economic factors are the main incentive for farmers to grow poppy. Other factors such as insecurity and weak governance also play a role. This year in Helmand, the Taleban encouraged farmers to grow opium poppy. There are some reports of the Taleban intimidating farmers who do not grow poppy and offering protection from eradication to those who do. But there is no evidence to suggest that these actions had a significant impact on cultivation levels. A broader variety of factors play into farmers' decisions to grow poppy. This year, in areas of Afghanistan where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved in 2005 have been sustained and in some cases improved upon.</p>

	<p pid="d.1179W.2/1">The increase this year in the opium crop from Helmand and other southern provinces is worrying. It reflects the very difficult security situation and limited law enforcement capability in Afghanistan. We are supporting the Afghan Government to implement their National Drug Control Strategy. Progress is being made but sustainable drug elimination strategies take time. In areas of Afghanistan where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions in opium poppy cultivation achieved in 2005 have been sustained and in some cases improved upon.</p>
	<p pid="d.1179W.2/2">The effect of this year's increase in supplies of heroin to the UK is uncertain. Previous large fluctuations in the size of the opium crop in Afghanistan have led to no appreciable change in supply as measured by the UK average street price.</p>

The Afghans do not keep a central record of municipal prosecutions and as such records can be recovered only at disproportionate cost. The more serious cases, which involve amounts in excess of 2kg of heroin or 10kg of opium, are heard by the CN Tribunal in Kabul. By the end of September 2006, the CN Criminal Justice Task Force had arrested over 690 individuals and completed over 260 cases. This has so far resulted in over 280 convictions.</p>

This includes a summary of goods by destination. All reports&mdash;from 1997&mdash;can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website at: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage">http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage</a>&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=l0070 29395474.</p>
	<p pid="d.1184W.5/2">In the latest published annual report, covering 2005, no export licenses issued to Israel were revoked. Given the way data is recorded, if there were any revocations, it would not be possible to identify how many were due to information originating from overseas Posts, this usually being one aspect of several taken into account when a licence is assessed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1184W.5/3">All export licence applications are judged rigorously against the Consolidated EU and National Export Licensing Criteria including risk assessment by all four Government Departments (the FCO, the Department for Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development) involved in the export licensing process. There are few revocations.</p>

	<p pid="d.1186W.8/1">According to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a combination of checkpoints, physical obstacles and a permit system has effectively cut the west bank into three distinct areas&mdash;north, central and southern west bank, in addition to east Jerusalem. Within these areas further enclaves have been created. These enclaves are bordered by checkpoints and roadblocks and this has led to Palestinian communities being separated.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186W.8/2">Many routes within the west bank are regulated by a system of permits. However, requirements to get permits to move from one area to another are increasingly difficult to meet and fewer permits are issued. Without warning, additional restrictions or closures can make permits invalid. Additional restrictions can be by age (usually 15 to 32-year-old males), by gender or by geographical area. These restrictions can be imposed at any checkpoints at any time. According to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation Negotiation Affairs Department, the barrier, settlements and restrictions on Palestinian access to the Jordan valley together prevent regular Palestinian access to at least 46 per cent. of the west bank. Their estimates are that the percentages of west bank land involved are: barrier 9.5 per cent., settlements 8 per cent. and Jordan valley 28.5 per cent..

The dominant group in the NRF is the JEM. The NRF is thought to be gaining popularity among individual SLM factions including the predominantly Fur-based Abdel Wahid and its rival, Abdul Shaffi. The NRF is alleged to be responsible for the majority of recent rebel attacks. We are pressing the NRF to immediately cease fighting and to sign up to the Darfur Peace Agreement.
