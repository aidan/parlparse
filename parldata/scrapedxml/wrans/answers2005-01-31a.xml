	<p pid="a.566W.2/1">Cyclical periods of drought and cassava pest (manioc mosaic) are having an adverse impact on the availability of food and on households' capacity to produce food in the northern provinces of Burundi. The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it will assist 520,000 people in the provinces of Kirundo and Muyinga for the next two months. This month it delivered 1,485 metric tonnes of food aid to 176,000 people in the communes of Busoni, Bugabira and Kirundo.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/2">Distribution of food aid and emergency agricultural inputs (seeds and tools) have been increased since July 2004, but these have had a limited impact because of poor rains, extremely low productivity of the land, reduced arable land by household and the poor health status of the population. The negative impact of these combined factors on food security and nutrition show the widespread and extreme fragility of an average Burundian household.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/3">DFID has contributed &pound;750,000 to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) through the UN Consolidated Appeal for emergency agriculture activities in an effort to improve the food security situation. The WFP has said it has enough funding for food aid for the next five months. We are concentrating our efforts on food security through the FAO and looking at other support in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the present situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.0/1">The last 18 months has seen the formation of many new Iraqi Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) seeking to address and articulate the rights of ordinary Iraqis. CSOs include such bodies as non-governmental organisations, professional unions and associations, faith-based organisations, government and legislative bodies. With little history of independent civil society in Iraq, many of these CSOs lack capacity. DFID's Civil Society Fund (CSF), a two-year programme with a budget of &pound;5 million, seeks to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi CSOs better to address the needs of poor, vulnerable and socially excluded groups, especially women and young people. Much of the fund is aimed at building links between Iraqi and international CSOs. However, direct funding for Iraqi CSOs is also available.</p>

	<p pid="a.569W.2/1">At the Global Partners Forum on orphans and vulnerable children in Washington DC in December 2004, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State announced how DFID would be meeting its spending target of at least &pound;150 million on orphans and vulnerable children over the next three years. This included &pound;38 million to be delivered through UNICEF for work in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.2/2">DFID plans to work very closely with UNICEF to support elements of the Rapid Assessment Analysis Action Planning Process (RAAAP) plans in some of the countries in Africa which are most affected by AIDS&mdash;this includes six Southern African countries: Angola, Botswana, Swaziland, Namibia, Lesotho and South Africa under a regional programme estimated at &pound;18 million over three years, and in a separate programme of support in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.2/3">The support DFID provides will be based upon the UNICEF Framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children living in a world with HIV/AIDS, which aims to: strengthen families' ability to cope, through such things as financial credits, child care and developing skills; start and support community-based responses, largely through involving local leaders; ensure that vulnerable children have access to essential services, such as education and health care; ensure that governments protect the children that are the most vulnerable; and, finally, raise awareness to create an environment that understands and supports those children.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.2/4">DFID is also planning to work with UNICEF and provide assistance to strengthen the capacity and competence of UNICEF's Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO). This is in order that RAAAP plans can be built into wider planning and implementation processes and interventions are based on firm evidence about their effectiveness. We are also developing a programme of support to UNICEF in New York so that they can provide global oversight and develop country commitment and the means to monitor and track the international response to meeting the needs of vulnerable children.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.2/5">We are working though our bilateral programmes in DFID's target countries in Africa, with Government, and civil society organisations to address the needs of vulnerable children. Where countries have their own Poverty Reduction Strategies, DFID is pressing for children and AIDS&quot; issues to be included in budget planning, allocation and expenditure. This is being done in close consultation with UNICEF.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.5/1">The Department for International Development's humanitarian response to the tsunami disaster in Sri Lanka has been channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross movement, and non-governmental organisations and in direct in-kind interventions aimed at addressing immediate needs. DFID is providing financial support to five NGOs: Save the Children Fund UK, HelpAge International, World Vision UK, Basic Needs and ZOA Refugee Care. We are also considering proposals from 12 other NGOs regarding transitional shelter, water and sanitation and livelihoods support. The assistance that DFID has provided, and is supporting, is geographically spread throughout the country. This includes substantial support to Tamil communities in proportion to needs across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.5/2">DFID's focus for longer-term reconstruction in Sri Lanka is likely to be on providing support to the rebuilding of livelihoods and services for poor people in affected regions.

DFID is maintaining close contact with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) on these issues. Non-governmental organisations have commented that the WFP has done a very good job at short notice in distributing food but are concerned about medium-term implications of distributing large quantities of food. DFID will remain in contact with the WFP on discussions about potential longer-term food aid requirements to ensure these are both appropriate and cost effective.</p>

	<p pid="a.572W.9/1">I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.9/2">It being the first Council of their Presidency, Luxembourg presented their work programme for the next six months. Among their top priorities would be to reach agreement on the new Rural Development Regulation and to progress work on reform of the sugar regime. They also hoped to take forward work on rice, wine, tobacco, bananas, potato starch, organic farming, risk management for agriculture, international forestry and timber imports, avian influenza, aquatic animal diseases, chicken welfare, control of TSEs, potato nematode disease, Mediterranean fisheries and the EU Fisheries Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.9/3">The Commission set out its plans for assisting the reconstruction of the fisheries industry in those countries affected by the tsunami and for the co-ordination of EU and member state initiatives in this sector. This would include Council legislation enabling decommissioned EU fishing vessels to be sent to the affected countries. I expressed support for the Commission approach, explained what action Britain had been taking and urged the Commission to speed up the adoption of the new Generalised System of Preferences scheme and to improve the rules of origin to help the affected countries export to the EU more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.9/4">Under any other business, Latvia and Sweden requested Community financial support following storms at the beginning of the month which had caused extensive damage to the forestry and agriculture sectors. Estonia, Lithuania and Denmark said they might also seek funding. The Commission would examine actions to help through EU programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.9/5">Austria and Greece, supported by a number of other member states, called for assistance in exporting cereal and maize surpluses where bumper crops had led to storage problems and low prices. The Commission drew attention to action already taken on exports but would consider further intervention action.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.9/6">In response to a request from Poland, the Commission said it would keep up the pressure on Russia to speed up its inspection of EU export establishments for animal products in order to enable trade to re-start. It would also address problems created by Russia's insistence that export certification for plant and animal products be done at EU not member state level.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.9/7">After the Council, I attended a presentation by ministers from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and Least Developed Countries on the impacts of EU sugar reform for their economies. The meeting was attended by the three Commissioners with responsibility for agriculture, trade and development who drew attention to their work on an action plan to address the potential negative impact of reform on those developing countries which currently enjoyed preferential access to the EU market. None of the member states intervened.</p>

	<p pid="a.576W.8/1">The issues the Environment Council will be working on during the United Kingdom presidency of the European Union are contained in the 2004&ndash;06 Multiannual Strategic Programme and the Luxembourg-UK Annual Operating Programme for 2005, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. We will seek to maintain progress on the range of business covered in these plans, in the light of where matters stand at the end of the Luxembourg presidency. However, we expect the following to be included in this business.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/2">The Prime Minister has made it clear that climate change is a priority for both our G8 and EU presidencies, and we will maintain momentum towards establishing mid and longer-term strategies and targets, and seek to ensure that the EU can demonstrate progress towards its Kyoto commitments. We will take forward any Commission proposals to incorporate aviation into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/3">The Government will invest major efforts in progressing the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) Regulation based on an effective balance between economic, social and environmental considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/4">The UK presidency will take forward work on those thematic strategies in the framework of the Sixth Community Environmental Action Programme that have been published by the European Commission in time for the UK presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/5">The Government will take follow-up action to the spring European Council's review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, and will provide environmental input to the 2006 review. We will apply the principles of better regulation by proceeding with proposals that have been through proper economic, social and environmental impact assessment, and seek to build on the Cardiff integration process at the level of individual policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/6">In 2005 momentum will be maintained on the regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE+) and on the INSPIRE directive which aims to put in place infrastructures for the prevention and better management of potential environmental risk. Concerning nature and biodiversity, we will take forward work on biodiversity action, depending on the timely submission of proposals from the European Commission, and on the directive on humane trapping standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/7">Work will also continue on: the bathing waters directive; the sulphur content of marine fuels; a Pollutant Release and Transfer Register; priority substances and emissions control; protection of ground water; waste shipments; the directive on batteries and accumulators; the management of mining waste; end-use energy efficiency and energy services directive; stricter emissions standards for light duty vehicles; and applying the Aarhus Convention to the EC.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/8">The Government will also seek to make progress on the implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan (ETAP), to ensure that measures are taken to stimulate innovation and market penetration for environmental technologies so that synergies between environmental protection and enhanced economic competitiveness are fully exploited.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.8/9">The UK and Luxembourg presidencies will also ensure effective preparation and coordination of international meetings throughout the year, including for the UNEP Governing Council, the UN CSD and the UN's high level review of Progress against the Millennium Declaration and the WSSD commitments. The annual meeting of the UN Climate Change Convention will be particularly important because of the expected entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

No specific Commission forecasts are available for the years requested, but for historical and demographic reasons, pension costs will take an increasing share of the &euro;6billion administration budget. Forecasts from 2002 suggested that costs would reach around &euro;1.5 billion by 2015 but then stabilise in real terms. The Commission reforms of 2003 helped to reduce this future burden by increasing the retirement age to 63, abolishing correction co-efficients and increasing contributions from EU officials.</p>

	<p pid="a.594W.11/7">The Commission's report deliberately does not provide a breakdown between cases of irregularity and fraud; fraud is defined and treated differently in each member state. Past estimates made by OLAF (the EU Anti-Fraud office) have suggested that around 20 per cent. of reported irregularities may turn out to be fraud. Applying this to the 2003 figure would suggest that the amount of fraud could be around &euro;185 million. This would represent around 0.2 per cent. of total EC Budget expenditure in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.605W.2/19">DWP Information Centre. Figures are from a 5 per cent. sample at <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase> each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Clwyd, South, the proportion in employment has risen to 74 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/21">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 1,400 in Clwyd, South alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures for 2002&ndash;03 show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 1,200 families in Clwyd, South.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country, and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/24">Our reforms include the State Second Pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. Around 3,860 pensioners in Clwyd, South are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;41.20 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;02) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over, to help with their fuel bills. Additionally for this year eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the One-off 70+ Payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their Basic State Pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 12,900 pensioners in Clwyd, South have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the response times on telephone calls. You asked specifically about the response times before telephone numbers which are advertised to the public are answered, the percentage of time in a working day when lines are not engaged and what the most recent figures are for the performance against these standards. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a Customers' Charter which sets out the level of service that customers can expect when dealing with us, including the standards we aim for when answering telephone calls. The current standard states when you phone us or use a textphone we aim to answer your call within 30 seconds&quot;. The Charter is available from our local offices or can be printed from the internet through the Jobcentre Plus website. I have placed a copy of the latest version of the Charter in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/5" class="indent">This standard has been in place since the introduction of Jobcentre Plus and applies equally to all areas of the business&mdash;whether delivered through our local offices or through the network of modern contact centres that we are putting in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/6" class="indent">In the Jobcentre Plus National Customer Satisfaction Survey 2003, a copy of which is available in the Library, we asked our customers if this standard still met their expectations. Of those respondents who normally contacted us by telephone 69 per cent. felt that it was reasonable to wait at least 30 seconds and nearly two thirds of those people considered it reasonable to wait over a minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/7" class="indent">However, although the length of time taken is considered reasonable by many of our customers we endeavour to answer all incoming calls as quickly as possible for the people who need our services.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/8" class="indent">You asked for our most recent figures for performance in two separate areas. The performance of the 30 second response time is measured in two ways: through a Mystery Shopping Programme which measures performance against a range of service standards as defined in our Customer Service Target; and by Management Information from our contact centre network. I have provided that information. However, our telephony systems do not measure the percentage of time in a working day when lines are not engaged and I am therefore unable to respond to that part of your question.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/9" class="indentitalic">Mystery Shopping Programme</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/10" class="indent">We are moving towards an organisational structure in which many of our services will be delivered by telephone&mdash;but at the moment nearly 50 per cent. of the local office network has still to be converted to the integrated Jobcentre Plus service delivery model. Many of those offices do not have centralised switchboard systems, nor dedicated telephony teams. We therefore use the Mystery Shopping programme to undertake telephone calls on a sampled basis at a level that will provide us with robust information for the network as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/11" class="indent">The programme is undertaken by an external contractor (NOP Mystery Shopping). It includes three telephone calls to each office per quarter. The information for the first three quarters of this year (April&mdash;December) show:</p>

	<p pid="a.609W.2/2">Research has been conducted on the macro-economic effect of the new deal for young people (NDYP) and the new deal for lone parents (NDLP). Information is not available on costs per additional job by region. A full cost-benefit analysis, including the effect on tax benefits and unemployment benefits, is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/3" class="italic">New Deal for Young People</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/4">The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) undertook a detailed macro-economic analysis of NDYP until March 2000 <sup>1</sup> . NIESR calculated the net budgetary cost per job was &pound;7,000 per annum (excluding the Environmental Task Force and Voluntary Sector options) or &pound;4,000 per annum when these two options are included. The National Audit Office report <sup>2</sup> suggested that the average annual cost per additional person of any age in employment through the new deal for young people is within the range of &pound;5,000-&pound;8,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/5">NIESR calculated that by March 2000, NDYP had reduced unemployment among all age groups by 35,000. They also estimated that NDYP raised youth employment by 15,000 (excluding those on the Environmental Task Force and Voluntary Sector options). Adding these two options raised this to 30,000 more young people in work due to NDYP.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/6" class="italic">New Deal for Lone Parents</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/7">Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the new deal for lone parents (NDLP) comes from the provisional cost-benefit analysis of NDLP carried out by departmental economists. The findings were published in the NDLP Evaluation Synthesis Report in June 2003 <sup>3</sup> . The unit costs of NDLP in 2000&ndash;01 were &pound;400 per participant. The gross cost per job was around &pound;860.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/8">A calculation of cost-effectiveness takes into account the additional earnings from movements into work and the costs of running the programme in 2000&ndash;01. NDLP provided a significant net economic gain to society, with a net benefit of over &pound;4,400 from each additional job, and a total net gain of &pound;115 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/9">The net impact on public finance was also calculated. This included the cost of in-work credits and benefits such as the working families' tax credit. NDLP in 2001&ndash;02 resulted in a net exchequer saving of &pound;1,600 for each additional job entry&mdash;a total saving of &pound;41.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/10" class="italic">Employment Zones</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.2/11">The gross cost per job of Employment Zones has been estimated by the Department to be &pound;3,115 per job without benefit payments and &pound;6,027 per job with benefit payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.9/1">Although there is nothing specific to London, there are a number of programmes designed to help disabled people return to work which are available to disabled people within the Greater London area.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) have applied to all employers, with the exception of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/3">The ending of the exclusion from the employment provisions of employers with fewer than 15 staff brings into coverage a further one million small employers with seven million further jobs in which 600,000 disabled people already work.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/4">During 2004 the Department undertook a major campaign to raise awareness of the DDA particularly among small and medium-sized businesses. Around a million businesses were directly mailed information; this was supported by radio advertising, press articles in specialist and trade press and website fact sheets. A free information pack with video is also available and the second presentation of the 'Access All Areas' awards, which congratulates small service providers who have made services more accessible, took place in November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/5">Initiatives which seek to enhance the employability of disabled people include the use of Jobcentre Plus Disability Employment Advisers who visit employers and advise them on the support and help available in the employment of disabled people and the Job Introduction Scheme (JIS) which aims to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities by offering a weekly grant, currently &pound;75 per week, to employers during the first six weeks of their employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/6">New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) is designed to support people in receipt of disability or health-related benefits in finding and sustaining paid employment. It is delivered through a network of Job Brokers across England, Scotland and Wales who agree with each customer what is the most appropriate route into employment for them and work closely with providers of training and other provision where the customer needs additional help. NDDP Job Brokers were introduced in July 2001 and to September 2004 the programme showed 115,930 registrations with Job Brokers and over 54,000 job entries.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/7">In addition there are a number of other programmes designed to help disabled people return to work which are available to disabled people within the Greater London area.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/8">Access to Work is a specialist disability programme which provides practical advice and support to help disabled people enter or stay in paid employment. The support is aimed at overcoming work related obstacles resulting from disability. It does this through a system of grants towards the cost of providing support. Access to Work is open to those who are employed as well as people moving out of unemployment and is a highly effective job retention measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/9">Work Preparation is a highly flexible programme open to benefit recipients (incapacity or unemployment-related benefits) and non-benefit recipients. It is an individually tailored, work-focused programme that enables disabled people to address barriers associated with their disability and prepare for work with the confidence necessary to achieve and sustain their job goals. The vast majority of Work Preparation programmes take the form of short unpaid work placements.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/10">WORKSTEP was introduced in April 2001 to modernise the former Supported Employment Programme. It provides job support to over 30,000 people in employment and in this financial year up to October 2004 just under 900 clients had progressed into open unsupported work. In 2003&ndash;04 it held a budget of &pound;163 million, and it is delivered by over 200 providers, including Remploy, in England, Scotland and Wales. WORKSTEP is managed by Jobcentre Plus and involves a three-way partnership between the employer, the WORKSTEP provider and a disabled person.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/11">People receiving incapacity benefit can do permitted work and keep benefit in some circumstances. The pre-Budget report announced new national measures for improving permitted work provision including an extension of the initial period of permitted work from 26weeks to 52 weeks in all cases and an expansion of permitted work provisions to people facing the greatest barriers to full-time employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.9/12">People with the most limiting conditions such as advanced progressive conditions will be covered by a widened version of the permitted work provisions and be able to work for a longer period of time while maintaining their entitlement to benefit. The new measures will improve take-up and provide better support on entry to permitted work through face-to-face meetings with personal advisers including a requirement for clients to consider the prospects of a move into full-time employment, but only where they are able to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.2/1">There has been no specific study on the effectiveness of the social fund on helping homeless people move from temporary to permanent accommodation. However, we know from more general research that the discretionary social fund is used by people in these circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.2/2">DWP research report 139 The use of the social fund by families with children&quot; contains secondary analysis of the Families and Children study and the Family Resources Survey. This study found that moving home is one of the three main trigger events for social fund loan applications and the main trigger event for lone parents. We can guarantee a Budgeting Loan payment to help people in these circumstances, provided the applicant satisfies the eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.2/3">Community Care Grants (CCGs) are also available to help people with the cost of setting up home. In particular it is available to people leaving institutional care, families under exceptional pressure, and people taking part in a planned programme of resettlement. These can include former rough sleepers, families fleeing domestic violence and ex-prisoners. However, as the CCG scheme is discretionary and cash-limited, there can be no guarantee of payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.2/4">We believe that the social fund provides valuable support to the poorest and most vulnerable people in society, including those in temporary accommodation, which is why an additional &pound;90 million has been made available to the discretionary fund over the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. This has allowed the Community Care Grant budget to be increased from &pound;108 million in 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;128 million for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.2/5">We have recently announced that we intend to abolish the Budgeting Loan 'double debt' rule and reduce the standard repayment rate of 15 per cent. of a customer's benefit to 12 per cent. from April 2006. These changes will make budgeting loans more consistent and easier to understand and access, and will improve the help available to those who are setting up home, in particular many of those who have outstanding social fund debt. To support these changes the Social Fund loans budget will be increased by &pound;210 million over the three years 2006&ndash;07 to 2008&ndash;09.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.2/1">The Social Fund plays an important role in the Government's commitment to tackling poverty and social exclusion. It provides support to millions of people on low incomes, including some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/2">The Social Fund is continually under review and we have announced a number of improvements. For example, &pound;90 million is being added to the Discretionary Social Fund budget over the three years to 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/3">We have recently announced that we intend to abolish the Budgeting Loan 'double debt' rule and reduce the standard repayment rate of 15 per cent. of a customers benefit to 12 per cent., from April 2006.

To support these changes the Social Fund loans budget will be increased by &pound;210 million over the three years 2006&ndash;07 to 2008&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/4">The Government are also looking at ways in which more affordable loans can be made available to people on low incomes, and is seeking to work in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors to find ways of delivering these, while ensuring that the loans enhance the ability of people to manage their finances responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/5">We will continue to look at ways in which the Social Fund can be made more effective and contribute to our vision of greater financial inclusion.</p>

This study evaluated the potential for CO <sub>2</sub> injection into our North Sea oil fields for the purposes of carbon sequestration together with Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Our studies show that there are several operating fields where this can be technically feasible. However the cost of CO <sub>2</sub> captured and delivered to these sites and the capital costs involved are high, and none of these schemes have been shown to be commercially feasible under the current economic conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.625W.5/1">The Government work with the police and industry to tackle fraud and other online crime through a number of initiatives. A key factor in dealing with online fraud is prevention and education and the Government take an active role in educating computer users about the risks of fraud committed through the internet. The Home Office website provides advice on avoiding internet fraud and the Home Office has also created, and maintains the 'e-tailing mini site', which forms part of the crime reduction website. The mini site provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves specifically when using the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/2">The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 protect consumers against payment card fraud including credit cards. The Regulations apply to contracts made at a distance including online ones. The card issuer is required to reimburse consumers the full amount in the event of fraudulent use of the consumer's card.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/3">In addition, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 also allows consumers to recover the cost of a purchase made by credit card from either the supplier or the credit card provider. This provides additional protection should a consumer be unable to trace the company they were dealing with over the internet. The Banking Code stipulates that consumers' liability for misuse of a card will be limited unless there is evidence that they have acted fraudulently or without reasonable care.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/4">Through the Department of Trade and Industry's Safe Internet Shopping initiative consumers have access to information on how to shop online safely. Consumers need to be aware of security features on websites and to look for a closed padlock sign when they are asked for personal details. The Consumer Direct website at <a href="http://www.consumerdirect.gov.uk">www.consumerdirect.gov.uk</a> also offers advice on internet auctions, online scams and information on a range of consumer-related issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/5">The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 are included in a list of EC Directives, which is part of the Injunctions Directive. The Injunctions Directive requires all member states to have in place arrangements, which will allow certain unlawful actions harmful to consumers to be stopped in good time. The Injunctions Directive allows consumer protection bodies designated by the member states to apply to the courts or competent administrative authorities for orders to require traders to cease conduct that constitutes a breach of any of the consumer protection directives specified. Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002 implements the Injunctions Directive in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/6">Co-operation arrangements exist to ensure we can tackle scams that cross borders. In Europe member states have just agreed a Regulation (Consumer Protection Co-operation) to ensure that all consumer protection enforcement agencies are working closely together to combat cross border scams, and 30 OECD countries have all signed up to a co-operation agreement to tackle cross border fraud that affects consumers. The International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network (ICPEN) is a network of consumer protection enforcement agencies in over 30 countries that exists to facilitate cross border co-operation on cross border scams and consumer fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/7">The Home Office has published, jointly with the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) a leaflet on card safety, which includes a section on using cards safely over the internet. The leaflet has been sent to all police forces in England and Wales, and to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships. It is also available on the Home Office website and the e-tailing mini site, and APACS members (banks) will be sending a version of the leaflet to their cardholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/8">The Home Office is represented on an industry-led Steering Group, which aims to tackle 'Card Not Present' (CNP) fraud (which includes fraud over the internet). We support practical measures being introduced by the industry to increase levels of security for internet transactions. These include Address Verification Services (AVS) and Card Security Code (CSC), along with Mastercard Secure Code and Verified by Visa which require password verification for internet transactions. These initiatives are already making a significant impact on CNP Fraud. The work of the CNP Steering Group has also led to the production of a manual (Spot and Stop Card Fraud Retailer Pack), which aims to educate merchants on the dangers of CNP fraud and the steps which can be taken to prevent it.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/9">Government are also involved in the development of Project Endurance, an initiative that will launch an internet security public awareness campaign in spring this year. The project is an alliance of public and private sector, which brings together a number of UK Government Departments and law enforcement organisations with a number of high-profile private sector companies. This campaign is to be targeted at micro businesses and consumers, primarily aimed at helping these users gain confidence in using the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.5/10">We will continue to monitor and review the effectiveness of these many different initiatives.</p>

It initially made available &pound;450 million (&pound;150 million a year) for the 3 years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 to help the Post Office to maintain the parts of the rural post office network that could not be sustained on a commercial basis.

Because this activity is geared towards replacing traditional outlets with some alternative means of access rather than simply closing them, it is permitted within the scope we have set for the company to run the pilots. I have asked POL for a full report on pilot activity by the end of this year. The lessons that will emerge from these trials over the next 12 months will be crucial in informing longer-term decisions about the future shape of the rural post office network.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.11/1">Most of the matters for which the Department is responsible in England have been devolved in Wales to the National Assembly for Wales. However, there are some reserved areas in which the Government has introduced initiatives which affect Preseli Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/2">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK- made, high quality and original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and S4C, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/3">In November 2000 we introduced free television licenses for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Preseli Pembrokeshire with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 4,835.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/4">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on New Year's Eve to 11 am on New Year's Day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/5">The Licensing Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2003 repealed those parts of the Licensing Act 1964 which allowed the local government electorate in the counties and county boroughs of Wales to requisition polls to decide whether licensed premises should be allowed to open on Sundays. This has removed the uncertainty which businesses in Wales, including those in Preseli Pembrokeshire, faced, allowing them to exercise long-term planning. It also removes a costly administrative burden on local authorities and an artificial difference in licensing controls between Wales and England, which prevented businesses and customers exercising freedom of choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/6">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licences and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licences for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Preseli Pembrokeshire, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/7">No statistics are available for international visits or expenditure by constituency. However, VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination benefit all parts of the country, including Preseli Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/8">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Preseli Pembrokeshire has benefited from over 430 awards totalling over &pound;17.8 million. Of these, 63 awards worth over &pound;3.7 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.0/1">Small Business Rate Relief is applied to qualifying properties with a rateable value under &pound;10,000 while qualifying properties under the thresholds (&pound;15,000 outside Greater London and &pound;21,500 inside Greater London) pay the lower small business rate multiplier.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.0/2">The scheme is aimed at businesses occupying a single small property and so is not available to larger businesses with several small hereditaments (e.g. a chain of small shops, a company with many advertising rights).</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.0/3">About 1,017,000 hereditaments outside London have a rateable value (RV) less than &pound;15,000 and 196,000 hereditaments within Greater London are under &pound;21,500 RV. Because the rating list does not distinguish between those occupied by large companies with many small hereditaments from those occupied by businesses occupying a single hereditament, the Government conducted research in early 2004 on the likely eligibility for the relief. This research indicated that around 350,000 businesses would benefit. A summary of this research is on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.0/4">This figure was based on a proposed threshold of &pound;8,000 and was revised when the threshold was set at &pound;10,000. The new estimates indicated that about 430,000 would be eligible for the relief and this was reflected in the consultation paper and RIA as over 400,000&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.0/5">As a result of the feedback from the consultation, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister further extended the eligibility for the relief by allowing applicants to discount additional properties with a rateable value below &pound;2,200. We estimate that this will further increase the eligibility for the relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.646W.8/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was created in May 2002. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also provides a records management service to the Department for Transport. Actual numbers of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's files destroyed each year prior to 2004 could be provided only at disproportionate cost but an informed estimate for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Department for Transport combined is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.8/2">2002&mdash;23,500; 2003&mdash;20,800; 2004 (to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December</phrase>) 53,252. A further 23,400 files are awaiting destruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.8/3">Files continue to be destroyed in accordance with well established procedures. Files which are not viewed as having permanent historical value are marked out for destruction after a specified period. At the end of this period files are destroyed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's contractors, once confirmation has been received that there is no business reason for, or historical value in, retaining them. In 2002 and 2003 a backlog of files awaiting destruction developed due to machinery of Government changes and the closure of the Hayes Records Repository. The higher figure for files destroyed in 2004 reflects work to clear that backlog, although this still stands at 23,400 files.</p>

	<p pid="a.650W.3/24">Good authorities will still be required to produce these plans as appropriate. Subject to the successful completion of the parliamentary procedure for the Local Authorities Plans and Strategies (Disapplication) (England) 2005 Order, excellent authorities will only be required to produce streamlined Best Value Performance Plans (in both years), Civil Contingencies Plans (in 2005&ndash;06), Crime and Disorder Reduction Strategies (in 2005&ndash;06), Youth Service Plans (2004&ndash;05) and Local Development Schemes (in 2004&ndash;05). All local planning authorities (districts and unitaries) either have to complete old development plans or prepare new development plan documents over the next three years (districts and counties, and for waste and minerals only, counties). The aforementioned Order will remove the requirement for excellent authorities to publish, produce or prepare (as the case may be) Homelessness Strategies, Home Energy Conservation Reports, Youth Justice Plans, Rights of Way Improvement Plans, Local Transport Plans and Bus Strategies and Air Quality Action Plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.657W.9/2">It is essential to the success of any school building project, including Building Schools for the Future, that those who will use the buildings are involved in the design and building from start to finish. This includes head teachers, other staff, pupils and the local community. The process of design and building is also an excellent educational opportunity for pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.657W.9/3">To this end, the Department develops and spreads good practice through projects with expert bodies such as CABE, School Works, Learning through Landscapes and joinedupdesignforschools&quot;, guidance such as the exemplar designs, and materials such as the School Works Toolkit and post-occupancy evaluations. For Building Schools for the Future, our delivery body Partnerships for Schools is charged with supporting local government so that all projects are models of good practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.658W.5/1">We recognise the importance of ensuring that children and families are protected from the perpetrators of domestic violence or child abuse. The details of how the information sharing databases or indexes will work will be set out in regulations and guidance. In framing the regulations and guidance we will take care to address the issue of protection from the perpetrators of domestic violence or abuse. This will include the facility for certain details, such as an address, to be blocked out or not to appear on the index at all where a parent has good cause to believe that the inclusion of such information may lead to a crime being committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.5/2">Where information on a child is held on the index, and a parent makes a request to access that information, their rights to access that information are balanced by the rights of the child. For children of sufficient maturity (which for the vast majority of children is taken to mean aged 12 or over), the right under the Data Protection Act to access data held about the child on the index will belong to the child rather than to the parent. So there will be no obligation on the person with responsibility for managing and operating the index (the data controller) to disclose information to a parent in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.5/3">For other children, where rights to access information held on a child may be exercised by a parent with parental responsibility, the data controller is under no obligation to disclose information if that would lead to harm. We will ensure that guidance to data controllers on handling such requests includes guidance on identifying cases of potential harm and procedures to avoid this, such as asking the other parent if they have any objection to the request or deciding that the other parent is the best person to exercise access right on behalf of the child.</p>

	<p pid="a.659W.2/1">One of the Sure Start principles is that parents and children have access to services that are tailored flexibly according to their needs and circumstances. We issued children's centre start up guidance to local authorities in February 2003. This said that children's centres must not only consult parents and carers, including fathers, on what services to offer, but must also actively involve them by setting up systems to get their feedback on services and having on-going arrangements to ensure parents have a voice. There must also be mechanisms in place to enable parents to self-refer to services. Children's centres should implement specific strategies to include fathers. Family support and health advice must be available at times suitable for working parents. There should also be opportunities for family learning to take place at the centre or in settings linked to the centre such as FE colleges.</p>

	<p pid="a.667W.2/1">The Government are committed to supporting the development of extended schools, to offer enrichment activities and child care to parents and children. By 2010 all parents with children aged 5&ndash;11 will be offered the guarantee of affordable child care between the hours of 8 am to 6 pm, all year round. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local childminders. Half of all parents will be able to enjoy this service by 2008. For secondary school aged children, all secondary schools will, by 2010, be open 8 am to 6 pm all year round offering a range of interesting activities. By 2008 we want at least a third of all secondary schools making this offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.2/2">We have already committed around &pound;50 million over the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2004&ndash;05 to support the roll out of extended schools. This has comprised just under &pound;44 million paid via the Standards Fund (including &pound;2.8 million made available by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit and &pound;1.8 million from the Home Office) and &pound;6.8 million paid through the Sure Start General Grant, In addition to this &pound;14 million from the Young People's Fund element of the Big Lottery Fund has been made available to 78 local authorities over three years from 2004&ndash;05 to support the development of extended schools across their areas</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.2/3">Funding should also be available from the agencies which deliver services provided on school premises such as health and social care. Schools can also charge for some services such as community use of the schools premises and child care. In the case of school based child care, parents, who are eligible, can claim part of the cost through the child care element of the working tax credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.2/4">In the financial year 2005&ndash;06 my Department will be making available just over &pound;107 million to support the development of extended schools. In later years we will provide further sums including funding to support the development of school based child care. An announcement will be made in due course. The funding for extended schools is to kick start the delivery of services with the intention that the facilities should be self-sustaining over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.667W.5/1">At <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> approximately 61,100 children were looked after, of whom 68 per cent. were in foster placements in England. The Department itself does not collect information centrally about the number of foster carers. However, a recent survey of local authorities, carried out by the Fostering Network, indicated a shortage of around 8,200 foster carers in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.5/2">Supporting local authorities to act effectively to recruit and retain foster carers is therefore a priority for my Department and we have recently produced a Fostering Publicity Pack designed to help local authorities to run targeted local campaigns to recruit new foster carers for looked after children. We have also awarded a 3 year grant of &pound;180,000 to the Fostering Network to support Foster Care Fortnight, which has a particular focus on recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.5/3">In addition, the Choice Protects grant, which provides funding of &pound;113 million over three years, has a specific emphasis on fostering services. We are currently developing a number of new initiatives to improve the status, support and training of foster carers. These include the development of a national award ceremony, a national advice line, measures to improve the support given to foster carers who are subject to allegations and new training resources for foster carers. We will also shortly be commencing detailed work on payments to foster carers in the context of the Children Act 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.8/1">In 2003 the DfES commissioned Cambridge and Manchester Universities to carry out a joint study of teaching approaches for different types of special educational needs (SEN). The study found that there was a large degree of overlap between different effective approaches&mdash;in essence, good teaching skills are much the same for all pupils, regardless of whether or not they have SEN, or the type of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.8/2">The 2003 research did not include an assessment of the effectiveness of the different specialised approaches used in teaching children with hearing impairment&mdash;oral/aural, total communication and sign bilingualism. We are considering what further work might be taken forward in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.8/3">Parents of deaf or hearing impaired pupils who have statements of special educational needs, are able to express a preference for the maintained school they would like their child to attend, and can also make representations for a place at an independent or non-maintained special school. Before expressing a preference they are able to consider teaching approaches offered by different schools. Local authorities decide which school should be named in a child's statement taking account of parental preference and the individual needs of the child.</p>

	<p pid="a.671W.5/1">There has been no decision to end ring-fencing Government funds for marriage counselling and family relationship counselling. Funding for charities specialising in these services was formerly available through the Marriage and Relationship Support (MARS) grant. The Marriage and Relationship Support grant has now been amalgamated with the former Family Support grant to form the Strengthening Families grant, but the same amount of money is available to support the provision of marriage counselling and family relationship counselling. Marriage and Relationship Support will continue as an integral and important element of family support provision by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.671W.5/2">In view of the recent merger of the Marriage and Relationship Support and the Family Support grant programmes we are considering evaluation of the current Marriage and Relationship and Family Support provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.671W.5/3">We have had no representations from the sector in this area.</p>

At that time around 450 projects were supported by the Department. The money available was not a limit, but an estimate of the requirement. Most authorities brought forward projects at that time and various means have been employed since that time to identify outstanding cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.673W.2/1">The South Greenwich Sure Start local programme was approved in 2000 and supports around 900 young local children and their families living in Eltham and Kidbrooke. The programme delivers a wide range of services to support local families including: a resourceful friends&quot; scheme in partnership with Home Start Greenwich that provides one-to-one support to families in crisis; a support group for single parents; provision of Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Educational Therapy and Portage services for families and children with special needs; provision of safety equipment which is loaned to families at a subsidised rate; a toy library; a creche; additional home visits by qualified midwife and health visitors; and early assessment and referral for children with development delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.2/2">Since opening, Sure Start South Greenwich has helped improve the quality of life for local families. For example: the percentage of women smoking during pregnancy has fallen from 45 per cent. to 39 per cent.; the percentage of children identified with speech and language development delay has fallen from 33 per cent. to 9.73 per cent. Local health visitors report back to the local programme on all women identified with post natal depression including specific referral to the Sure Start programme to provide support. Recent Sure Start Unit monitoring reports show that the programme is seeing 858 of their 909 children (a 94 per cent. increase since the programme opened).</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.2/3">The programme has strong parental participation both in the management board which has 10 parent representatives (up from three since 2000)&mdash;and in activities where parents act as volunteers.</p>

	<p pid="a.685W.5/1">The Government have no immediate plans to amend the laws on blasphemy. We acknowledge that there are a wide variety of views on whether the blasphemy laws should be retained, repealed or extended, but we have not sought to amend the current law on blasphemy in the absence of a consensus on how to proceed. For example in a recent ICM poll for <i>The Guardian</i> although 46 per cent. of the public believe that the blasphemy laws should be repealed, 38 per cent. believe it should be kept on the statute book. We will however, keep the issue under review, particularly as the benefits of the new provision against incitement to religious hatred are realised.</p>

	<p pid="a.685W.11/3">The CRP CCTV Initiative ended in 2002, but funding opportunities remain available under the Building Safer Communities Fund (BSCF) and the BCU Fund. &pound;72.3 million and &pound;74 million was made available in 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 respectively from the BSCF and was allocated directly to CDRPs to tackle local crime priorities using a raft of interventions, including CCTV. A further &pound;50 million was allocated to police forces under the BCU Fund in both years. In addition, police forces may include CCTV provision at their discretion from police capital grant to support local capital programmes. The Home Office has allocated a total of &pound;210 million in capital provision for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 13 per cent. over provision for 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="a.687W.3/1">The skills and knowledge required for the post of custody officer are identical whether or not the statutory functions required under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) were to be carried out by a police sergeant, as currently provided for under PACE or, under Clause 111 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, for a staff custody officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.3/2">Currently, there is no formal qualification required before a police officer can take on the role of custody sergeant.

	<p pid="a.687W.3/3">National Occupational Standards for the Police Sector developed by Skills for Justice set out the competencies and skills required for authorising and managing police detention and form an Integrated Competency Framework. In terms of the custody officer, the competency framework focuses on the key areas of making detention decisions; managing the detention of individuals; and authorising and reviewing continued detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.3/4">In addition, further work is currently under way with stakeholders and the National Centre for Policing Excellence on developing guidance on how these standards are to be achieved. This will be published later this year. Combined with the competency framework, we will have in place definitive standards for police and police staff employed in the custody suite.</p>

	<p pid="a.688W.2/4" class="indent">2.Council Regulation (EC) NO. 333/2002 on a uniform format for forms for affixing the visa issued by member states to persons holding travel documents not recognised by the member states drawing up the form. Adopted 18/02/2002</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.2/5" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> Where member states do not recognise the country or authority that issued a person's travel document, the appropriate visa is stuck onto a separate form. The purpose of Regulation 333/2002 is to ensure that member states adopt a standard, recognisable format for the forms used in these circumstances. The Regulation also prescribes various security features which will help prevent counterfeiting and falsification.</p>

Performance testing has proved to be an extremely successful mechanism for driving improvement in poor performing establishments. Although the National Offender Management Service has announced that the formal programme of performance testing will cease with the return of market testing, the Prison Service will retain performance testing as part of an internal performance improvement programme designed to help the Service compete effectively in the more contestable environment. Any poor performing establishment that fails to recognise the need for change and therefore presents a poor prospect at any future market test may be performance tested.</p>

	<p pid="a.711W.5/1">We have received over 80 representations, mostly from members of the public, opposing the ending of the temporary suspension of enforced returns of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.711W.5/2">The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has based its recommendations on a broad assessment of conditions in Zimbabwe generally. Asylum and human rights decisions are not based on general conditions in a country, they are made case by case according to the risk that the individual applicant would face. Asylum and human rights claims by Zimbabwean nationals are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). As with any other nationality, Zimbabweans who meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Convention are granted asylum. If they do not qualify for asylum, but there are other circumstances that make them particularly vulnerable and engage our obligations under the ECHR, they are granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave. If their application is refused, they have a right of appeal to the independent appellate authorities. In this way we ensure that we provide protection to those Zimbabweans who need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.711W.5/3">Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information from a wide range of reliable sources including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, other international organisations, non-governmental organisations, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the media. Decisions are based on the specific circumstances of the individual concerned. It is clear that there are Zimbabweans in need of international protection, but if an asylum and human rights claim is refused, and any appeal to the independent appellate authorities is unsuccessful, that means that it would be safe for that particular individual to return to Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.711W.5/4">Voluntary returns have continued throughout the period that enforced returns were temporarily suspended. There is no evidence to suggest that voluntary returnees or those whose return has been enforced since the suspension was ended have suffered any mistreatment on return.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.6/1">Installation of oil metering equipment is an important measure to preserve Iraq's oil resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.6/2">Prior to military action in Iraq there were no functioning meters in the Iraqi oil system. At the handover of authority on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-28">28 June 2004</phrase> the issue remained outstanding. Currently Iraqi oil exports, either by pipeline to Ceyhan in Turkey or by tanker through the Arabian Gulf, are metered as they pass into the receiving tanks.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.6/3">The Iraqi Ministry of Oil is responsible for ensuring meters are installed on Iraq's oil wellheads. The Ministry has established a committee to develop and install a metering system for the entire Iraqi oil industry. However a comprehensive system to measure crude oil output is a complex task beginning in the oil fields themselves. This involves conducting a design study that will identify the type of meters and their locations required for measuring crude oil.</p>

	<p pid="a.716W.2/1">In December 2004 the Lahore High Court annulled the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000 which, if implemented, would effectively reinstate the possibility of the death sentence for juvenile offenders in Punjab province of Pakistan. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-17">17 December 2004</phrase> the EU made a demarche to the Pakistan authorities to raise their concerns on this and other human rights concerns. Officials from our high commission in Islamabad have also raised this bilaterally with Pakistani officials. The UK is entirely opposed to the death penalty, which it considers to be a cruel and inhuman punishment, and notes that the imposition of the death penalty on those under 18 at the time of the crime is contrary to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Pakistan is a signatory. We hope that steps can be taken by the relevant Pakistani authorities to ensure that the death penalty for juvenile offenders is not reinstated as a result of this recent annulment by the Lahore High Court.</p>

An interim house condition survey is due to be published later this year and this will provide more up to date information.

In January 2004, the Commission expressed a wish to undertake another inspection of the only remaining Juvenile Justice Centre at Rathgael, Bangor. As a full-scale inspection of the Centre was already being undertaken in that year by the Criminal Justice Inspectorate (CJI), in order to avoid duplication and the placing of an unnecessary burden on the children and staff in the Centre the Commission was advised that it would not be appropriate for them to carry out another review at that time. However, at the invitation of the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice, an Investigations Officer from the Commission joined the CJI team and played a full part in the inspection.</p>

	<p pid="a.730W.8/2">The proposed title of the 'King's, Lancashire and Border Regiment' was one of the options put forward by the King's Division, and was selected by the Executive Committee of the Army Board (and subsequently endorsed by the Army Board) on the basis that this title best reflected all the antecedent regiments from which it will be drawn. This was felt to be particularly important because of the fact that this reorganisation involved the merging of three previously distinct regiments, into a two-battalion regiment.</p>

	<p pid="a.735W.3/1">Under both United Kingdom and international law wrecked military aircraft and vessels remain the property of the state, regardless of their location and condition.

	<p pid="a.735W.3/2">The Ministry of Defence uses the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to afford protection from unwanted interference to RN vessels wrecked after <phrase class="date" code="1914-08-04">4 August 1914</phrase>, where this is considered necessary and appropriate. To date, seventeen wrecks have been designated under the Act; more will follow as part of a rolling programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.0/1">All items recovered from the site, including those coins that may later be sold, will be fully recorded to appropriate professional standards. Post-fieldwork assessment and analysis will result in the creation of a post-excavation assessment report. The archaeological team may then elect to undertake specific analysis or invite or permit other scholars to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/2">It is too early to speculate on the timing of disposals. Such decisions will eventually be informed by what is recovered. Under the Licence Agreement, the Government, as owner of the wreck and artefacts, retains complete discretion to retain any artefact. A decision on the sale or retention of assets can only be taken with the benefit of far more information on the wreck, its state and contents.</p>

	<p pid="a.748W.2/1">Nutrition is a key component of a healthy start in life and schools, alongside parents and carers, have a role in shaping the habits and eating behaviours of children. As set out in the Government White Paper, Choosing Health: Making healthier choices easier&quot;, we want to see all schools deliver clear and consistent messages about nutrition and healthy eating, provide opportunities to learn about diet, nutrition, food safety and hygiene, good preparation and cooking as well as where food comes from and actively promote healthy food as part of an enjoyable balanced diet. This message is supported by a number of activities and White Paper commitments regarding nutrition in schools, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.2/2" class="indent">Funding of &pound;77 million is being provided over 2004&ndash;06 to enable over two million children (all four to six-year-old children in local education authority- maintained infant, primary and special schools throughout England) to receive a free piece of fruit or vegetable every school day.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.2/3" class="indent">The Government aim is that half of all schools will be part of the healthy schools programme by 2006, with the rest working towards healthy school status by 2009. From April 2005, a healthy school will provide a supportive environment, including policies on healthy and nutritious food.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.2/4" class="indent">Revising both primary and secondary school meal standards to reduce consumption of fat, salt and sugar and increase consumption of fruit and vegetables. We will strongly consider introducing nutrient based standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.2/5" class="indent">Subject to legislation, extending the new standards to cover food across the school day, including vending machines and tuck shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.2/6" class="indent">Supporting schools to provide the best meal service possible&mdash;through guidance on food procurement for heads and governors and improving training for school meal providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.2/7" class="indent">Ofsted inspectors will be looking at healthy eating in schools and will take into account any school meals provided in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.2/8" class="indent">A comprehensive Food in Schools&quot; package to provide guidance and resources for implementing the whole school approach to healthy eating and drinking.</p>

	<p pid="a.749W.5/1">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency, which has responsibility for food safety matters, that the regulatory controls in respect of imports from non-European Union countries are comprehensive, and for the most part are EU based and operate EU wide.

	<p pid="a.749W.5/2">Imported food from non-EU countries is subject to checks at ports of entry by local authorities under imported food legislation. Also, food products, whether from outside or within the EU, are subject to the same checks by local authorities as United Kingdom produced food.</p>
	<p pid="a.749W.5/3">The Agency works closely with a number of other Government departments on imported food enforcement matters.

However, we do share a commitment with the GMC, the Council of Heads of Medical Schools and other relevant bodies that all health professionals are trained so that they have the skills and knowledge to deliver a high quality health service to all groups of the population with whom they deal. I am aware of the British Medical Association's recent publication, Healthcare in a rural setting&quot;, which recommends a greater accent on placements in such settings.

	<p pid="a.753W.6/1">The Government are committed to halting the rise in childhood obesity and have outlined their strategy for doing so in Choosing Health: making healthy choices easier&quot;. This includes a new cross-Government campaign to raise awareness of the health risks of obesity and the steps people can take through diet and physical activity to prevent obesity. We have already taken a number of steps to increase awareness of issues relating to obesity during the Choosing Health&quot; consultation last year, including staging a conference on obesity and publishing separate consultation papers, Choosing a Better Diet&quot; and Choosing Activity&quot;. Ministers and senior officials have presented at a wide range of conferences and seminars on obesity throughout the year and continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.753W.6/2">This builds on the five-a-day programme, which includes a number of initiatives to inform consumers of the benefits of eating a variety of at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day as part of a healthy balanced diet, which can help to maintain a healthy weight. Last summer, Sport England also piloted a social marketing campaign to increase exercise in the north east of England. The Everyday Sport&quot; campaign focused on opportunities for people to include more physical activity in their daily routine and will contribute to the evidence base for an obesity awareness campaign. The Department also funds a range of non-governmental organisations to increase awareness of the benefits of healthy diet and active lifestyles.</p>
