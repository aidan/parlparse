In order to allow the metal to be sold, its radioactivity level must be below the 0.4 Becquerel/gram regulatory exemption level set out in Schedule 1 of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and the Substances of Low Activity (SOLA) Exemption Order. The material is then no longer considered to be radioactive. Once it has been sold on to the scrap metal market, it is not possible to identify the products or manufacturing sectors in which it is used.</p>

	<p pid=".780W.8/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear that we expect France to lift its ban as soon as possible. It is for the Commission to take action to enforce EU law and it has asked France for an explanation of its failure to comply with the ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This is the first stage in a process which may lead to a further ECJ case against France and the imposition of penalties for failure to comply with the Court's Judgment in December 2001 that the French ban on imports of UK beef exported under the Date-based Export Scheme is illegal.</p>

	<p pid=".781W.2/2">Waters around the UK are regularly patrolled by surveillance aircraft equipped to detect pollution. The data held for 2001&ndash;02 by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) indicate that more than 150 such flights were made under arrangements put in place by the MCA and that more than 20 per cent. of these flights covered the west or south-west of the UK and would therefore have covered part of the Bristol channel. In addition, civil and military pilots are encouraged to report sightings of pollution. Every incident spotted, or reported, is investigated and, whenever possible, those parties responsible for committing pollution offences are prosecuted.</p>
	<p pid=".781W.2/3">The UK also has legislation in place to ensure a properly planned system of waste reception facilities in ports, in order to leave no excuse for ships to resort to the unacceptable practice of discharging their waste at sea. The MCA has approved 36 waste management plans for ports or parts of ports around the Bristol channel, an area of coastline stretching from Milford Haven to Newquay. In 2000, the European Community adopted a directive to establish a port waste reception facilities system across the Community; like other member states, the UK is working on the implementation of this directive, which will come into force in December of this year.</p>

Individual Departments and the Countryside Agency are working together to develop rural proofing strategies and to rural proof individual policies. DEFRA officials are also involved.

It is difficult to be precise on the exact numbers of contacts and representations made with them, but there have been many. We approached the Croatian courts on numerous occasions for information about the case, and attended all court hearings with Private Jeans' family. Our consular division in London last spoke with Simon Jeans' father, Terry, in May 2001, and our pro-consul in Split last met with Mr. Jeans in August 2001, when he visited Croatia.</p>
	<p pid=".783W.0/2">The hon. Member will be aware that Private Jeans was a serving member of the British Army at the time of his death. As such, the Ministry of Defence was and continue to be the lead Department in this case. Private Jeans' family are aware there is very little our consular staff can do with regards to the case in Croatia, as it is now a legal matter. Under international law we are unable to get involved in the judicial process of other countries. Nevertheless, Mr. Jeans and the MOD have been in regular touch.</p>

	<p pid=".785W.6/2">As I suggested would happen in my statement last week, the Independent Television Commission is now beginning a re-tendering process, on an accelerated time scale with a view to awarding licences at the end of a six-week period. I understand that, during this period, the ITC will liaise with the administrator and broadcasters providing the digital terrestrial free-to-air services with a view to ensuring that ITV Digital subscribers will continue to be able to receive these channels, including the five main terrestrial channels, through their set top box. We expect that companies interested may wish to use the ITV Digital assets, and that they will liaise with the administrator to do so. There is a real opportunity to benefit from the expertise and technical experience now existing, enabling a successful business to emerge, and ensuring we maintain our world leadership in digital television.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.2/2">Any disruption of tourism will be unwelcome, but weekend closures, while disruptive to tourism, are unavoidable if essential work is to take place. Any closures are considered by Railtrack, train operating companies, the relevant rail passenger committees and the Strategic Rail Authority. I am advised the weekend closures are preferable to closures during the week which would cause wider disruption for business as well as leisure travellers. The closures have been planned to avoid the Commonwealth games. The tourism industry, like other business sectors, will be looking forward to benefiting from the main line upgrade. Improved rail services are essential to ensure the long-term health of the tourism industry in the north-west.</p>

	<p pid=".788W.2/1">Recruits to the parachute regiment are required to complete a minimum of eight jumps from aircraft in order to qualify as a military parachutist. The use of balloons ceased in 1995. Basic parachute training is carried out from RAF Brize Norton and the aircraft used are a Skyvan, for an initial familiarisation jump, and a C130 Hercules, for the remaining qualifying jumps. During the last financial year, four basic parachute courses were cancelled due to Hercules aircraft unavailability, caused by operational commitments. Although this has had no effect on the ability of the regiment to carry out its assigned duties we are currently looking at how greater use of the Skyvan could reduce the Hercules requirement to support the basic parachute course to the essential minimum number of jumps that must be done from the operational platform.</p>

	<p pid=".792W.2/1">The Consignia board decided that the company's costs needed to be reduced to stem its losses and improve its performance. At the moment it is not immediately clear what the effect in Wales will be. It is understood that up to 125 jobs will eventually be affected, although it is not known at this stage how many of these will actually be job losses. The company will offer as many of those affected as possible the option of continued employment with a different part of the business or a voluntary redundancy package.</p>

I expect the Budget changes to help businesses in Herefordshire become more competitive and productive. Herefordshire has an above-average number of small businesses, which will benefit from a reduction in the starting rate of corporation tax from 10 per cent. to zero and a 10 per cent. cut in the small companies' rate; a reduction in the red tape and compliance costs imposed by the VAT and payroll administration systems; and a new &pound;30 million training fund to bring small businesses up to the Investors in People industry standard. Further details of these measures, and of other measures to benefit businesses of all sizes, can be found on <a href="http://www.budget.treasury.gov.uk">www.budget.treasury.gov.uk</a>. The Hereford and Worcester Chamber of Commerce and Business Link (on 0800 104010) can also provide advice on the impact of the Budget on business activity.</p>

However, the agreement does require WTO member states to protect plant varieties by other legal means if patents are not available. The UK supports this flexibility in the agreement and there are no plans to remove it.</p>

However, from my statement at the Namur Informal Council on Regional Policy in July 2001, the Commission will be aware of the Government's view that the next reform of the Structural Funds must ensure that they contribute better to the Lisbon agenda of improving Europe's competitiveness and modernising its economies. Improvements are needed in both the effectiveness of the funds and the means to evaluate their impact and added value. Also, greater efforts must be made to simplify the funds and remove unnecessary bureaucracy, while maintaining proper financial control.</p>

	<p pid=".801W.0/1">The Government have introduced a number of measures, including training bursaries and &quot;golden hellos&quot;, to boost teacher recruitment nationally. These are already having an effect, and there are nearly 10,000 more teachers in post now compared to January 2001&mdash;the largest increase in a single year since the 1970s.</p>
	<p pid=".801W.0/2">We have also reformed the teachers' pay system to ensure that those teachers who perform well are well rewarded. The introduction of the threshold for experienced teachers, leading to the upper pay scale, has provided a career structure which will allow our best classroom teachers, in time, to earn over &pound;32,000 at today's rates, excluding additional allowances. And we have implemented cost of living pay rises at above inflation rates for all teachers in each of the last four years.</p>
	<p pid=".801W.0/3">All teachers working in the London area are paid mandatory London allowances on top of their basic salary. These allowances were increased last year by 30 per cent. and are currently inner&mdash;&pound;3,105; outer&mdash;&pound;2,043; and fringe&mdash;&pound;792. In addition, schools are able to pay recruitment and retention allowances to individual teachers of up to &pound;5,262 per annum. Schools can decide to pay this as a lump sum covering up to three years.</p>
	<p pid=".801W.0/4">It is open to local authorities to help teachers with housing, relocation and travel costs through the Recruitment and Retention Fund established by my Department. We have made &pound;77 million available to 2003 for this purpose. And we have made &pound;250 million available to 2004 to help key public sector workers, particularly nurses, teachers and police, to buy homes in or near the communities they serve through our starter home initiative scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".802W.6/1">The ending of Government recognition of national training organisations (NTOs) and the licensing of sector skills councils are separate issues. Organisations formerly with NTO status are independent bodies led by employers, often with responsibilities wider than those which were required for NTO recognition. The continued funding and operation of these organisations is therefore a decision for the board of each body. New contracts have been awarded by my Department to 62 former NTOs from April 2002 for the delivery of specific essential work in support of occupational development. These contracts will conclude on <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-31">31 August 2002</phrase>. The new Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA), working with other public agencies, will make arrangements for the delivery of essential work to support occupational development from September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".802W.6/2">Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) represent a new deal with employers across the UK to improve skills and productivity performance in significant industry and business sectors. SSCs provide the opportunity for collective action by employers, in partnership and with the support of Government, to identify sector skills priorities and lead action to meet them. There is no timetable for introducing the new network as the decision to form a SSC rests with employers. Where employers want to form a SSC, and can meet the published SSC standard for the award of a licence, my Department will supplement employers' investment by contributing up to &pound;1 million each year to support the Council's core work.</p>
	<p pid=".802W.6/3">Employers in the construction, engineering and hospitality sectors have yet to make a formal expression of interest to the SSDA about forming a SSC for their sectors. Informal discussions have been taking place and formal expressions of interest from these sectors are expected in the next few weeks when invited by the SSDA.</p>

	<p pid=".803W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> The UK higher education sector is taking forward work on credit transfer and progress files to ensure transparency of diplomas and other qualifications. This is part of the Bologna process, which aims to build a new European higher education area by 2010. The UK National Academic Recognition Information Centre, part of a European-wide network, exists to offer clear advice on mutual recognition and comparability of all higher education awards.</p>
	<p pid=".803W.2/3">EU member states are also working together on a broad strategy to make vocational qualifications better understood across Europe. The strategy includes work on certificate supplements and developing a common format for CVs for mobile workers to use if they wish to.

Currently we are developing a national language strategy that will identify what we need to deliver and how we will deliver it, taking account of resources available and our existing policy commitments. The strategy will be published in the autumn. Currently language learning is a requirement for all 11&ndash;16 year olds. Our ambition is that all primary school children will be entitled to study languages by 2012.</p>

	<p pid=".803W.2/6"><i>(d)</i> Pupils in England are already taught about Europe and the European Union at secondary school. They are taught about the history of Britain in its European and wider context within National Curriculum History. They will learn about the world as a global community, the role of the European Union and the UK's relations in Europe, including the European Union in National Curriculum Citizenship as a statutory National Curriculum subject in secondary schools this September. We have spent just over &pound;1 million to date to support the production of resource materials for teaching citizenship and we will spend about &pound;500,000 in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".806W.0/2">I recently announced a &pound;35 million programme to reduce the number of homeless families with children in B&amp;B hotels. Changes have also been made to housing benefit subsidy arrangements, worth an estimated &pound;10 million, to encourage authorities to place homeless households in self-contained temporary accommodation. The Bed and Breakfast Unit is working with authorities with high levels of B&amp;B use to produce individual action plans to ensure that, by March 2004, homeless families with children are placed in B&amp;B hotels only in emergencies, and even then for a maximum of 6 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.0/3">My Department has significantly increased funding for new affordable housing. Investment through the Housing Corporation will rise to over &pound;1.2 billion by 2003&ndash;04, almost double 2000&ndash;01 levels. This will help deliver our target of 100,000 new affordable homes by 2004, and we will ensure these funds are distributed more in line with local and regional priorities so that investment matches local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.0/4">We are also providing &pound;250 million through the Starter Home Initiative to help some 10,000 key workers in high demand areas to purchase a home.</p>

	<p pid=".807W.5/1">The four new schemes recognised in the regulations are voluntary, and offer small businesses the opportunity, should they wish to take it up, to save money through not having to go through local authority building control. This is particularly important in relation to replacement glazing where as a result of changes we made to Part L of the regulations&mdash;that part dealing with the conservation of fuel and power, it became controlled fitting and subject to building control.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/2">The Fenestration Self Assessment Scheme (FENSA) was introduced to ease the burden of this change. We estimate that the typical cost of going through local authority building control for replacement glazing would be about &pound;120 for a contract with a value of less than &pound;2,000. Overall we have estimated the cost of not introducing self-certification to be &pound;106,400,000 in the first year, and the overall financial benefit to be &pound;104,685,000.</p>

	<p pid=".808W.0/2">There will be no requirement to demonstrate compliance with these regulations prior to the sale of a house. However, prior to the sale of a property, a search may reveal that the installation of a window has taken place without either the issue of a certificate from a person registered with the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme (FENSA), or evidence of a building notice given to a local authority. This though is highly unlikely to prevent the sale of a house, although in some circumstances it could delay the process. Householders would be advised in any event to keep receipts and other such records necessary to ensure a smooth transition during the sale of any property. In relation to publicity, I am pleased with the level of public awareness in relation to the changes so far. However, I will keep the situation under review and if there is evidence that more publicity is required, we shall provide it.

	<p pid=".819W.2/2">In 1999&ndash;2000 support for asylum seekers was provided by the Department for Social Security (now Department for Work and Pensions), the Department of Health and the Home Office. The Department of Social Security (DSS) provided support to those asylum seekers who made their application for asylum at a port of entry until such time as an initial decision was made on the claim. But the costs of support provided by the DSS were met by the Home Office. The Department of Health was responsible for funding the support costs of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. The Home Office was responsible for payment of grant to local authorities who were supporting asylum seekers who had either applied for asylum in country or who, having applied at a United Kingdom port of entry, had received an initial negative decision on their claim and were appealing against that decision.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.2/3">In 2000&ndash;01 support for asylum seekers was mainly provided by the Home Office. Support was provided either directly by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) or by grant paid to local authorities to meet the direct costs of those supported under the interim provisions. In 2000&ndash;01 the grant to social services departments caring for unaccompanied asylum seeking children was also met by the Home Office. The DSS provided support for those asylum seekers who applied for asylum at a port of entry prior to <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-03">3 April 2000</phrase> and who had not received an initial decision on their claim. Again these costs were met by the Home Office.</p>

The Bail Act 1976 establishes a presumption in favour of bail and then sets out exceptions to this presumption, so that the defendant need not be granted bail where he or she presents a bail risk. For example, where there are substantial grounds for believing that if released on bail the defendant would fail to return to court, would commit an offence, interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. Each decision is at the discretion of the courts and each case is considered on its own merits.</p>

	<p pid=".829W.2/3">In the Passport Service and the Criminal Records Bureau smart card technology is not currently used, however, the Passport Service is currently investigating the potential use of electronic data storage in passport books and in a card form of the passport issued along side a passport book. The primary aim of this technology would be to improve document security by the addition of a machine readable biometrics templates. Smart card technology would be one option for data storage. Other options are optical memory, 2D bar codes and magnetic strip. The use of smart card (i.e. microcomputer chip) technology would be expensive but would also provide the opportunity to develop other applications, particularly if used on a passport card. These investigations have centred on technology standards and the experience of other Governments and organisations using electronic data storage for biometric templates. There have been no direct discussions about a smart card passport design with private sector companies supplying smart card technology.</p>

	<p pid=".833W.5/1">Currently there is only one special secure unit (SSU) in operation which is located at Whitemoor prison. The eight prisoners in the SSU have all been convicted by the courts.

Three of those held in the SSU have been convicted of murder with the other five having been convicted of drug related charges.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/2">The declared religion is Church of England (three); Muslim (two), Roman Catholic (one). The remaining two prisoners decline to state their religion. All those held in the SSU are Category A 'Exceptional Risk' prisoners.</p>

The agencies have scored a number of notable successes against smuggling gangs and other organised criminals over the past year, including the largest ever UK seizure (over 42 million) of smuggled cigarettes at Warrenpoint in November 2001. In February 2002 the police broke up a heroin distribution network and charged 15 people with serious drug offences.</p>

	<p pid=".835W.9/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the efforts being made in Northern Ireland by the PSNI to get the &quot;don't do drugs&quot; message across to children in our schools. It is an essential part of the overall anti-drugs strategy, with education at one end of the spectrum allied to detection and prosecution at the other. The PSNI recognises the value of including the anti-drugs message in the Citizenship and Safety Education (CASE) Programme which provides a platform for them to work in partnership with teachers and parents. The overarching aim is to encourage responsible behaviour in young people and empower them to live safely and that must include avoidance of drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.9/2">It is of course impossible to say precisely how effective the incorporation of the drugs education programme is in terms of numbers deterred from drug abuse, but the theme is &quot;Education&quot;, recognising that it is better to education the young on prevention than simply to concentrate on catching offenders.</p>

	<p pid=".836W.5/1">The Police Service of Northern Ireland recognises the importance of education in promoting individual safety for young people and families and to help create safer communities. The Citizen and Safety Education (CASE) Programme has been developed in an attempt to establish close links between the police and the school community through the central themes of Protection, Education and Prevention. CASE provides a platform for police to work in partnership with teachers and parents. Together, they seek to present information and promote skills, attitudes and values, which encourage responsible behaviour in young people and empower them to live safely.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.5/2">The issues covered in the programme include the role of the police, vandalism, bullying, peer pressure, stranger danger, road safety, internet safety, abuse, respecting others, young people and the law, underage drinking, solvent abuse and drugs and the law. Over 80 officers are involved in the CASE programme and it is hoped to significantly increase that number for the next academic year. Of the 1,182 schools in Northern Ireland, PSNI is currently working in 940, focusing on pupils at Key Stages I, II and III.</p>

	<p pid=".840W.11/1">The Government's strategy for tackling terrorist crime in Northern Ireland is two fold. First, the police must have available to them robust legislative powers. The Terrorism Act 2000 contains a number of financial provisions for seeking information and restraining assets. These powers were supplemented by the Anti-Terrorist Crime and Security Act 2001, passed in the wake of the events on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.11/2">Second, in September 2000, the Government established an Organised Crime Task Force for Northern Ireland. The task force, which I chair, brings the various agencies that can make a difference, such as the police service of Northern ireland and HM Customs and Excise to agree crime types for concerted multi-agency action. The agencies have scored a number of notable successes over the past year, including the largest ever UK seizure (over 42 million) of smuggled cigarettes at Warrenpoint in November 2001. In February 2002 the police broke up a heroin distribution network and charged 15 people with serious drugs offences.</p>

	<p pid=".842W.3/1">Through the Department for International Development, the Government have supported fair trade (FT) initiatives for a number of years, both in developing countries and in the UK. This support forms part of a wider dialogue with the private sector and civil society to encourage the adoption of more socially responsible and ethical trade practices. As companies and consumers become more aware of the connection between the way business is done and its impact on the livelihoods of people in developing countries, so the pressure for positive change grows.</p>
	<p pid=".842W.3/2">To this end, DFID has provided &pound;250,000 this year to support the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI). The ETI is a consortium of UK retail companies (with a combined annual turnover of nearly &pound;100 billion), NGOs and trade unions committed to working together to identify and promote best practice in the implementation of codes of labour. ETI corporate members are required to report compliance down their supply chains against a base code founded on the ILO convention.</p>

	<p pid=".842W.3/4">With regard to direct purchasing of FT products by Government Departments, value for money considerations and the limited number of commodities for which internationally agreed FT standards exist, currently make it impractical to link Government purchasing policy to the FT mark.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.0/1">Power sector reform is a key development challenge for India. In many states, power subsidies take a large proportion of the government budget, squeezing out expenditure on anti-poverty programmes. A high quality power supply is also critical for economic growth.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.0/2">DFID is supporting the reform and restructuring of the power sector in three states, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. Power sector reform is highly complex and also new to India, and assistance has been requested from DFID and other donors to help design and carry forward the structural changes needed to reform the sector and place it on a proper commercial footing.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.0/3">In all three states, DFID is making available assistance, including experts with international experience of successfully carrying out similar work, following competitive tendering processes to ensure maximum value for money. Most of the support so far has been provided by Indian experts, even when international companies have been engaged. Expatriate inputs are limited to specialist areas where international experience is of greatest benefit and local expertise is not available. These are long term projects, designed to respond flexibly to local needs. They are reviewed regularly, including market comparisons to ensure that value for money is maintained.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.0/4">In Andhra Pradesh, considerable progress has been made in helping the state government achieve its objectives on power reform, but the process has been more difficult and has taken longer than originally envisaged.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.0/5">In Orissa, DFID assistance to the state grid company finished when the company was privatised. We continue to support the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission and also the Orissa Transmission Company. Both of these programmes are making good progress.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.0/6">In Madhya Pradesh, DFID has been asked to provide assistance with power sector reform and competitive tendering process is underway to identify suitable expertise.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.3/1">Since 1997 my Department has committed almost &pound;11 million in support of the Rwanda Revenue Project. This particular project began in September 1999 and finished in March 2002, with a budget of &pound;2.3 million.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.3/2">In April 2000, DFID concluded that management capacity problems in the RRA were more severe than at first thought and DFID inputs were increased accordingly. By the end of the project, we had succeeded in reforming the corporate services and management of the RRA. Proper financial organisation had been put in place; and information technology strategy had been developed and implemented; training in internal audit procedures had been completed; the RRA were acting on the recommendations made in an organisation and staffing review; and the RRA had a corporate plan in place, against which they were measuring their own performance.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.3/3">Our assessment is that this project has achieved good value for money. The management reforms are significant and have contributed to a major improvement in revenue collection More still needs to be done at senior and middle management level, but the basic corporate structures are now in place.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.2/1">The Rural Access Programme in Nepal is an ambitious programme of rural transport infrastructure and related activities aimed at eliminating rural poverty. It is being implemented over a six year period that has only just started. It is therefore too early to judge the value for money achievements of the whole programme at this time.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.2/2">An inception review of the programme was completed in April. This review took into account the current conflict situation in Nepal and the impact on programme implementation; how more immediate impact can be achieved for communities affected by conflict; and the approach to the provision of technical assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.2/3">The outcome of this review is that there will be improved modalities for working in conflict affected areas and on conflict issues. This will include working with organisation with an established local presence and by strengthening and empowering existing groups and adopting working methods that bridge the divides giving rise to the current conflict. Also, there will be a reduction in the numbers of international consultants without compromising quality and supervision, through a more rapid localisation of key positions in the technical assistance team.</p>

	<p pid=".847W.5/1">Since 1997 my Department has committed almost &pound;11 million in support of the Rwanda Revenue project. The specific project referred to in the question began in September 1999 and finished in August 2001, with a budget of over &pound;2 million.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.5/2">An improvement in revenue collection became clear from late 2000. During the last year of the project the VAT department exceeded its revenue targets, the RRA modernised its tax and customs departments and revenue collections were also on target. It is our assessment that this project has achieved good value for money, initially through rebuilding the capacity of the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) which had been shattered by the genocide, and then through significant improvements in revenue collection.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.5/3">The Rwandan Minister of Finance has described the project as DFID's most important support to Rwanda. However, more work remains to be done if the RRA's improved performance is to be sustained. DFID has therefore extended its support to the RRA through a new project, which runs from October 2001 to December 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".848W.8/1">DFID awarded a three-year contract for the management of the Russian President's Management Training Initiative (Main Phase) to the British Council under a waiver of competition in March 1999. The waiver was granted at that time, as the British Council was the only UK company with the necessary expertise to undertake this work. In order to ensure the key consideration of value for money, a Project Compliance Investigation was undertaken prior to contracting which confirmed that the British Council costs offered value for money. A comprehensive review of the performance of the project was undertaken by DFID's Eastern Europe and Central Asia Department in June 2001. The review team concluded that the project has been going well and its purpose &quot;to achieve improvements in the performance of 540 enterprise managers&quot; was likely to be completely or largely achieved and still offered value for money.</p>

We have also attempted to fill gaps in assistance caused by the failure of other donors to provide agreed inputs.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.11/3">This was a complex project operating in difficult circumstances. We shall make a judgment on its overall value for money in the light of the planned review.</p>

	<p pid=".852W.2/1">There is no single definition of debt sustainability, which can be applied to all developing countries. For the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), the international community has agreed two transparent thresholds: the net present value (NPV) of external debt should be below 150 per cent. of export earnings and 250 per cent. of Government revenues.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.2/2">We regularly discuss these issues with developing countries. We have also funded two meetings this year at which representatives from the HIPC countries debated these issues and fed their views into the on-going evaluation of the HIPC initiative by the Operations Evaluation Department of the World bank.</p>

	<p pid=".852W.8/1">The enhanced heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, which was agreed in September 1999, provides deeper debt relief to poor countries committed to eradicating poverty. Up to $100 billion debt could be written off for the 42 HIPC countries, reducing their debts by more than two thirds. On average, the 26 countries that have already qualified for HIPC relief will spend three times more on the social sectors in 2002&ndash;05 than on debt service over the same period.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.8/2">An important feature of the HIPC initiative is the recognition of the link between debt relief and poverty reduction in order to ensure the poor benefit from debt relief. Governments are developing national poverty reduction strategies, involving civil society and international donors, specifying how resources, including savings from debt relief, will be spent. As part of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approach, the World bank and IMF have committed to undertaking poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of major macroeconomic and structural reforms likely to have significant impact on the poor. The World bank and IMF are leading a programme of work on PSIA and are realigning their programmes with PRSPs in these countries. We are supporting this work by piloting PSIA studies in six countries. We are also working with partner countries on their PRSPs, through our bilateral programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".853W.2/1">We have been following closely the impact of falling commodity prices on developing countries since well before the events of <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase>. At the annual meetings of the World bank and IMF in Ottawa last November, we raised this concern and asked bank and fund staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including HIPCs. The IMF and World bank analysis, published last month, shows that, although the situation varies from country to country, the external debt indicators for most HIPC countries have deteriorated, and several HIPC countries now face unsustainable debt burdens. Following UK pressure, the World bank and IMF boards have agreed to provide additional relief to countries in this situation. This was reconfirmed at the spring meetings last month.</p>

The international community remains committed to vigorous implementation and full financing of the initiative. It has been recognised that support is needed to integrate poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) into national poverty reduction strategies.

	<p pid=".856W.5/1">My Department closely monitors the humanitarian situation in the North Caucasus, including Ingushetia. Assessments by UN agencies and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Ingushetia of the situation in camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) indicate that the situation for IDPs resident in Ingushetia is stable in terms of morbidity and mortality, and that there are no major outstanding humanitarian needs. But agencies agree that a full package of humanitarian assistance will continue to be required in light of the highly dependent nature of this population, and that the quality of assistance provided through humanitarian agencies within the Republic needs to be improved. We are addressing these needs through constant dialogue with, and through financial support to, the UN agencies and INGOs working in the region.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.8/2">Basic health care is provided in numerous small health care centres, but the level of care is not known. ICRC's recent street survey showed that in Grozny out of 1,913 persons, 86.6 per cent. said they were in good health and in the rural areas out of 2,248 persons, 89.6 per cent. said they were in good health. The cost of drugs and health care has frequently been mentioned as a problem in ICRC focus groups.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/3">Aid agencies are reluctant to start tuberculosis programmes in Chechnya when there is so much movement by IDPs because effective treatment requires continuing treatment which is very difficult to provide to shifting populations.</p>

	<p pid=".859W.9/1">Of the non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) for which the Department is responsible, the majority are Advisory or Tribunal NDPBs which we support directly, not through a grant or grant in aid. Targets for efficiency savings specifically for these NDPBs would therefore not be possible as their staff are not distinct from the main Department and cannot therefore be targeted separately.</p>

	<p pid=".859W.9/5">The Information Commissioner does not set targets for efficiency savings in relation to savings as a percentage of total running costs. She sets a target for efficiency savings in three areas of the work of her office:</p>

There are a number of trigger points contained in the contract, but at the present time the PRO is concentrating its efforts on monitoring and evaluating the enhancement and testing work being carried out by QinetiQ on the census website. The PRO's top priority is to ensure that the relaunched service provides a consistently good service to users.</p>

Once configuring of the technical enhancements is complete, rigorous testing will be undertaken on all aspects of the system. However, the most important consideration is to ensure that the service is re-launched successfully. The system will again be made available to designated service centres as part of the general re-introduction of the site. General on-line searches will be available as soon as practicable following testing and availability at the service centres.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.0/1">The Department makes an assessment of the costs and benefits of regulations when developing regulatory proposals. Where a regulatory proposal has an impact, in terms of costs, benefits and risks that affect businesses, charities and the voluntary sector, a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is undertaken to inform policy development. Final RIAs are placed in the Libraries of both Houses when the regulation is presented to Parliament, but are not required for regulations where it has been assessed that no or negligible costs would be imposed or savings made, or those that increase statutory fees via a predetermined formula. Copies of final RIAs are available from the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

In order to improve the throughput of applications the bureau is currently recruiting additional staff and redeploying others over 100 in all.

We expect the commission to consider each case separately. In doing so it will need to determine what other checks the employer undertook before employing the worker and whether or not they would have been in breach of other regulations or conditions of registration relating to staff numbers, or the health and welfare of service users, if they did not fill the vacancy. Where a registered person employs someone and deliberately fails to require that person to apply for a disclosure from the bureau we would expect the commission to seek prosecution for breach of the relevant requirements.</p>

The 20 districts with the lowest MMR coverage have been asked specifically to concentrate efforts on identifying unimmunised children or those who have had incomplete courses of single vaccines, clarify their immunisation status, and provide information to their parents, if so wished.</p>

	<p pid=".881W.5/18">This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income, described in detail in &quot;The Child and Working Tax Credit&quot;. The new tax credits respond only to rises in income in the current year of more than &pound;2,500, disregarding the first &pound;2,500 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.The figures in the table, which cover the number of households in receipt of either income related benefits or the working families tax credit (WFTC) or new tax credits from April 2003, where at least one person works 16 hours or more, include the effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/19">The effect of tax and benefit changes introduced since Budget 1998, including the WFTC, reduced the number of households facing MDRs in excess of 70 per cent. by around half a million. As WFTC is more generous than the family credit that it replaced, more households benefit from it, hence the larger numbers facing MDRs over 40 and 50 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/20">Building on the success of WFTC, the Government will be introducing a new system of tax credits from April 2003. As the new tax credits will be more generous and inclusive than the current system of support, more households will be eligible, and those currently eligible will gain more, hence a greater number will face MDRs over 40 and 50 per cent. from 2003&ndash;04.</p>

The Government intend to abolish stamp duty for all non-residential property transactions in these wards, subject to state aid approval.</p>
