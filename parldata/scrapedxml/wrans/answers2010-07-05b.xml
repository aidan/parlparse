	<p pid="b.1W.3/1">Security audits in 2004 and 2009 both recommended that the Embankment entrance by the Norman Shaw South building should be closed. This recommendation was endorsed by Members of both Houses on the Joint Committee on Security (JCOS). A significant amount of upgrade work would be needed to make the entrance safe-both for the occupants of the adjacent Norman Shaw Buildings and for the security staff on duty at the post. The entrance was therefore closed in May 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.4W.8/2">The section of A5 between M1 Junction 9 and Flamstead, formed part of the A5 Beech Road Dunstable to M1 Junction 9 Lighting Replacement Scheme. The scheme included the replacement of existing street lighting, installation of safety barriers, kerbing, footways, fencing, earthworks, road markings and renewal of some traffic signs. The overall cost of the whole scheme when final accounts are agreed, will be approximately &#163;2,440,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.4W.8/3">The Highways Agency does not have a breakdown of costs of specific sections of the A5 included in the scheme, but estimates that the cost of replacing the street lighting and associated works on the section between M1 Junction 9 and Flamstead was around &#163;810,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.5W.8/1">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) requires biofuel suppliers to report to the Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA) both the greenhouse gas emissions reductions provided by, and the sustainability of, the biofuels they supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.5W.8/2">Jatropha is not currently used in the UK and is not expected to be widely used in the future, as there are significant barriers towards its sustainable commercialisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.5W.8/3">Around 10% of UK biofuel reported under the RTFO last year came from palm oil. The RFA's 2008-09 report, &quot;Year One of the RTFO&quot;, showed that only around 5% of the palm biodiesel supplied had sustainability certification but assessed that there was potential to increase this to 100% at small additional cost to suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="b.5W.8/4">As there has been much controversy surrounding the use of palm oil, both the RFA and the Department for Transport have carried out further assessments. The RFA published a short case study of the impacts of Malaysian palm oil in its 2008-09 report to Parliament. This study looked at issues such as carbon emissions and social impacts. The Department for Transport is currently reviewing the indirect sustainability impacts of a number of feedstocks, including palm oil. The results of this study will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.11W.2/2">The scheme to widen the M1 between junctions 25 to 28 includes technology to allow the use of mandatory variable speed limits.</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.2/3">Use of these limits helps to manage traffic flows and provide more reliable journeys for motorists at times when the road is particularly busy. The technology which supports these limits includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.2/4" class="indent">loops in the road to monitor traffic speeds and provide alerts when congestion is starting to occur,</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.2/5" class="indent">CCTV cameras to allow the traffic conditions and any incidents to be monitored,</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.2/6" class="indent">electronic variable speed limit signs, and</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.2/7" class="indent">speed enforcement cameras to ensure that motorists do not exceed the variable limits in force.</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.2/8">The cameras are not, therefore, standalone installations on roads with permanent speed limits. They are part of an overall package of technology measures to support variable speed limits, improving journey reliability as well as safety. In these limited circumstances I am content for speed cameras to be used as part of the overall solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.14W.3/1">Reading is a significant station on the Great Western route and an important junction on the nation's railway network. Network Rail is proceeding with a major scheme to provide additional platform capacity and remove the present &quot;bottlenecks&quot; which constrain growth in both freight and passenger business.</p>
	<p pid="b.14W.3/2">In order to ensure that this is delivered in the most efficient manner and at a cost which represents the best value for money, I have asked Network Rail to review all aspects of their plans for the scheme and to seek out the most cost-effective construction approach and report to me at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="b.17W.8/3">In January 2006 the Highways Agency published draft Orders for the A57/A628 Mottram, Hollingworth, Tintwistle Bypass and progressed the scheme to inquiry. The inquiry was formally closed in July 2009 when it was announced that the scheme would be withdrawn because the Regional Transport Board determined that the increased costs for the scheme could not be supported. During the life of the scheme, over five thousand representations were received by the agency. It is likely that a number of these representations included elements relating to HGV issues on the Woodhead Pass but the information is no longer readily available.</p>

	<p pid="b.18W.11/1">The Department for Transport fully supports the important work that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) undertakes in respect of counter-piracy. The IMO's Maritime Security Circulars together with the Department's Marine Guidance Note on measures to counter piracy armed robbery and other acts of violence against merchant shipping (MGN 298), and the industry's own Best Management Practices to counter piracy in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia (BMP) represent a sound body of advice that is developed and supported collectively by the IMO, government and industry bodies including the International and UK Chambers of Shipping. In particular the BMP has significantly reduced the risk of successful pirate hijack, especially in the critical Gulf of Aden trade artery.</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.11/2">The Department has regular discussions on counter piracy with the IMO and the shipping industry directly, including through the IMO's Maritime Security Committee and through the counter-piracy sub committee of the Department's National Maritime Security Committee. As a result of work in our counter-piracy sub committee we will soon be issuing an update of our MGN 298 that complements, and has more general applicability, than the geographically specific advice contained in the BMP. Finally, I can confirm that counter-piracy is on the agenda for the next meeting of the IMO's MSC, scheduled for December this year, at which my Department will play an active part.</p>

This grant was chosen for reduction because it was evenly spread across local authorities and thus provides equal incentive to local authorities to make efficiencies to compensate for the reduction in road safety grant. At the same time, a substantial tranche of local authority grant was de-ring fenced, allowing local authorities greater flexibility in spending. The reduction in road safety grant is not intended to signal that local authorities are expected to reduce spending on road safety disproportionately.</p>

Alongside the rest of the international community, we have been working closely with the Afghan Government to ensure that the elections are credible and inclusive. The security situation remains challenging in parts of the country and this will impact on campaigning opportunities for many candidates.</p>
	<p pid="b.22W.12/2">The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is working to support the Afghan Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the Afghan National Security Forces in providing security for the elections. The UK, with the UN and other international donors, is in close contact with ISAF partners and the IEC to encourage them to work closely together to provide as secure an environment as possible for the elections and for candidates. Adequate security needs to be provided to enable candidates to campaign in as many areas as possible, particularly for female candidates who may face increased levels of intimidation and attacks as a result of standing for election. Work on this is already ongoing; the Afghan Ministry of Interior will provide two bodyguards for each female candidate, and a number of international-and state-run programmes aimed at providing extra support for female candidates are being co-ordinated by the IEC's Gender Unit.</p>

	<p pid="b.23W.5/1">Human rights in Chechnya and the North Caucasus remain a serious concern. The recent comparative stability in Chechnya has been at the expense of freedom of expression and democratic space, with civil society and media freedom facing tough restrictions. Corruption is endemic. 2009 saw the murders of human rights defenders and journalists. There is still a low success rate in investigating and prosecuting such crimes, perpetuating a climate of impunity. The 2009 Foreign and Commonwealth Office Annual Human Rights Report, the June report of the All-Party Parliamentary Human Rights Group visit to Chechnya, and the June Council of Europe resolution on the North Caucasus highlight these concerns and call on the Russian Government to act.</p>
	<p pid="b.23W.5/2">The Government welcome President Medvedev's recognition of the need to address the underlying socio-economic conditions which can lead to extremism and on the need to strengthen the rule of law in Russia. Equally, it is important that the Russian Government recognise that security measures which do not respect international human rights law are counter-productive, and that putting an end to human rights violations is a vital element in the achievement of a long-term solution to the region's problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.31W.5/1">The Government are working closely with African governments, the EU, the UN, the United States and other international partners to find sustainable solutions to Somali piracy, notably through the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS).</p>
	<p pid="b.31W.5/2">In parallel with its strong support for naval counter-piracy operations and the widest possible implementation of shipping industry-agreed self-protection measures (Best Management Practice), the UK supports steps being taken to increase the capabilities of regional countries to combat piracy, consistent with their political commitment to take action through their signature of the January 2009 Djibouti Code of Conduct.</p>
	<p pid="b.31W.5/3">The UK recognises within this context the primary importance of building up prosecution and especially penal structures, including in Kenya, Seychelles and within Somalia itself, and welcomes the work of the UN in this sector, supported by the EU and others. The UK has joined partners in encouraging more regional countries to share the burden assumed by Kenya and the Seychelles in prosecution and detention, and welcomes dialogue with Tanzania, Mauritius and others in this sense.</p>
	<p pid="b.31W.5/4">The UK also supports reinforcement of other law enforcement and military structures, including coastguard, as well as support for alternative livelihoods and community engagement. The UK has provided direct support this year for the Seychelles, Somaliland and Yemen coastguards. The UK continues to support the full implementation of the recommendations of the UK-led CGPCS regional Counter Piracy Capability Development Needs Assessment mission to East Africa and the Gulf of Aden, endorsed by the CGPCS in January 2010, which encapsulates all these requirements. A copy of the report was placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.46W.3/4">Evidence suggests that the most important reason for lower survival rates in England compared with other countries is later diagnosis of cancer, and so patients have more advanced disease at diagnosis. Over the coming months we shall be looking at what needs to be done to achieve earlier diagnosis. This will include tackling low public awareness of cancer symptoms, delays in people with symptoms presenting to their general practitioner and delays in referral to secondary care.</p>

We support the Shan Women's Action Network who provide basic health services to displaced people, and provide medical supplies through the Mae Tao Clinic. We are also expanding our cross-border health support from China. At least 345,000 people in remote border areas have benefited from this programme since 2006.

	<p pid="b.54W.0/1">The Electoral Administration Act 2006 extended the existing provisions for making polling places and stations, as far as practicable, accessible for electors who are disabled. Under the Act local authorities were required to undertake a review of polling places in their area within 12 months of the obligation starting to apply to them. An additional obligation was imposed to carry out further reviews at least every four years. This should mean that polling places are regularly checked for accessibility, and consideration given to making reasonable improvements where practicable.</p>
	<p pid="b.54W.0/2">It is important that polling stations are accessible to all voters. The Government will look at this issue with reference to the current legislative framework to see if improvements need to be made.</p>

For the three-month period January-March 2010 it is estimated that, in the UK, there were 23,000 full-time and 56,000 part-time employees working in non-specialised retail stores where food, beverages or tobacco predominate and which had ten employees or fewer.</p>

	<p pid="b.66W.5/1">The advice I have received is that standstills confer significant protection against the spread of fast moving diseases such as foot and mouth. The biggest factor in the size of an outbreak is the length of time between the disease entering the country and its detection (the so called silent spread period-typically three weeks). Properly observed standstills limit the number of movements livestock can make during this period and hence reduce the number of potentially infected premises. Standstills are not effective against slower moving diseases such as bovine tuberculosis.

	<p pid="b.78W.5/1">The Government recognise and values the role that police community support officers (PCSOs) play in neighbourhood policing. We do not believe that the powers of PCSOs should be further increased, not least because their purpose is to spend more time in communities. It is important that PCSOs have the right set of powers to meet their responsibilities; some of these are standard and some of these are discretionary. It is a matter for forces to determine the deployment of PCSOs and the discretionary powers granted to them.</p>

The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) is committed to supporting the Special Constabulary and increasing its numbers across England and Wales. As part of this the NPIA created nine regional coordinator posts to help police forces increase numbers and improve retention rates. In particular, they are working in partnership with police forces to develop effective marketing and recruitment strategies and to implement the National Strategy for the Special Constabulary. This aims to make the management of the recruitment process easier for police forces. Work is also ongoing to engage employers support to enable their staff to volunteer as special constables.</p>

	<p pid="b.84W.5/1">The Government remain committed to the provision of new affordable housing and has secured an additional &#163;560 million for affordable housing and other housing programmes in 2010-11. This includes &#163;390 million additional funding announced today-which means a further 4,500 social rented homes, over 3,000 homes for sale at affordable prices and 1,000 homes stalled by the recession This is on top of the &#163;170 million made available by the coalition Government on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-24">24 May</phrase>, which will protect delivery of 4,000 new social homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.84W.5/2">The coalition Government nevertheless remain strongly committed to reducing the United Kingdom's budget deficit-the Government's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-24">24 May</phrase> set out immediate savings of over &#163;6 billion. The Chief Secretary has also announced today that Departments have agreed to reductions totalling &#163;1.5 billion amongst a range of spending commitments planned by the previous administration but where the funding was reliant on underspending across Government through the End Year Flexibility system. The &#163;1.5 billion savings includes &#163;220 million of the &#163;780 million housing funding planned by the previous administration. As the Chief Secretary says in his statement, without this remedial action Government borrowing would have been higher this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.84W.5/3">It is likely a number of housing projects will be affected by the need to find these &#163;220 million savings. To date, the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) has been holding back from making any new commitments in 2010-11 until the position on funding could be finalised. Now that the funding position has been confirmed, the HCA will fully review the impact of any changes on its investment programmes, and will then contact affected schemes to advise them. The HCA will also publish a list of the confirmed schemes. Throughout 2010-11, the agency will continue to publish on its website the quarterly regional investment statements, detailing all allocations to the National Affordable Housing Programme.</p>

We will want to work closely with Manchester to ensure that it has the freedoms and tools to deliver on its economic ambitions. We have recently written to local authorities and business inviting them to come together to form local enterprise partnerships. We will consider Manchester's proposal for a combined authority once consultation has ended and in the light of their proposals on local enterprise partnerships.</p>

Blackpool council was initially responsible for assessing and achieving the housing provision set out in the regional spatial strategy (RSS). Following the recent announcement regarding the abolition of RSS, it remains a matter for the council to assess how to meet its housing needs based upon a robust assessment of need within its area. Abolition of the housing figures in RSS will give the council responsibility for determining numbers, based on the evidence available to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated June 2010:</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning research and development tax credit: environmental protection, if it will be possible to bring forward proposals to amend the UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities to identify clean technology as a separate sector. (4619)</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/5" class="indent">The United Kingdom Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activity (UK SIC) is the national version of the European system 'Classification of Economic Activities' in the European Community' (NACE), part of the integrated system of statistical classifications. By an international agreement, the highest levels of NACE (the sections and divisions) are identical to those of the United Nations system 'International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities' (ISIC).</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/6" class="indent">The UK is required by European legislation to revise the UK SIC in parallel with NACE, ensuring that both systems remain identical down to and including the 4 digit class level. A further breakdown of the class level can be provided in certain instances by the addition of a 5 digit (country specific) subclass level. The UK SIC (2007) is currently bound by European legislation (Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006) to be identical with NACE Rev 2, down to and including the 4 digit class level. Changes to UKSIC (2007) above the 5<sup>(th)</sup> digit subclass level are therefore not permissible.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/7" class="indent">Revisions to statistical classification systems arc motivated by the need to adapt the classifications to changes in the world economy and must meet the methodological criteria associated with the classification. It is not possible to amend NACE in order to identify 'clean technology' as a separate section as the system classifies economic activities in terms of input-process-output. By applying the criteria described in the NACE methodological guide, the &quot;clean technology&quot; process cannot be distinguished from that of other technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/8" class="indent">The European Community regulation governing NACE is directly applicable to all member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.8/9" class="indent">The timing of the NACE revision process sits with a committee consisting of delegates form all member states; as yet, no announcement has been made to a possible revision date with regard to NACE Rev2. As a result of the obligations of the NACE Rev2 legislation, is not possible to bring forward a date for the revision of UKSIC (2007).</p>

	<p pid="b.99W.2/2">In the Emergency Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a 2.5 percentage point increase in the standard rate of value added tax (VAT). Analysis of the impact of indirect taxes, of which VAT is the most significant change, is provided in Annex A of the Red Book on both an income decile and expenditure decile basis. The Office for National Statistics and others have suggested expenditure deciles may better represent a household's expected lifetime income, and therefore better represent the impact of changes in VAT on households. The analysis provided in the Red Book is scalable to give the impact of a one percentage point increase in the main rate of VAT.</p>

	<p pid="b.102W.0/1">Pension funds are well diversified and invest for the long term in a range of assets. However, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill will have had a detrimental impact on pension funds due to the fall in the BP share price, the decision by BP to suspend dividend payments and the falls in share prices of other companies operating in the oil and gas sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/2">It is not possible with any degree of certainty to isolate the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on financial markets, and therefore on UK pension funds, due to changes in wider economic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/3">Traditionally, BP is a major source of dividends for investors. Self-administered pension funds received around &#163;60 billion of income in 2009, of which only 15% came from dividend payments. We estimate around 2% of total annual income was attributable to BP dividend payments. Consequently, the decision not to pay further dividends in 2010 should not have a significant impact on pension funds in the long term.</p>

	<p pid="b.109W.5/1">The Consumer Prices Index figure for September is the most up to date that can be used which allows time for the necessary activities involved in changing both the legislation and benefit systems in time for the uprating date in April.

	<p pid="b.109W.5/2">The September figures are published by the Office for National Statistics in mid-October and feed into the forecasts prepared for the pre-Budget report, The Uprating Statement to Parliament is made in November or December followed by the Uprating Order which is laid and debated in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.5/3">This timetable is important so that new claims to state pensions and pension credit, which can be made up to four months in advance, can be processed using the correct rates of benefit.

Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor's (Kenneth Clarke) written ministerial statement on HM Courts Service Estates issued on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-23">23 June 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-06-23.16"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 16-18WS</phrase>, we proposed to:</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;look at what can be done to use technology more effectively so fewer people have physically to attend court for routine purposes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.2/3">The potential benefits of using technology more effectively could be realised in various ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.2/4">The Virtual Court pilot focused on testing whether first hearings in the magistrates courts could be undertaken through the use of technology by connecting police stations to magistrates courts via video link. The pilot operated in London and Kent and is currently being independently evaluated. The evaluation will contribute to the Ministry's wider understanding of the potential of video linking to speed up the delivery of justice and reduce cost without compromising the interests of justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.2/5">In the civil courts, Money Claim on-Line and Possession Claim on-line (MCOL/PCOL) already allow small claims and housing possession claims to be submitted and processed on line. These services reduce the reliance on physical court buildings, reduce the need for the public to visit the court themselves and make access to justice available online 24 hours a day. We will continue to support and develop these systems and actively pursue other ways of providing access to services that provide greater value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.2/6">We will also consider whether technology can improve the take up of alternative and innovative routes to justice that do not require court hearings, for example through increasing the availability of the telephone small claims mediation service.</p>

The structures were based on core posts, with other roles excluded, e.g. where prison-based resources have been pooled at a regional level.

If another agency has brought the prosecution, area categorisation is based on the criminal justice area of the sentencing court.<br/> Magistrates Courts: As part of the rollout of the Libra case management system in magistrates' courts during 2008, a change was made to the categorisation by area. Sentences given at courts using the Libra system are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the court while others are categorised in the same way as the Crown Court. By the end of 2008, all magistrates' courts were using Libra. Police forces do not prosecute minor offences (those that are sentenced at magistrates' courts) outside their areas. Only around 0.01% of sentences at magistrates courts were affected in 2007 and 2008.<br/> Police force areas correspond to criminal justice areas except for the Metropolitan and City of London Police, which are combined to form the London criminal justice area.<br/> This data has been taken from the Ministry of Justice Court Proceedings database. This data is presented on the principal offence basis. Where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence the principal offence is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed. Where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.121W.5/1">A prisoner transfer agreement with South Africa is unlikely to be concluded in the near future. It is the policy of the South African Government not to enter into such agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/2">The possibility of a prisoner transfer agreement with China is under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/3">Nigeria and the United Kingdom are signatories to the Scheme for the Transfer of Convicted Offenders within the Commonwealth. The scheme allows for the transfer of prisoners between Nigeria and the United Kingdom where the consent of both states and the prisoner is obtained. A separate compulsory transfer agreement is under consideration. We expect negotiations to be completed once the Nigerian National Assembly has passed the necessary legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.121W.8/1">The United Kingdom and Nigeria are both participants to the Scheme for the Transfer of Convicted Offenders within the Commonwealth. This scheme provides for the voluntary transfer of prisoners between participating states. 24 Nigerian nationals in prisons in England and Wales have submitted applications to be repatriated to Nigeria. These applications are under consideration by the Nigerian Government. Because of the voluntary nature of the current transfer scheme and the need for the consent of the Nigerian Government in each case it is not possible to indicate how many prisoners will be transferred in the years 2010-11 and 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="b.131W.8/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has a range of mechanisms to ensure that the needs and concerns of retailers and small businesses are given due attention. These mechanisms include meetings between Ministers and representative bodies and trade associations, regular policy discussions with officials, the small firms consultation database and through a series of formal meetings, including the Retail Policy Forum. In the Budget the Government announced plans for reducing the regulatory burdens on business, including the introduction of a one-in-one out system for new regulations and a fundamental review of all regulation inherited from the previous Government scheduled for introduction over the coming year. These regulations will not be implemented until they have been reviewed and re-agreed by the Reducing Regulation Committee. Also, seven key reviews have been announced which will tackle the burden of regulation:</p>
