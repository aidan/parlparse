	<p pid=".1W.3/1">The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the regulations made under it do not in terms apply to the House. The Commission nevertheless attaches great importance to applying both the spirit and practice of the legislation. The House employs qualified health and safety specialists, and seeks to ensure full compliance with the law and industry best practice. All directly-employed works manual staff are required to undertake wide-ranging health and safety training including manual handling, risk assessment, control of substances hazardous to health and emergency first aid training. Contractors' staff are required to be competent individuals, who must work in accordance with a health and safety action plan. This plan is based on a formal risk assessment which is carried out for each project.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/2">Statutory health and safety standards are met through a 10-year rolling programme which includes cyclical maintenance, inspections, surveys and audits. Health and safety audits using the RoSPA Quality Safety Audit method were carried out in the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate and in the Refreshment Department in 2001. Currently an audit of the Serjeant's Departmental Safety Action Plan is being carried out. Copies of these audits are available for inspection from the Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Service in 7 Millbank.</p>

The Government will set out its views in the forthcoming Air Transport White Paper. The Government strongly supports further action at the international level to tackle the contribution of aircraft emissions to climate change, and we are working within ICAO and the EU to achieve this. At the local level differential charges related to aircraft noise already exists at BAA's London airports.</p>

We recognise the need for FTL requirements to be harmonised at a European level and should the proposal come before the Council we will work constructively with other member states to ensure that it is appropriately amended. I can assure the hon.

The TCT has been problematic ever since it was introduced, because it was built using old (1938) rolling stock. Tube lines are now responsible for this train and are considering options for its repair or replacement or alternative ways of cleaning the tunnels. In the meantime, I understand that manual cleaning using standard industrial vacuum cleaners continues, that dust levels in the tunnels and stations are monitored, and that they have not changed as a result of the TCT not being in use.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.0/2">The Government's Civil Contingencies Capabilities Programme has identified broad areas of activity under which Departments group specific projects, activity and programme expenditure. The purpose is to deliver broad generic capabilities which allow the UK to respond effectively to a wide range of disruptive challenges.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.0/3">The Home Office assumed responsibility for the initial assessment of the mass fatalities resilience work in late 2002. Prior to this, work was carried out on fatalities but was judged not to necessitate a specific project and was incorporated in other resilience work. All expenditure in 2002&ndash;03 is therefore additional. In 2002&ndash;03 &pound;15,000 has been used researching the preparedness of the emergency services. &pound;65,000 has been provided for work on a temporary facility (organised by GOLondon) at Northolt Airport and is to be spent in 2003&ndash;04. Further to this spending any additional money for the current financial year will not be known until the completion of the initial assessment work. The central expenditure excludes all the related work under way in local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.0/4">Decontamination is led by the Department of Health and supported by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister through Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate. I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" name="John Hutton">the right hon.

Within the Home Office the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Team works on CBRN resilience which includes decontamination. This is not quantifiable in financial terms as it is integrated with other aspects of CBRN planning.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.0/5">The capabilities that we are working to deliver have been developed to allow the Government to deal with the fullest range of scenarios. Should a specific additional urgent operational need arise, at any point of the spending cycle, action would be taken to meet it. The public expenditure framework the Government have put in place provides the flexibility to deal with unexpected pressures.</p>

	<p pid=".12W.3/1">The Government have a manifesto commitment to &quot;look at Government's interface with the faith communities&quot;. This was prompted by the success of the Lambeth Group at the time of the millennium celebrations. My Department is now able to act on this commitment.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.3/2">My predecessor, my noble Friend Lord Filkin, recently convened a high-level Steering Group to take the work forward. I will now chair the Group. Its terms of reference are to consider the most effective means of achieving greater involvement of the faith communities in policy-making and delivery across Whitehall; to identify the specific policy areas where this input would be most valuable; to oversee the agenda of the Working Group, and comment on and monitor its work; and to agree a report and recommendations by the end of December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.3/3">The Group includes a number of Ministers from Departments with a particular interest, as well as prominent representatives of the faith communities and others with an interest. A membership list is attached for the information of the House. The small Working Group referred to in the terms of reference is carrying out the technical mapping and other work associated with the Review, and will report to the Steering Group.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.3/4">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is aware of our plans and attaches considerable importance to this Review. It will lay the foundations for the effective long-term involvement of the faith communities' perspectives and needs in policy development across Government, building on excellent work that is already being done, for instance in ensuring that Prison chaplaincy provision meets the needs of inmates from many faith communities. It also complements the work my Department is doing to deepen engagement with individual communities through ministerial visits and meetings.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.5/2">The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) is committed to tackling the problem of work-related violence. In March 2000 HSC embarked on a three year programme to help employers, including those in the public sector, to tackle this problem, with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of violence at work. So far the programme has resulted in the publication of new guidance specifically aimed at small businesses; the development of new National Occupational Standards on work-related violence; a programme of inspections in the health care sector; and new research to establish good practice for lone workers, including those in the public sector.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.5/3">HSE officials are now evaluating this programme and will be submitting written proposals to the HSC on the next stage (2003&ndash;06) in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".17W.5/1">The EU Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism, which was agreed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of December 2001, requires all member states to introduce rigorous common terrorist offences and penalties. As a result, specific anti-terrorism legislation has to be introduced in those EU member states that did not have such measures in place. The United Kingdom, which already has specific strong counter-terrorism legislation, fully supported the framework decision. We believe it is vital to ensure that the EU has a co-ordinated, robust response to terrorism.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.2/1">Ministers recently met and talked with over 2000 primary headteachers at conferences across the country. They shared our ambitions for raising standards but asked us to consider how we could help to motivate them and their staff to achieve improved pupil performance.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.2/2">We agree with them that primary schools should have targets which are not only stretching, but realistic and signed up to by everyone in the school. Targets in literacy and numeracy provide a clear focus for what we need to achieve. All children who have the potential to do so should achieve Level 4 in English and maths at age 11. Our document 'Excellence and Enjoyment: a strategy for primary schools' published in May announced that in future schools will be empowered to set their own challenging but appropriate targets for individual pupils at age 11.</p>

	<p pid=".23W.0/1">Comparable UN estimates for forest cover in Africa are available for 1990 and 2000. Forest cover fell from almost 24 per cent. of total land surface to just under 22 per cent., a net loss of 0.8 per cent. or 5.2 million ha a year (a loss roughly equivalent to the size of France annually). There were particularly high rates of loss of mangrove forests and in Cote d'Ivoire and Congo of natural forest.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/2">Estimates of forest cover are available for 1980 and 1975 (25 per cent. in 1980 and between 17 per cent. and 33 per cent. of land area in 1975), but are not truly comparable as <i>(a)</i> they are based on different definitions of forest cover and <i>(b)</i> the assessment methods used in 1975 were neither accurate nor complete.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/3">Deforestation between 1990 and 2000 was higher in Africa than in Asia. This is because 62 per cent. of Asia forest cover is now plantation, and this has compensated for loss of natural forest, whereas in Africa only 4 per cent. is plantation.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/4">While &quot;deforestation rate&quot; is one official indicator for measuring success or failure of Millennium Development Goal 7 it is an imperfect one that hides differential impacts on poor people and does not capture the underlying causes of reducing forest cover&mdash;population growth, trade (including trade in illegal timber), macro-economic policies, weak governance, unclear access rights and conflict.</p>

In conjunction with the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, we are actively promoting the incorporation of measures for effective social and environmental impact assessment and regular stock assessment into these agreements. DFID's contribution to the current review of the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy is directed at securing these measures. Once the Policy reflects these improvements, we will closely monitor how they are implemented. Finally, DFID funds several development programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing the capacity of developing countries in fisheries generally and in the negotiation of fisheries access agreements in particular. We are currently discussing with a number of African countries support to strengthen policy for a fairer distribution of the benefits generated from such agreements.</p>

	<p pid=".29W.3/1">England offers visitors a wonderful range of attractions. The Department supports tourism directly through its sponsorship of VisitBritain, which has a remit to promote Britain overseas and England to the domestic market. It also provides funds to the Regional Development Agencies, who play a key role in strategic planning for tourism. Under reformed arrangements, we will work closely with the industry to drive up accommodation quality, foster skills to increase productivity, improve tourism statistics, and ensure that a coordinated marketing strategy yields maximum benefit for the sustainable growth of English tourism.</p>

At ministerial level, there is the Sports Cabinet, which is responsible for identifying strategic priorities and brings together Sports Ministers from the four parts of the UK and others closely involved in the development of UK sport. The membership comprises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who chairs it, and the Home Country Ministers with responsibility for sport. I represent England. The Chairs of the Home Country Sports Councils also attend in the capacity as observers to hear discussions where appropriate. The Cabinet meets on average twice a year.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/2">The Chairs of the Home Country Sports Councils are also Council members of UK Sport. UK Sport takes the lead in co-ordinating activities between home country sports councils and sport administrators working in high performance sport. UK Sport hosts regular meetings of the Chief Officers' Group, lead officers in performance, modernisation and on issues of ethics and equity. In addition, UK Sport has convened a 'Performance Forum', involving home country sports councils, the sports institutes from the home countries and representatives of national governing bodies of sport. This complements the work of the 'leadership group' which includes the directors and chairs of the four home country sports institutes, alongside representatives of UK Sport and which was established to help co-ordinate work across the UK Sports Institute network.</p>

Personnel eligible for treatment under the scheme are ATRA trainers or trainees referred by their unit General Practitioner for investigation, opinion and/or treatment for a condition which is preventing them from continuing with their employment or training. Personnel are referred only when lengthy waiting times occur at the local Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit or NHS hospital. The initiative has proved successful in reducing the average waiting time for both consultation and treatment, enabling trainers and trainees to return to work or training more quickly. The scheme is kept under constant review.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.11/2">The Waiting List Initiative and the Rapid Treatment Initiative were schemes run by the then Defence Secondary Care Agency in 2000&ndash;01 and January 2002 respectively. Some 2000 referrals were made under the two schemes, which were successful in treating personnel more quickly than would otherwise have been possible and in returning many of them to full fitness. Experience gained from these two initiatives will be relevant to further fast-track treatment initiatives in the future.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.2/1">Exercise Dimming Sun 03 was a joint UK/US Grade A defence nuclear accident response exercise. It is not possible to disaggregate the costs of the exercise as the majority lie where they fall, and are not charged specifically to an exercise budget as participants are carrying out duties to which they are already assigned in their command structure. The exercise took place in Norfolk over the period 16 to <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-20">20 June 2003</phrase>, and was co-sponsored by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence and the United States Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Exercise play was also conducted at the MOD Headquarters Nuclear Accident Response Organisation in London, the US Embassy in London and by US Government officials in Washington. The exercise scenario simulated the crash in Norfolk of a US Air Force aircraft, carrying a cargo of unarmed nuclear weapons. UK and US units participated in the exercise and responded to the incident, as well as other Government Departments, agencies, civil emergency services and local authorities. A copy of the All Agency Report on this exercise will be placed in the Library of the House as soon as it is completed. It will not be posted on the Departmental web site.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.0/1">The proposed changes would not affect claims from those currently eligible under the War Pension Scheme, or from those whose conditions arose before the introduction of the new scheme. The review team's evaluation of the changes proposed for the new scheme looked at the combined effect on a future cohort of claimants of those changes (including arrangements for time-limits and review for deterioration, as well as standard of proof) as against the combined provisions of the two existing schemes&mdash;the War Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. Its primary concern was whether, overall, the new arrangements would ensure eligibility for those claimants whose conditions might reasonably be regarded as attributable to service and whether the level of provision was appropriate to the pain and suffering incurred and to the expected effect on earnings capacity. It also looked at the overall budgetary implications for the Department. It did not consider the specific effect on numbers of the change to standard of proof. The important issue was the overall effect for those with a reasonable claim rather than the effect of one isolated aspect. The review team's conclusions were that its proposals would provide fairer, more comprehensible and administratively more simple arrangements with a better focus on those whose earning capacity has been significantly affected. As indicated, decisions on claims would be subject to an independent tribunal. The review team expects its proposals to be broadly cost neutral.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.7/1">The information requested falls within the Responsibility of the National Statistician. I have asked him to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Mr. Edward Davey, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking for a break down of council tax as a percentage of gross income in England in 2001&ndash;02 by <i>(a)</i> pensioner and <i>(b)</i> non-pensioner households consistent with estimates given in the previous answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-10">10 June</phrase> to Matthew Taylor MP for households in Great Britain. (121737).</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/4" class="indent">Estimates for council taxes and income are based on the analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&ndash;02&quot; produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on April 11 2003 and in Economics Trends in the May 2003 edition. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons Library. This includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. Sample sizes for pensioner households are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given for England not for Scotland or Wales, and by quintiles of income distribution not by decile.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/5" class="indent">Pensioner households have been defined as those where the Household Reference Person is retired or unoccupied and aged 65 or more and male, or 60 years of age or more and female, and economically inactive. Non-pensioner households are all other households. The Household Reference Person is identified during the interview and is defined as the member of the household who:</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/6" class="indent">a. owns the household accommodation, or</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/7" class="indent">b. is legally responsible for the rent of the accommodation, or</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/8" class="indent">c. has the household accommodation as an emolument or perquisite, or</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/9" class="indent">d. has the household accommodation by virtue of some relationship to the owner who is not a member of the household.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/10" class="indent">If there are joint householders, the Household Reference Person will be the householder with the highest income. If the income is the same, then the eldest householder is taken.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/11" class="indent">The following table shows the estimated gross and net council tax for pensioner and non-pensioner households in England for each income quintile where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less benefits and discounts. The table shows the equivalised disposable income quintile point boundaries, which have been calculated separately for the pensioner and non-pensioner households.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.7/12" class="indent">For example, the 1st quintile point for the pensioner households is the income below which one fifth of all pensioner households are estimated to lie and similarly for the non-pensioner households. The quintile point boundaries differ between the two groups, particularly between the fourth and fifth quintiles.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.9/1">The Government is not convinced that removing stamp duty for first-time buyers is the best way to assist those on the bottom rung of the housing ladder. Indeed it might actually fuel house price inflation and make property less affordable for first-time buyers. Continuing stability through the Government's policies, and in particular, continuing low interest rates, have been effective in helping people to be able to afford their own home.

UNAMA hopes to begin registration in August 2003, with a particular focus initially on rural areas where winter access would be more difficult. UNAMA is sensitive to the particular needs of women, and will ensure that registration takes place in private single sex facilities, with women registrars employed to ensure that as many women as possible are registered to vote.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.3/2">An important precursor to registration is the civic education process now being undertaken. One of the main objectives of this will be to educate heads of households and community leaders on the importance of females registering and voting, as well as reminding women themselves of their rights to vote.</p>

Both the industry regulator, Ofgem, and Energywatch, the statutory consumer body for the industry, have parts to play in this area.

	<p pid=".76W.8/3">In terms of public sector tendering 'Accelerating Change' says, &quot;The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) has issued a series of guidance for central civil government clients. The OGC's 'gateway process' offers a highly relevant straightforward way to ensure that government clients are helped through the procurement process at all stages and that the principles of Rethinking Construction underpin this. The Forum congratulates OGC for taking the lead in this way.&quot;</p>

We are working closely with Inland Revenue to ensure that processes are in place to make this happen smoothly.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.2/4">Where a family receiving income support chooses to claim child tax credit before April 2004, they will be entitled to the maximum rate of child tax credit which will be taken into account as income in their income support assessment. These families will continue to be awarded child premia and allowances with their benefit, which will offset their child tax credit income.</p>

The Electronic Libraries Programme is presently in the implementation phase and the current file download size of 1.44 Mb will be reviewed at the end of implementation, and at regular intervals throughout the term of the contract.</p>

	<p pid=".101W.6/1">Physical Education is compulsory within the Northern Ireland curriculum for all pupils from age 4 to 16 and this shows the degree of importance which is attached to the subject. It is essential that pupils develop an understanding of the importance of physical activity to a healthy lifestyle in later life. Schools themselves determine how much time is devoted to PE in the curriculum, but they have been encouraged to give pupils at least two hours PE per week. The PE Programme of Study is also flexible enough to enable teachers to adjust the activities available to cater for developing the particular sporting interests of all pupils and so make the subject enjoyable for them. The Northern Ireland Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) is currently carrying out a review of the curriculum, and PE is being considered as part of this review.</p>

	<p pid=".108W.8/1">Housing associations are independent organisations whose boards are responsible for ensuring that their organisations are financially strong and flexible enough to operate in different markets and meet the needs of tenants.</p>
	<p pid=".108W.8/2">Housing associations may themselves come to the conclusion that merger or rationalisation of their operations is in their organisation's and their tenants' interests. A number of them have already done this or are doing so, particularly where the effectiveness of neighbourhood management is inhibited by the presence of a large number of social landlords. The Housing Corporation, as regulator of housing associations, encourages and enables those who wish to pursue this route to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.2/1">The regulation of housing associations is the responsibility of the Housing Corporation, an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Housing Corporation's regulatory code sets out minimum requirements for housing associations across a range of functions, including the management of properties. The Housing Corporation's regulation teams are responsible for ensuring these requirements are met and, where possible, exceeded.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.2/2">The Housing Corporation introduced inspection as an important part of its range of regulatory activities in 2002. In April 2003, inspection of housing associations was transferred to a single social housing inspectorate at the Audit Commission, which was already responsible for the inspection of local authority housing services. The Housing Inspectorate is working with the Housing Corporation to drive up standards of service to tenants of housing associations.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.2/3">There is a annual programme of inspections which is published by the Audit Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.2/4">Where the Audit Commission finds that standards of service to housing association tenants do not meet those set out in the Housing Corporation's Regulatory Code, the Corporation ensures that associations take action to bring about improvements, including using its statutory powers if necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.0/1">The Government's draft Housing Bill, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, proposes that the period during which people who have bought their homes under the Right to Buy scheme may be required to repay their discount if they choose to resell should be extended from three years to five years, and that the amount to be repaid should be linked to the resale value of the property less the value of any improvements made by the owner after exercising his Right to Buy.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.0/2">The Government are concerned that the Right to Buy rules are being exploited by companies seeking to redirect public subsidy for their own profit, and that this is adversely affecting the availability of affordable housing in some areas. There is strong evidence that some companies offer tenants financial help to buy their homes on condition that they resell them to the company after the three-year discount repayment period has ended ('deferred resale' arrangements). The companies thus acquire former social homes at substantially less than their market value, and rent them out. This means that homes formerly available at subsidised social rents then command substantially higher market rents, reducing the availability of affordable housing. Research by Heriot-Watt University, published in May 2003, has demonstrated that such exploitation is prevalent in Inner London, where around 2,000 ex-council homes are now privately rented. The aim of the measures in the Housing Bill is therefore to make deferred resale arrangements less financially attractive.</p>

	<p pid=".119W.5/2">I understand the question pertains to what is known as Low Frequency Active Sonar (LFAS). The MOD plans to introduce Sonar 2087, an LFAS system, in order to protect against a developing submarine threat. The system is planned to be used, at need, on a world-wide basis. The associated Environmental Impact Assessment accordingly considered its potential effects on marine mammals in the conditions in which it might be used, rather than in the specific context of UK territorial waters. The assessment, which we are updating continuously as necessary, indicates that the sonar has the potential to be harmful to marine mammals. It forms the basis for the development of a range of operating measures to minimise the danger of such impact.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.2/1">No assessment has been made. The Access to Justice Act 1999 removed negligently caused personal injury claims from the scope of legal aid. This was done because of the availability of conditional fee agreements (CFAs) and meant that the limited public funds available for legal aid could be better targeted on priority areas of law. CFAs have proved successful as a means of bringing personal injury actions, and this remains the case. The demise of one provider would not prevent people with genuine claims obtaining access to justice. They can do so either by approaching solicitors' firms who deal with such claims or accident intermediaries. The Government believe the personal injury market is able to absorb the loss of individual organisations because there is a strong network of CFA providers.</p>

	<p pid=".130W.0/2">CAFCASS has over 100 stand-alone legacy case recording systems, inherited from the three different services unified under CAFCASS. On the legacy systems, each case data item is only entered into one of these systems; no interface exists from these to other systems such as management information or financial systems.</p>
	<p pid=".130W.0/3">The original project for a case management system was suspended as it was deemed to be too high risk. CAFCASS is now planning a simpler and more cost effective case recording system and this has been independently verified as a more effective approach.</p>
	<p pid=".130W.0/4">CAFCASS are currently tendering for a supplier to provide the new integrated case recording system. Until that process is completed CAFCASS will not be able to assess the full costs. However, it is expected that the costs will, over a three-year period, be less than the costs of maintaining the existing legacy systems. A user group as been set up to review requirements and supplier proposals prior to selection of the successful tender. CAFCASS hopes to pilot the system later this year and introduce it from 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".133W.9/1">The Department has made no specific requests for information, advice or assistance around buprenorphine from other countries. The National Treatment Agency has a responsibility to review research and disseminate findings to enhance quality of drug treatment in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.9/2">The current evidence does not suggest that buprenorphine should replace methadone as a substitution treatment, but rather that burprenorphine should now be considered an addition to the range of pharmacological maintenance treatments. Information from specialists indicates that there has already been an increase in the use of buprenorphine (or Subutex) in the United Kingdom as an alternative to methadone.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.2/1">Resources for funding cancer services have been included in general primary care trust (PCT) allocations for 2003&ndash;04 and in the general allocations to health authorities in previous years.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/2">The Department published a report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-22">22 May</phrase> from the national clinical director for cancer services, Professor Mike Richards, detailing investment in cancer services locally and from central budgets over the past two years. Copies are available in the Library. Further details are available at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/cancer">www.doh.gov.uk/cancer</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/3">Investment in new cancer drugs has been the single largest element of expenditure. However, there has also been significant investment in other key areas, such as expanding the cancer workforce to improve access to diagnostic capacity and to help build specialist teams to deliver high quality treatment and care. Some networks have invested to extend services such as radiotherapy and strengthen existing services, such as screening.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/4">The national report includes figures on spending on cancer drugs and new service developments in each network. Beyond this, strategic health authorities and cancer networks collected more detailed information, where possible, in the ways that were most appropriate to local circumstances. Networks specified their new service developments in a variety of formats and so it is not possible to give a national picture of how the money was spent, but networks have made further information available locally.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/5">The report included a broad assessment of whether networks' spending had been in line with their expected share of the national totals. Some local variations were expected given that networks had differing starting points and differing local priorities, but investment in a few networks did fall short of the expected totals. However, PCTs are receiving an additional &pound;12.7 billion over the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. It is for PCTs in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national priorities, including the targets set for cancer in the three year priorities and planning framework.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/6">In the financial year 2001&ndash;02, 71 computed tomography (CT) scanners (four additional and 67 replacement), 18 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners (13 additional and five replacement) and 33 linear accelerators (12 additional and 21 replacement) were delivered to the national health service from central budgets. The figures for 2002&ndash;03 were 40 CT scanners (17 additional and 23 replacement), 11 MRI scanners (seven additional and four replacement) and 17 linear accelerators (four additional and 13 replacement). The aim of this investment is to increase capacity in diagnostic services and begin to tackle inequalities in access to radiotherapy services. Each scanner will provide improved access to diagnostic imaging services to all patients, though the impact of the extra capacity in terms of waiting times will depend on local circumstances. The investment in linear accelerators will make available to patients the latest treatment technology.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.2/1">14 regional Civil Contingencies Reaction Forces (CCRFs), 500 strong and drawn from the Armed Forces Reserve, are currently being formed by the Ministry of Defence. Formation of these units was an important conclusion of the work undertaken last year on &quot;A New Chapter of the Strategic Defence Review&quot; (cm 5566, dated July 2002). The CCRFs are expected to be fully ready by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/2">The Department of Health, along with many other Departments and agencies, worked with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on the development of the New Chapter. Once formed, the CCRFs could be made available to provide support to the national health service, during an emergency, under normal crisis management arrangements. They would remain under military command, but would work under the supervision of the police and other civil agencies, including, if appropriate, Department of Health and NHS officials.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.2/3">The CCRFs will be able to apply general military skills in response to a crisis. Their role would vary according to the nature of the emergency, but might include, for example, management of displaced persons, limited first aid, temporary accommodation management and manning of water and feeding points. To ensure that the NHS response to a crisis is not adversely affected by the mobilisation of the MOD's response, the MOD has adopted a policy of not recruiting doctors, nurses, and paramedics, who are part of the Armed Forces Reserve, into the CCRFs.</p>

These annexes remain open pending safety assessment of additional substances.

	<p pid=".143W.11/3">The Government are not seeking amendments to the Directive, which it considers represents the best achievable deal for United Kingdom consumers and industry, given the pressure from many other member states for a more restrictive regulatory regime.</p>

In addition, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is urgently seeking a meeting with the European Food Safety Authority and relevant interest groups to discuss the content of safety dossiers for those vitamins and minerals and their sources currently excluded from the permitted lists.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.11/6">The Government also recognise concerns over the future setting of maximum permitted limits of nutrients in food supplements. While the Directive establishes principles for setting maximum permitted limits, no such levels have yet been set. The Government's view is that these maximum limits should be based on consideration of safety rather than supposed nutritional need so as to neither unnecessarily limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade. To this end, the FSA, which will be responsible for future negotiations on this issue, takes every opportunity to press this case bilaterally with member states and with other interested parties.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.5/1">The causes of illness associated with substandard housing can be complex and multi-factoral and it is not possible to disentangle the possible contributory role of housing conditions from other potential contributing factors such as poverty, working conditions and behavioural aspects. Therefore it would not be feasible to produce accurate figures representing the costs to the national health service of illness resulting from substandard housing.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/2">Nevertheless, links have been established between cold, damp housing and increased ill health and the physiological effects of cold are well documented. The Government's Fuel Poverty Strategy and specific initiatives such as the 'Warm Front' and the review of the housing fitness standard all contribute to tackling substandard housing.</p>

In accordance with Cabinet Office guidance, employees will be offered access to a scheme certified by the Government Actuary Department as broadly comparable with their current scheme. Staff will then have the option either to transfer their accrued rights or alternatively freeze their rights in the old scheme and enter the new scheme as a new joiner following the transfer. There should therefore be no residual liabilities. As to other liabilities, it is not anticipated that there will be any residual liabilities over and above those that normally arise in the conduct of businesses such as this. Inventures is part of NHS Estates, which is an Executive Agency of the Department of Health. Bidders were invited to state whether they attached greater value to Inventures and the retained estate portfolio being sold together, or singly at the short-listing stage. Bidders' responses suggested that better value for money would be obtained through a combined sale, and the evaluation of bids was carried out on that basis.</p>

	<p pid=".157W.5/2">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently developing a guideline on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary and secondary care. NICE is due to publish the guideline in 2004. In January 2003, the Respiratory Alliance published their guidance, &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot;, which aims to help primary care trusts to commission and deliver high quality allergy and respiratory care. Local British Lung Foundation &quot;Breathe Easy&quot; groups often reinforce pulmonary rehabilitation programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.5/3">Information is not held centrally regarding the proportion of people with COPD who can access pulmonary rehabilitation. However, a recent survey by the British Lung Foundation and the British Thoracic Society found that 160 out of 266 hospitals across the country provide some form of pulmonary rehabilitation to lung patients. A wide range of patients can benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation. These include those with chronic lung diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, or lung tumours. Most pulmonary rehabilitation programs include medical management, education, emotional support, exercise, breathing retraining, and nutritional counselling. The objective is to help people gain the highest level of function and independence possible, and to improve overall quality of life.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.5/4">Substantial new investment in both health and social care services was announced in the 2002 Budget. This amounts to the largest sustained increase in funding of any five-year period in the history of the national health service. Over the years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08, these plans mean that expenditure on the NHS in England will increase on average by 7.4 per cent. a year over and above inflation&mdash;a total increase over the period of 43 per cent. in real terms. This means that over the same five-year period, there will be an increase of &pound;34 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.5/5">It is the role of strategic health authorities, in partnership with primary care trusts, to decide what services to provide for their populations including those with respiratory conditions. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them.</p>

	<p pid=".158W.2/1">The current United Kingdom policy is not to offer single measles and mumps vaccines, because this exposes children to a greater risk of disease due to the longer course of vaccination required. Single vaccines leave children at risk of diseases that have serious complications for no benefit and the Government do not endorse this. There is very considerable evidence for the safety of MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation (WHO) stated:</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;WHO strongly supports the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. The combination vaccine is recommended rather that the monovalent presentation (single vaccines) when available and the disease burden justifies its use&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/3">The Secretary of State does not have direct powers to prevent clinics providing single mumps and measles vaccines, provided that the regulations for supply of medicinal products are complied with. Independent healthcare establishments, such as private clinics, are regulated by the National Care Standards Commission. Their concern would be compliance with the relevant Regulations and National Minimum Standards. They have no powers to prevent a clinic providing single measles and mumps vaccinations as such.</p>

	<p pid=".158W.5/1">I am pleased to announce the publication today of a report for consultation by the Government's chief medical officer, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, outlining proposals for reform of the national health service clinical negligence system.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/2">The report, entitled &quot;Making Amends; a consultation paper setting out proposals for reforming the approach to clinical negligence in the NHS&quot;, has been prepared against a background of the rising cost of claims for clinical negligence, which have drawn much media attention. In line with our wider drive to put patients at the heart of the NHS and patient safety at the top of its agenda, Sir Liam proposes that a less adversarial system should be available. Injured patients would no longer have to resort to lengthy and costly court action under the tort law. It would allow the NHS to be pro-active in responding to sub-standard care. There would be clear links to NHS quality initiatives to improve the patient's experience of the NHS as well as an incentive to drive up standards and so reduce injuries in the first place.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/3">The chief medical officer proposes a NHS redress scheme which would offer redress for injuries, in all senses of that word. The scheme would provide people who were injured with an explanation of what went wrong, the necessary apologies, treatment for that injury and support for patients and their families, as well as some financial compensation in appropriate cases. It is proposed that families of neurologically impaired babies would also be eligible for the NHS redress scheme if the impairment was birth related and fulfilled other eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/4">Although a person's right to pursue a formal claim in the court would remain, patients would no longer have to resort to the law as the only way of resolving a dispute with the NHS. Proposed improvements to the legal aid system would mean that use of the NHS scheme would be taken into account if a claimant applied for legal aid after rejecting a fair package of redress under the NHS scheme. At present, over 70 per cent. of clinical negligence cases are legally aided, meaning the taxpayer often foots the bill through the legal aid budget if the NHS wins a case or the NHS budget if it loses.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/5">For too long, we have had a disjointed approach to clinical negligence in the NHS. There are often no clear links between complaints procedures and the systems to deal with clinical negligence claims at a local level. There is little consideration of the wider issues raised by complaints and clinical negligence claims&mdash;and settlements&mdash;locally and nationally. Finally, there are no reliable systems of ensuring that mistakes made in one organisation are not repeated in another.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/6">The proposed NHS redress scheme would link to the NHS complaints procedure and the new independent inspection structures being taken forward through the Health and Social Care Reform Bill presently before the House.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/7">The report emphasises the importance of building a NHS that is better at addressing injuries resulting from poor quality treatment. As well as the NHS redress scheme, it recommends that the NHS should improve rehabilitation services and that in cases of clinical negligence the costs of future care should be considered on an NHS-provided rather than a privately-provided basis. This is a long-term measure and it will take time to establish the necessary specialist NHS capacity. However, the Department will be exploring taking this forward through the long-term care national service framework, as it makes sense that those injured by the NHS should be able to get the care that they need from the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/8">Sir Liam's review has been wide-ranging and he proposes radical reform of the present lengthy, complicated and overly adversarial court-based system. The existing system is slow and often does not provide injured patients with the response to their injuries that they seek. The new system will be more responsive to the needs of patients for redress, and of the NHS for mechanisms that help it learn from mistakes. I believe it is possible to have a system that responds to patients' needs, that supports clinicians to deliver the very best quality care, and that is a driver for the NHS to learn from mistakes to continue to improve the quality of care it delivers.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.5/9">There will now be a consultation period until <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>. Following considerations of the issues raised and of the views of respondents on the specific questions asked, the Department expects to set out the next steps to reform the clinical negligence system in the autumn.</p>

NHS Plus, launched in November 2001, is currently providing access to local occupational health services to small and medium sized businesses through 107 providers (National Health Service trusts) across the United Kingdom, while the new Job Retention and Rehabilitation pilots, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, and the Incapacity Benefit reforms, announced in the Government's Green Paper, &quot;Pathways to Work&quot;, in November 2002, are offering work-focused interventions for those with health problems, including mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.5/2">In addition, &quot;Making It Happen: A guide to delivering mental health promotion&quot;, published by the Department of Health in 2001, contains a section dealing with mental health promotion in the workplace, the National Institute for Mental Health in England is currently preparing a resource on mental health and employment for people with mental health problems for publication in the autumn and the Health and Safety Executive is about to launch an occupational health support pilot scheme for the construction industry.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.2/2">In our response to the Independent Working Group's Report on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in January 2002, we endorsed their view that there should be no doubt this is a chronic illness and that health and social care professionals should recognise it as such.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/3">We have had discussions with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on the conclusions of the report.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/4">We also asked the Medical Research Council (MRC) to develop a research strategy for advancing biomedical and health services research on chronic fatigue syndrome CFS/ME.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/5">The MRC published their research strategy for (CFS/ME) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-01">1 May 2003</phrase>. The strategy will enable researchers and funders to develop research proposals on all aspects of this illness. It was developed by an independent research advisory group in response to a request from the Chief Medical Officer, and was informed by contributions from patients, carers, charities, researchers and clinicians via a consultation exercise in summer 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/6">The MRC has announced two initiatives in response to the strategy. One is a notice to the research community welcoming high quality proposals across the entire spectrum of CFS/ME research. The other is a scientific meeting to discuss the potential to use existing UK resources and infrastructures to undertake epidemiological studies in this country. In addition, the MRC has just announced funding (<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-15">15 May 2003</phrase>) for two trials that will look at the effectiveness of various treatments for CFS/ME. The results of these trials will help patients and their doctors to choose the best treatment. These complementary trials will assess a variety of treatments, and in doing so, will both help address important issues for those with CFS/ME.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/7">The first trial known as PACE (&quot;Pacing, Activity and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy: A Randomised Evaluation) will make the first assessment of a treatment choice popular with patients called 'Pacing'. The second trial, known as FINE, (&quot;Fatigue Intervention by Nurses Evaluation&quot;) will test two different treatments that are particularly suited to helping reach those who are too ill to attend a specialist clinic as patients will be treated by nurses in their own homes.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/8">On May 12 2003, we announced that funding of &pound;8.5 million would be provided to develop services for people with CFS/ME. In July 2003, health organisations will be invited to bid for development funds to set up centres of expertise to develop clinical care, support clinical research and expand education and training programmes for health care professionals and to establish satellite community multidisciplinary teams. The first phase of development will commence in April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".163W.2/1">Historically, capital and revenue funding for neonatal intensive care (NIC) has been sourced from health authority base-line allocations, without segregation from funding the generality of health services. However, we have provided additional funds in recognition of the growing potential and availability of advanced levels of intervention, expertise and technological support for pre-term and sick babies, which increasingly saves the lives of even the most vulnerable, but leads to the need for greater levels of support within neonatal units.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.2/2">We approved additional funding in 2000 specifically to improve the NIC services. There were three elements: &pound;5 million revenue funding, &pound;6.5 million capital funding for new and replacement equipment and &pound;10.5 million funding for intensive care training for nurses, including neonatal intensive care education packages.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.2/3">Further to this we have taken advice from a NIC services review, the background to which and report is available at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/nsf/neonatal.htm">www.doh.gov.uk/nsf/neonatal.htm</a> and we have set up a full consultation into improving NIC services. The consultation period concludes on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July</phrase>, following which, and to help NIC services implement the outcome, there will be additional &pound;20 million capital funding this year and &pound;12 million additional revenue funding, increasing to &pound;20 million in subsequent years.</p>

	<p pid=".166W.8/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, the Counter Fraud and Security Management Service will take over lead responsibility for tackling violence against NHS staff and will be leading a programme of work in 2003&ndash;04 to consider how best to implement the recommendations contained in the NAO's recent report. These include recommendations to improve the risk assessment process, to standardise the training staff receive, to deal with violence and ensuring that NHS employing organisations are managing the problem of violence within a clear legal framework.</p>

	<p pid=".172W.5/2">The Department of Health considered the recommendations of the report and this influenced the document, &quot;National Service Frameworks: A practical aid to implementation in primary care&quot;, which was published in August 2002 as a series of topic leaflets to support general practices and primary care trusts (PCTs). The topic leaflet, &quot;Health Prevention and Improvement&quot;, also captures information on effective interventions to encourage and promote physical activity that emerged from Health Development Agency surveys of local prevention strategies under the national service framework for CHD.</p>

	<p pid=".172W.5/4">Under &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, performance management of PCTs in accordance with local priorities is largely the responsibility of strategic health authorities. Local strategies and policies to increase physical activity will be included in the Commission for Health Improvement/Audit Commission joint national study into the implementation of the NSF for CHD. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the Department of Health to propose an additional assessment of the promotion of physical activity by primary care trusts.</p>
