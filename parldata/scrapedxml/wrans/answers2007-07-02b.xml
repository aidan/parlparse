	<p pid="b.896W.5/4">If suitable, a potential partner is sent a Partner Framework and Agreement to sign which sets out the following requirements: promoting key messages of the campaign including FCO Travel Advice; encouraging travellers to get adequate and comprehensive travel insurance; informing travellers about preparations they need to make before travelling; informing travellers about the consular assistance they can and cannot receive once abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.5/5">Furthermore, a partner will have the responsibility wherever possible to promote the campaign to its customers through its own communications initiatives and distribute marketing materials. The partner will also need to have a secure and established website or newsletter, which hosts the KBYG logo and link to the FCO website in a prominent position. We also expect where possible the partner to work together with other partners and the FCO on a strategic level to leverage the campaign and where appropriate offer feedback and case studies of campaign activity.</p>

	<p pid="b.896W.5/7">Partners are expected not in any way to bring the campaign into disrepute and at the absolute discretion of the FCO partner status can be immediately withdrawn. In such instances the partner agrees to remove immediately all references to the KBYG campaign from its website and literature.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.5/8">Being a partner in the campaign does not give rise to any payment from the FCO, except where the FCO decides to co-sponsor specific communications activities with particularly relevant partners, for example, the co-funding of a guide to travel safety produced by &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; books and distributed free to younger independent travellers.</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.2/2">The operation of Admiralty House is covered by a single facilities management contract which covers maintenance, renovation, security and running costs. It is not possible, within the overall total, to separately identify the costs that arise from the three flats in Admiralty House. However, for internal accounting purposes the Deputy Prime Minister's Office meets 20.7 per cent. of the costs of the operation of the entire building. This is calculated on the basis of the floor area of the flat as a proportion of the total floor area of Admiralty House.</p>

Each case is logged and given a reference number. DFID is committed to openness and transparency in accordance with the spirit of the FOI Act, and the presumption is always in favour of disclosure unless exemptions are found to apply. For example, in 2006, 80 per cent. of FOI requests received by DFID were answered in full without the withholding of any information. Only in 7 per cent. of cases was information fully withheld under permissible exemptions, often after consultation with other Government Departments such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p>

Summary statistical information on the outcomes of FOI requests and exemptions used are reported by DFID to the Ministry of Justice every quarter and can be accessed on the Ministry of Justice website at:</p>

Universities as independent, autonomous bodies are responsible themselves for complying with legislation and fulfilling their statutory duties. Under the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000) university governing bodies are also responsible for assessing the impact of their policies on student and staff of different racial groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.907W.10/6">Digital map data are also freely available to LEA-funded schools from their parent local authority under the terms of the Local Authority Mapping Services Agreement. In order to ensure that LEA schools are technically able to access this data, Ordnance Survey has been working closely with the British Education Communications Technology Agency (Becta) to trial an on-line mechanism for the delivery of map data to schools and their suppliers. The 18 month 'MapPilot' project will report in summer 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.10/7">To further support the educational use of geographic information within schools Ordnance Survey operates a specialist on-line service within its web site. 'MapZone' is an award-winning free resource for school use, available 24 x 7 for teachers and pupils. It contains all the map reading skills required within the national curricula. The latest mapping is also available free of charge to schools and pupils (and the public) through the Ordnance Survey on-line 'Get-a-Map' service from which extracts may be downloaded or printed for a wide range of personal or learning uses.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.10/8">Ordnance Survey supports teacher training by supplying all tutors of Post Graduate Certificate of Education geography courses across Great Britain with free OS Explorer and OS Landranger maps to aid with training of secondary school teachers. Through sponsorship arrangements with the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and the teachers' professional body. The Geography Association (GA), Ordnance Survey also supports the provision of free geography teaching materials and teacher in service training (INSET).</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.10/9">Further and higher education needs are served through a collective purchasing agreement between Ordnance Survey and the Higher Education Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). A basket of Ordnance Survey digital mapping products is available for use for teaching and non-commercial research use within higher and further education establishments&mdash;each establishment pays a single annual subscription for all agreed use by staff and students.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.10/10">The value of providing further services for free is continually held under review. The Government published their response to an independent review by Ed Mayo and Tom Steinberg, &quot;The Power of Information&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June 2007</phrase>. This made clear that Ordnance Survey will look very seriously at launching Open Space, a project which would allow non-commercial experimentation with mapping data.</p>

	<p pid="b.913W.0/1">All efforts are being made to avoid vulnerable prisoners being held in police or court cells. Prisoners previously held in prison accommodation will have been assessed on their reception for drugs treatment, detox and wider health needs. Invoices, including medical and food expenses are submitted in arrears. The total cost of food and average cost per prisoner per meal is not centrally available. Estimated costs, on average, are around &pound;385 per place per night to hold a prisoner in a police cell, and around &pound;300 for every place in a court cell.</p>

	<p pid="b.913W.0/6">All prisoners held in court cells, whether or not previously held in custody, have a 'prisoner escort record' (PER) form, on which issues giving rise to concern are noted. Contractor staff and the on-site constables are able to take management action as appropriate, up to and including a hospital bed watch (where a minimum of two officers are to be present throughout the hospital stay). At each court a clinic is held each night by a qualified health care professional to identify and help address any health issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.0/7">Prisoners have access to sanitary facilities within the custody area. Showers are not generally available, but other than in wholly exceptional circumstances prisoners are only held in court cells for one night.</p>

	<p pid="b.915W.0/2">There is a range of controls in the Firearms Act 1968 and related statutes controlling the possession and use of airguns. For example, a person must be aged 17 or over before they can buy an airgun or receive one as a gift. Anyone under 17 must normally be supervised by an adult when in possession of an airgun. It is an offence to carry an airgun in public without reasonable excuse. Other offences include possession with intent to injure, possession with intent to cause fear of violence and trespass with an airgun. Persons sentenced to three years imprisonment or longer for any offence are prohibited for life from possessing an airgun, and those sentenced to three months or more are prohibited for five years. High powered airguns are subject to certification and some are prohibited.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/3">The Government are further strengthening the controls on airguns through measures contained in the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. It will soon become an offence for businesses to sell airguns unless they register with the police as firearms dealers. To guard against under-age sales, transactions by dealers will have to be completed in person. The Act will also increase to 18, the age limit for buying and possessing an airgun and will make it an offence for anyone of any age to fire an airgun beyond the boundary of premises.</p>

	<p pid="b.921W.5/3">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, Home Office officials consulted with the Attorney General's Fraud Review Steering Group on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>, where a presentation on proposed changes to the reporting and recording of cheque and plastic card fraud offences was made.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/4">The Fraud Review published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase> mentions proposed changes to the Home Office Counting Rules under paragraph 2.17 and states</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/5" class="indent">&quot;Changes to the counting rules centre on rationalising responsibility for recording the crime and using statistics collated by APACS to supplement crime statistics&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.921W.5/7" class="indent">&quot;These changes to the fraud statistics, following on from the Fraud Bill, are welcome&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/8">Home Office officials have not held any direct discussions with Trade and Industry officials on changes to the reporting and recording of cheque and plastic card offences introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/9">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, Home Office officials have discussed changes to the reporting of cheque and plastic card offences with APACS (UK Payments Association), ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) and Attorney General's Office officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/10">Home Office officials are integral members of the Economic Crime Portfolio Group which is chaired by the commissioner of the city of London police. The Commissioner is also the ACPO lead on all fraud matters. Home Office officials have made presentations to the group and kept them updated on the changes to reporting and recording of cheque and plastic card fraud by police introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. The FSA are also represented at the ECP meetings, together with a range of other stakeholders in fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/11">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> each police force now has a single point of contact (SPOC) that has been set up to receive reports of cheque and plastic card crime direct from financial institutions. It is a matter for the financial institutions which crimes they decide to refer to the police for recording. It is then a matter for individual chief officers to decide which crimes will be investigated.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/12">The Home Office has been making greater use of APACS (UK Payments Association) figures to provide a better indication of the extent and trends in cheque and plastic card fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/13">Home Office officials will remain engaged with the UK Payments Association (APACS) and the Association of Chief Police Officers to continually assess the effectiveness of new arrangements for reporting and recording of cheque and plastic card fraud introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/14">Financial institutions now have a network of single points of contact within each police force where they can report cheque and plastic card fraud. Guidance issued to both police and financial institutions and contained within the Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime, (which is a public document available online at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/countrules.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/countrules.html</a>) states the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/15" class="indent">The financial institution wishing to report fraud will give the case or cases to the force area based on the following set of principles. The principles are listed in order of priority and it is only when a principle cannot be achieved or is not known that the next principle will apply:</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/16" class="indent">1<sup>(st)</sup>&mdash;The police force area covering the location of the fraudulent operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/17" class="indent">2<sup>(nd)</sup>&mdash;The police force area with the greatest number of individual usages.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/18" class="indent">3<sup>(rd)</sup>&mdash;The police force area where the first offence was committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/19" class="indent">4<sup>(th)</sup>&mdash;The police force area where the victim is located.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/20">The Rules make it clear that where the trader or account holder is the victim (i.e. they suffer the financial loss) they can report this to the police who have to record this as a crime and not refer them back to the financial institution. It is then a matter for the police to decide which force is responsible for recording this matter as a crime based on the above criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/21">Where an account holder does contact the police to report this matter without having first spoken to their financial institution, a crime related incident will be recorded and the account holder will be referred to their financial institution.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/22">APACS put out a press release to this effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/23">A series of questions and answers for all police staff was circulated to all police forces in January 2007 on the changes to the reporting and recording arrangements for cheque and plastic card fraud offences. This additionally appeared in Police Review on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-19">19 January 2007</phrase> as a two page article.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/24">In addition the Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime contain more extensive details. This is a publicly available document available on the Home office website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/25" class="indent"><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/countrules.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/countrules.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.5/26">Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and individual forces have been fully consulted on these proposed changes throughout the course of 2006-07 through the National Crime Recording Steering Group and also its fraud sub-group.</p>

All officers should have access to a range of body armour, either on an individual or shared basis, dependant on their role. In reaching decisions about what protective equipment to issue, chief officers have the benefit of expert advice provided by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) and the standards they produce. Body armour supplied to the vast majority of police officers in the UK now offers a dual protection level of knife and ballistic resistance as detailed in the HOSDB Standard.</p>

DOMILL has issued three statements on the medical implications of the use of the Taser. Its view is that the risk of death from primary injury with high power laser is low and certainly very much lower than that from conventional firearms.</p>

	<p pid="b.943W.5/1">The disqualification from holding or obtaining travel authorisation and the use of curfew orders are part of a package of changes to the child maintenance enforcement model.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.5/2">In the case of travel authorisation, giving the power to impose these measures directly to the Commission greatly strengthens their hand in dealing with the non-resident parent. There is more immediacy than a threat of court action. It is envisaged that this threat of imminent action will be significantly more effective in securing compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.5/3">Curfew orders will serve as an effective alternative to committal; it is expected to create a strong incentive to pay without impeding the non-resident parent's ability to do so by causing him or her to lose his or her job.</p>
