	<p pid="c.213W.5/2">The dataset 'Children in Families in Receipt of Out-of-work Benefits' is currently used as a proxy to measure child poverty at the local level. This dataset is the basis for indicator 116 in the National Indicator Set, used by local government and its partners. The data were produced between 2004 and 2007 and are available at both local authority and ward level. April 2007 is the latest available. There is a six-month time lag for this dataset.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.5/3">A revised indicator is currently being developed to measure child poverty at local level and will include children living in low income working families as well as those in workless families. The revised indicator will be the proportion of children living in families in receipt of out-of-work benefits or working families whose income is below 60 per cent. of median income. This will provide information on both in-work and out-of-work poverty in the local area.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.5/4">The data will also be available at both local authority and ward level. It will be produced annually. Data will shortly be available for 2006 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.5/5">In addition to NI116, the National Indicator Set provides local authorities and their partners with a wide range of data related to child poverty and its underlying causes. Local authorities can use local administrative data to supplement the data that are provided from central Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.5/6">The Child Poverty Unit is working with the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes in Children and Young People's Services (C4EO)&mdash;a sector led organisation&mdash;to develop a tool to help local delivery partners analyse local data relating to child poverty. This tool will be available from the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.217W.2/1">The Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) takes very seriously its responsibility to stop illegal drugs entering establishments. Visitors, staff and others are required to undergo a rub-down search, and items brought into prisons are subject to a Rapiscan search. A passive drugs dog is used to screen visitors to prisoners before admission to the visits room. Prisoners entering or leaving the visits room are subject to either a rub-down or full search; the latter requires removal of clothing. CCTV operates in all visits rooms, and includes the use of new CCTV equipment at Maghaberry. Supervisory staff patrol the visits room with modern, discreet communication links to the CCTV operator. Searching takes place regularly throughout establishments including active search dogs trained to detect secreted drugs.</p>
	<p pid="c.217W.2/2">This year NIPS introduced new procedures for management of prisoners' private cash. Co-operation between NIPS and PSNI has increased with a better flow of intelligence and targeted searching of visitors and accommodation areas. Revised Prison Rules will be introduced by the year end to facilitate mandatory drug testing of all prisoners using new saliva testing procedures to replace the current urine test. Governors will have delegated authority to ban visitors and impose closed visits on prisoners and visitors who abuse the visiting arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.221W.11/1">There is extensive research on car parking. In May 2007 for example the Department of Communities and Local Government published residential car parking research, which addressed the availability of on- and off-street parking in residential developments and the efficiency of allocating spaces to dwellings. It concluded that well-designed on-street parking in residential areas can make a valuable and flexible contribution to the overall supply of parking.</p>

	<p pid="c.222W.2/1">The current rail environmental benefit procurement scheme has two components that provide revenue support for rail freight based upon the amount of lorries removed from the roads. The Department for Transport has reviewed both of the rail freight support schemes over the last two years. Consequently we are continuing with the well established freight facilities grant scheme and have secured European state aids clearance for the introduction of a revised revenue support scheme from April next year called mode shift revenue support. Both of the schemes are designed to help rail freight compete more effectively with road transport and to increase the quantity of goods transported by rail.</p>

The ongoing review has already led to a number of proposed regulatory amendments, on which we are currently consulting.

	<p pid="c.226W.9/1">The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July</phrase> is the most systematic response to climate change of any major developed economy, setting out the Government's approach to securing reductions from the agriculture sector. It challenges the English farming industry to develop a voluntary plan to deliver three million tonnes CO2 of emissions savings from livestock and fertiliser&mdash;which will reduce emissions in English agriculture by about 10 per cent. by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.9/2">To achieve this, Government will be supporting farmers to take action by ensuring they have access to a comprehensive low-carbon advisory service; continuing our support for Anaerobic Digestion; improving the national inventory for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farming; and working with the Carbon Trust to make farming businesses eligible for its interest-free loans for low-carbon activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.9/3">The Plan commits Government to review progress on the voluntary plan by 2012 and intervene if the voluntary plan is failing to deliver. Government will publish its options for intervention in its Carbon Reduction Delivery Plan in spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.9/4">We have also worked closely with the dairy sector to produce a Dairy Roadmap to develop opportunities to mitigate climate change impacts and assess the positive benefits to the landscape and biodiversity of cattle husbandry. A Beef and Lamb Roadmap is now being developed by the industry with DEFRA support and the newly formed Pig Meat Supply Chain Task Force will be working with the industry's Pig Environment Partnership to deliver similar roadmap for the pig sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.9/5">Agriculture can have both positive and negative impacts on biodiversity. These effects are monitored through a variety of sources. These include the Farmland Birds Index, which represents a general indicator of the state of the farmed environment, research and analyses through the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory and the continued development of Environmental Accounts for Agriculture. The aim is to quantify and value the full range of impacts using the best available evidence from a range of sources to help inform policy responses.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.9/6">Policy mechanisms include regulation, incentives, as well as providing information and advice to farmers on how to improve their environmental performance. Earlier this year there was a review of baseline standards in cross compliance that farmers have to meet as a condition of the Single Payment Scheme. Cross compliance protects a variety of habitat features and in future will place greater emphasis on protecting water resources and water quality. These standards are complemented by our agri-environment schemes such as Environmental Stewardship which reward farmers for positive habitat management.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.9/7">Environmental Stewardship has recently been reviewed resulting in new options to further encourage farmers to manage their land in an environmentally friendly way and an overarching climate change theme. In particular there will be a new component specifically designed for uplands farmers which will be launched in January 2010. Our agri-environment schemes have been popular and successful with 65.8 per cent. of farmland currently under agreement. Natural England has a target to increase the coverage of the schemes to 70 per cent. by March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.229W.5/1">In December 2002, the Government noted that there was a need for a Neighbour Noise strategy to compliment the support that had been received for developing an Ambient Noise strategy. Subsequently, it was agreed that it would be sensible to combine the proposed ambient and neighbourhood strategies into a single strategy addressing environmental, neighbour and neighbourhood noise.</p>
	<p pid="c.229W.5/2">However, 2002 was also the year that the environmental noise directive (END) became law, and its implementation has had to be the Department's main focus of activity regarding noise. In meeting the requirements of the END, we are now progressing noise action plans, and this is helping to refine existing policy as evidence on the effects of noise continues to emerge.</p>
	<p pid="c.229W.5/3">The Government are in the process of consolidating, for all sources of noise, their longer term noise management policies, some of which can be found in the draft noise action plans, and determining how these could be best delivered.</p>

	<p pid="c.231W.8/1">The Defence Dental Services did not introduce any new mobile dental facilities for military personnel in December 2008. Where fixed dental surgeries are not available, the three armed forces dental branches have used portable dental units for the last 30 years or more. They are mainly employed on land operations or on smaller HM ships that do not routinely carry a dental team. The Royal Naval Dental Services have also used mobile dental surgeries in HM dockyards for many years. These mobile dental facilities are currently being refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="c.231W.8/2">More generally, the Service Personnel Command Paper (Cm 7424) noted the problems encountered by service families in accessing dental services, and stated that the Government would address these in a variety of ways, including the provision of mobile services. However, when considering a suitable location for trialling mobile services, it became clear that there was a lack of information about the real extent of difficulties in getting access to dentistry, and most reported cases could be resolved through advice and advocacy from local service and welfare organisations. The Ministry of Defence and the Department of Health concluded there was no requirement for a trial at this time, but work continues to gather evidence of any geographical problems, and should the need for mobile services become apparent this solution will be reconsidered.</p>

Each base has personnel who, as part of their duties, are responsible for the welfare of service personnel and their families. Facilities available include a wide range of services from HIVE information services, dedicated sports and recreational facilities, community centres, cr&egrave;ches to numerous social and special interest clubs.</p>

	<p pid="c.238W.5/2">The Ministry of Defence takes its responsibilities towards the environment very seriously. Prior to Exercise Joint Warrior, the Royal Navy consulted widely with interested parties such as non-governmental organisations, local authorities, various national rural agencies, and landowners. During the planning of the exercise, environmental impact assessments were conducted for all potentially damaging activities. All participants were given extensive briefs on safety and environmental considerations which specified that environmental awareness takes priority over military training objectives, and a precautionary approach is adopted to all aspects of the exercise which may have an environmental impact. Ships remain ready to take immediate action to minimise any risk. Before any active sonar transmissions, a full environmental impact assessment is conducted, look-outs are posted, and equipment is used to listen for marine mammal activity. If marine mammals are detected sonar transmissions are terminated or modified in order to minimise the risk. There are also continual monitoring procedures that ensure compliance with international pollution prevention standards and crews are also trained to manage onboard incidents to minimise environmental impacts. No environmental impact has been reported following the most recent Joint Warrior exercise.</p>

As a mandatory grant, Communities and Local Government expects these important services to be prioritised and delivered within the legal time frame. The regulations that govern the disabled facilities grant programme are clear about how long anyone should wait for a grant and are triggered by the receipt of a valid disabled facilities grant application. A decision on whether or not to award the grant must be made within six months. The grant must then be paid by the authority either on completion of the works or by a date specified in the decision letter, whichever is sooner. That date must be no longer than 12 months from the date of the application for grant.</p>

Under the same legislation, the multipliers will also be adjusted to ensure that the overall tax yield does not increase as a result of the 2010 revaluation. The September 2009 RPI of -1.4 per cent will exert a downward pressure on the multipliers and on 2010-11 rates bills, reducing the overall tax yield in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.245W.0/3">The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more by ensuring the share of the national rates bill paid by any one business reflects changes over time in the value of their property relative to others. The 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.245W.0/4">Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation. The Government intend to put in place a &pound;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases.

PPS3 asks local authorities to develop residential parking policies for their areas taking account of expected levels of car ownership, the importance of promoting good design and the need to use land efficiently. This has been deliberately devolved to local authorities so they can make the right choices for their local areas, in consultation with their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.0/2">The flexibility given to local authorities in PPS3 is consistent with the objectives of PPG13, to set their own residential parking policies taking account of the expected levels of car ownership, the importance of promoting good design and the need to use land efficiently.</p>

	<p pid="c.254W.2/2">The UK remains deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Burma. It is evident from the latest Report to the General Assembly by the UN Rapporteur, Mr. Tomas Ojea Quintana, that systematic and appalling abuses remain unchecked and that arbitrary arrests and the sentencing of opposition figures to long prison terms continues.</p>
	<p pid="c.254W.2/3">The most prominent example is that of Aung San Suu Kyi, but his report also draws attention to the plight of the more than 2,100 other political prisoners who remain in detention. EU sanctions have been in place against Burma since 1996, but following the sentence imposed on Aung San Suu Kyi on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-11">11 August</phrase> this year, the EU agreed to a further set of sanctions intended specifically to target the Burmese regime's economic interests, including a travel ban on those members of the judiciary responsible for the verdict.</p>
	<p pid="c.254W.2/4">These measures came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-14">14 August 2009</phrase> and can leave the regime in no doubt about our determination to see real democracy established and human rights respected in Burma. Their objective is to target those individuals and entities that are most closely linked to the regime's misrule, rather than punishing the Burmese population as a whole.</p>

The figure for this year should therefore be treated with caution.<br/> <sup>(2 )</sup>Provisional information.<br/> <i> Notes:</i><br/>  1. Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/>  2. Alcohol-related admissions<br/>  The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br/>  Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/>  Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br/>  Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/>  Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/>  Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/>  Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br/>  Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/>  Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/>  Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/>  Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/>  Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/>  Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/>  3. Ungrossed data<br/>  Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/>  4. Finished admission episodes<br/>  A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/>  5. Data quality<br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/>  6. Assessing growth through time<br/>  HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/>  Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/>  Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/>  7. Assignment of episodes to years<br/>  Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.263W.3/1">Any person who wishes to receive national health service primary medical services can apply to a local general practice to register as a patient or as a temporary resident. However, under their contracts with their primary care trust the general practice can, where they have reasonable non-discriminatory grounds, decline an application, for example if they are not accepting new patients or because the prospective patient does not live within the practice boundary. Where an application is declined, the general practice must nevertheless provide as a term of their contracts any immediately necessary treatment for a period of up to 14 days free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.263W.3/2">Entitlement to free NHS hospital treatment is based on lawful and settled residence in the United Kingdom. Illegal immigrants are therefore subject to the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended, which set out a number of exemption from charge categories. Illegal immigrants are not exempt from charges except for certain services that are free to all, including treatment given inside an accident and emergency department or for certain infectious diseases.</p>
	<p pid="c.263W.3/3">Treatment which is clinically considered to be immediately necessary must never be withheld or delayed, although charges will still apply to illegal immigrants. Further, treatment that is clinically considered urgent enough that it cannot await the patient's return home, must also be provided, although hospitals should attempt to secure payment during the period before treatment is provided. Non-urgent treatment that can await the person's return home should not be given unless payment is received in advance.</p>

	<p pid="c.264W.8/3">We are increasing the availability of CBT in primary care through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme (IAPT). Our plan is to have trained 3,600 more therapists who will help to provide 900,000 more people with access to psychological therapies by 2010-11. Of those completing treatment 50 per cent. are expected to recover.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.8/4">All IAPT services are required to collect routine clinical outcome data at every session, so that clinical teams can evaluate the effectiveness of the service and so that patients can see and discuss their progress with their therapist. The data also enables primary care trusts and practice based commissioners to commission psychological therapy services for the outcomes which they are expected to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.8/5">New IAPT services collect the IAPT minimum data set, and a national data standard is currently being developed to enable the national collation of this data by 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.268W.5/1">Advances in technology and health care expertise have led to increasing survival rates of very premature babies over the last 20 years. Over the past decade, survival has improved dramatically for babies born at 26 weeks of gestation and above so that now over 80 per cent. survive.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.5/2">The EPICure Study (led by the university of Nottingham, Department of Child Health) was established in 1995 to determine the chances of survival and later health status by following up children who were born in the United Kingdom and Ireland at less than 26 weeks gestational age during a 10-month period in that year. This is now an ongoing study, which it is hoped will not only show survival and rates of disability but also identify factors at birth, which could give an indication as to the long-term outcome for the survivors.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.5/3">A new study, EPICure 2, covers all babies born in England at 26 weeks of gestation or less during 2006. This study will demonstrate how effective advances in neonatal care have been since the first study in 1995. Preliminary findings, published in May 2008, found that babies born above 24 and 25 weeks of gestation were significantly more likely to survive in 1995 compared with 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.274W.6/2">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is aware that its staff in post figures do not reflect the economically active population of Northern Ireland in regard to community background. These figures show that the Protestant community is under-represented within HMRC's work force. In light of this, the Department has sought both the advice and agreement of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (the Commission) in the drafting of the Department's 2009 Northern Ireland Affirmative Action Plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.6/3">The plan, recently agreed by the Commission, aims to ensure fair participation of all sections of the community in HMRC's work force through fair and transparent employment practices and a range of outreach measures, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.6/4" class="indent">All vacancies for employment are advertised widely, ensuring that newspapers read mainly by the Protestant community are included.</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.6/5" class="indent">Job advertisements for all posts will continue to include a statement welcoming applications from the Protestant community.</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.6/6" class="indent">Where jobs and benefits offices are used, advertisements include a welcoming statement for members of the Protestant community and are circulated to other offices in the catchment area. The response to each such request is monitored.</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.6/7" class="indent">We have links with schools from the Protestant community in an effort to attract applicants from that community and to offer work experience to trainees.</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.6/8">The Department continues to benefit from the involvement of the Commission in the implementation and review of the action plan, and will report on progress to the Commission in January 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.277W.0/1">The United Kingdom has made clear that it wishes to see global emissions reductions consistent with limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius. The UK has committed to reducing its emission by 80 per cent. on 1990 levels by 2050. This is consistent with the EU's commitment to reduce its emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2020. The EU is prepared to increase this to a 30 per cent. reduction in the context of a global agreement in Copenhagen, provided the other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reductions and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities. In this context the UK is calling for developed countries to set mid-term emissions reduction targets that, collectively, would reduce developed country emissions by 25-40 per cent. on 1990 levels; and is calling for developing countries to take significant action to reduce their emissions growth by 15-30 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2020. The UK has made these representations in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, other international forums including the Major Economies Forum, G8 and G20, and in bilateral contacts.</p>

	<p pid="c.283W.2/1">Since 1998 when antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) were introduced we have introduced a wide range of tools and powers to tackle antisocial behaviour. These measures are being used by practitioners to bring relief to communities across the country. Local agencies decide on the most appropriate intervention to use in each case. The overall aim is to tackle antisocial behaviour at the earliest opportunity with the most appropriate tool.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.2/2">Three independent reports including the Home Affairs Select Committee report (2005), the Audit Commission report (May 2006) and the NAO report (December 2006) have confirmed our approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is working. The NAO report found that 65 per cent. of people desisted from ASB after one intervention and nine out of 10 had desisted after three interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.2/3">The Home Office has commissioned research into the comparative effectiveness of all the antisocial behaviour tools and powers which is due for publication next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.283W.5/1">Neighbourhood policing is central to providing a police service that is responsive to local crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) concerns. Since 2002 we have invested over &pound;1 billion to ensure that there is now a neighbourhood policing team in every neighbourhood, including over 13,500 officers and 16,000 PCSOs, with a range of tools and powers to deal with ASB. These teams engage with their local communities to understand their concerns&mdash;which will usually include ASB&mdash;and work with partners to address them. Between March 2008 and March 2009 public confidence that police and local agencies are dealing with local crime and ASB matters has increased from 45 per cent. to 49 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.5/2">In December 2008, we introduced the policing pledge, which outlines commitments that the police service have made to the public, including minimum response times, holding monthly meetings to understand local concerns, providing monthly updates on action taken to deal with those concerns and visiting victims of crime. I welcome the recent inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) of the delivery of the pledge, in each police force ensuring that the public know how well their force is doing. Police authorities and forces are now working to respond to the challenge this has set them.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.5/3">The Government are clear that there is more to be done. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-13">13 October</phrase> I announced a package of measures to improve the collective response to ASB. This includes extra support for victims of antisocial behaviour and a crackdown on those that breach ASBOs and new local minimum service standards agreed with the public that outline what they should expect from councils, police and social landlords to deal with intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.5/4">In 62 priority CDRPs, support and advice will be provided from a Home Office regional delivery manager, supported by the ASB action squad of expert practitioners, to make sure that the police, councils and housing are working together effectively to tackle ASB. All 62 partnerships have had face to face meetings, five partnerships have already been visited to begin the assessment process and the remaining 57 are due to be visited in the next six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.5/5">The forthcoming Policing White Paper will set out the next steps on neighbourhood policing.</p>

	<p pid="c.284W.2/1">Breach of an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) is a criminal offence. Currently whenever a child is in court convicted of a criminal offence, the court must consider making a parenting order where the court's assessment is that this is in the interests of preventing a repetition of antisocial behaviour by the child.</p>
	<p pid="c.284W.2/2">We are proposing to bring in legislation to make a parenting order mandatory when a child (aged 10 to 15) breaches an ASBO. In tandem with this we are also proposing that children being considered for an ASBO receive a parenting needs assessment.</p>

	<p pid="c.288W.2/1">The national DNA database (NDNAD) is constantly changing as profiles are added and deleted. It is not possible to produce information retrospectively on the state of the database in past years, unless this was collected by statistics produced at the time. The information sought on the number of those on the NDNAD by the ethnicity, gender and age groups specified is available for <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> and is provided in table 1. Some information is also available for <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, and is provided in table 2. The information sought is not available for years before 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.2/2">The tables show the number of profiles held, which is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because some profiles are replicates i.e. more than one profile is held for one individual. This may occur if, for example, an individual gives different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests. As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, the replication rate on the NDNAD as a whole was 13.5 per cent. The tables show data on profiles loaded by all police forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.2/3">It is not possible to calculate accurately the proportion of members of ethnic groups in the population as a whole who are on the NDNAD because the data held on the NDNAD are not directly comparable with census population data. The NDNAD does not hold self-reported ethnicity data on arrested persons who have a DNA sample taken, but on their 'ethnic appearance'. The ethnic appearance data is based on the judgment of the police officer and is recorded for police intelligence purposes to assist in subsequent identification. It uses six broad ethnic categories (plus 'unknown') whereas census data is based on 16 ethnic groups self-reported by individuals.</p>

The spend on future development projects in the 2006-07 financial year amounted to &pound;30.9 million. The costs accounted for as future development projects in the 2007-08 financial year were &pound;61.7 million, &pound;81.5 million in 2008-09 and approximately &pound;42 million for the period April to September 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.296W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/2">Straightforward passports must be issued within 10 working days of receipt of the application. Since rationalising the European network and creating three centres of excellence, 96 per cent. of straightforward applications have been issued within this target.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/3">The cost of passports both in the UK and overseas increased with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-03">3 September 2009</phrase>. The overseas fees are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/4" class="indent">32-page adult passport: &pound;124.50</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/5" class="indent">32-page child (under-16) passport: &pound;79.50</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/6" class="indent">48-page 'jumbo' passport: &pound;150.50</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/7" class="indent">Emergency passport: &pound;69.00</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/8" class="indent">Emergency travel document/temporary passport: &pound;89.00.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/9">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issues fewer than 400,000 passports a year from about 60 locations and under HM Treasury rules must recover the full costs of issuing through the passport fee.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/10">The passport fees are calculated on the basis of the cost of staff, accommodation and overheads involved proportionate to the average time taken worldwide to perform the service. The calculations are carefully scrutinised by the Treasury, approved by the Privy Council and laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/11">Fees are set in London in sterling and collected overseas in various currencies depending on the location of the service. The rates of exchange used to calculate the local fee rates allows each overseas Post a small variance to ensure that, in countries where the exchange rate dramatically changes on a daily basis, the embassy does not have to amend its rates daily. The rates of exchange are scrutinised regularly to ensure that Posts do not exceed this.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/12">For passport applicants applying by post, the average cost of courier delivery varies from country to country and ranges from &pound;7 to &pound;40 depending on location. Customers living in remote locations tend to have to pay more.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/13">We have a consular business target that 90 per cent. of applications are issued within this processing target. The time it takes the courier to return the new passport to the customer, which in Europe averages two to three working days, is not part of the 10-day target.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-10-27c.296188.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-10-27c.300W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" speakername="Diana Johnson" colnum="300W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091027/text/91027w0021.htm#091027102003377">
	<p pid="c.300W.6/1">There are two types of sponsorship payments for academies: &quot;Traditional Procurement&quot; and &quot;Endowment Model&quot;. In the case of &quot;Traditional Procurement Academies&quot;, the timing of the receipt of cash sponsorship varies from academy to academy and is agreed as part of the funding agreement between the Department and the academy. In the case of the &quot;Endowment Model&quot;, receipts commence only after the academy has opened, and usually over a period of five years. Payments are not required on an annual basis and the question has therefore been answered as set out below.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.6/2">The answer contains two tables. The first, headed &quot;Traditional Procurement Academies&quot; shows for each academy where sponsorship is a contribution to capital costs, the total pledged, the amount for which the Department has evidence of receipt, and the amount still expected. In some cases further sponsorship payments may have already been received by the academy trust but not yet reported to the Department. The second table, headed &quot;Endowment Sponsorship Academies&quot; shows for each academy where sponsorship is in the form of contributions to an endowment fund, the amounts pledged, the amounts reported so far to the Department as received and the amount still expected. As with the first category, there may be cases where further sponsorship has already been received by the academy trust but not yet reported to the Department.</p>

	<p pid="c.305W.2/1">Local authorities have discretion to provide financial support. There is no requirement for a local authority to provide financial support to an individual family. However, where an assessment of a person's need for financial support is made and it is decided that a person has such needs, the local authority must decide whether to provide the support and in making this decision they must act in accordance with regulations and must act reasonably. Financial support can be paid to help secure a suitable special guardianship arrangement where such an arrangement cannot be readily made because of a financial obstacle.</p>

It gives local authorities powers to require institutions within the FE sector to provide a specified young person, aged 16-19, with education suitable to their requirements. This will be particularly important within the context of the forthcoming raised participation age in supporting young people to fulfil their duties to participate.</p>
	<p pid="c.309W.6/2">In exercising these powers, we would expect local authorities to consider both the individual needs of the learner and that of the institution.

It is expected that the statutory guidance made under clause 44 will include guidance on these specific considerations. This guidance will be subject to full public consultation prior to local authorities assuming their responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.311W.3/14">Information on nursery school places per head of population has not been included. This is because data on places available are not collected; only data on places filled are available and as children can access their free entitlement across different areas; part time equivalent places are not on a comparable basis with the population figures. Population figures at this level of disaggregation are also not as reliable as at the national level.</p>

It also has wider powers concerning the conduct of criminal investigations and as a prosecuting authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.322W.2/1">As part of their target of getting 1 million people doing more sport by 2012-13, Sport England includes an emphasis on the need to encourage women and girls to participate in sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.2/2">Over the period 2009-12 Sport England will invest &pound;480 million in the national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport to deliver increases in participation within their individual sports. While Sport England has not set specific targets for NGBs on increasing participation among particular groups of people, funding levels for the sports were in part assessed on the strength of their strategic plans to deliver on increased participation amongst women, black and minority ethnic groups, and disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.2/3">Furthermore, Sport England, acting as a centre of best practice and working with their national partners, are committed to continuing to help NGBs deliver and to push them to do as much as possible to deliver for these groups. In the particular case of women and girls, funded and supported by Sport England, the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation is actively engaged with all of the NGBs, working in a consultancy capacity to advise the individual NGBs on best practice for increasing women's participation in sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.2/4">For the NGBs, developing the girls' and women's game, disability sport, and reaching out to diverse communities is not an optional extra but a vital part of what they are required to do.

	<p pid="c.322W.5/1">One of the key ambitions at Sport England is to help partners such as governing bodies to deliver sporting opportunities to as many people as possible, including women and girls. Through Sport England's investment process each national governing body of sport (NGB) was asked to produce a Whole Sport Plan outlining the ways in which they intend to drive up participation within their specific sport from 2009-13. Funding levels for the sports were in part assessed on the strength of their strategic plans to deliver on increased participation among women, black and minority ethnic groups, and disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.5/2">To support NGBs in the design and delivery of provision to encourage women and girls to participate in sport, NGBs now receive tailored support from the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF). Funded and supported by Sport England, the WSFF is actively engaged with each of the NGBs, working in a consultancy capacity to advise the individual NGBs on best practice for increasing women's participation in sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.5/3">Sport England is also ensuring that new funding streams, such as the Themed Rounds and the Innovation Fund, support the development of women's participation in sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.5/4">The Sport Unlimited programme, a Sport England funded initiative, which aims to increase opportunities for children and young people aged five to 19 to participate regularly in sport, also targets girls to take part. The latest statistics show that 49 per cent. of girls versus 51 per cent. of boys have so far taken up this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.5/5">As with Sport England, all Youth Sport Trust programmes are inclusive, although a number have been specifically developed as tools to support the work of schools to increase girls' participation, involvement and enjoyment of physical education and sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.5/6">GirlsActive, launched in 2006, is an initiative designed to empower teenage girls to enjoy more sporting activity on their own terms. Seven centres have now been established across the country, which are driving the work around increasing girls' participation within each of their own regions. The regional centres are a joint approach between the Sports College and the School Sport Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.5/7">The Sports College lead on high quality PE and curriculum innovation work and the School Sport Partnership drive the implementation and innovation of an agreed regional delivery plan to increase girls' participation across the region. Over 20,000 girls have been reached since September 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.324W.2/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) drew up an action plan in response to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman's 22 recommendations following Mr. Baranovsky's death in 2006 at HMP Rye Hill. 18 of the recommendations have been fully addressed, including those to do with further investigations. The remaining four were referred to Primecare, the healthcare provider at the time of Mr. Baranovsky's death, who have failed to respond. Following the death, the contract with Primecare was terminated.</p>

The impact reduces after 2009 because there are fewer and fewer prisoners sentenced under the 1991 Act, which was replaced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>

	<p pid="c.328W.3/1">Section 21 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act deals with &quot;Credit for period of remand on bail: terms of imprisonment and detention&quot;. It allows the courts discretion to direct that up to half the number of days spent on tagged bail will count as time served against a subsequent custodial sentence. The credit is made on a similar, but not identical basis as remand to custody. It was expected that this measure would have no impact on the number or length of sentences given by the courts.</p>

	<p pid="c.328W.6/1">The Ministry of Justice was formed in May 2007 to take forward the work of the Department for Constitutional Affairs together with significant additional responsibilities transferring from the Home Office. These included the National Offender Management Service, which covers the Prison and Probation Services, and the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. The figures in the following table therefore relate to the Department for Constitutional Affairs where the financial years fall prior to 2007-08 and the Ministry of Justice on or after the 2007-08 year.</p>
	<p pid="c.328W.6/2">The nature of the Ministry of Justice's activities is such that it does not engage in significant levels of advertising on initiatives. More than 95 per cent. of departmental advertising spend is on recruitment, mainly by Human Resources (HQ and NOMS). To provide information for individual recruitment advertising campaigns would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.328W.6/3" class="italic"> National Offender Management Service (NOMS)</p>
	<p pid="c.328W.6/4">NOMS, which has responsibility for the prison and probation systems, has spent the following non-recruitment related amounts on advertising, external publicity and broadcasting. Amounts relating to specific advertising initiatives cannot be separately quantified.</p>

	<p pid="c.328W.6/17">The expenditure on recruitment for the NOMS Agency in 2008-09 is &pound;3,409,968, mainly on recruitment of prison officers. This figure may include other recruitment expenditure not considered to be publicity and advertising. Work to split out publicity and advertising spend from the total recruitment amount would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.328W.6/18">The stated figure for NOMS excludes expenditure by the 42 local probation boards and trusts whose records are held locally and could only be collated at disproportionate cost. A one-off exercise undertaken in 2007-08 found that expenditure on advertising and promotion by local probation boards and trusts was &pound;58,264. There are no current plans to repeat this information-gathering exercise for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="c.328W.6/19" class="italic"> Headquarters and other agencies</p>
	<p pid="c.328W.6/20">For the rest of the department, the Ministry's central accounting records do not distinguish different types of advertising expenditure. To determine what expenditure relates to requires retrieval and examination of individual invoices and records held locally across the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.328W.6/21">Advertising, publicity and communications expenditure over the last five years is set out with some of the expenditure for advertising in recruitment. However, not all of the expenditure on recruitment advertising is included since it is not separately quantifiable from the accounts. The Criminal Justice Group, which is part of the Ministry's headquarters, was formed from various Home Office functions transferred to the Ministry in April 2007. It is not possible to extract historical information for the Criminal Justice Group from the Home Office's records prior to 2008-09, meaning that the figures for Headquarters are not directly comparable between the financial years.</p>

The procedure to be followed to obtain an injunction is specified in the relevant rules of court. None of these rules refer to parliamentary privilege. Whether or not an injunction should be issued and, if so, the terms in which it will be issued are governed by the general law of England and Wales. This includes the qualified privilege to report parliamentary proceedings and the absolute privilege enjoyed by Members of Parliament in respect of parliamentary proceedings. The Bill of Rights provides that the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament may not be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.</p>

Witnesses in fear or distress of testifying may also receive assistance from special measures and when determining such applications the court must take into account a number of factors including the age of the witness.
