With the Burmese military rulers' failure to deliver any tangible outcomes despite the good work by the office of the UN Secretary-General, we will continue to consider options for further Security Council action with like-minded partners in New York.</p>

	<p pid="c.18W.5/1">The UN published its report on the Somali Region of Ethiopia in September 2007. The UN has not published a further report since. We welcomed the Ethiopian Government's acceptance of the UN assessment team's appraisal and we continue to urge the Ethiopian Government to adhere to its commitments in relation to the report&mdash;opening-up of trade routes, lifting restrictions on movement, allowing food aid to reach all parts of the region and allowing non-governmental organisations greater access. However, we continue to be concerned at the risk of further human suffering and therefore look forward to full implementation of the report's findings. The UK continues to raise this with the Government of Ethiopia at regular intervals. My noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown raised this issue when he met Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in late January. Most recently, our ambassador in Addis Ababa discussed ways to improve the situation in the Somali region with the Ethiopian Foreign Minister in March.</p>

	<p pid="c.20W.5/1">We believe that the complex issues in Papua can best be resolved through peaceful dialogue between the people of Papua, their elected representatives and the central Government of Indonesia. The dialogue is on-going. Indonesian Vice President Kalla, along with a team of Ministers, visited Papua most recently in February to discuss economic and social development with representatives of the Papuan people. Papuan leaders regularly visit Jakarta. The Indonesian President has committed his government to improving the situation in Papua, which we welcome. Governor Suebu, of Papua province, is pressing ahead with his development programmes, underpinned by the significant financial resources now being directed to Papua as a result of its special autonomy status.</p>
	<p pid="c.20W.5/2">We continue to encourage all sides to maintain a meaningful dialogue that focuses on implementing fully the existing special autonomy legislation. We judge that this is the best way to ensure the long-term stability and development of Papua and its people.</p>

	<p pid="c.20W.5/4">Our embassy in Jakarta follows the situation in Papua closely and is in regular contact with human rights organisations, non-governmental organisations and academics working in the region. Embassy staff also visit Papua regularly, most recently from 15 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February 2008</phrase>. While there, they held discussions with local officials, non-governmental organisations and representatives of religious organisations. The Department for International Development (DFID) is providing funding for four development advisers to the Governor of Papua. Their work focuses on poverty alleviation, public finance and infrastructure. DFID is also funding HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment activities in Papua, as well as focusing on improving forest governance livelihoods to address poverty reduction and deforestation in Papua. We continue to engage with Papuan leaders on a range of issues, including conflict prevention, and we fund several projects in Papua, including human rights training for the police.</p>

The problem tends to arise particularly where the biodiesel does not meet the relevant fuel quality standards. The issue is not a new one: biodiesel blends have been used for many years by bus operators in the UK and other countries. It can generally be addressed through good housekeeping practices, such as regular tank cleaning, and by the use of various fuel additives. These are matters for the transport fuel industry to resolve: commercial bus operators and others should ensure that fuel quality requirements are covered in any fuel supply contracts.</p>

	<p pid="c.32W.3/2">The Council of Ministers considered an earlier introduction date than <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase> for the new requirements but concluded that the cost of converting older vehicles would be disproportionate to their remaining life.

This will cover the aims of the programme, eligibility criteria and the application process.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.4/2">The programme is also being promoted through presentations and exhibitions, and through close working partnerships developed with the major disability groups such as the Royal National Institute for Blind people, Royal National Institute for Deaf people and MIND.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.4/3">Articles have appeared in external publications such as 'Disability Wales' and the National Spinal Association magazine illustrating how Access to Work can practically support disabled people into paid employment. Additionally, Jobcentre Plus includes information on Access to Work in internally produced magazines such as 'Inspire'. This magazine, which is targeted at job seekers, is available, along with other leaflets on Access to Work, in all Jobcentre Plus offices. The magazine 'Engage', also produced by Jobcentre Plus and aimed at employers, regularly carries information about Access to Work, along with other Jobcentre Plus services.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.4/4">Information about Access to Work is available on the Jobcentre Plus and Directgov websites. Directgov as a source of information about Jobcentre Plus services for disabled people is widely publicised, for example, in the latest issue of 'Ability Needs' magazine. Disability employment advisers, who are often the gateway to Access to Work, are regularly in contact with small to medium sized employers locally and will raise awareness of Access to Work when appropriate.</p>

For example, we received over 450 formal written submissions to our recent Welfare Reform Green Paper consultation, but this represents only a small part of the picture, because in addition we received over 2,000 posts in two internet-based discussion forums, and a large amount of face-to-face input at a range of different meetings. Whereas, for our more specialist, and often limited, consultations in the Private Pensions area typically between 50 and 100 responses are received.</p>

In line with all civil service Departments DWP produced its own plan and targets for the period from 2005 to 2008. As well as its higher target for the SCS, the Department also set targets for the grades below the SCS. The March 2008 DWP targets and figures are in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="c.41W.6/14">The figures are based on the proportion of staff who have voluntarily declared themselves as being disabled. However, we are aware that not all disabled staff declare their disability for departmental records, and the true figure may be higher than the figures shown. For example, the 2008 DWP Staff Survey (which is completed anonymously), showed that 13.6 per cent. of respondents considered themselves to have a long standing health condition or disability.</p>
	<p pid="c.41W.6/15">The roll out of a new computer system has meant a more accurate record of the numbers of disabled people working within the Department who made a declaration. As we rolled out the new system we asked each member of staff to check the personal information we held about them and to declare whether they considered themselves to be disabled. A further recent communications exercise has also emphasised the importance of individuals providing this information, and we will be repeating the request for people to declare their status later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.41W.6/16">Although we have achieved good levels of diversity across the Department, including those for disabled people, we aim to improve this position and details of actions are in Department for Work and Pensions Race, Disability and Gender Equality Schemes 2008-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.41W.6/17">The Cabinet Office is currently drawing up a new diversity strategy that will build on the achievements and lessons learnt from the 10 Point Plan. Once this has been agreed the Department will be setting further targets to 2011 and the strategy for achieving them.</p>

	<p pid="c.53W.0/1">MOD pandemic influenza planning assumptions on overall clinical attack rates are based on modelling provided by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), which underpin the National Planning Framework. In 2006 this accorded with the national plan that 25 to 33 per cent. of the armed forces overall may be affected during the course of a pandemic. However, in line with the revised National Planning Framework issued in 2007, which raised the upper potential impact to 50 per cent., our planning is being adjusted to reflect this higher potential clinical attack rate.</p>

	<p pid="c.58W.5/1">The cost of transporting heavy equipment varies considerably according to the method employed. The means of transportation is decided on a number of criteria, primarily when the equipment is ready for transport and its required delivery date.</p>
	<p pid="c.58W.5/2">For Iraq the approximate cost of transporting one Mastiff vehicle by commercial heavy lift aircraft is &pound;41,600.</p>
	<p pid="c.58W.5/3">For Afghanistan the approximate cost of transporting one Mastiff vehicle by commercial heavy lift aircraft is &pound;55,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.58W.5/4">Bulldog deploy to theatre using military shipping. Using a standard calculation for operating costs including the costs of fuel, port handling charges and Suez Transit (and excluding fixed costs such as wages and cost of ownership) the cost of moving one Bulldog is &pound;717. This figure assumes that the vessel carried a full load of cargo which was the case for both of the shipping consignments in this case.</p>

	<p pid="c.63W.2/1">Since the introduction of a grant cap in May 2007 for household installations monthly applications, including for solar PV and micro-wind, have decreased relative to before May 2007. However, we have seen a more even spread across the various technologies. There are potentially a number of factors contributing to this lower uptake of household grants. However, we believe that the extension to the household stream of LCBP, relaxation of planning requirements and wider promotion of the programme should help to boost take-up.</p>

Officials consider not only the merits of the individual case but also the most effective means of achieving a safe and successful return. While there is no policy not to return to any country or territory, our ability to return may of course from time to time temporarily be affected by legal challenge. This is currently the case with Zimbabwe, where we have undertaken to the High Court that we will not enforce the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe until the current country guidance litigation is resolved, and that remains the case.</p>

For the first time ever, every household across England and Wales has access to a visible and dedicated police team to help solve local problems. Announced on the same day, the 'Name in Every Neighbourhood' campaign aims to raise awareness and understanding of neighbourhood policing among the public and ensure they know how to find the contact details of their local team and know how to engage with them.</p>
	<p pid="c.74W.5/3">Neighbourhood policing teams focus on engaging with their local community and provide high visibility, reassurance policing in order to deal with the issues that matter most to the local community. Partnership working is a key element of neighbourhood policing and locally identified issues will be addressed by neighbourhood policing teams in partnership with other community safety partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.74W.5/4">The Government have committed to making consistent, monthly, local information on crime available throughout the country. This will include data on crime and community safety issues, such as information about what local agencies are doing to tackle their community safety priorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.87W.0/2">When the UK National DNA Database (NDNAD) was set up in 1995, the SGM profiling system was used. This looked at six areas of DNA, plus a gender marker. The probability of an adventitious (chance) match between full SGM DNA profiles of unrelated individuals is of the order of one in 50 million. As the NDNAD grew in size, instances did come to light where different individuals were found to have the same SGM profile, hence the decision to change to SGM Plus in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.0/3">The quoted probability of a match between full SGM Plus DNA profiles of unrelated individuals is one in one billion (i.e. one in a thousand million).</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.0/4">The NDNAD Custodian carefully monitors replicate DMA profiles loaded to the Database, and a key reason for doing this is to identify potential adventitious matches between SGM Plus DMA profiles derived from unrelated individuals. To date, no such adventitious match has been found. This indicates the SGM Plus match probability to be significantly lower than the figure quoted&mdash;it is probably better than one in one trillion (i.e. one in a million million).</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.0/5">Safeguards against possible miscarriages of justice arising from adventitious matches operate at two levels&mdash;firstly, further investigation of matches using the SGM Plus technique, and secondly, the fact that if a person is to be charged on the basis of a DNA match, the CPS require that there must be supporting non-DNA evidence available to be used in evidence. DNA evidence is one piece of the information that the courts would require for a successful prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.0/6">Other EU states use different profiling systems and do not publish information on the likelihood of adventitious matches using these systems. However, the level of overlap between SGM Plus DNA profiles and those developed by other systems is that the discriminating power will typically be of the same order as the SGM (rather than the SGM Plus) level. It is thus extremely important that all possible opportunities are taken to improve the discriminating power associated with a match, for example by re-analysis of the sample to upgrade, the profile before any other information on the identity of a suspect nominated by a DNA match is disclosed to an overseas police authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.87W.3/1">In the building of Terminal 5 at Heathrow, the British Airports Authority (BAA) took the decision to introduce a common departure lounge (CDL). BAA were required to ensure that any immigration risks arising from the mixing of domestic and international passengers were mitigated and a working group, which includes BAA, British Airways (BA), the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) and other control agencies, has worked together since 2005 to consider appropriate mitigation measures. BAA presented a number of systems which they believed were capable of mitigating the risks to Border Security and following a number of trials, fingerprinting together with digital facial recognition comparison were identified as the most effective solution. However, to ensure that the proposed system is fully validated by the Information Commissioner, it has been agreed that the system will operate using only digital photography until such validation is given.</p>

	<p pid="c.94W.5/2">In 2005 the European Community funded a total of 16 projects under the RETURN 2005 programme. The UK was partner in four of these projects working with 12 other member states and one non-governmental organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.94W.5/3">In 2006 the European Community funded a total of 20 projects under the RETURN 2006 programme. The UK was partner in five of these projects working with seven other member states and two non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.94W.5/4">The projects we have participated in have not yet been fully evaluated, however we have mostly supported assisted voluntary return which we consider very important in the UK. Reintegration assistance helps break the cycle of migration; meaning return is more sustainable for individuals and families, and contributes indirectly to communities in the country of origin. We have also gained expertise from working with other countries on these projects.</p>

	<p pid="c.98W.8/1">Help and support is available for the families and friends of missing people from family liaison officers of the investigating police force, the voluntary sector and the National Policing Improvement Agency's (NPIA) Missing Persons Bureau (MPB).</p>

Missing People, and a number of other similar charities, work with young runaways, missing and unidentified people, their families, friends and others who are, or have been, affected by the issue of missing people.</p>
	<p pid="c.98W.8/3">Missing People is part funded by the Government (approximately &pound;700,000 this year). This service includes support, advice, guidance and practical help to the families of those who have gone missing through:</p>
	<p pid="c.98W.8/4" class="indent">a dedicated national 24-hour support helpline for families and friends of missing people;</p>

	<p pid="c.98W.8/9" class="indent">Identification&mdash;a specialist service offered by Missing People to support police, coroners, hospitals and social services to resolve cases of unidentified people (alive or dead).</p>
	<p pid="c.98W.8/10">Support is also available for families of abducted children from other charities including Reunite. Reunite provide advice, information and support to parents/guardians and family members, who have had a child abducted or who fear child abduction. Reunite also provide advice to parents who may have abducted their child as well as advising on international contact issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.98W.8/11">The MPB acts as the centre for the exchange of information connected with the search for missing people nationally and internationally. This includes the co-ordination between police forces, relevant agencies, charities and other organisations working in the field of missing people. The Bureau already works closely with Government Departments, including the Home Office and the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, has endorsed Sir Ronnie's report and expects his recommendations to form the next drive against unnecessary bureaucracy in the police service.</p>

	<p pid="c.102W.0/2">This marks a new era in policing where neighbourhood policing teams work with communities to agree local priorities for action, such as anti-social behaviour, and solve local problems.

	<p pid="c.109W.6/2">Since the phasing out of border controls in 1994, no Government have ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally and that includes illegal workers. By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately and that remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.109W.6/3">As one of the Government's 10 substantive changes to the border and immigration system in 2008 we will count in and out the majority of foreign nationals. This will build on the successes of our early testing of the e-Borders programme (Project Semaphore) which already covers over 30 million passenger movements and has led to 18,000 alerts and more than 1,500 arrests.</p>
	<p pid="c.109W.6/4">This is part of a large-scale programme of reform to border protection which also includes the global roll-out of fingerprint visas, compulsory watch-list checks for all travellers from high-risk countries before they land in Britain and ID cards for foreign nationals.</p>

	<p pid="c.112W.6/1">Jodrell Bank Observatory is owned and run by the University of Manchester. It is involved in a variety of radio astronomy activities including the e-Merlin project. E-Merlin is the development of a network of seven UK radio telescopes run by the Jodrell Bank Observatory and funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) in partnership with the North West Development Agency and the University of Manchester. The STFC has recently undertaken a review of all its existing programmes to make sure they are delivering, or will deliver, the anticipated science output, and that they continue to represent value for money. The initial results of this review have been subject to consultation with the relevant scientific communities, and STFC is currently considering the responses it has received. STFC has yet to take a decision on its future level of support for e-Merlin. However, STFC has made it clear that the e-Merlin project is part of its strategy for radio astronomy and that it is in discussion with its partners about the issues raised by the review.</p>

	<p pid="c.114W.0/1">There are around 200,000 part-time first degree undergraduates compared to around one million full-time. To estimate the cost to the public purse of giving part-time students the full-time package of support is complicated due to their diverse nature. We can give very broad estimates based on the assumptions we hold for full-time students and replicating the exact same package of support. This enables us to estimate grant costs in the region of &pound;250 million and loan costs also in the region of &pound;250 million per year. We are not able to estimate the cost to the public purse of bursaries as institutions determine the eligibility criteria and are responsible for payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.114W.0/2">These estimates assume that part-time students are identical to full-time students in every respect except they are part-time. They are highly dependent on uncertain factors such as household incomes on which student support is assessed, eligibility for and take-up of support, level of fees charged and earnings following completion of the course, all of which have been assumed the same as for full-time students. The support has not been pro-rated, but if part-time students take twice as long to complete their course compared to a full-time student the costs would be around a half.</p>
	<p pid="c.114W.0/3">This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for part-time students, in 2000-01. In 2006-07, we introduced the most generous package of financial support ever for part-time students in England. This included increasing the maximum fee grant by 27 per cent. and an above-inflation increase in the income threshold for receiving this support. The part-time package is different from the support available to full-time students because it has been designed to meet the particular needs of part-time students. Unlike full-time students, many part-time students are in full-time employment &mdash;two thirds according to the Woodley report, published at the end of 2004. That report also found that 36 per cent. of part-time students receive full fee support from their employer.</p>
	<p pid="c.114W.0/4">We must ensure that statutory student support is carefully focussed to achieve maximum benefit.</p>

	<p pid="c.116W.5/2">The STFC published its Delivery Plan on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-11">11 December 2007</phrase> following its Science Budget Allocation which amounted to an additional &pound;185 million over the CSR period and a total budget of &pound;1.9 billion over that period.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.5/3">STFC Council has made clear that the funding for physics exploitation grants will remain broadly level in this financial year (2008/09). Bill Wakeham, Vice Chancellor of Southampton University, has been asked to lead a review of the health of physics research in the UK, as part of a RCUK review of the continued health of key research disciplines. The review panel is expected to report to the RCUK Executive Group in September, and the results of the review will be published shortly afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.5/4">STFC also announced that funding for Particle Physics grants will be 43 per cent. higher in 2008/09 than it was in 2005/06, while in Nuclear Physics, a grant round now in progress will provide an increase of 78 per cent. in 2008/09 compared to 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.5/5">STFC has also announced that support for astronomy grants will be 67 per cent. higher in 2008/09 than in 2005/06.</p>

We have no plans to extend this change to cover existing students. The fundamental changes to the system that we introduced in 2006, which included the deferment of fees by taking out a loan, rather than paying them up-front, offered a very attractive support package, and this continues to be available to current students.</p>

But there will be mechanisms to prevent deliberate fraud as there are under the current system and these will operate in a way that sets an appropriate balance between the need for regulation and the desire to avoid an overly bureaucratic system. In all cases, HEFCE will work with institutions to audit fundable student numbers and final HEFCE funding will be determined on the basis of audited returns and through a robust audit process. The Student Loans Company will be reviewing its processes to cover the new arrangements and ensure that mechanisms are in place to deter and detect fraudulent applications.</p>

	<p pid="c.120W.8/1">The Government's intention are to introduce a Coroners Bill when parliamentary time allows. One of the key aims of the Bill is to deliver an improved service for all bereaved people, including those bereaved as a result of mesothelioma. The Coroners Bill will establish the post of chief coroner who will be responsible, among other things, for establishing national standards and providing guidance and training to coroners and their staff. The chief coroner will not have direct authority over police officer training or the practices of medical practitioners but he or she will work closely with local police authorities to promote best practice and will have authority to intervene if investigations are not conducted in accordance with agreed guidance. Under a reformed system, the new national medical adviser to the chief coroner will provide an additional valuable resource for bringing guidance to the attention of those professionals in the health service who interact with people who are diagnosed with mesothelioma.</p>

	<p pid="c.124W.5/1">We have commissioned an independent review to consider whether there should be any changes to the legislation governing data protection. The Data Sharing Review, being conducted by the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, and Dr. Mark Walport, will publish its report before the end of June. The impact of technology was one of the issues covered by the review's consultation paper and we look forward to seeing the final report. More generally, the Government and the Information Commissioner's Office keep legislation under review in light of ever-increasing technological changes in the field of data protection.</p>

The Prison Service incident reporting system processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute. Assault data is complex and may include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact incidents. Information on assault incidents may involve more than one assailant or more than one victim. In a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.2/4">Assault information is recorded at establishment level in four categories:</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.2/5">Prisoner on Prisoner, Prisoner on Officer, Other (including miscellaneous assault information) and Prisoner on Other. Rises or falls in reported numbers from one year to the next are not a good indicator of underlying trend for a particular prison.

	<p pid="c.145W.6/1">We know that some people are drinking too much and tackling the culture of harmful and binge drinking is a priority for Government. We are working with the alcohol industry and other stakeholders to implement a comprehensive strategy to tackle it, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/2" class="indent">a new public information campaign, which will start on <phrase class="date" code="">19 May</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/3" class="indent">more help for people who want to drink less&mdash;targeted advice and support will be available from the same date;</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/4" class="indent">a Home Office led review of industry social responsibility standards, which will report this Spring;</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/5" class="indent">an independent review of alcohol pricing, promotion, and harm, which will report in August; and</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/6" class="indent">toughened enforcement of the law on underage sales.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/7">Much alcohol related harm is preventable and there are substantial health gains to be made through the widespread implementation of programmes to identify harmful drinking earlier, providing brief advice or referral to specialist alcohol treatment for those who need it.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/8">We have put in place a new national indicator from April 2008 to measure change in the rate of alcohol related hospital admissions&mdash;the first ever national commitment to monitor publicly how the national health service is tackling alcohol harms. This indicator is expected to encourage earlier identification of people who drink too much linked to advice from general practitioners or hospitals&mdash;shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of 'everyday' drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/9">We will disseminate the lessons of the current trailblazer pilots on identification and brief advice to encourage uptake by NHS professionals.</p>

	<p pid="c.149W.3/2">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for providing local health services, including primary medical services, to reflect local needs and healthcare priorities. Westminster PCT has advised it has a long-standing general medical services (GMS) contract with a general practitioner to provide primary medical services to staff who live within the borders of Buckingham Palace. All GMS contracts set out the practice's boundaries, and in this case the practice area covers only the environs of the Palace. The practice does not operate a closed list but, in common with all practices, it does not have to register patients who live outside the practice area. The latest available data show that at <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September 2007</phrase> there were 296 patients registered at Buckingham Palace practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.149W.3/3">Information about the revenue the practice has received for additional needs is not held centrally. My hon. Friend may therefore wish to raise this issue with the chief executive of Westminster PCT. However, the issue here is not additional needs funding but payments made under the minimum practice income guarantee, which is being reviewed and on which announcements will be made as part of the Next Stage Review this summer.</p>

	<p pid="c.152W.5/1">Consolidation of processing and testing to six and five sites respectively will result in a reduction of around 140 posts. This is part of an anticipated overall reduction of up to 600 posts across the National Blood Service (NBS) by the end of 2010-11. The NBS intends to reduce these posts largely through non-compulsory means, including voluntary redundancy, staff turnover and vacancy control. Help will provided for all staff affected by change to find other jobs, across NHS Blood and Transplant and the wider national health service.</p>

	<p pid="c.168W.15/1">As a group, academies have an overall pattern of exclusions that is almost identical to the pattern for a control group of similar schools. Academies often inherit a large number of disengaged pupils and need to establish good behaviour in order to raise attainment. Academies place great emphasis on getting the basics right and improving behaviour in particular. As the new ethos and behaviour policy are implemented in an academy's early days, the number of exclusions may rise, but it typically falls as behaviour improves. This phenomenon is not unique to academies&mdash;the same effect is often observed when a new head teacher transforms a struggling maintained school.</p>

	<p pid="c.173W.2/1">Information on the number of young people in the care of each local authority that went onto <i> (a)</i> further education and <i> (b)</i> higher education, as well as the number of young people who were not in education, employment or training is not collected centrally by the Department. However, information on the number of children that are now aged 19 who were looked after on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> but have since left care and are engaged in higher educational studies (i.e. studies beyond A level) or who are not in education, employment or training has been placed in the House of Commons Library (Table LAG1). Table LAG1 is taken from the Statistical First Release (SFR 27/2007) entitled 'Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>'. The SFR is located at <a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000741/index.shtml">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000741/index.shtml</a> and table LAG1 can be found within the second set of Excel tables on the website. The measures we are taking forward through the Care Matters white paper and the Children and Young Persons Bill such as requiring local authorities to pay a &pound;2,000 bursary to care leavers who undertake a course in higher education and to provide a personal adviser to care leavers in education up to the age of 25 are designed to support them to achieve their full potential.</p>

Where a child moved into either of the aforementioned placements on more than one occasion during the year, he or she has been counted only once.</p>

However, we recently carried out an analysis of the 2008-09 admission arrangements adopted by schools in three local authorities areas&mdash;Barnet, Manchester and Nottinghamshire which showed that although a large majority complied with the school admissions code and admissions legislation, there was a significant minority of schools that appeared to have adopted unlawful arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.180W.5/2">Evaluations of the Every Child a Reader pilot-which provides Reading Recovery for children from among those having the most difficulties in learning to read&mdash;were published in 2006 and 2007. These are available on</p>

	<p pid="c.180W.5/4">The evaluation of Every Child a Reader in London in 2005/06 showed that 87 per cent. of children who had received Reading Recovery were considered to have made average to exceptional progress in reading comprehension. However, these evaluations did not include looking at the efficacy of Reading Recovery for children with dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.5/5">Our commitment through the Primary and Secondary National Strategies is to ensure Quality First teaching for all. The Every Child a Reader and Every Child Counts initiatives are focused on providing additional intervention for the 5 per cent. of children facing the most difficulties with reading and mathematics. They do not provide a specific focus on provision for children with dyslexia. Every Child a Reader is being rolled out to reach 30,000 children a year by 2010/11.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.5/6">Every Child Counts is currently in a research phase and will be informed by the Williams Review of the teaching of mathematics that is due to be published in June this year. The intention is that Every Child Counts will be aimed at children whose attainment in the early stages of mathematics shows they are not making expected progress for their age.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.5/7">Every Child a Writer is a new programme announced at the end of last year. The intention&mdash;as stated in our Children's Plan&mdash;is that this will offer support later in primary school than Every Child a Reader and Every Child Counts and reach a greater number of pupils. Further announcements will be made about Every Child a Writer in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.5/8">The SEN Code of Practice says that &quot;effective management, school ethos and the learning environment, curricular, pastoral and discipline arrangements can help prevent some special educational needs arising, and minimise others&quot; (paragraph 5:18). Where whole school arrangements for teaching and learning are not addressing a child's learning difficulties, schools have a statutory duty to do their best to ensure that the necessary provision is made for any pupil who has special educational needs. It follows that if a child with dyslexia is not benefiting from their participation in any or all of the three initiatives, the school must make additional or different arrangements to address the child's special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.183W.2/1">The DCSF was responsible for 12 public service agreements (PSAs) from the 2004 spending review, which ended in 2007-08. Over the 2007 comprehensive spending review period, which runs from 2008-09 to 2010-11, my Department has six departmental strategic objectives (DSOs) and leads five cross-governmental PSAs. Details are available on the HM Treasury website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.183W.2/5">The 12 PSA targets over the 2004 spending review period, which ended in 2008, were underpinned by 20 indicators. Of these, 11 indicators underpin the five PSAs which the DCSF leads over the 2007 comprehensive spending review period. The remaining indicators underpin DSOs or, in the case of PE and school sport, a PSA led by another department. Full details of the transition will be set out in the forthcoming DCSF departmental report, a copy of which will be placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.191W.0/1">Schools do not have to apply to the Department for Children, Schools and Families to become a trust or foundation school. A change of school category to foundation and the acquisition of a trust are 'prescribed alterations'. To make such a prescribed alteration the governing body must publish statutory proposals in accordance with provisions are set out in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 and regulations made under that Act. Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May 2007</phrase> proposals are decided by the governing body (or the Schools Adjudicator where proposals to acquire a trust have been referred by the local authority). There is no role for Ministers in the decision-making process.</p>

	<p pid="c.196W.2/1">Level 3 (equivalent to two or more A-levels) is broadly similar, once young people's prior attainment at Level 2 (equivalent to five GCSEs A*-C) is taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.2/2">Internal analysis shows the average Level 3 attainment score per qualification entry for a sixth form college student is around 2 points higher than for a school sixth-form student, with a similar level of prior attainment. Across a three A-level package of qualifications, the average difference in attainment would be around 6 points which is the equivalent of around a third of a grade. While this difference is statistically significant it is small.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.2/3">Sixth-form colleges and larger school sixth forms&mdash;either operating individually or as part of a consortium&mdash;do an outstanding job and are popular with parents and students. We want to encourage more high quality provision of this type, often working in partnership, in order to overcome England's unacceptably low participation rate in education beyond GCSE. Collaboration between schools, and between schools and colleges, will be essential to ensuring that we have a high quality offer for all young people and to support the successful delivery of the 14-19 reform programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.198W.3/1">The existing suite of Public Service Agreements (PSAs) targets expires this year, and as part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), a new set of PSAs and national targets is to be delivered by 2011. No formal GCSE targets are due for delivery in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.198W.3/2">There are currently no formal targets set for 2020, although the Children's Plan, launched last December, sets out the ambition that by 2020 at least 90 per cent. of young people should achieve the equivalent of five higher GCSEs at age 19.</p>
	<p pid="c.198W.3/3">In addition, the new PSA targets have a dual focus on ensuring that pupils reach the levels expected for their age in both English and mathematics (threshold targets) and improving the rates of progress made by pupils from ages 5 to 16 (new progression targets) with increased attention to achieving faster progress for underachieving groups such as children in care and minority ethnic pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.198W.3/4">The progression targets will be a major factor in helping all pupils&mdash;regardless of their background and circumstances&mdash;to realise their potential in English and mathematics in particular. By 2011 we want to see a 15 percentage point improvement in the number of pupils making two levels of progress in English and a 13 percentage point improvement in those making two levels of progress in mathematics between Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4.</p>
	<p pid="c.198W.3/5">The Key Stage 4 (GCSE) threshold target is for 53 per cent. of pupils to achieve 5A*-C GCSEs (and equivalent), including GCSEs in both English and maths by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.198W.3/6">In the Budget announcement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-12">12 March 2008</phrase>, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced new funding to bring forward by a year to 2011 the Government's ambition for no school to have less than 30 per cent. of its pupils achieving 5 A*-C at GCSE, including English and maths. This programme is called the National Challenge.</p>

	<p pid="c.199W.2/1">It has been open to awarding bodies to propose either linear or modular GCSEs for a considerable time. In 2005 around 27 per cent. of GCSE specifications on which young people were examined were modular. Following changes to GCSE science specifications for first teaching in 2006, around 35 per cent. of specifications are now modular and these will apply to qualifications awarded up to 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.199W.2/2">GCSE criteria for all subjects other than English, mathematics, ICT and science were revised in 2007, and the provisions allowing either linear or modular GCSEs remained unchanged. Awarding bodies have recently submitted new GCSE specifications for accreditation for first teaching in September 2009. It is not possible to say what proportion of GCSE specifications examined in 2011 will be in modular form until decisions have been taken on accreditation by Ofqual, the independent regulator of</p>
	<p pid="c.199W.2/3">qualifications. The outcome of the accreditation process will be made public in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.199W.2/4">It is Ofqual's responsibility, as regulator, to ensure that standards are maintained so that students achieve the appropriate grade based on their knowledge, understanding and skills, regardless of whether the specification they are studying is modular or not. All GCSE specifications require that students undertake at least 40 per cent. of their assessment at the end of the course, and students are only able to retake individual modules of their GCSEs once.</p>

	<p pid="c.216W.5/1">Our latest figures for pupils in schools with specific learning difficulties (including dyslexia) show there are 75,920 pupils either with a statement of special educational need (SEN) or supported through School Action Plus. We do not collect data on the particular special educational needs of the tenth of all pupils who are supported through School Action.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/2">All local authorities and schools must have regard to the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice which provides advice on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils' special educational needs. Children with dyslexia should have their needs identified and support put in place, as advised through the code.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/3">To help those working in schools with identifying and supporting children with dyslexia, last October we launched the Inclusion Development Programme, which is offering professional development in key areas of SEN starting with training on communication difficulties, including dyslexia. The Inclusion Development Programme materials were developed in close consultation with dyslexia organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/4">To identify and promote best practice, we are working with dyslexia organisations on the No to Failure Project, through which children in trailblazer schools are screened and specialist teaching provided to those identified at risk of dyslexia and other specific learning difficulties. We are supporting this project with just over &pound;1 million funding over three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/5">The recently published report from No to Failure says a significant proportion of participating children not achieving expected levels of attainment are at risk of dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties. However, the report does not indicate how many children had already been identified with SEN, nor does it evaluate the impact of specialist teaching on children's progression. We are looking forward to seeing the final report later this year, which we understand will contain such an evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/6">Through No to Failure, we have commissioned Dr. Chris Singleton to summarise published research on the impact of specialist dyslexia teaching. We will consider whether and how we should promote specialist dyslexia teaching as best practice in the light of evidence of its impact.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/7">Our commitment through the Primary and Secondary National Strategies is to ensure Quality First teaching for all. The Every Child a Reader and Every Child Counts initiatives are focused on providing additional intervention for the 5 per cent. of children facing the most difficulties with reading and mathematics. They do not provide a specific focus on provision for children with dyslexia. Every Child a Reader is being rolled out to reach 30,000 children a year by 2010/11.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/8">Every Child Counts is currently in a research phase and will be informed by the Williams Review of the teaching of mathematics that is due to be published in June this year. The intention is that Every Child Counts will be aimed at children whose attainment in the early stages of mathematics shows they are not making expected progress for their age.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/9">Every Child a Writer is a new programme announced at the end of last year. The intention&mdash;as stated in our Children's Plan&mdash;is that this will offer support later in primary school than Every Child a Reader and Every Child Counts and reach a greater number of pupils. Further announcements will be made about Every Child a Writer in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/10">Evaluations of the Every Child a Reader pilot&mdash;which provides Reading Recovery for children from among those having the most difficulties in learning to read &mdash;were published in 2006 and 2007. These are available on <a href="http://www.everychildareader.org.uk">www.everychildareader.org.uk</a>. The evaluation of Every Child a Reader in London in 2005/06 showed that 87 per cent. of children who had received Reading Recovery were considered to have made average to exceptional progress in reading comprehension. However, these evaluations did not include looking at the efficacy of Reading Recovery for children with dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.5/11">The SEN Code of Practice says that &quot;effective management, school ethos and the learning environment, curricular, pastoral and discipline arrangements can help prevent some special educational needs arising, and minimise others&quot; (paragraph 5:18). Where whole school arrangements for teaching and learning are not addressing a child's learning difficulties, schools have a statutory duty to do their best to ensure that the necessary provision is made for any pupil who has special educational needs. It follows that if a child with dyslexia is not benefiting from their participation in any or all of the three initiatives, the school must make additional or different arrangements to address the child's special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.224W.2/2">Following The Children's Society report Stepping Up (August 2007) a cross-Departmental working group on young runaways was established, supported by a consultative group made up of experts from the voluntary sector. Immediate activities for the working group include consideration of data collection mechanisms which will best support the new indicator. I am expecting a progress report from the working group on this in June, and full technical consultation on the indicator will take place in autumn 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/3">In addition to developing the new indicator, the working group are also developing an action plan to be published in June which will set out ongoing actions for improvements to services for young runaways at local, regional and national level; reviewing the Missing from Care and Home guidance (2002) and carrying out a review of emergency accommodation provision for young runaways.</p>

	<p pid="c.226W.2/1">The Government are taking forward a number of steps to help to keep down the price of school meals. We are investing over &pound;650 million between 2005-11 to help raise nutritional standards and keep school lunch prices down. This funding is also being used to help build kitchens in areas with no kitchen facilities; to better support the development of training centres for the school food workforce; and to improve overall take-up.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.2/2">The School Food Trust is working with manufacturers, caterers and schools to ensure the long term sustainability and efficiency of the country's school food service. They are working with food producers and manufacturers to ensure that the nutrient menus have a minimum effect on the price of school meals as well as working on kitchen efficiencies, including both skilling the workforce and looking at international business models. The Trust has produced guidance focusing on efficient and sustainable school food procurement. This guidance is being distributed to all schools in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.2/3">The Department is working in close alliance with the Trust and other Departments, to identify opportunities and develop initiatives to further improve efficiencies in procurement. These include price benchmark variance reporting, common food standards and terms and conditions to support local and national competitive tendering, as well as the use of shared contracts from other Departments, where they can be shown to meet the needs of schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.227W.0/1">The Secretary of State has not made a comprehensive assessment of the effects of selection by ability in local authorities with grammar schools. We remain opposed to selection by ability and legislation prevents admission authorities from introducing new selection of this type. Grammar and partially selective schools already selecting in this way at the beginning of the 1997/98 academic year may continue to do so, with decisions on whether individual schools should continue to do so being made at a local level. Parents may object to the Adjudicator about continuing partial selection, and mechanisms are in place to allow parents to vote to remove selection at grammar schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.227W.6/1">It is essential that Government departments have access to high quality and comprehensive legal advice. This allows for decisions to be taken in a fully informed context. It is vital that Ministers and officials are able to consult lawyers in confidence in order to obtain effective legal advice in a forum which is conducive to a candid exchange of views and consideration and assessment of potential risks without fear of disclosure. Disclosure of legal advice is very likely to prejudice the Government's ability to conduct its business effectively and to defend its legal interests, either by unfairly exposing its legal position to challenge or by reducing the reliance it can place on the advice it has received. For these reasons, disclosure of legal advice would not be in the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="c.228W.0/1">A school may select up to 10 per cent. of its intake by aptitude in prescribed subjects if the school considers it has a specialism, whether or not the school is a designated specialist school. It recognises the diversity of such schools, increases choices for parents and widens access to particular schools. We have published guidance in the school admissions code on aptitude selection which states that a child with aptitude is one who is identified as being able to benefit from teaching in a specific subject, or who demonstrates a particular capacity to succeed in that subject. Such selection is limited to subjects where there are recognised tests for aptitude which do not inadvertently identify high academic ability. Schools may also hold auditions or oral or practical tests to ascertain a child's aptitude. Prescribed subjects are modern foreign languages, performing or visual arts and physical education or sport. Schools may continue to select 10 per cent. by aptitude in design and technology and ICT if they already had such arrangements in place prior to the 2008 academic year.</p>

	<p pid="c.230W.3/1">The school's adjudicator considers objections to admission arrangements where the admission authority concerned fails to comply with the mandatory provisions of the school admissions code, or does not follow its guidelines. Local authorities have a duty to refer to the adjudicator the admission arrangements of any school if it appears to them that they do not comply with the law or the mandatory requirements of the code. The Secretary of State made a statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-02">2 April</phrase> in which he outlined his proposals to extend the role of the schools adjudicator to ensure that all admission arrangements are legal, fair and effective.</p>

	<p pid="c.232W.11/1">School place planning is a local matter and it is for the local authority and individual schools to decide whether to consult on, and then publish, statutory proposals to expand a school. Following publication of any statutory proposals, the final decision would be taken by the local authority or schools adjudicator, or, prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May 2007</phrase>, the local School Organisation Committee or schools adjudicator.</p>
	<p pid="c.232W.11/2">Since January 2003 statutory proposals to expand nine schools have been rejected. The Department does not maintain records of whether the schools were over-subscribed or the reasons for rejection and we have made no estimate of rejections due to neighbouring schools having surplus places or the unavailability of local authority capital funding. The Department has no information on other cases where a school, or local authority, have decided not to proceed to publish expansion proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.232W.11/3">Each local authority is allocated significant amounts of capital through a range of different programmes that can be joined-up and used flexibly according to local priorities. Additional resources are also available through the new Primary Capital Programme and, through application, for the expansion of successful and popular schools from the Standards and Diversity Targeted Capital Fund. The Government have made it clear that the wishes of parents should be taken into account in planning school place provision and that they want to encourage successful and popular schools to expand to meet parental demand.</p>

	<p pid="c.234W.8/1">The statutory national curriculum programmes of study set out what is to be taught in each subject, not how it is to be taught, nor for how many hours each week. The Department does not prescribe the amount of time that should be allocated to the teaching of English, mathematics or culture. However, the Rose Review of the teaching of reading recommended that 15-20 minutes a day should be spent on the teaching of phonics in order to secure children's early reading, particular during key stage 1.</p>
	<p pid="c.234W.8/2">In February 2008 the Government announced a &pound;25 million Find Your Talent programme of 10 pilots that will trial different ways of offering young people a range of cultural experiences for at least five hours a week, both in and out of school. The pilots will test a variety of approaches to a cultural offer over the next three years and will build on the considerable amount of cultural activity already taking place, and provided by a range of partners in addition to schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.234W.8/3">In compulsory food technology lessons pupils will be taught a broad range of practical skills and techniques and how to use them to develop, plan and cook a range of dishes. They will also learn about health and safety, the characteristics of a broad range of ingredients and a balanced diet. This will equip them with the skills, knowledge and understanding they need to eat a healthy, balanced diet. This new curriculum for food technology will be introduced from September 2008 and will become compulsory from September 2011. From September 2011 schools will share &pound;2.5 million a year towards the cost of ingredients for pupils on free school meals.</p>

	<p pid="c.239W.8/1">The DCSF funds SSAT through a range of grants and contracts to support the Specialist Schools and Academies Programmes and a range of other activities designed to raise pupil achievement. The total financial contribution made to SSAT over the last six years for which we have final information is: &pound;2.395 million in 2001-02; &pound;4.371 million in 2002-03; &pound;11.326 million in 2003-04; &pound;17.796 million in 2004-05; &pound;24,350 million in 2005-06; and &pound;35.152 million in 2006-07. Once accounts are finalised, we expect the contribution for 2007-08 will be in the region of &pound;44 million. Within each grant and contract funded by the Department, a proportion of funding will cover the associated direct and indirect delivery costs, as appropriate for each programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.240W.2/1">The Department does not provide direct funding to supplementary schools. However, last year, in partnership with the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, the Department contributed &pound;596,000 towards funding the establishment of a National Resource Centre for Supplementary Education. This funding was initially planned to end on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase> this year but as announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-26">26 February</phrase> the Department has extended it to ensure that the centre's valuable work continues. In 2008-09 the Department will make available a grant of &pound;350,000 and up to a similar amount in 2009-10 with arrangements to give the centre an incentive to become self-sufficient as early as possible. One key aim of the centre is to promote links between supplementary schools, local authorities and mainstream schools.</p>

Two key benefits of this project will be safeguarding and efficiencies. All participating agencies will hold the DCSF Recruitment Employment Confederation (REC) Quality Mark, thereby meeting the requirements of the Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education guidance. All London boroughs will be able to benefit from a safe and value adding quality central service, reducing their own resourcing requirement in relation to temporary staff and allow them to redirect to other needs.</p>
