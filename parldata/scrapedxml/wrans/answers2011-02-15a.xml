In discharging those duties the ACMD has a responsibility to advise Ministers on measures &quot;...which in the opinion of the Council, ought to be taken for educating the public (and in particular the young) in the dangers of misusing such drugs, and for giving publicity to those dangers&quot;. It is entirely appropriate that the ACMD does, and will continue to, provide Ministers with advice that informs our public health messages.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.3/1">The decision to review the approved lists of English language tests for entry into the UK under <i> (a)</i> Tier 1, <i> (b)</i> Tier 2 and <i> (c)</i> Tier 4 of the points-based system (PBS) was taken by the UK Border Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.3/2">The introduction of English language testing has been a gradual process starting with its introduction under Tier 1 (General) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February 2008</phrase> and ending with roll out of English language testing in Tier 4 on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-03">3 March 2010</phrase>. The UK Border Agency judged that this milestone was an appropriate juncture at which to review the lists of acceptable tests. The review will build on the lessons learned since the inception of English language testing under PBS and will consolidate the existing lists of acceptable tests into a single list.</p>

	<p pid="a.669W.11/2">We do not consider that this fee has any significant effect on the UK's ability to attract tourists.

	<p pid="a.670W.2/3">During the fee setting process, the UK Border Agency worked with officials through the Cross-Whitehall Fees Committee and ensured that the interests of those Departments that have responsibilities for UK trade, (primarily the Department for Business Innovation and Skills) are fully taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/4">Fee levels continue to strike the right balance between maintaining secure and effective border controls, and ensuring that the fees structure does not inhibit the UK's ability to attract those migrants and visitors who make a valued contribution.

Subsequent to these recommendations action was taken against 360 suspects, of which; 19 were removed from the UK, 18 departed voluntarily and 75 were denied entry to the UK. Of the remaining 248 suspects; 139 were refused British citizenship and remain in country with indefinite leave to remain, 35 were refused asylum and granted discretionary leave pending removal and 74 were appealing their decision and/or awaiting further action against them.</p>

	<p pid="a.679W.2/6" class="indent">The problems encountered by the Child Support Agency following the launch of the Reforms in 2003 resulted in a decision to defer the bulk transfer of cases from the old scheme (launched in 1993), to the current scheme (launched in 2003).

	<p pid="a.688W.11/3">In those circumstances, member states would be liable for a share based on their contribution to the EU Budget at that time. Contributions to the EU Budget vary over time, mainly driven by the member states' share in national income. For this reason, it is not possible to state exactly the UK liability in the event of a default by a member state. As an illustrative example, based on contributions to the 2010 EU Budget, the UK's share would be approximately 14% of the default amount.</p>

	<p pid="a.689W.2/5" class="indent">The OBR applied a range of fiscal multipliers to help inform its judgement on the impact of policy measures on aggregate demand in the economy. These multipliers are set out in Table C8 of the interim OBR's June Budget document A figure of 0.6, for example, means that a measure which has a direct effect of raising revenue by 1 per cent of GDP is estimated to reduce aggregate demand in the economy by 0.6 per cent in the short run. A multiplier of 1 was judged to be appropriate for changes in capital expenditure, while a multiplier of 0.6 was applied to changes in VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.2/6" class="indent">In the OBR's November forecast, reductions in capital expenditure were therefore assumed to have an initial impact of a one-for-one reduction in aggregate demand. The forecast also assumed that the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent would reduce the level of real GDP in 2011/12 by around 0.3 per cent. These immediate effects are reduced over time through a number of processes as the economy adjusts, including a monetary policy response and real wage adjustments.</p>

	<p pid="a.691W.3/1">The forward-looking fiscal mandate addresses a key failing of the framework of fiscal rules that was in place from 1997 to 2008; the formulation of the golden rule adopted during this period required the Government to balance the current budget over the economic cycle. This resulted in an approach that was too backward-looking, especially at the end of the economic cycle, allowing persistent fiscal deficits when growth was strong, on the basis of past surpluses.</p>
	<p pid="a.691W.3/2">By contrast the Government's fiscal mandate is forward-looking and requires that the cyclically-adjusted current budget be returned to balance over the five-year forecast period. Moreover, the key forecast judgments as to whether the Government are on course to meet the fiscal mandate will be now determined by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, not HM Treasury. The choice of the fiscal mandate reflects the exceptional fiscal challenge the Government must address.</p>

	<p pid="a.701W.5/1">The UK has been trialling a catch quota management system verified by on-board remote electronic monitoring. Under this system, all fish caught, including juveniles, count against quota and fishermen have to stop fishing once the quota is reached. Total mortality is fixed under this system, unlike a landings based quota which simply limits the amount of fish that can be landed. The results of the North sea cod trial run in 2010 were very promising and indicate that this system can significantly reduce discards. We are running a further trial this year with more vessels and different stocks, and the evidence collected is being used to influence the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.701W.5/2">The UK sees moving to a system of catch quotas as key in our fight against discards. We envisage this operating within a regionalised framework-where those closest to the fishery have the flexibility to use catch quotas, and a range of innovative discard measures appropriate to local conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.701W.5/3">Presently, the cost of the catch quota technology is met by the Government. However, in future years, and as the scheme expands further, we will consider what part the industry should play in helping to meet these costs.</p>

No vessel of this type has been licensed by Animal Health. However, such a vessel may be licensed by a competent authority in another member state and operate into/out of a UK port.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.9/2">Animals may be transported in other sea-going vessels, such as on roll on, roll off ferries and specialised livestock containers. Although these do not need formal licensing under the legislation there are various technical rules relating to the welfare of the animals during transport. In Great Britain, compliance is monitored by Animal Health to ensure that both vessels and operators meet legislative requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.707W.5/1">DEFRA's Darwin Initiative is currently supporting three projects on invasive species in UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs). The first is developing knowledge to eradicate house mice across three UKOTs. The second is looking at protecting galaxiids from salmonid invasions in the Falkland Islands. The third is reducing the impact of feral livestock in Montserrat.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.5/2">In 2009-10 DEFRA funded a pilot project to make the invertebrate plant pest diagnostic expertise of our Food and Environment Research Agency available to certain UKOTs. The project was highly successful in identifying a number of previously unreported non-native species in the UKOTs and some species possibly new to science. This year the project was extended to all UKOTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.5/3">DEFRA is also supporting a project on Jost Van Dyke island in the British Virgin Islands on the management of mongooses and feral cats in order to safeguard globally threatened species. The project also includes a training workshop for the region.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40391" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman)</phrase>, announced in Nagoya in October 2010 that DEFRA would be contributing &#163;200,000 towards a project being co-ordinated by the RSPB to eradicate rats from Henderson Island in the Pitcairn group, where invasive rats have been bringing endangered species such as the endemic Henderson petrel to the brink of extinction.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.5/5">Over the next few weeks, DEFRA intends to issue research contracts to quantify the impact of invasive species in UKOTs and to develop solutions to address these impacts. The research competition has been under way for some months now; all proposals have full support of the relevant OT Government and involve collaboration with at least one organisation based in that territory.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.5/6">In addition to the role DEFRA plays in the UK's Overseas Territories, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development (DFID) play a pivotal role. Funding from FCO and DFID continues through the Overseas Territories Environment Programme (OTEP). The programme supports the implementation of the environment charters and environmental management more generally in the UKOTs, but has tended to focus on biodiversity conservation in view of the rich biodiversity that the UKOTs support.</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.0/1">Under European legislation, pesticide active substances are first evaluated at Community level. A key part of this process is an assessment of the risks to wildlife, including bees. If an active substance meets the EU safety requirements then products containing that active substance can be authorised at member state level, taking into account that country's individual agronomic, climatic and dietary requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.0/2">In the UK, pesticide products can only be sold or used after they have been authorised. As part of this process, the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (the Government body responsible for regulating pesticides) undertakes an assessment of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment (in particular honey bees) may be exposed. The purpose being to ensure that the use of the product poses no unacceptable risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.0/3">The controls extend to the use of products and CRD routinely restricts the way products can be used (e.g. specifying dose rates, timing and place of application) to ensure protection of human health and the environment. Users are also legally obliged to take all reasonable precautions to protect the health of human beings, creatures and plants. Advice on how this can be done is set out in a statutory &quot;Code of Practice for Using Plant Protection Products&quot; which, among other things, contains guidance on minimising the exposure of bees to pesticides.</p>

Consignments of some tree species moved within the European Union are covered by plant passports issued by the grower to attest to the health status of the trees. Given concerns about the efficacy of these measures, the entire EU Plant Health regime is currently undergoing a major review and we will be working to ensure that the level of security under the new arrangements is fit for purpose. In the context of the review the UK is pushing for faster decision making so that risks are tackled when first identified, as well as improved controls which take into account the risks inherent in trade in plants and plant products.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.5/1">Since May 2010 the Government have taken a total of 14 opt-in decisions which represented a final UK decision on participation in an EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) measure. We have opted in to eight and not opted in to six decisions. The UK has additionally opted into three negotiating mandates to third country agreements. It should be noted that opt-ins to negotiating mandates enable us to influence the mandate but do not commit the UK to participating in the eventual agreements, as we have further opt-ins on signature and conclusion of the agreements-therefore they are not included in our running totals. These decisions on negotiating mandate are listed as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/2" class="indent">Council Decision on the negotiating mandate for an EU-US Agreement on Passenger Name Records; opted in (negotiating mandate only)</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/3" class="indent">Council Decision on the negotiating mandate for an EU-Australia Agreement on Passenger Name Records; (negotiating mandate only)</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/4" class="indent">Council Decision on the negotiating mandate for an EU-Canada Agreement on Passenger Name Records; (negotiating mandate only)</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/5">All opt-in decisions taken between <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase> are set out in the annual report to Parliament on the opt-in, which was tabled as a command paper on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-21">21 January 2011</phrase>. As above, the annual report counted an opt-in as a final UK decision on participation in a measure - for this reason the figures in the annual report exclude separate opt-in decisions on negotiating mandates and signing. The annual report also included additional information on Schengen opt-out decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/6">In addition, since <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase>, the Government have opted into the following proposals:</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.5/8" class="indent">Amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Establishment of EURODAC.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/9">Also since <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase>, the Government have not opted in to the following proposal:</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.5/1">The UK welcomes the return to democratic rule in Guinea and is actively engaged with EU counterparts in Brussels and United Nations colleagues, with the African Union and with the Economic Community of West African States to develop democracy and respect for human rights. As a key member of the International Contact Group the UK continues to work with and support the new Government. As the Government takes further steps towards further entrenching democracy, the EU will progressively unblock development funds suspended when the military seized power in 2008. We have also recently set up UK projects working with non-governmental organisation youth leaders on deepening democracy, improving human rights and civilian/military relations. We will continue to monitor the human rights situation closely.</p>

The Knesset are likely to formally approve this next week.

	<p pid="a.716W.8/2">Our ambassador to Tel Aviv discussed the issue with the Israeli ambassador to the UK, Ron Prosor, shortly after the Knesset vote. Officials raised this with one of the two Members of the Knesset who had pressed for these panels (she is also the proposed chair of one of them) and underlined our concerns to her.</p>

	<p pid="a.718W.5/2">Our overall assessment is that the Government of Uganda have made some progress in improving the framework for elections, including amendments to electoral legislation and a comprehensive update of the voter register, partly in response to the recommendations of the EU and other observation missions to the 2006 elections. It is also notable that the run-up to these elections has been more peaceful than in 2006. However, we remain concerned that the playing field between the governing and opposition parties is uneven, and that levels of trust in the Ugandan Electoral Commission are low.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.5/3">The UK and other donors have undertaken a wide range of activities to encourage these improvements, including capacity building support for the Ugandan Electoral Commission, media and political parties via the Deepening Democracy Programme. We are fully supporting the activities of observation missions from the EU, Commonwealth and other international and domestic bodies. Furthermore, we have also emphasised the importance that we attach to free and fair elections to the Government of Uganda (including to President Museveni) and have urged both the Government and opposition parties to engage constructively in the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.721W.0/1">The Department estimates alcohol dependence by reference to a score of 16 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)<sup>(1)</sup>. This definition is consistent with that used in the Alcohol Needs Assessment Research Project (ANARP) published in 2005. ANARP used a cut-off score on the AUDIT of 16 to identify 'moderately or severely dependent' drinkers.</p>

In 2000, it was estimated that 8.1% of 20 to 24 years old were alcohol dependent, in 2007, the estimated proportion was 8.3%. Neither of the changes in the estimated proportions between 2000 and 2007 is statistically significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.0/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> AUDIT was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a method of screening for excessive drinking and to help identify alcohol dependence.

	<p pid="a.722W.3/1">The prohibitions of anti-competitive behaviours under the Competition Act 1998 could potentially apply to general practitioner (GP) consortia, but only to the extent a GP consortia was acting as an 'undertaking' for the purposes of the Act, which may be unlikely to occur in practice, although the competent authorities (i.e. Monitor or the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)) would be obliged to consider any individual complaint on its merits. The OFT has published the following statement on the definition of 'undertaking' for these purposes:</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;It covers any natural or legal person engaged in economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed. It includes companies, firms, businesses, partnerships, individuals operating as sole traders, agricultural co-operatives, associations of undertakings (e.g. trade associations), non profit-making organisations and (in some circumstances) public entities that offer goods or services on a given market. The key consideration in assessing whether an entity is an undertaking for the application of Article 81 and/or the Chapter I prohibition is whether it is engaged in economic activity. An entity may engage in economic activity in relation to some of its functions but not others.&quot; (Agreements and concerted practices: understanding competition law; Office of Fair Trading; 2004; paragraph 2.5)</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.3/3">Further guidance on prohibitions of anti-competitive behaviour and investigations and enforcement action under the Competition Act 1998 is published on the OFT website at:</p>

The White Paper and Command Paper set out the Government's commitment to allowing patients to choose any health care provider for the majority of national health service-funded services. We are therefore keen to remove potential barriers to fair competition. In light of this we want to ensure that social enterprises, particularly those established under the right to request, are in a position to add value to current services, and that commissioners, through a range of providers, offer choice and quality to patients, as well as value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.2/2">Further consideration of the effects of this policy on the opt-out rate will be made as part of the process of determining the distribution of increases in contributions across members of the NHS Pension Scheme. We are engaging with employee representatives on the principles to apply across public service schemes and wish to implement change in a way which minimises increases in opt-out rates. The Government have already committed to implementing contribution increases in a progressive way so that higher earners pay higher rates than lower earners.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/3">No assessment has been made of the number of additional members that might opt-out as a result of the change in indexation.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.5/1">The NHS Pension Scheme (England and Wales) has two sections. The 1995 section provides a pension of 1/80th pensionable pay for each year of service together with a lump sum of three times the annual rate of pension. For members of the 2008 section, there is no automatic lump sum and the pension provided is based on 1/60th pensionable pay for each year of service.</p>

Disputes can occur between commissioners as well as between a commissioner and provider. Every one of these organisations would therefore need to be contacted to provide this information.</p>

We will consider the potential for increasing the sample size for this particular survey when the contract comes up for renewal. In the meantime, this survey provides useful information about consumer indebtedness and borrowing behaviour among the general population, as it is based on a nationally representative sample.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.2/2">More detailed survey data on household borrowing (including the use of payday lending) is also available from the Wealth and Assets Survey, an ONS survey that is partially funded by BIS, along with other Government Departments. This covers roughly 32,000 households (approximately 50,000 individuals). However, detailed analysis of the incidence of payday lending at a sub-national level has not been conducted on this dataset.</p>

There will almost certainly remain a need for a residual level of subsidy in the future to maintain those branches which could never be profitable, such as those in remote rural areas which provide a valuable social purpose.

	<p pid="a.743W.5/1">The Department has commissioned a number of projects which have examined the impact of tuition fees on different groups of students. Reports are available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/research">http://www.bis.gov.uk/research</a></p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/3">University tuition fees are estimated to have had a negative impact on participation, and enrolment tends to be lower in the presence of tuition fees. An increase in tuition fees tends to cause a decline in participation, particularly among students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, unless accompanied by an equivalent increase in student support.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/4">Recent evidence relating to reforms of tuition fees and student support in the UK found that an increase in tuition fees by &#163;1,000 per annum-holding all other factors constant-would be expected to lead to a 4.4 percentage point decline in participation. In addition, it was found that a &#163;1,000 per annum increase in grants increases participation by 2.1 percentage points while a &#163;1,000 per annum increase in loans is associated with a 3.2 percentage point increase in participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/5">In relation to the 2006 reforms, some individuals appear to have started university a year earlier than they might otherwise have done so (i.e. in 2005-06 rather than 2006-07) to avoid having to pay the new fees. This pattern of shifting participation was most clearly evident for individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds, and for those with the highest key stage 5 results. However, there was no evidence that the reforms lead to a sustained fall in HE participation, because tuition fees were accompanied by large increases in loans and grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/6">The introduction of upfront tuition fees in 1998 had a small negative impact on participation of high income groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/7">Tuition fees and other education related costs also influence the selection of higher education institutions, behaviour while at university and reduce the probability of completion, especially for students from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) and lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/8">Studies around attitudes to debt have tended to find that people from lower income groups tend to be more debt averse than those from higher income groups and that debt aversion can influence decisions around HE for lower income groups, though this was mainly about where to study rather than whether to study. The same effect was not found for those from higher income groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.5/9">Studies from the US tend to find that the impact of tuition fees is greatest on those from low income groups. Studies from Australia do not find any relationships between debt aversion, socio-economic group and HE participation.</p>

Both visits were used to lobby on specific commercial interests, to promote the UK's expertise and to push for progress on market access issues, which will help open the doors for British business. UKTI will continue to work closely with the Government of the Philippines on public-private partnership initiatives to identify commercial opportunities, sell the UK's capabilities and ensure UK business maximise their interests in the Philippines.</p>

UKTI is also working closely with stakeholders to develop strategies to help British business access these opportunities. UKTI will shortly publish a guide to doing business with the Philippines which will assist UK companies to understand and navigate the business environment better.</p>

	<p pid="a.750W.6/2">Cardiff Tribunals Service have been dealing with an unprecedented and unforecast increase in the levels of appeals, receiving 73.2% more appeals from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase> than during the same period two years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.6/3">In response, there has been a significant increase in staffing levels at our Cardiff processing centre, together with a number of initiatives to improve capacity and throughput. The result has been that, between <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase>, the Cardiff Tribunals Service Centre ran over 75% more hearing sessions in the hearing venues it supports than during the same period two years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.6/4">This is also reflected at the Haverfordwest hearing venue where, between <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase>, the number of appeals submitted to the Tribunals Service from that area increased by almost 130% compared with the same period two years ago. In response the number of hearing sessions have been increased by over 162%. Haverfordwest is a hearing venue and no processing staff are permanently based there. There has, however, been a suitable increase in the numbers of staff who are available to clerk hearings at Haverfordwest in order to support this increase in hearing sessions.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.6/5">In order to continue to increase hearing capacity in Cardiff, and Haverfordwest in particular, new medically qualified panel members have been recruited in that area and new legal members are currently being recruited. Combined with the additional processing capacity at Cardiff Tribunals Service, these measures are designed to ensure that the waiting times in Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire will begin to reduce in the coming year.</p>
