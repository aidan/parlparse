However, offenders are known to have a higher level of needs across a wide range of conditions than the general population, and recently, the department has undertaken a survey of offenders in custody, and started a survey of offenders in the community, each including a range of emotional and other wellbeing questions. A report on the survey of offenders in custody will be published as part of a Reoffending Statistics Compendium on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November 2010</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.290W.9/1">An early decision was made to adapt the programme of repairs, maintenance works and refurbishments to take account of the shorter summer recess and the September sitting. It is therefore difficult to quantify accurately the additional cost to the House Service of the September sitting. It was determined that it would not be cost effective or realistic to stop work while the House resumed in September and then recommence work during the three weeks of the conference season, because of the requirement for double set up and removal costs, and because the working time would be too short for any meaningful work to be undertaken. The penalty has therefore been of deferred projects rather than increased costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.290W.9/2">The difference in other House Service costs between sitting and non-sitting days is small, as the major costs of accommodation and staffing are not appreciably affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.293W.8/17">These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains. The ODA is unable to release the value of individual contracts at this time as this is commercially sensitive information. These figures represent the committed spend to date, rather than the end contract value, as in many cases this will not yet be known.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.8/1">Pigs are susceptible to infection with bovine TB, but are considered incidental spill over hosts and unlikely to play any significant role in maintaining the epidemic in cattle and wildlife in the UK. However, Animal Health do receive reports of sporadic incidents of TB in pigs, often in high cattle TB incidence areas where infection has come from cattle or wildlife.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.8/2">Surveillance for TB in pigs is based on routine post mortem meat inspection in abattoirs. In addition, TB in non bovine species is a notifiable disease under the Tuberculosis (England) Order 2007. Under the order, carcases of pigs (and any other farmed animal or pet) with, or suspected of being affected with tuberculosis, are notifiable to Animal Health. When TB is suspected, Animal Health can impose movement restrictions on herds to reduce the risk of spread of infection out of the herd. We work with the herd owner to agree appropriate surveillance regimes for their particular enterprise aimed at lifting the restrictions at the earliest opportunity and in the most cost effective manner. Occasionally this can involve a test and slaughter (of TB test positive animals) approach, while at other times Animal Health vets rely on routine meat inspection information.</p>

	<p pid="a.298W.6/1">The Government's proposals treat people registered to vote in more than one constituency in the same way as existing legislation. It has been a longstanding feature of the electoral register that some people are legitimately registered in two places. Although in some circumstances a person may legitimately appear on two or more electoral registers, it is an offence, subject to a fine of up to &#163;5,000, to vote more than once at an election for the same body. Therefore a person cannot vote twice in a UK General election or European Parliamentary election, but can do so in different local elections where they are validly registered.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.6/2">The Government believe that the electoral register remains the best basis for defining parliamentary constituencies, since it is updated every year, and produced for electoral purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.299W.3/2">An appointment system was introduced to manage effectively the flow of people into Croydon ASU. This offers applicants both choice and certainty on the specific date and time of their interview and is particularly useful for those who may need to travel some distance and who want to plan their journey. In those cases, where possible, applicants will be offered appointment slots to fit with their travel plans. The appointment system is monitored on a daily basis and can be adjusted as the number of applicants change.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.3/3">We also remain committed to dealing with vulnerable and destitute people on the day and so, alongside the appointment system, the ASU has retained a walk-in facility for all such initial applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.3/4">It is also recognised that there may be a small number of cases who, because of exceptional circumstances, are unable to travel to Croydon-this may include some unaccompanied asylum seeking children. In these cases alternative arrangements will be made to ensure such applicants can be screened locally and their claim processed.</p>

	<p pid="a.299W.6/1">We are committed to ensuring that parents who are being interviewed about their reasons for seeking protection are not placed in the position of having to give an account of personal victimisation or humiliation in the presence of their children. In general, applicants are advised in their letter of invitation not to bring their children to the interview but to make alternative arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.6/2">For some families, child care will be easier to arrange-in London, for example, the majority of asylum applicants are able to reside with family and friends and as a result have a wider support network for child care. We do recognise, however, that this will not be possible for all families.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.6/3">At present, the only UK Border Agency building that provides child care facilities when a parent is being interviewed about their asylum claim is in the North West. Additionally, however, in the West Midlands, the UK Border Agency is currently in the final stages of discussions with the Children's Society and hope to be in a position to provide a supervised play facility for the dependents of interviewees by January 2011. If these facilities prove successful and cost effective, we will consider extending this approach to other offices.</p>

	<p pid="a.302W.2/1">The 2003 Act is intended to deter the practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and we understand that in some cases social services departments have used the existence of the Act to warn parents-before they travelled with their daughters to countries where FGM is practised-that they could be prosecuted on their return if FGM were carried out abroad. Following this, the girls concerned have returned home intact.</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/2">Since the appointment of the cross-Government FGM co-ordinator, a number of initiatives have been implemented to improve the Government response to tackling FGM. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/3" class="indent">Action plan for 2010 developed following consultation with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), statutory agencies and professionals who have expertise in working on FGM. Actions include:</p>

	<p pid="a.324W.2/1">The Department is committed to enabling young people to have better opportunities to engage in decision making at national level and in their communities. Ministers and officials actively engage with children and young people on emerging policies that affect them through the Office of the Children's Commissioner and the Department's Children and Youth Board and through our stakeholders in the children and youth sectors. For example, I am in regular contact with members of the UK Youth Parliament through their regional meetings and I will be attending their second debate in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-29">29 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/2">I am particularly keen to ensure that we listen to the views of the most vulnerable children and recently met a group of care leavers to discuss how we could improve the support we give to young people leaving the care system. In the future I have asked the Children's Rights Director to set up quarterly meetings with groups of looked after children and care leavers, so that I can have an ongoing dialogue with them and take their views into account when making decisions about how to improve the outcomes of children in care.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/3">We are currently developing our proposals for the future of youth services and on new approaches to giving young people a voice and strengthening youth scrutiny over national and local policy. I have taken action to ensure that young people are integral to the wider consultation process through a range of events, including one I hosted at the Department, organised in partnership with the National Children's Bureau, with around 20 teenagers from different parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/4">Officials from my Department, with colleagues from Communities and Local Government (CLG), are working to assess the impact of current approaches to youth empowerment and democratic engagement and are drawing on the mechanisms and experience of youth organisations to involve young people directly in this work. This will also help to inform decisions about priorities for future funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/5">Both Departments (Department for Education and CLG) are also working with the Office for Civil Society to support the National Citizen Service (NCS) programme. Young people were involved in the work that led to the creation of NCS, and their direct contribution to its continuing development is an essential part of future plans for the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.336W.2/1">The Government recognises the extent of the skills challenge in the power sector which was underlined by several leading figures in the sector at &quot;The Energy Forum&quot; held on October 11 this year. The Government's response to the challenge, both in the long and the short term, is through its joint support and funding for the National Skills Academy for Power (NSAP) in collaboration with power sector employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.2/2">The Academy is addressing immediate skills gaps at the same time as assessing longer term demand for skills and optimising training capacity to deliver against identified need. Alongside developing qualifications and providing training materials for the sector, the Academy is establishing a network of quality assured education and skills providers to develop the capacity, capability, quality and consistency of training for a sustainable UK power sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.2/3">NSAP will also work closely with the Power Academy, which is sponsored by the Institution of Engineering Technologies, to improve the supply of graduate electrical engineers from higher education. The Power Academy represents a collaboration of 18 power sector employers and seven UK universities, together with the Institute of Engineering Technologies and the Energy and Utilities Sector Skills Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.353W.5/1">The Government have looked into policy on the British Indian Ocean Territory and have decided to defend the claims for resettlement and compensation which the Chagos Islanders have brought to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. This is because we believe the arguments against allowing resettlement on the grounds of feasibility and defence security are clear and compelling. Nor do we see the case for compensation as this has already been paid in full and final settlement of all claims. Both of these issues have already been decided by the UK courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.5/2">However, we do want to keep channels of communication open to the Chagossian communities and explore new ideas for their engagement with the Territory, short of resettlement. We plan to continue our support for islanders wishing to visit to tend family graves, engage in heritage conservation and contribute to environmental work, including the implementation of the Marine Protected Area.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.9/1">The UK regularly raises human rights matters of concern with the Egyptian Government. Mr Arsal is one of over 10,000 prisoners in Egypt who is reported to be detained without a final sentence. In our view, it is fairer and ultimately more effective, to address the common human rights concerns behind each of these cases, rather than to raise each case individually. For example, the UK supports the EU's &#8364;10 million project on the 'Support and Modernisation of Administration of Justice and Enhancement of Security' which is expected to reduce the backlog of cases in Egyptian courts. Given our overall approach, the Government currently have no plans to raise Mr Arsal's case with the Egyptian Government.</p>
