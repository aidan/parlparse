	<p pid=".457W.3/2">The Regulator has made no such representations. The Regulator has identified a number of areas where Railtrack is currently not complying with the requirements of Condition 7 of its Network Licence. These are detailed in his statement published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-27">27 June 2002</phrase> on the proposed acquisition of Railtrack PLC by Network Rail Limited. The statement explains what regulatory action is being taken in respect of each area of non-compliance and sets out the Regulator's expected approach to the regulation of Network Rail.</p>

	<p pid=".457W.6/2">London Underground will make payments to the infrastructure companies in line with the service they deliver. Both the preferred bidders, Metronet and Tube Lines Group, have developed their bids on the basis that over the lifetime of the contracts they will recover the costs they incur in enhancing and maintaining the Tube, plus associated finance costs, including a return on their direct financial investment&mdash;the level of this return will depend on the level of service delivered. Their bids also allow for their recovering the sums they have invested in developing their bids. This is perfectly normal commercial practice. Such sums include costs incurred directly by the bidders, costs associated with raising finance and fees paid to their financial, legal and other advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".457W.6/3">These costs will be verified by London Underground before they can be recovered by the bidders. The Government would risk undermining London Underground's commercial position if they were to prejudge the results of this verification by estimating the level of such costs that might ultimately be recovered.</p>

The Committee is also mandated to act as a consultative committee to establish and revise the list of areas eligible under Objective 2, discuss the Community Support Frameworks and Single Programming Documents for Objectives 1 and 2, and discuss issues arising from the allocation of technical assistance to the programmes.</p>

We assess all applications on a case-by-case basis against these consolidated criteria. In doing so, we take account of reliable evidence, including, for example, reporting from diplomatic posts, relevant reports by international bodies, intelligence and information from open sources and non-governmental organisations. In addition, the EU Code of Conduct requires member states to inform partners of licence refusals under the EU Code through the circulation of denial notifications. The code requires member states to consult partners before approving a licence for a transaction refused by those partners. This helps further to ensure conformity within the EU when assessing export licence applications.</p>

	<p pid=".471W.5/1">The Government are already taking a number of steps to further reduce the pay gap between men and women which currently stands at 18 per cent., for full-time workers, down from the figure of 20 per cent. in 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.5/2">As well as the introduction of the national minimum wage and the provisions in the Employment Bill, the Fair Pay Champions and Castle Awards are helping to spread good practice on equal pay. All Government Departments are committed to carrying out a pay review by March 2003 and we are also taking forward recommendations from the Kingsmill Report.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.5/3">80 per cent. of Britain's 6 million part-time workers are women. The Part-Time Workers Regulations, introduced in July 2000, ensure that part-timers are no longer treated as second class citizens. The regulations establish a minimum standard of fairness for part-timers so that they can no longer be treated less favourably than the full-timers they work alongside. The regulations cover conditions such as pay, pensions, training and holidays.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.5/4">The Equal Opportunities Commission is developing practical tools for employers wishing to investigate their pay systems such as an Equal Pay Review model; a Code of Practice, Guidance Notes and an Opportunity Now/Equal Pay Forum.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.5/5">I have no separate proposals to tackle gender inequality in salaries for professionals in the engineering sector where figures in the year 2000 showed that the gender pay gap was also 18 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".472W.11/1">The UK has well-developed and internationally respected arrangements for setting and enforcing accounting and auditing standards, both of which are vital to the preparation of company accounts which show a 'true and fair' view. There were substantial changes for the better to both accounting and auditing standards during the 1990s.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.11/2">It would be unwise, however, to conclude that serious concerns over particular company accounts could not arise in the UK, or that more regulation can prevent all possibilities of false accounting.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.11/3">There are a number of relevant actions in hand, which build on the existing position. A group, which I chair together with my hon. Friend, the Financial Secretary, was formed in February to co-ordinate the response of key regulators to the issues for accounting, auditing and aspects of corporate governance raised initially in the aftermath of Enron. The group will produce an interim report by the end of July.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.11/4">In addition, the Government will publish shortly their response to the company law review, which made a number of relevant recommendations to improve company reporting. The Government have also set up a review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors under Derek Higgs, which is expected to report around the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.11/5">It is also important, as we move with our EU partners to adopt international accounting standards for 2005, that none of the strength of existing UK requirements is lost. The Government therefore welcome the leading role which the UK Accounting Standards Board is playing in the development of international standards; and the determination of the International Board under Sir David Tweedie to ensure that there are rigorous international standards in place by 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".473W.2/1">Over the last five years more than 270 companies have invested in Coventry for the first time, creating over 11,400 jobs. Coventry is home to more than 130 overseas-owned companies which have taken advantage of the many opportunities offered by the City.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/2">Growth in value-added R&amp;D activity has seen major investment and modernisation from companies such as Yachiyo, Denso, Edscha, Eu-Matic, Mission Foods, Peugeot, Jaguar and others which have all benefited from the wide employment opportunities in the area, and received support from local, regional and national Government schemes. Eu-Matic's investment was the first inward investment announced under the new Labour Government in 1997 and their 132,000 sq ft, purpose-built factory on seven acres at Coventry Business Park was completed in January 1999. This &pound;17 million investment was supported by a Regional Selective Assistance grant of &pound;2.5 million.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/3">Other investments have seen a new HQ for AAH Pharmaceuticals, new investment from a Mexican company, Mission Foods, EPMB, and a major expansion at Peugeot. Jaguar and Denso are among many other examples.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/4">Much of the city is eligible for Objective 2 funding. Other European funding via &quot;Rechar&quot; programmes have benefited Kersley Colliery and the &quot;Retex&quot; (textile industry) programme has added to major reinvestment by the public sector in regenerating large parts of the area.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/5">Brownfield site regeneration has been an area of major success in the city with former major employment sites now housing new inward investors and investment from the city's university at the Technopark and the Coventry business park. Growth in the city's and sub-region's ICT sector has seen over 40,000 people now employed in 1,300 companies in this sector, helping diversify the area away from traditional manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/6">The creation of a science park, and a Technocentre housing centres for incubator units, innovation, and many small start-up companies, have all been supported by public sector partnerships working with others. Other examples of such developments include Binley development. Nearly 50 acres have been developed for commercial use in the city, including the private sector-led Prologis park.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/7">DTI's Small Business Service has ensured that in the last year nearly 2,000 local businesses have received advice and support. Also, almost 2,000 people have benefited from training to raise the local skills threshold. Additionally, some &pound;1.5 million worth of funding from the Skills Development Fund has been allocated to Coventry for projects such as a purpose-built centre for the delivery of engineering training.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/8">Advantage West Midlands, the west midlands regional development agency, is supporting Coventry and its sub-region's desire to promote the area as a High Technology Corridor. Substantial investment from the Rover task force resource will be used for HTC projects e.g. through the establishment of an ICT Skills Taskforce and an associated skills training scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/9">Part of the city falls within Advantage West Midlands' Coventry-Nuneaton Regeneration Zone, which aims to connect areas of need to opportunities, working with many local partners in the community, voluntary and education sectors. This will receive considerable funding from Government.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/10">Community investment has been supported by approximately &pound;12 million via the Government's Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, including developments at Hillfields and Wood End, and some &pound;55 million under the New Deal for Communities. &pound;37 million has been provided via the Single Regeneration Budget Programme in the same period.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/11">Coventry has benefited from substantial other funding from a number of Government schemes, including Sure Start and the Children's Fund, along with over &pound;50 million from the national lottery.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/12">Employment is at its highest since the mid 1980s, with 142,000 employed in the city compared with 118,000 in 1992. While there have been some shifts in employment between sectors (telecoms and aerospace have suffered recent downturns), the changing nature of Coventry's economy has meant that unemployment has remained at 3.7 per cent. for several years, only slightly above the regional average of 3.5 per cent. The strong sub-regional partnership between agencies operating across the area, such as Jobcentre Plus, the Chamber, LSC, city council, Advantage West Midlands and Regional Supply Office, has ensured that when downsizing situations arise, the partnership is able to deploy the necessary tools to assist companies in a number of practical ways. This has been reinforced with Government funding via the Rapid Response Fund and other training and development initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/13">More than 20,000 students are expected to graduate from the two universities this year assisting business and individuals gain qualifications and training across many sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/14">Through these significant interventions the Government have worked hard to achieve some important improvements in the regional economy, and to support the strong lead which local partners have shown to promote the industrial growth and diversification of Coventry and its sub-region since 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".475W.2/2">The White Paper sets out plans for radical changes to current arrangements for the clean up of the public sector civil nuclear legacy including the creation of a new body&mdash;the Liabilities Management Authority&mdash;responsible to Government and with a specific remit to ensure that clean up is carried out safely, securely, cost effectively and in ways which protect the environment for the benefit of current and future generations. It makes clear the Government's determination to drive clean up forward systematically and progressively using the best available skills to get the job done and, through competition, to promote the development of the supply chain and skills base required to sustain the clean up programme over the long term. It also underlines our commitment to ensuring that management arrangements are open, transparent and command public confidence. Implementing legislation will be brought forward at the first available opportunity.</p>

The legislation says that the obligation consists of a service provided at an affordable price determined by a public tariff uniform throughout the UK and includes the delivery each working day to the home or premises of every individual in the UK and a collection each working day from access points. Under the Act it is the primary duty of the Postal Services Commission (known as Postcomm) to exercise its functions in the manner which it considers is best calculated to ensure the provision of a universal postal service and it currently requires Consignia, in the licence, to provide the universal postal service.</p>

	<p pid=".478W.5/2">The Government have shown a strong commitment to maintaining postal services through a variety of schemes which have been predominantly designed to support the Post Office network and to explore possible new income streams.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.5/3">The Government contributed &pound;480 million to the capital cost of the Horizon project which computerised the whole network. We have also made available a &pound;2 million fund to support volunteer and community initiatives to maintain or reopen post office facilities in the rural areas where traditional service would otherwise close. Figures for the end of May showed that applications to the value of &pound;500,000 had been assessed and approved and to that date, payments of &pound;231,000 had been made. Government provided &pound;25 million for the &quot;Your Guide&quot; pilot in Leicestershire and Rutland which trialled the concept of post offices as one stop shops for government information and services.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.5/4">Following the announcement in January agreeing in principle to a compensation package for the urban network restructuring programme, the Government will make available up to &pound;210 million for the compensation and investment package for urban offices, subject to state aid and parliamentary approval.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.5/5">In line with the Government's commitment to the maintenance of a nationwide network of post offices, proposals for the rural network are being developed in the context of advice on transitional financial assistance from the Postal Services Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.5/6">In terms of supporting the mail business, the Government have not provided financial assistance for specific projects but, as announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-13">13 June</phrase>, the need for the company to restructure has led to the Government agreeing the basis of a financing package which will allow the restructuring to go ahead. The &pound;1.8 billion of investments on the Balance Sheet will be held by the group holding company as reserves. It will be available to back the investment required in the mails business, to implement the renewal programme and to support the nationwide network of post offices, subject, where necessary, to the relevant state aid clearances.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.5/1">My Department does not publish data on the numbers of lecturers in individual colleges who are receiving particular payments under the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI). This is because the distribution of TPI payments to teachers within individual colleges is properly a matter for the management of those colleges and their staff. However, distribution of TPI funds from the Learning and Skills Council to colleges is being monitored, and TPI is being evaluated at a national level. I am able to make the following information available.</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/2">For sixth form colleges, the size of TPI payments to individual teachers is prescribed as part of the initiative; the formula is the same as that applying to school teachers. The original announcement stated the Government expected that about two-thirds of teachers in sixth form colleges would qualify for payments of &pound;2,000.</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/3">For general further education (FE) colleges, the size of payments to individual teachers is not prescribed as part of the initiative. In the original announcement the Government expected that over two thirds of teachers in general FE colleges would qualify for payments of up to &pound;2,000, with 10 per cent. receiving career structure and initiative payments of up to &pound;4,000. However, the announcement made it clear that colleges would have the flexibility to determine the precise levels of payments.</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/4">This is the first year of TPI and we are currently evaluating its impact on colleges. The Sixth Form Colleges' Employers' Forum estimates that, nationally, 84 per cent. of sixth form college teachers have already received payments of &pound;2,000 in 2001&ndash;02. For general FE colleges, although no comparable figures are available, indications nationally are that progress has been much more gradual. The first case study evaluation report is due from the Association of Colleges in April.</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/5">In Leeds, seven general FE and one sixth form college, have been allocated a total of &pound;1,007,749 TPI support in 2001&ndash;02 as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/6" class="indent">Leeds College of Art and Design&mdash;&pound;83,422</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/7" class="indent">Leeds College of Music&mdash;&pound;49,498</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/8" class="indent">Joseph Priestley College&mdash;&pound;72,539</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/9" class="indent">Leeds College of Building&mdash;&pound;67,693</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/10" class="indent">Leeds College of Technology&mdash;&pound;102,195</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/11" class="indent">Thomas Danby College&mdash;&pound;162,238</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/12" class="indent">Park lane College&mdash;&pound;339,611</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/13" class="indent">Notre Dame Sixth Form College&mdash;&pound;130,553.</p>
	<p pid=".480W.5/14">In 2002&ndash;03 allocations to each college will increase by between 25 per cent. and 50 per cent. Further increases to the TPI budget are planned for 2003&ndash;04. These increases will enable colleges to extend TPI payments to teachers who meet the criteria for the first time. The increases should also enable general FE colleges to review the size of payments offered to individual staff and to consolidate these payments where they have not already done so.</p>

	<p pid=".483W.6/1">The Government are fully committed to improving the literacy, language and numeracy skills of adults. The Prime Minister launched Skills for Life, the national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy in England in March 2001. Since then, we have introduced a new national teaching and learning infrastructure of standards, curricula, teacher training and national tests in literacy and numeracy nationally to help increase standards and learner achievement. There have been three bursts of national promotion activity to increase demand for basic skills provision. These have led to over 100,000 calls to the national information hotline. Demand is also being stimulated among employers with a toolkit of advice and materials to ensure low skilled employees have opportunities to improve their skills. We have completed a series of pilots to test innovative pedagogical approaches and financial incentives for learners and employers. A new national research and development centre, led by the London University's Institute of Education, has begun investigating best practice in the UK and internationally. Our target is that 750,000 adults improve their literacy and numeracy by 2004. Between April 2001 and January 2002, more than 124,000 adults were helped to gain literacy and numeracy qualifications.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.2/1">The Department for Education and Skills has responsibility for the development of child care places in England through the National Childcare Strategy. The Strategy is carried forward at a local level by Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships (EYDCPs) that have been established in every local education authority area in England and are tasked with providing and supporting good quality, affordable child care in their respective areas.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.2/2">More than 175,000 new pre-school child care places <sup>1</sup> have been created since 1997 and EYDCPs have plans to create approx. 140,000 new pre-school places over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.2/3">Many of these places will be created through the Neighbourhood Nurseries programme, a key component of the Government's wider Neighbourhood Childcare Initiative. Launched in January 2001, the initiative aims to create 45,000 new nursery places for children from birth to school age and 25,000 childminding places in the most disadvantaged areas of England.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.2/4">Since September 1998 all four-year-olds have had access to a free part time early education place for the three terms before they become of compulsory school age.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.2/5">In addition, we have also increased the number of three-year-olds accessing a free early education place from 34 per cent. in January 1997 to more than 66 per cent. in March 2002. From September 2004 all three-year-olds will have access to a free early education place.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.2/6" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Pre-school child care places include day care places lasting for three and a half hours or more per day and places with childminders.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.5/1">In his annual report for 2000&ndash;01 Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools reported that standards of behaviour were unsatisfactory in one secondary school in 12 and one primary school in 50. He added that unsatisfactory behaviour in some secondary schools had undermined efforts to raise standards, and that such behaviour and negative attitudes towards work were significant problems in half of the secondary schools making poor progress in raising attainment.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.5/2">We have provided extensive support to schools to tackle disruptive behaviour and help improve standards, including funding for over 1,050 Learning Support Units, guidance on discipline and exclusion policies, and guidance on developing effective anti-bullying strategies. In addition, the &pound;66 million made available through this year's Budget will fund a programme of focused support for schools in the 34 LEAs facing the toughest challenges of behaviour and criminality.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.5/3">We will also extend the availability of Parenting Orders, so that these can cover parents of pupils excluded for violence or persistent serious disruption.</p>

	<p pid=".489W.6/2">With regard to fire safety, projects will not be approved unless they are designed in accordance with the 2000 edition of Approved Document B (Fire Safety), which accompanies the regulations. The Department's guide 'Fire Safety' includes information on sprinklers. It states that, though expensive to install, sprinklers can be worthwhile in areas where the risk of arson is high. In these circumstances their use can help minimise the loss of valuable course work and teaching materials, and prevent major disruption to the life of a school.</p>

	<p pid=".499W.5/1">This year, we intend to publish value- added measures in the secondary school performance tables of progress made from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 3 and from Key Stage 3 to GCSE/GNVQ for all secondary schools. We are also conducting a pilot programme for measures of progress made from Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 2 for primary schools, with full publication planned for 2003. We aim to pilot a measure of value-added between Key Stage 2 and GCSE/GNVQ in 2003, and between GCSE/GNVQ and A/AS level in 2004, prior to full publication the following year.</p>

	<p pid=".500W.2/1">The Education Bill will place a duty on LEAs to co-ordinate the admissions process for their area. Every admission authority in that area will have a duty to comply with the agreed co-ordination scheme for their area. The scheme will set out a common timetable for local admissions, and ensure that all parents state their preferred schools on a single form and are made a single offer of a school place on the same day. This will be fairer than the current system&mdash;where some parents may hold multiple offers of places, while others have none. All maintained schools and academies will be part of these local schemes. Admission forums will be responsible for monitoring the admissions process in their area, to check that it operates in the best interests of children and parents.</p>

	<p pid=".510W.6/1">Procedural bulletins issued routinely to all staff provide guidance on the handling and processing of claims from successful asylum seekers. The transition for asylum seekers moving from National Asylum Support Service support to benefits is, like any claim to benefit, subject to the relevant evidence requirements being satisfied. In some cases this can lead to delays although every effort is made to keep that delay to a minimum.</p>
	<p pid=".510W.6/2">A procedural bulletin was issued to all income support and jobseeker's allowance processing staff in December 2001, informing them of new procedures designed to minimise delays in assessing claims to benefit from successful asylum seekers. Where an asylum seeker has reported that they have not received their NASS 35 form, staff are instructed to send a fax to NASS requesting that another one is issued within 48 hours. The NASS 35 provides details of the level of support the person has received from the National Asylum Support Service and the date when the support ceased. This information is necessary so that full rate benefit can be paid. The new procedure was introduced in consultation with the National Asylum Support Service.</p>

Existing SDA recipients under the age of 20 on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-06">6 April 2001</phrase> were automatically transferred to long-term incapacity benefit (IB) in April 2002, making them up to &pound;28.10 per week better off.

	<p pid=".511W.8/2">We have received some representations from hon. Members and a small number of letters from the public about the change.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/3">Depending on their circumstances, young disabled people receiving IB can qualify for help with NHS charges (for example, prescriptions, dental treatment, sight tests, money-off vouchers for glasses, wigs, fabric supports and help with the cost of travel to hospital for NHS treatment) on the grounds of low income. We recognise that some will no longer have automatic entitlement to this help but many in this group will already be considerably better off as a result of the changes we have introduced and it would be unfair to treat these people differently to other IB recipients.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/4">Non-dependant deductions are made where a housing benefit recipient has another adult living in the household who could reasonably be expected to make a contribution towards the rent. The level of deduction depends upon the income and other circumstances of the non-dependant adult.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.2/2">The Pensions Appeal Tribunal's decision in the recent case involving &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; is specific to that case. It does not set a legal precedent for other war pension claims. The Tribunal found that the Ministry of Defence had failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; was not attributable to service. However the overwhelming consensus of medical and scientific opinion is that the symptoms reported by some Gulf veterans do not constitute a discrete disorder. It would be wrong to interpret from the Tribunal's finding that &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; does exist.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/3">The fact that there is, at present, no proper basis for recognising &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; as an appropriate diagnostic label does not prevent a Gulf Veteran getting a war pension. A war pension can be paid for any disablement provided that a causal link to service is accepted.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.2/1">48 per cent. by volume of the munitions stored at Dean Hill are held in support of the Navy and 52 per cent. in support of the RAF. However, munitions stocks held at Dean Hill represent less than four per cent. of munitions stored by Defence Munitions on behalf of all three armed services.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/2">In the last year, 49 per cent. of engineering and munitions maintenance work at Dean Hill was carried out in support of the Navy and 51 per cent. in support of the RAF. Again, however, this represents about four per cent. of the processing capacity within Defence Munitions.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.5/1">An internal rationalisation study, known as Defence Munitions Rationalisation Study 2 (DMRS 2), started in 2001, and examined the best utilisation of Defence Munitions (DM) facilities throughout the United Kingdom. An earlier study (DMRS 1) had already recommended two other site closures at DM Welford on Berkshire and DM Smalmstown near Carlisle in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/2">Even after the impact of the closure of the Welford and Smalmstown sites has been taken into account, DMRS 2 confirmed that spare capacity remains in DM's explosives storage and processing capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/3">The DMRS 2 team examined munitions storage, processing and supply issues. Most of DM's eight principal depots cover a variety of these outputs. The study drew these elements together to determine how the necessary capacity could most efficiently be retained. Taking all of these elements into account, it was concluded that only the capacity and facilities provided by the DM Depot at Dean Hill, near to West Dean village in south Wiltshire, was not critical to the delivery of DM's outputs. The other Defence Munitions depots are required either for the volume of explosives storage and processing capacity they offer and/or have specialised (often unique) facilities to outload and issue munitions to customers.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/4">All eight Defence Munitions depots were included in the review. Apart from DM Dean Hill, these are DM Beith in Ayrshire, DM Crombie in Fife, DM Glen Douglas in Dunbartonshire, DM Gosport in Hampshire, DM Kineton in Warwickshire, DM Longtown in Cumbria and DM Plymouth in Devon.</p>

However, I recognise that Harold Shipman's crimes raise issues of particular public concern and I therefore intend to depart from my usual practice in this case. Harold Shipman was convicted in January 2000 on 15 counts of murder. I extend my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the victims. These were the most heinous of offences and the grossest breach of the duty of trust he owed as a doctor to the victims all of whom were trusting patients. Taking all the circumstances into account I have decided that nothing less than a whole life tariff should apply in this case.</p>

	<p pid=".527W.2/2">The police and local authorities have a joint responsibility for the removal of abandoned vehicles and taking action as appropriate against their owners. When a vehicle is reported or discovered apparently abandoned on the highway, the police will carry out a number of checks to ensure it is not stolen, illegally parked, or causing an obstruction or danger. If it is, removal of the vehicle will be arranged as soon as possible. Once the vehicle is removed, the police will take steps to identify the last registered keeper of the vehicle via a search of vehicle keepership information on the police national computer.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.2/3">Where an apparently abandoned vehicle is not of police interest, details are forwarded to the local authority, which has responsibility for its removal and ultimate disposal. The Government have recently introduced tough new measures to help local authorities deal more effectively with the problem of abandoned vehicles, including improved access to the Driving Vehicle Licence Agency (DVLA) vehicle records.</p>

The PNB is the statutory negotiating body for police pay and conditions of service, on which all the main police organisations are represented, including the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities, the Superintendents' Association and the Police Federation.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.3/2">One of the reforms agreed is to reduce the plain clothes allowance on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> to half its current rate of &pound;258 and then to abolish it altogether on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. That change has to be seen in the context of all the changes, which include an increase in the basic salary for all federated ranks' officers of &pound;402 a year from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> and a shortening of the federated ranks' pay scales, resulting in faster progression to the top of the scales. Once they have spent a year at the top of the scales, federated ranks officers will be eligible for a new competence-related payment of &pound;1,002 a year, with at least 75 per cent. of those eligible expected to get the payment. In addition, under a new special priority payment scheme to target extra pay at those officers at the sharp end of policing, officers in qualifying posts will receive annual payments of between &pound;500 and &pound;3,000 normally, up to &pound;5,000 exceptionally.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.3/3">The PNB Agreement does not require officers to contribute to the cost of their uniforms.</p>

	<p pid=".534W.2/2">Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic given the reluctance of the victims of trafficking to report to the police. There is currently no accurate, reliable data in existence within the United Kingdom (UK) or the European Union. A Home Office research study, &quot;Stopping Traffic&quot; (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000), indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries.</p>
	<p pid=".534W.2/3">The Immigration and Nationality Department Intelligence Section (INDIS) and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) produce confidential monthly assessments and annual threat assessments for Reflex, our multi-agency task force on organised immigration crime. These assess the extent of organised immigration crime, which includes the trafficking of women and children, as it impacts on the UK. Reflex is led by the National Crime Squad and brings together all the key agencies involved in combating the problem, including INDIS, NCIS, the security and intelligence agencies and key police forces including the Met, Kent and the British Transport police.</p>

The proportion of arrestees falling within the definition of repeat offending drug misusing offenders category was 15 per cent. for the financial year 1999&ndash;2000 (the first year of data collection).

These activities have been carried out in partnership with local NGOs, UN agencies, EU and Malawi Government departments.

	<p pid=".539W.5/1">It is difficult to obtain accurate information. According to the Commercial Farmers' Union about 2,900 farm owners have received section 8 orders and most of these will be legally required to leave their homes in the first half of August. However many may choose not to do so at this point while further legal avenues are being explored. Farm workers are also at risk of losing their only income and their home with the change of farm ownership. There are around 300,000 farm workers affected by the land reform programme which with their families affects perhaps two million people. While we do not know exactly how many of them have already been forced off farms, we are working with the farm workers' organisations and the UN World Food Programme to monitor their situation and meet their immediate humanitarian needs.</p>

It is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's goal is to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that creates the conditions where such abuse can flourish.

Most of the current log bridges have deteriorated to the extent that they cannot carry loaded vehicles and, as a result, there is limited access to markets and social services. The goal of the project is to improve the livelihoods of the people living in the targeted areas by providing physical access, all year round, to markets, schools and hospitals/ clinics. DFID has committed &pound;8.5 million to this project and so far 28 bridges have been constructed, with a further 37 envisaged.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.5/1">The current negotiations on the GATS offer developing countries the potential to gain access to new markets overseas and to benefit from more efficient and competitive services at home. One of my key priorities for the GATS talks is to ensure that developing countries are able to participate fully in the negotiations. To this end, my Department is working with the UN Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on a &pound;350,000 project to strengthen developing country involvement in the services negotiations in Geneva. We are also working with other donors and international organisations to find the best way of providing technical assistance to developing countries to carry out an impact assessment of the requests made of them.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/2">More generally, my officials are working closely with the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) and other Government Departments to ensure that UK and EC policy on trade in services takes development considerations into account. In the recently agreed EC requests of other WTO Members, for example, requests to least developed countries have been mainly limited to 3&ndash;5 sectors, with a focus on sectors where liberalisation is most likely to contribute to development. The requests also make clear that the EC recognises the importance of liberalisation being underpinned by domestic regulatory frameworks designed to ensure the achievement of public policy objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.0/1">In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low income countries compared to 70 per cent. a decade before. In November 2000 we secured adoption of an EC development policy which, for the first time, makes poverty reduction the central objective of EC development programmes. This new policy calls for priority in resource allocation to be given to low income countries and we continue to work for agreement on the budget allocations to implement this policy and have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In particular we are working for an increase in allocations for Asia. We welcome the positive steps that have been taken to reform EC development assistance. This should help improve the rate of programme implementation, of particular importance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries where many of the world's poorest people live. But much remains to be done to improve the poverty focus and effectiveness of EC development assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.3/1">Crisis prevention and recovery has been identified as one of the six core practice areas within the UNDP mandate. The former Emergency Response Division which deals with these issues was upgraded to a Bureau in November 2001 and now has greater authority to engage in the inter-agency processes such as the Executive Committee on Peace and Security, and to develop its role in peace building in relation to that of the UN Department for Political Affairs. These are very welcome developments, through which UNDP is attempting to realise the &quot;untapped&quot; potential of the organisation in crisis and conflict situations, as noted in the Report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations (the Brahimi report), published in August 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.3/2">My Department has observed that strategy and policy development over the past 12 months is starting to deliver demonstrable benefits at the country level. UNDP's transition recovery programme, developed in the aftermath of the earthquake in Gujarat in January 2001, is a positive example of a community-led recovery process which builds on local traditions and capacities. UNDP has also played a key role in drafting the UN's five-year strategy for mine action. The pivotal role of UNDP is clearly recognised by the relevant players in this field, since it has been tasked to lead on 10 of the 40 strategic objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.3/3">Crucially, UNDP is also beginning to develop policy and tools to deliver conflict-sensitive development programmes. My Department is encouraging UNDP to incorporate conflict assessment into planning and management processes such as the common country assessment and the UN development assistance framework.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.3/4">However, there is still a considerable amount of progress to be made, before UNDP's role in crises and conflicts will be universally accepted and welcomed by the United Nations family and the broader international community. It is essential that UNDP capitalises on the opportunities which now present themselves and focuses on successful implementation at the country level across the full range of technical areas. My Department will continue to work with UNDP's Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery and encourage a continued focus on improving delivery at the field level.</p>

Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the best way of preventing arms from falling into the wrong hands. Nevertheless, the Government remain committed to carrying out end-use monitoring in those circumstances where this will genuinely add value to our efforts to minimise the risk of misuse and diversion and where such monitoring is practicable. And our overseas posts have standing instructions to report on reports of misuse of any UK-origin defence equipment. We take these reports into account in our assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".552W.5/1">The term income referred to the income of the OPCW from the usual three sources: contributions from member states in accordance with assessments adopted by the Conference of States Parties; payments by declared possessors of chemical weapons in respect of costs incurred by the OPCW in verifying chemical weapons destruction; and interest on cash deposits held.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/2">We do not have precise information on the timing of payments by member states. Our understanding is that all the major contributors paid their assessed contributions by mid-year in each of the past five years.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/3">The Head of the Administrative Division of the OPCW supervises the work of the budget and finance branch, the human resources branch, the information systems branch, the procurement and support services branch and the training and staff development branch. The post was vacant throughout much of 2001: it was occupied by a US national early in the year, and succeeded in September by another US national.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/4">The OPCW Secretariat, through much of 2001, issued monthly statements on income and expenditure. The Director-General included commentary on the operational programme in his statements to Executive Council meetings and in separate briefings of delegations through the year, where he outlined the cuts to the operational programmes he believed were needed to keep within anticipated income; and reported on progress in delivering what remained of the operational programmes. The Executive Council, on receipt of these reports, requested further authoritative information; requested specific proposals to deal with problems identified; expressed concerns about proposed cuts in operational programmes; authorised the use of all available cash to finance credible levels of verification activity and international co-operation and assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/5">The first draft of the 2000 budget proposed 12 per cent. growth over 1999; 2001 draft proposed 17 per cent. growth over 2000; 2002 draft proposed 24 per cent. over 2001; and the preliminary draft put to ABAF (Advisory Body on Administrative and Financial matters) in respect of 2003 proposed 29 per cent. growth over 2002. During these years, the norm in most international organisations was zero growth, and OPCW member states regularly made clear each year their belief that the draft budget should much more closely reflect the financial and political reality, so as to provide a sound basis for negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/6">At Entry-into-Force on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-29">29 April 1997</phrase>, there were 87 States Parties. At <phrase class="date" code="1997-12-31">31 December 1997</phrase>&mdash;105; 31 Dec 1998&mdash;121; 31 Dec 1999&mdash;128; 31 Dec 2000&mdash;141; 31 Dec 2001 (and today)&mdash;145.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/7">OPCW industrial inspection targets are in many respects randomly selected by the Technical Secretariat, so it is not possible to estimate with any accuracy the likely frequency of inspections to be faced in any country or group of countries. Previous budget proposals have provided an indication of numbers of inspections planned for the various categories of industrial facilities subject to declaration and inspection. The current budget proposal for 2003 under consideration in the Executive Council makes comparable projections based on current risk assessments which, if implemented, we estimate would tend to provide a more global coverage by the OPCW. If total inspection numbers remain broadly the same as in past years, as is currently forecast, this shift in emphasis could perhaps slightly reduce inspection frequency in 2003 for some of the major contributors, relative to what might have been expected from budget projections in previous years.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/8">The Director-General, in August 1998, published a grading review conducted by an outside consultant, together with his intended actions in respect of the review, including his decision to implement, effective <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase>, all the grade changes recommended. In October 1998, the Director-General noted to the Executive Council his understanding that some member states had reservations about the funding needed to implement the grading recommendations. In November 1998, the Conference of States Parties decided that the reclassification of posts involved should be discussed and decided by States Parties at a later stage, and requested the Director-General meanwhile not to implement the study. The Conference of States Parties in July 1999 reiterated its request to the Director-General not to implement the 1998 staff grading review, and requested him to initiate a new classification study once terms of reference were approved by the Executive Council. In June 1999, OPCW staff members filed complaints with the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation, an action joined later by a total of 89 staff. The Tribunal concluded that, in August 1998, the Director-General had had the competence for classification of posts, and that the re-classification announced should therefore have proceeded on <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase>. The concern of many States Parties was that the basis of the grading review was open to question, the Director-General's decision to implement it was premature, and he had no budgetary authority to incur the significant additional costs that would arise.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.5/9">Since the recent change in leadership the situation at the OPCW has improved with indications that better staff morale and planning are leading to greater efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid=".556W.2/2">Ministers would not normally support a plea for clemency on compassionate grounds if a Prisoner Transfer Agreement exists between the UK and the sentencing state and a transfer to the UK could be completed within a reasonable time frame. In such circumstances, any request for early or temporary release on compassionate grounds could then be made to the appropriate UK prison authority.</p>

	<p pid=".559W.2/1">The Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-26">26 March</phrase> measures to ensure fairness for all staff working on local authority contracts, including those transferred out of local government as a result of an outsourcing of a service.</p>
	<p pid=".559W.2/2">In broad terms, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (as amended) (TUPE) protects employees' terms and conditions (except in relation to future occupational pensions) when the business in which they work is transferred from one employer to another, and the business retains its identity.</p>
	<p pid=".559W.2/3">The measures we have announced include a commitment to legislate to make statutory within local government the provisions in the Cabinet Office 'Statement of Practice on Staff Transfers in the Public Sector' and the annex to it, 'A Fair Deal for Staff Pensions'. This will ensure that local authority contracting exercises are conducted on the basis that TUPE will apply, unless there are genuinely exceptional circumstances, and that transferees' pension benefits will be protected. New statutory guidance to local authorities will also set out a package of measures which will ensure that new joiners taken on to work beside transferees on local government contracts will be treated fairly.</p>

The change, which will be introduced alongside other changes to the local government capital finance system, will bring the treatment of debt-free authorities in line with the arrangements that apply to other authorities. We will be consulting on the detailed operation of the pooling shortly.</p>

The cause of every death is certified either by a doctor who attended the deceased in his last illness, or a coroner. ONS codes the diseases, injuries and external causes from the certificate and selects the underlying cause using the current revision of the international classification of diseases, published by the World Health Organisation. Since January 2001, the Tenth Revision (ICD-10) has been used. Prior to that, the Ninth Revision was in use from 1979. Mortality statistics are published by ONS in electronic and paper form and are used by the Department, other Government Departments, the national health service and academic researchers.</p>

Data sources include administrative sources and ad-hoc surveys according to the particular issues. Some sources have general health information and others focus on specific conditions (eg cancer registration, psychiatric morbidity survey).

	<p pid=".575W.2/1">We have consulted on proposals to amend the European Specialist Qualifications Order (1995), to enable the Specialist Training Authority of the Medical Royal Colleges to take training, as well as qualifications, into account when assessing doctors for entry to the specialist register. There was strong support for our proposals from the medical profession and the amended legislation is currently being prepared. The proposed amendment is designed to facilitate entry to the specialist register for doctors working in the national health service, and may be of benefit to doctors in the non-consultant career grade posts.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.2/2">We did not specifically consult on the inclusion of experience gained outside formal training posts, as criteria for entry to the specialist register, for the current amendment. However, some responses to consultation indicated that we should consider the inclusion of experience. We accept that there needs to be a proper debate about the issue and we are considering taking forward work to look at the appropriateness of including experience in the longer term. We would not introduce retrospectively approved experience as a criterion for entry to the specialist register without a full debate and consultation about the appropriateness of this with the medical profession.</p>

We have pledged additional funding for NHS child care, building up to &pound;100 million, to do this. Many NHS trusts already provide holiday play schemes and other forms of child care support, and we want to ensure that all NHS organisations help meet their staff's child care needs. In addition, all staff will have access to an NHS child care co-ordinator by April 2003, and we are providing funding to pump-prime these posts. Over 70 child care co-ordinators are already working in the NHS, developing local child care strategies, and providing advice and support to parents working in the NHS. A number of NHS trusts also provide child care vouchers to their staff.</p>

	<p pid=".578W.6/2">European Union rules already require the labels of pre-packed foods to declare their ingredients, including additives such as colourings, although some exemptions do apply. Amendments currently under discussion would remove a number of these exemptions, including the 'compound ingredient rule' which exempts ingredients of ingredients making up less than 25 per cent. of the food. The Food Standards Agency is supporting plans for early discussions aimed at removing the ingredient listing exemption for alcoholic drinks. It is also pressing for an early review of the justification for the remaining exemptions, especially those which apply to additives used as processing aids or which do not have a technological function in the final food.</p>

The assessment materials in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), which was conducted in 1995 by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) among students in international grades 3&ndash;4, 7&ndash;8 and the final year of secondary school, and repeated in 1999 among students in the eighth grade only, were constructed on the basis of an analysis of the intended curriculum in each participating country, so as to cover the core material common to the curriculum in the majority of participating countries. The assessment materials in PISA 2000 covered the range of skills and competencies that were, in the respective assessment domains, considered to be crucial to an individual's capacity to fully participate in, and contribute meaningfully to, a successful modern society.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.11/1">Camelids are susceptible to foot and mouth disease (FMD), although less so than some other species. Based on veterinary advice, movements of camelids have therefore been subject to conditions set out in a general licence under the interim livestock movement controls. Details were set out in leaflets sent to all livestock farmers in February 2002 and placed in the Library of the House. They are also on the Department's website. They reflect discussions with organisations representing the owners of camelids.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.11/2">Special arrangements apply to llama trekking, which can currently take place under a separate licence issued by the DEFRA Divisional Veterinary Manager. Again, details were discussed with the relevant organisations in March 2002 and can be found on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.11/3">Veterinary advice has now been revised reflecting the passage of time since the end of the lambing season with no re-emergence of FMD, and it is our intention to remove all restrictions on camelid movements, including llama trekking, assuming there is no change to the current disease situation. This will require amendments to the legal instrument which sets out the animal movement controls, and the changes are expected to come into force at the end of July. Controls over camelid movements would be reimposed if a further outbreak of FMD occurred.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.8/1">The Commission has said that, following a feasibility study to be undertaken in co-operation with member states, it intends to propose the establishment before mid-2004, of a joint inspection structure at Community level, which will pool national means of inspection and surveillance in relation to fisheries or other areas and manage them within a Community framework. Pooling of means will include the operation of multinational inspection teams in both Community and international waters. The Commission has also said that the establishment of a joint inspection structure will not change the distribution of responsibilities for fisheries control and enforcement between the Commission and member states, in which the member states are primarily responsible for the control and enforcement of CFP rules and the Commission is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the correct application of Community law by the member states. Effective and consistent standards of enforcement are key priorities for the UK and we shall be examining the Commission's proposals carefully to ensure that they achieve these objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".589W.5/1">DEFRA's ultimate aim is to produce an effective vaccine for cattle to protect against bovine tuberculosis, and it is spending over &pound;1.4 million a year on this. DEFRA recently announced that the sequence of the entire genoma of the organism that causes bovine tuberculosis has been determined in a collaborative project between the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (UK), the Institut Pasteur (France) and the Pathogen Genome Sequencing Unit at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (UK). This breakthrough is a major step forward in the long-term search for a vaccine against bovine TB and more rapid diagnostic testing. However, the Independent Scientific Group for Cattle TB (ISG) advise that this would offer a solution only in the long term.</p>

	<p pid=".590W.0/1">Field operations associated with the badger culling trial were suspended during the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak, because of the risk of the disease being carried by field operatives onto agricultural land, and because of the diversion of resources. Surveying resumed in January, with trapping under way on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-01">1 May</phrase>. The Independent Scientific Group for Cattle TB (ISG) has considered the impact of FMD on the trial and advised that the delivery of results will only be delayed by 3&ndash;4 months, to late 2004 or early 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.0/2">The ISG advise that it is to early for an analysis of results so far. It is a basic rule for scientific trials that results are not published prematurely. It has, however, been possible to complete a preliminary analysis of the risk factors associated with cattle TB and this is set out in the ISG's third annual report, copies of which are available in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.2/2">In 1999 the Government published a series of high level targets for flood and coastal defence, alongside an elaboration of the Environment Agency's general flood defence supervisory duty. Following this, work has been undertaken to identify &quot;critical ordinary watercourses&quot; which are those watercourses agreed between the Environment Agency and the relevant operating authority as presenting a significant flood risk. The Environment Agency has also been working with the operating authorities to ensure that these watercourses and any related flood defences are regularly inspected and their condition reported to the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.2/3">We recently consulted on a Review of Flood and Coastal Defence Funding including a number of options for streamlining the service. These included the possibility of transferring to the EA responsibility for watercourses presenting the most significant flood risk. We have received nearly 300 responses to the consultation, and will be considering these and our conclusions through the summer and autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.5/2">The high level targets (HLT) published in November 1999 apply to the Environment Agency and other bodies. No targets apply to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The targets generally require the Environment Agency and others to report on specific issues at specific times. Unfortunately reports due in 2001 were delayed because resources had to be diverted during the serious and widespread flooding in autumn 2000 and to deal with follow-up work.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.5/3">Reports covering the 2001&ndash;02 period were published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-24">24 May 2002</phrase> for: HLT 1 (Policy statements); HLT 2 (Provision of Flood Warnings); HLT 3 (Emergency exercises and emergency plans) and HLT 9 (Biodiversity). I expect shortly to be able to publish reports for HLT 2 (due April 2002) and HLT 5 (Flood defence inspections and assessment).</p>
	<p pid=".592W.5/4">On other targets, the National Flood and Coastal Defence Database (HLT 4) is now expected to become operational by September. Coastal groups have provided partial responses under HLTs 6, 8 and 13 and we are working with them to secure fuller and timely compliance in future. Information has been forthcoming from operating authorities under HLT 7, and the Association of Drainage Authorities have issued guidance to IDBs under HLT 14, though this was delayed by factors beyond the Association's control.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.5/5">The Environment Agency are still awaiting submissions for the targets 10, 11 and 12, and reports will be published in coming months. While there might be some residual delay following the impact of the autumn 2000 floods, I hope to achieve rather more timely publication in future.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.2/2">Our latest modelling suggests that, for five out of the eight named pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, benzene, 1,3 butadiene, and sulphur dioxide), we are broadly on track to meet the objectives set out in the 1997 National Air Quality Strategy. In respect of three pollutants, however, (particles, ozone and nitrogen dioxide) there are some parts of the country which are at risk of exceeding the objectives originally proposed in the 1997 strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.2/3">Many of the objectives of the 1997 National Air Quality Strategy have been tightened or amended in recent years, in the light of on-going policy and scientific developments. Details of our latest objectives together with modelled forecasts for each pollutant, are set out in the January 2000 Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and also in the September 2001 consultation document on proposed new air quality objectives for particles, carbon monoxide, benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These documents are both available via the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/ index.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".594W.2/2">The standards for each of the eight pollutants in the Air Quality Strategy are given in Table 1a. The strategy is advised by the Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS), which recommends health based ambient air quality standards on which objectives will generally be based. Standards represent the concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere which can broadly be taken to achieve a certain level of environmental quality. They are based on assessment of the effects of each pollutant on human health including the effects on sensitive subgroups. The Air Quality Strategy also incorporates objectives which are policy targets generally expressed as a maximum ambient concentration to be achieved, taking account of the costs and benefits, and the feasibility and practicability of moving towards the standards. These are given in Table 1b.</p>

	<p pid=".597W.2/2">The table shows price patterns for arable crops over the period May 2001 to May 2002, one month more than a year to allow comparison for the maincrop potato where the season end is May. Here follows the explanation of the price trends.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/3">Bread making wheat prices have fallen by around 4 per cent. between May 2001 and May 2002. Domestic demand has been flat and any short term supply difficulties have been met by imports from the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/4">Feed wheat prices have declined by around 12 per cent. over the last year with the most marked fall since February 2002. Markets have come under increasing pressure from cheap Black sea eg Ukrainian supplies.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/5">Feed barley prices have been affected by falling wheat prices and limited trade on the domestic market. Overall they have declined by 19 per cent. over the period May 2001 to May 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/6">Maincrop potato prices have declined by 20 per cent. since the start of the current maincrop season in August 2001 and by 47 per cent. compared to the end of the 2000&ndash;01 season in May 2001. The fall in prices can be attributed to supplies outstripping demand. There is a large price difference between the poorest and best quality stock.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/7">Early potatoes are not shown on the table as at this point in 2002 there is no monthly representative data, however weekly information provides an indication. For the 2001 early season (June and July), prices were considerably higher than during 1999 and 2000 due to strong demand and poor weather restricting supplies. Early indications for 2002 suggest a likely fall in prices due to large volumes of imports. The latest provisional weekly prices (14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-06-20">20 June</phrase>) show the prices 98 per cent. and 30 per cent. higher than the equivalent weeks in 1999 and 2000 but 53 per cent. lower than in 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".598W.2/1">It is a Government policy priority to help farmers to consider diversifying the economic base of their businesses. This accords with views on farm diversification emerging from the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food.</p>
	<p pid=".598W.2/2">To help achieve this policy aim DEFRA provides grants under the Rural Enterprise Scheme, which forms part of the England Rural Development Programme. Since the scheme's launch in October 2000, over 200 diversification projects have been approved and awarded nearly &pound;9 million in funding. The Department also offers assistance in the form of free planning consultancy advice to farmers who intend to pursue an eligible diversification project through the Rural Enterprise Scheme and we are considering how to improve the provision of help and information to farmers considering diversifying their business. Our Rural Development Service has been running successful business planning seminars in a number of the regions.</p>
	<p pid=".598W.2/3">There are many types of farm business and no single approach will be appropriate. The Rural Enterprise Scheme is just one of a number of measures under the England Rural Development Programme, including agri-environment schemes, aid for conversion to organic farming, grants for processing and marketing of agricultural products, farm woodlands, energy crops and vocational training.</p>

	<p pid=".598W.5/2">The Policy Commission estimated that implementing its recommendations would cost approximately &pound;500 million over three years. However, the cost of many of the recommendations will depend upon the precise way in which they are implemented. The Government intend to produce a strategy for sustainable food and farming in England in the autumn, following a wide-ranging process of stakeholder engagement. This strategy will incorporate a definitive response to each of the Policy Commission's recommendations, although not all of these fall to, or involve expenditure by Government.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.0/1">The Department grant funds the environmental charity, Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS), which runs the Keep Britain Tidy campaign. Last year ENCAMS ran anti-litter advertising campaigns targeted at drivers who throw litter from cars, and adolescents. The latter campaign used pop stars, soap personalities and footballers to convey the message that it is not &quot;cool&quot; to litter. ENCAMS also initiated a clean up campaign targeted at those who drop litter in and around football grounds using Michael Owen and other famous footballers to get the message across&mdash;so far campaigns have been launched at Liverpool and Arsenal football grounds. This year ENCAMS will be launching a campaign directed at fast food litter. This campaign will run in August in cinemas throughout the country. ENCAMS also runs a number of Keep Britain Tidy campaigns throughout the year which get local communities cleaning up their local environment.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.0/2">It is primarily the responsibility of local authorities and the Environment Agency to instigate advertising campaigns in relation to fly tipping and waste disposed of by illegal means. While there is no central list of campaigns by local authorities, the Environment Agency has worked to establish the fly tipping forum which has helped to raise awareness and the profile of the issue. The forum is proposing to organise a seminar specifically relating to fly tipping and waste related crime in the future. In addition, information about fly tipping and advice on what to do in relation to a fly tipping incident can be found on the agency's website at: <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/wasteman/flytip/">http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ business/wasteman/flytip/</a>.

	<p pid=".603W.2/1">Guidance for dealing with litter is contained in the 1999 DETR Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse. This sets out reasonable and acceptable standards of cleanliness for local authorities and Duty Bodies which they can be expected to meet. Advice for the general public is published by the Tidy Britain Group in their leaflet entitled &quot;Litter and the Law&quot;. This explains the litter laws and how the public can help to achieve a litter-free local environment.</p>
	<p pid=".603W.2/2">The current legislation in place to deal with litter and refuse is contained in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This makes Duty Bodies responsible for keeping their land clear of litter and refuse. It also gives both local authorities and citizens the right to take legal action to get areas cleaned up.</p>
	<p pid=".603W.2/3">The Environment Agency, in conjunction with the fly tipping forum has put together a comprehensive pack of guidance to help various sectors of society to deal with fly tipping. This guidance is available on the Environment Agency website at: <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/wasteman/flytip/">http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ business/wasteman/flytip/</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".603W.2/4">Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 makes it a criminal offence to dispose of waste outside the terms of a Waste Management Licence or a registered exemption from licensing. Section 59 of the same act gives the Environment Agency and local authorities the power to serve notice on the perpetrators of fly tipping, requiring them to remove the waste and pay for the clean up. Local authorities and the Environment Agency are also empowered to effect the removal of fly tipped waste and to recover the costs from those responsible.</p>
	<p pid=".603W.2/5">The Department has not given any advice or guidance with relation to tackling problems from abandoned vehicles. The legislation covering abandoned vehicles is contained in the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978, the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1986 and the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".603W.2/6">There is no advice given by the Department in relation to waste disposed by illegal means&mdash;other than fly tipping. The Environment Agency can also take action to revoke or amend a waste management licence, if waste is deposited outside the conditions of that licence.

	<p pid=".606W.6/1">DEFRA has produced an interim contingency plan for foot and mouth disease in consultation with some key stakeholders and operational partners. The interim contingency plan builds on the existing plan (which is required by EC Directive 90/423) and codifies experiences and lessons learned from the recent outbreak. However, it does not seek to pre-judge the results of the official inquiries into the last outbreak. All plans will be comprehensively reviewed as a result of any recommendations made by the official inquiries.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.6/2">A programme of testing through simulation exercises is planned for the future. Stakeholders at both national and local level will be invited to be involved in the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.6/3">A number of restrictions on animal movements remain in place as a means of helping protect against the rapid spread of any new incursion of disease, and measures have been taken to improve standards of biosecurity in livestock markets and shows. These arrangements also will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the official inquiries.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.0/1">The Department is working closely with the Environment Agency (EA) to ensure that FMD disposal sites are effectively monitored. Up until the end of March 2002, the EA managed a programme of environmental monitoring in the areas worst affected by the outbreak. DEFRA has now taken over responsibility for this interim monitoring programme and has recently issued a tender for the sampling and analysis of selected sites throughout England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.0/2">The Department also intends to commission individual site-specific risk assessments for each carcase and ash disposal site. These assessments will be made available to the EA, who will review the environmental risk and Groundwater Authorisations. Based on the results of these risk assessments, the Department will then commission a targeted monitoring programme to ensure that any potential longer-term environmental impacts are identified.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.0/3">In addition to this monitoring programme, each of the mass burial sites has its own comprehensive monitoring programme with regular reporting to DEFRA and the EA. The agency also carries out audit monitoring. Watchtree has 68 monitoring boreholes, Tow Law 32, Throckmorton 28 and Widdrington six. These boreholes are at varying distances from the cells and samples are taken, in some cases at several different depths. The Environment Agency is sampling stream springs and watercourses in the vicinity of the mass burial sites. No pollution from carcase disposal has been detected to date.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.0/4">The need for formal risk assessments to be undertaken prior to the burial of carcases or ash is being incorporated into departmental operational guidance.</p>
