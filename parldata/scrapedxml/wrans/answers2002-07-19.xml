	<p pid=".568W.9/1">In my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-27">27 June</phrase> on Network Rail, I informed Members of two minutes I had laid in the House that day, setting out the contingent liabilities I proposed to incur on behalf of the Government to enable Railtrack plc to be acquired by Network Rail.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/2">This classification of Network Rail was a decision taken, not by the Government, but by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS takes independent decisions in matters concerning the classification, preparation and publication of statistics. It was their view that Network Rail would be classified as a private sector corporation &mdash; once its board has been ratified by its membership &mdash; and that the company's borrowing could be classified as private sector borrowing in the national accounts. In reaching this conclusion the ONS has, I understand, based their considerations upon the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95).</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/3">As I explained to the House in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-27">27 June</phrase> the SRA is providing Network Rail with standby credit facilities. It is the commercial debt markets that will provide the required borrowing for Network Rail, with the credit facilities called upon in identified, though unlikely, circumstances. On this basis the SRA's standby credit facilities are considered to be contingent liabilities and would only score as public expenditure in the extremely unlikely event of them being called upon.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/4">The Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office has, in his capacity as auditor of the SRA, concluded that Network Rail should be accounted for as a subsidiary of the SRA. This judgement is based on the application of UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK-GAAP). As such the expenditure and liabilities of Network Rail will be accounted for in an open and transparent way&mdash;a very welcome step.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/5">The provision of any funds necessary to meet the SRA's financial obligations could be made by way of grant under paragraph 7 of schedule 14 of the Transport Act 2000 or by permitting the SRA to borrow in accordance with paragraph 8 of that schedule. Whether the SRA's financial obligations (subject to normal supply procedures) would be met by a grant, by allowing it to borrow, or a mixture of both would be determined if the need arose.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/6">It therefore remains my intention to proceed as proposed and incur the liabilities set out in the minutes.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.9/7">The Government judges that the contingent liabilities set out in the minutes I laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-27">27 June</phrase> provide robust means of quickly setting up a strong and well-managed company to take over the responsibilities of Railtrack as network operator. And to do so by uniting the rail industry to work together under the strategic guidance of the SRA with Government with the overall aim of delivering the efficient, safe and reliable railway network that customers want.</p>

Safeguards in relation to the postal voting have been in place for many years, and we have no reason to believe that they do not operate satisfactorily in all postal ballots. The Electoral Commission is evaluating the local authority pilot schemes that ran all postal ballots in the May 2002 local and mayoral elections, including issues such as security and privacy. The Commission will publish its report on <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-01">1 August 2002</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".577W.0/2">CDC Capital Partners does not ask for or receive exemptions on environmental regulations on any of its investments. CDC makes investments on the basis that any shortfall in the standards of social and environmental performance of the company, not only against local legislation but also against international good practice, will be addressed. Where substantial environmental improvements are required, it is possible that the investee company will request exemption from local environmental regulation in the short term, but this is only acceptable to CDC in the context of long-term improvement.</p>

	<p pid=".578W.8/2">An environmental impact study is carried out by CDC on every investment where the environmental risk is high, and where thorough mitigation, management and monitoring is therefore required. Where the risk is perceived to be medium or low, a detailed study and management plan is not required but a basic assessment of environmental issues will be undertaken by the Investment Manager, with advice from CDC's Business Principles Unit.</p>
	<p pid=".578W.8/3">CDC does not hold records of environmental impact studies going back to 1997, but the following investments made in each of the years 1997 to 2002 were subject to a detailed environmental review.</p>

	<p pid=".585W.2/1">The primary factor in the continuing violence in eastern DRC is the absence of a political settlement between the main parties to the conflict and the attempt by forces that supported the genocide in Rwanda to invade the country. The final report of the UN Panel on resource exploitation in the DRC is due in the autumn. We shall study the report carefully and participate fully in the Security Council's deliberations on its recommendations. We are very conscious that the sad history of the Congo has meant that these resources have never been used for the benefit of the people of the Congo. We continue to believe that the surest way of converting resource exploitation into legitimate trade to benefit the Congolese people is to achieve an end to the conflict and restore peace in the region.</p>

The MDTF will help enable the country's debt to international financial institutions to be serviced in a timely manner.

	<p pid=".589W.0/1">The purpose of the Government of Albania, DFID and World Bank Poverty and Environment Workshop was to sensitise and raise awareness among a broad stakeholder group of the issues and links surrounding effective environmental management, poverty reduction and economic growth in Albania. This was done in the context of Albania's preparation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy paper. The group agreed several recommendations which have not been published but which were taken into account in the preparation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. A copy is in the Libraries of the House.</p>

It is an institutional building project focused at local and national levels with communities, government, NGOs and Civil Society to enhance the capacity of local communities to improve rural livelihoods.

	<p pid=".591W.8/1">The World Bank and IMF both have key roles to play in the Great Lakes region in supporting programmes for the demobilisation and reintegration of armed groups, post-conflict reconstruction and longer term economic development, and I believe the two institutions are approaching these tasks constructively. However the primary requirement remains to achieve a settlement of the Great Lakes conflict, without which no regeneration programmes can be successful. We continue to believe that full re-engagement by the Bank and IMF in the Democratic Republic of the Congo should be contingent upon achievement of an inclusive political settlement as provided for under the Lusaka peace accords.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.0/1">We attach considerable importance to engaging with a wide range of groups across society on our international development work, for example through our Development Policy Forums, publications and briefing notes on major international meetings. However, the nature of the issues for which my department is responsible mean that formal consultation processes are likely to be of interest only to a limited range of people. So while we take account of the principles set out in the Cabinet Office Code of Practice on Written Consultations, and have appointed a designated consultation co-ordinator in accordance with the Code, we do not regard our consultation activities as generally falling within the full provisions of the Code.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.0/4">The consultation document was made available in print, and in electronic form via the DFID website. It is DFID practice to make consultation documents available in print and on line until the publication of the finished document. No complaints were received in 2001 regarding this document. At the close of the consultation period the results were published as a final DFID Target Strategy Paper.</p>

	<p pid=".596W.5/1">Interim payments are discretionary payments on account of benefit which can be made to avoid hardship where the Decision Maker is satisfied that the basic conditions of entitlement for the benefit are met. Interim payments can be made in a number of circumstances:</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/2">where a benefit claim has been made but cannot immediately be determined and the delay is not the fault of the customer;</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/3">in an emergency. This covers a variety of different situations from civil emergencies to industrial action;</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/4">where a claim has not been made in the correct manner but it is not the fault of the customer, for example because the claim form has been completed incorrectly by a visiting officer;</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/5">while an appeal is ongoing but the customer clearly has some residual entitlement to benefit;</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/6">Interim payments follow the same payment cycles and periods as the main benefit being claimed and are not made before the person's first benefit pay day. The amount of any payment is recoverable from the main benefit when it is awarded.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/7">&quot;Alignment payment&quot; is an administrative term used to describe Social Fund crisis loans made to help with day to day living expenses to people awaiting a first payment of benefit which is paid in arrears. Any crisis loans made under these circumstances will cover the recipients' needs until their first benefit pay day, following which full or interim payments of benefit can be made. Alignment payments can also be made to people moving from benefit into work who need financial help until they receive their first wage.</p>

	<p pid=".599W.8/1">The purpose of the child support reforms is to ensure that more children receive the maintenance that is their right.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.8/2">To achieve this, the Government has legislated, in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, for a new child support scheme. This is simpler than the current scheme. This reduction in complexity will translate into fewer resources being required for initial and further assessment of cases, enabling more resources to be put into ensuring that liabilities are enforced.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.8/3">To support the Child Support Agency in its administration of the new scheme, a new IT system is being built. The new scheme will only be introduced when the technical backup necessary to make a success of the scheme is in place. The combination of modern technology, informing the staff of the Child Support Agency of a failure to pay maintenance, and the Agency having more resources to act on that information, should ensure that maintenance due to children is paid.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.8/4">In further support of the new scheme, to deter those seeking to avoid their responsibilities, section 13 of the Act created two new criminal offences, of failing to give information and of knowingly giving false information. Conviction for either of these offences carries fines of up to &pound;1,000. The provision has been in force since last year.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.5/1">County Court judgments are principally paid directly to the person who is owed the money. Court leaflets advise the defendant to liaise with the claimant on which method of payment is most suitable, but suggest using a method which provides proof of payment. The only circumstance where payment of a judgment debt will be accepted by a court is where enforcement has been initiated, for example through a bailiff's warrant. In 2000 the Court Service piloted a system which gave the defendant the option of paying his/her judgment debt by debit card. The take up rate of this service was very low so it was decided not to implement this system across the courts at that time. We will keep this issue under review.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.5/2">At present fines issued by county court judges for contempt of court can only be paid by cash or cheque. The Court Service is considering ways of providing court users with more choices in a number of areas, including payment methods. For instance, users can already issue a claim on line via the internet and pay the fee for that claim using a debit or credit card.</p>

	<p pid=".612W.7/2">The original contract, which covered the Docman project as well as the provision of internal IT services was signed in January 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.7/3">The reasons for taking the PFI route were:</p>
	<p pid=".612W.7/4">The size of the task was too great for the SFO to manage in house;</p>
	<p pid=".612W.7/5">The main task was the creation of an on-line document management system and this represented a major item of software which was to be written by suppliers;</p>
	<p pid=".612W.7/6">The contract transferred the majority of the project risk to the suppliers;</p>
	<p pid=".612W.7/7">The contract included a significant element of service, which permitted the suppliers to be paid in terms of the number of cases using the completed system.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.7/8">The whole project represented value for money. It is not practical to quantify the savings, which would have been made from adopting the PFI route as opposed to a non PFI route as the Docman project did not proceed on the lines planned. The contract was amended in September 2000 to exclude the Docman project. This is now being carried forward separately on a non-PFI basis. The first case went live on the Docman system in June 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".618W.3/2">As with any large organisation, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has turnover of staff. Table 1 (attached) shows that, there has not been a significant staff turnover in Derbyshire, Hertfordshire, Humberside or North Wales CPS, over the last twelve months, as compared to the national average for the CPS. The main reason for the loss of staff has been resignations.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.3/3">In recent months Derbyshire, Hertfordshire, Humberside have seen an increase in the number of staff employed.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.3/4">Loss of staff, particularly if they are experienced, impacts on the working of any organisation. New staff requires induction and training, which may vary from going on appropriate courses to &quot;on the job&quot; training. Inevitably this affects the training budget. It also means new staff members take some time before they are fully effective. However, the introduction of new staff, especially where they represent an addition to the existing numbers, is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.3/5">Table 2 (attached) shows the proportion of each local Area budget spent on training against their total running costs.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.6/1">Tables 5.1 to 5.5 in the Departmental Report for 2002 contain a number of errors. These arose from differences in the way information is loaded on central data bases, complications with compiling historical information following the recent Machinery of Government changes, and the re-structuring of DEFRA with the revised objectives that followed. Unfortunately, the tight timetable for producing these tables interfered with the quality assurance procedures that would normally have applied.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.6/2">The Department's quality assurance procedures are being revised to prevent similar errors in future. Meanwhile, work is in hand to re-issue corrected tables. This is a significant task involving the re-loading of central data bases which are subject to a number of timetable constraints. The intention is to provide revised figures by the Autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.6/3">Meanwhile, it is possible to clarify that underlying provision for resources available to control animal disease have risen in real terms over the period as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".625W.2/2">When the EC Water Framework Directive is transposed into English and Welsh law, it will require consideration of all aspects of the water cycle with an emphasis on ecological water quality. In implementing the Water Framework Directive, it will be important to ensure effective integration between the Directive requirements and Water Level Management Plans (WLMPs). WLMPs are designed to be reviewed at regular intervals and should incorporate any guidance which arises as a result of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/3">The operating authorities (Environment Agency, Internal Drainage Boards or Local Authorities) are the competent authorities in respect of ensuring that WLMPs comply with the Habitats and Birds Directives. They have a duty to ensure that their activities, including those relevant to water level management, comply with the Directives, as implemented in the UK by the Habitats Regulations. Under these Regulations they are required to assess whether any schemes which are not necessary for site management for nature conservation are likely to have a significant effect on the site. If so, an Appropriate Assessment must be undertaken before any works can be carried out. We are not aware of any Appropriate Assessments completed to date in relation WLMPs. English Nature and the operating authorities are working with DEFRA on guidelines to provide advice to operating authorities in undertaking such an Appropriate Assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/4">Operating Authorities draw up WLMPs in consultation with English Nature, who propose conservation objectives for each plan. All WLMPs must be agreed with English Nature before implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/5">In 1999, MAFF issued guidance to flood and coastal defence operating authorities on conservation benefits and WLMPs. This guidance was agreed with English Nature and the RSPB, as well as the operating authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.2/2">The decision as to whether a Water Level Management Plan (WLMP) is based on individual hydrological units or numerous units will depend on technical, environmental and economic factors which vary significantly between sites. As a result, all Water Level Management Plans are designed and implemented on a case-by-case basis and there is no policy on a preferred approach. In many cases, particularly for relatively small, discrete sites, operating authorities have prepared a single plan to cover all the hydrological units within an international site. However, for larger sites with separate hydrological units that have different operating authorities (e.g. the Somerset Levels), separate WLMPs have been prepared, for example, for each constituent Site of Special Scientific Interest.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.2/3">DEFRA is currently working with English Nature and the operating authorities to prepare guidance on the effects of the Habitats Regulations on Water Level Management Plans. Amongst other things, this will advise operating authorities on the geographical scale at which the implications for the Habitats Regulations should be considered.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.0/18">When DEFRA was created, the objective was have a step change in the way environment, agriculture and rural issues were treated in Government. The aim was to create a department with sustainable development at its heart&mdash;and with responsibility for supporting sustainable development across Government. For DEFRA this means working to achieve a better environment at home and internationally. It also means a food and farming industry working within a prosperous countryside, producing the food that consumers want in harmony with the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.0/19">For the Government as a whole, sustainable development goes much further. The vital importance of sustainable development for Government as a whole underlay the decision to make it a central theme of the Spending Review. As custodian of the Government's sustainable development strategy, I particularly welcome the elements of the Settlement, for my own Department and for others, which will deliver significant improvements in key policy areas. These include: Climate change&mdash;where we will invest in innovation to meet our Climate Change objectives, building on existing funding for renewable energy sources with an additional &pound;38 million in 2005&ndash;06 compared with 2002&ndash;03, and make further progress towards our greenhouse gas emissions targets Health&mdash;where we have announced the biggest ever sustained spending growth in the history of the NHS, to improve health outcomes and the quality of care for patients; Education&mdash;where increased spending and further reforms are aimed at getting and helping 16&ndash;19 year olds into further education; And Crime&mdash;where extra funding for the police will help them target reductions in vehicle crime, domestic burglaries and robbery, and reduce the gap between the highest crime local areas and the best comparable areas In addition, new spending on transport and regeneration will improve the quality of our local environments. For example, capital expenditure on capital transport plans&mdash;which includes expenditure on home zones, cycling, walking and local safety schemes&mdash;is doubling in real terms from 2001&ndash;2011 as part of the Ten Year Transport plan. The Neighbourhood Renewal fund is being increased from &pound;400 million in 2003&ndash;04 to &pound;525 million in 2005&ndash;06, in part reflecting an increased commitment to safer and cleaner communities. Let me now explain how the Spending Review settlement will impact on DEFRA's programmes over the next three years and will assist the Department in pursuing its aims and objectives. <i>Departmental Spending Plans</i> <i>Sustainable Farming and Food</i> When DEFRA was created, the farming industry was in crisis. Foot and mouth disease, coupled with the lowest farm incomes in many years&mdash;had destroyed farmers' confidence, and in some cases, their livelihoods. The Review provides DEFRA with the resources to make progress&mdash;working together with the industry&mdash;towards a more sustainable future for the farming and food industries. Investment totalling over &pound;500 million over three years will be available to support the key recommendations of the Policy Commission chaired by Sir Don Curry, and to improve animal health and welfare: Action through the England Rural Development Programme, including: A new broad and shallow agri-environment scheme which will reward farmers for delivering environmentally friendly outcomes to be piloted over the next 2 years and then rolled out in full in 2005&ndash;06; An expansion of schemes such as the Rural Enterprise Scheme, the Processing and Marketing Grants Scheme, and the Vocational Training Scheme, to assist people in rural areas retrain, diversify and extend their businesses; A more efficient food chain; Enhanced farm advice; Further measures to improve animal health and welfare, including livestock identification and tracing systems, enhanced testing for TSE-type disease (such as BSE); and further action to prevent illegal meat imports. The additional funding will rise to &pound;200 million in 2005&ndash;06 of which &pound;75 million has been specifically allocated to fund, alongside equivalent EU funding, the full roll-out of the new agri-environment scheme in England. Additional funding will also be made available to the Devolved Administrations to allow them to increase expenditure on their Rural Development Programmes. In return for the investment in their industry, farmers will be expected to play their part in making the industry sustainable, for example by acting to reduce the risks of animal diseases. I know they will co-operate with us fully in achieving these joint goals. The Government will continue to press for radical reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) in the negotiations on the Mid-Term Review of Agenda 2000 which began earlier this week. But the resources allocated in the Spending Review allow DEFRA to press ahead with reform and modernisation of the farming industry now. The Department will publish its strategy for sustainable farming and food in the autumn. I am very pleased that Sir Don Curry has agreed to chair a Group which will act as a driver and overseer of change in the farming and food sectors through the implementation of the farming and food strategy, to ensure that we move rapidly towards a more sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food industry which contributes to a thriving rural economy. The Group will report to me. The Settlement recognises the need to prevent, control and manage the risk of animal disease, where we are driven by the memory of last year's outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease as well as the legacy of BSE. The additional resources provided will allow funding of a wide range of work on animal health issues These measures will be set in the context of a comprehensive animal health and welfare strategy, as recommended by the Policy Commission. This will address ways in which the industry should bear its share of the costs of animal health controls and services. I am also please to be able to announce that we have secured additional funds to deal with Bovine TB this year. These will be used to pay for the extra staff and resources already committed to work on the TB testing backlog and control measures, and additional casual staff who will be recruited to supplement this work. Testing is being carried out on the basis of a veterinary risk assessment, with those posing the greatest risk being tested first. <i>A countryside for all to enjoy</i> In addition to the new agri-environment scheme, which will play an important role in making the countryside more attractive and in helping to preserve biodiversity, the Spending Review has allocated an additional &pound;5 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;10 million in 2005&ndash;06 for work in bringing our major wildlife sites into favourable condition. In addition, the extra funding of &pound;5 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;10 million in the two following years to implement the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act will increase public access and enjoyment of our beautiful countryside landscapes. <i>Thriving rural economies and communities</i> The investment in sustainable food and farming, in improving the condition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and in opening up access to the countryside will benefit the wider rural economy. However, DEFRA's leadership role on rural affairs goes beyond this and our new rural PSA target reflects this. It commits us to reducing the gap in productivity between the least well performing rural areas and the English average and making services more accessible for rural people. DEFRA will work with other Government Departments and agencies to deliver this and to ensure that the rural-proofing of their policies and programmes helps to deliver real improvements in prosperity and access to public services. The Spending Review White Paper sets out a range of commitments from other Departments to deliver key services in rural areas, and ensure that rural people benefit from the extra resources delivered through the review. The extra &pound;25 million allocated in the Settlement over three years, will further increase the additional funds announced in the Rural White Paper to help regenerate in market towns and improve the ability of rural communities and the rural voluntary sector to deliver services in support of the socially excluded and progress towards solutions to key rural concerns in each region. <i>Protecting our communities from flooding</i> Government investment in flood defence has increased significantly in real terms since 1997. Additional funding of &pound;15 million a year was made available in the wake of the autumn 2000 floods. The new funds over and above this which have been allocated in the Spending Review will ensure that this growth will now accelerate to reach 8.6 per cent a year in real terms over the SR2002 period. The further allocation to the Department of &pound;15 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;40 million in 2005&ndash;06, together with the amounts available for grants to local authorities and the revenues we expect to be able to raise from new funding mechanisms, will deliver an increase of &pound;150 million in the third year of the Review. This level of resources, together with simplification of the administration of flood defences and effective partnership working with homeowners, local government, the Environment Agency, scientists and the insurance industry will allow us to reduce the risk of threats to life and damage to property from flooding. <i>Sustainable use of resources: the challenge from waste</i> The Spending Review Settlement takes into account the pressures on local government and provides for spending on environmental, protective and cultural services, including waste management, to rise by &pound;671 million by 2005&ndash;06. The funds will also enable them to deal with the short-term problems of fridge disposal and changes to the legislation on hazardous waste. Final decisions on additional resources for addressing the challenge of growth in municipal waste and moving away from landfill disposal and on other policy measures will be made available when the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) publishes its report into sustainable waste management in the autumn. These decisions and those on landfill tax and the future of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS) will deliver a step change in performance. DEFRA's PSA target of 25 per cent recycling and composting of household waste by 2005&ndash;6 demonstrates the government's commitment to radical reform of municipal waste management. <i>Science</i> Evidence-based policy work is central to DEFRA's approach. I want, at the very least, to maintain the Department's expenditure on research in real terms over the Spending Review period. This is consistent with our commitment to the development of a strong and high quality science base. It will ensure that DEFRA's policy making continues to be based in the latest evidence and scientific and economic analysis. We will aim to increase science spending in our identified priority areas. These include: environmental horizon-scanning, climate change and extreme weather, a supercomputer to strengthen the UK climate change research capability, non-food crops, organic food production, and animal disease. We will also examine the findings of the Foot and Mouth Disease inquiries closely and determine if any additional funding for research is required in these areas. <i>Investment in the Department</i> A theme of the Spending Review across all Departments has been ensuring that they have the necessary capacity to deliver. That has been a primary focus of the Developing DEFRA change programme that was set up after the Department was created last year. Additional funding of &pound;140 million over the Spending Review period for investment in the Department will enable it to take forward the next phase of the change programme flowing from the recent Joint Strategic Review carried out with the Office for Public Service Reform (OPSR). The investment will give staff the tools they need to change their ways of working, focus on customers and deliver the high quality services that will build DEFRA's reputation as a respected, high performing, and efficient Department. <i>Forestry Commission</i> The Forestry Commission is funded on a net basis after taking account of the income it received, mainly from sales of timber from the public forests. Its timber income has fallen significantly in recent years due to a worldwide slump in timber prices. The Spending Review Settlement provides additional funding of &pound;5 million a year on top of the 2003&ndash;04 baseline to enable the Commission to continue to drive forward the Government's England Forestry Strategy despite the reduction in timber income. This new money underlines forestry's important place in England's rural affairs and will allow the Commission to extend sustainable forests management, restore more native woodlands, increase community forests and the role of forests in tackling industrial dereliction. In addition to the funding shown in the White Paper, the Commission is also benefiting from special funding from the Capital Modernisation Fund and the Invest to Save Budget amounting to almost &pound;11 million in the next 2 years. <i>Conclusion</i> Spending by the Department in 2005&ndash;06 will be more than &pound;400 million higher than in 2002&ndash;03, supporting a programme of reform. It fulfils the Government's pledge to introduce a significant programme of measures to move the food and farming industries to a long-term sustainable basis, to create thriving and prosperous rural economies and communities and to improve the environment. And it takes full account of the Department's lead role in promoting sustainable development across Government for the good of our citizens, both now and in the future.</p>

Alongside this, the Government has given the RDAs financial flexibility to pursue their regional priorities. From <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, the RDAs are getting their funding from Government as a single funding stream which they can use as they judge best in order to meet a set of agreed targets. Under this general framework there is also a modest component of extra funding specifically designated for manufacturing to match fund RDAs' Regional Centres for Manufacturing Excellence (delivering the Manufacturing Advisory Service) but their role is not specifically one of job creation. However, one of the underpinning objectives of the single pot is to increase competitiveness and therefore employment, including in the manufacturing sector. The RDAs are working closely with Government to put in place strategies at the national and regional levels which will encourage the development of a strong and forward-looking manufacturing sector.</p>

By March 2002, the target reduction to 901 beds had been met. London Boroughs received their share of the &pound;300 million made available through the Building Care Capacity Grant to end unnecessary delayed discharges from hospital. Their total allocation was &pound;42,560,387 over the two years 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.12/3">London Boroughs have agreed challenging targets for further reductions, averaging between 20 per cent and 25 per cent by March 2003. The targets were set as part of the conditions for receiving the grant. For Personal Social Services, we have already announced annual average growth in real terms of 6 per cent from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06.</p>

TPI is an important initiative designed to help modernise further education (FE) pay arrangements and to recruit, reward and retain teachers and lecturers as part of the drive to improve teaching and learning. Alongside TPI, we are introducing Training Bursaries, Golden Hellos and, subject to the approval of Parliament, a scheme to pay-off over time the student loans of new teachers in FE shortage subject areas. All of these initiatives offer significant financial rewards both to students training to be FE lecturers as well as those taking up teaching posts in FE shortage subject areas.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.8/2">It is hard to compare progress on final allocations in 2002&ndash;03 with earlier years since the process is now different. In the past, the allocation of funding to colleges did not take into account colleges' previous performance. The old system of funding led to some colleges bidding and receiving funding for unachievable growth targets, retaining funds which their performance did not justify (last year estimated at over &pound;150 millions) which could more usefully have been allocated elsewhere, and ultimately having to pay the money back.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.8/3">This year, as part of our drive to improve standards, performance and efficiency, and target funding where it can have the most impact, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has used its budgetary discretion so that money is allocated more effectively. It has introduced new arrangements which will stimulate growth, particularly for 16&ndash;18 year olds and basic skills, by putting in place a more robust allocations process and challenging those providers who have consistently been unable to achieve their projected performance levels in the past. This process has led to detailed and at times protracted negotiations with some providers. However it has ensured that we no longer have millions of pounds sitting in college bank accounts not working effectively towards our priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.8/4">Despite this change which might have been expected to cause delays, by <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-05">5 July</phrase> the LSC had made 313 (48 per cent) final allocations to colleges. This is well ahead of last year when only 16 per cent of institutions had received final allocations by the first week in July. We recognise however that there is still considerable scope for improvement and the LSC is looking at ways of doing better in the future so that final allocations can be made even earlier.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.2/1">It is important that all teachers are properly prepared for the range of special educational needs (SEN) they will encounter in schools. That is why, as part of their initial teacher training, all student teachers must show that they understand their responsibilities under the SEN Code of Practice, and know how to seek advice where necessary. These skills are reinforced and developed during their induction period, when teachers have to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils with SEN.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.2/2">There are no specific training requirements placed on teachers in relation to dealing with pupils diagnosed with either Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or specific learning difficulties, such as dyslexia. However, opportunities for in-service training and continuing professional development for teachers in post are supported under the training component of the SEN category of the Department's Standards Fund, through which &pound;91 million of locally supported expenditure is available for SEN in 2002&ndash;03. Under the Standards Fund, LEAs and schools can draw on grant aid to address the training and development needs of teachers, and other staff, in relation to particular SEN conditions, including ADHD and dyslexia. The support on offer covers activity ranging from awareness raising events to more specialised in-depth training. It is, however, for individual local education authorities and schools to determine and prioritise the training and development needs of their staff, in the light of local circumstances. We have also introduced in 2002&ndash;03 two new &pound;1 million funding streams, under the SEN Small Programme Fund and the SEN Training and Development Fund, to support the creation of new or extended training opportunities and resources for teachers and other staff. Under these initiatives, competitive bids were invited from voluntary organisations and higher education institutions. Included amongst the successful bids were a number of ADHD and dyslexia projects.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.3/1">The Department has discussed the safety of CCA pressure-treated wood with officials from the Department of Health. We have also discussed the issue with DTI who represent the views of the Construction Industry; and with HSE who carried out a risk assessment of CCA products used to treat wood, under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.3/2">In the UK wood preservatives are covered by the Control of Pesticide Regulations, and the Health and Safety Executive lead on such non-agricultural pesticides. CCA is approved for the pre-treatment of timber by pressure impregnation at industrial sites. This follows the advice to Ministers from the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) that such products do not present any risk to human health or the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.3/3">Recently the EU Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment advised that there was a small risk to children from the use of CCA treated wood in playground equipment. Applying the precautionary principle, the Commission have subsequently drawn up proposals under the Marketing and Use Directive, which would prevent the use of CCA treated wood, with some exceptions such as for railway sleepers and electricity and telephone poles. This would prevent its use in playground equipment.</p>

However Copper Chrome Arsenic (CCA) pressure-treated wood preservative is the most common wood preservative for softwoods which are often used externally and have been used extensively in playgrounds. There are alternative materials which can be used in place of CCA treated wood in playground equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.2/3">Both the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills are committed to ensuring that there is a balanced and diverse medical student population of the requisite quality to meet the demand for doctors. This is a matter for ongoing discussion with the universities and medical schools. The Department and Higher Education Funding Council for England joint medical expansion group will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/4">Universities are autonomous bodies who are responsible for operating their own application systems but they collectively adhere to the &quot;Guiding Principles for the Admission of Medical Students&quot; issued by the Council of Heads of Medical Schools in February 1999. This guidance follows principles of fairness, diversity and equity in access.</p>

	<p pid=".660W.2/2">In September 2001 there were 1126 people who experienced a delayed transfer of care from an acute hospital bed in London. By March 2002, the target reduction to 901 beds had been met. London Boroughs received their share of the &pound;300 million made available through the Building Care Capacity Grant to end unnecessary delayed discharges from hospital. Their total allocation was &pound;42,560,387 over the two years 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".660W.2/3">London Boroughs have agreed challenging targets for further reductions, averaging between 20 per cent and 25 per cent by March 2003. The targets were set as part of the conditions for receiving the grant. For Personal Social Services, we have already announced annual average growth in real terms of 6 per cent from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.2/2">The proposals in the Draft Mental Health Bill have been the subject of a long process of consultation by the Government, starting with the Green Paper <i>Reform of the Mental Health Act 1983</i> published in November 1999. Responses to that document (where the respondent gave permission) were placed in the Libraries of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Since then there have been informal discussions with key stakeholders and letters have been received, for example following the publication of the White Paper <i>Reforming the Mental Health Act</i> published in December 2000. None of these, however, were part of a formal consultation process and there was no expectation by those making representations that the comments would be made public.</p>

	<p pid=".662W.5/1">Working people who are receiving Working Families' Tax Credit or Disabled Person's Tax Credit at the full rate or maximum credit reduced by &pound;72.20 or less per week do not have to pay National Health Service dental charges. Others on a low income may be entitled to free treatment via the NHS low income scheme and those not entitled to full remission of charges may get partial help under this scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".662W.5/2">The table below shows the number of exempt adult courses of treatment in England for the years 1996&ndash;97 to 2000&ndash;01. It is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the impact of dental charges from these figures, but the most likely explanation is that they reflect an improvement in economic circumstances. Research has indicated that increases in charges do not have any significant long-term effect on attendance. There are many factors that influence attendance patterns, the primary ones being attitude and habit.</p>

	<p pid=".668W.0/1">No statistical data are collected on offences that may have been committed due to specific drug taking. However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research published between 1998 and 2001 sheds some light on the links between drugs and acquisitive crime. The research is insufficiently advanced to reveal the precise links between drugs and violent crime.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/2">What the most recently published research does indicate is that users of both heroin and cocaine/crack (just under a quarter of the arrestees interviewed) are responsible for more than 60 per cent of the illegal income reported. Furthermore, 53 per cent of the arrestees reported having committed one or more acquisitive crimes in the last year. This increased to 62 per cent of those who had used any drug in the past 12 months, and 75 per cent of those who had used heroin and/or cocaine/crack in the last year. The latter group reported an average of 432 acquisitive crimes in the year&mdash;nearly 10 times the rate for non-drug-users. Therefore, drug use in general, and especially use of heroin and/or cocaine/crack, is associated with higher levels of crime.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/3">There is little evidence of any strong links between acquisitive or violent crime and cannabis, amphetamine, ecstasy or LSD use.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.2/12">The police can arrest someone who is in possession of cannabis, as a dealer, if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that the person has committed an offence of possession with intent to supply. The Home Affairs Committee, however, was not persuaded that an intent to supply should be presumed on the basis of the amount of a drug found and the Government has accepted this view. There would be considerable practical difficulty in setting a figure for the amount of cannabis possessed to constitute a criminal offence of possession with intent to supply. Dealers would exploit this by ensuring that the amount of the drug held by them remained below such a figure. The amount of the drug found in possession is an important factor, but not the only one, to consider in deciding on intent to supply. Other factors, such as other items in the person's possession or intelligence information gathered, might also be relevant.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.2/13">The Association of Chief Police Officers is currently developing a model for enforcing cannabis possession offences which they expect to issue this Autumn, following consultation. It is expected that the majority of first offences of cannabis possession by an adult will be dealt with by way of a formal warning from the police, together with confiscation of the drug. Further offending, or offending where there are aggravating factors, such as that involving a flagrant disregard for the law or which threatens public order, could result in arrest, followed by a caution or prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.2/14">Youth offenders will be dealt with in the same manner as they are for all other offences, as detailed in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 Final Warning Scheme. Under that scheme, they should be reported for the offence and a decision should be made on their case disposal from the options of a reprimand, final warning or charge. A young person with no previous offending history should receive a reprimand. A second offence will lead to a warning or charge, depending on its seriousness. Any further offending following a warning will normally result in a charge being brought.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.2/15">Frequent use is an indication of vulnerability and this needs to be taken seriously. Hence, after a final warning, a youth offender must be referred to the Youth Offending Team to arrange a rehabilitation programme to prevent reoffending.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.2/16">We are currently launching local Safer Schools Partnerships with an initial 100 police officers in schools by September, which will help to make the communities around schools safer places to be. The Department for Education and Skills encourages all schools to have a drug incident management policy agreed by the governors, staff and parents in consultation with the local police. Schools are also encouraged to involve pupils in this process.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.2/17">We are considering the introduction of a separate criminal offence of supplying drugs to young people which would attract higher maximum sentences than are currently available. Those who deal near schools would be sentenced severely.</p>

	<p pid=".670W.2/1">Under the Police Act 1996 the Home Secretary sets strategic objectives for the police. These are commonly known as the Ministerial Priorities. For the current year, 2002&ndash;03, these are:</p>

We are working on a package of measures to help reverse the decline in the number of special constables by improving the way they are recruited, managed and deployed. We are publishing guidance on good practice by the end of the year. We are also keen to improve liaison with employers and to encourage recognition of the wealth of skills and experience that specials bring to the workplace. We have also set aside &pound;300,000 to help &quot;specials champions&quot; drive forward initiatives to improve recruitment and retention.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.6/2">The Home Office in association with the trade association for credit card companies has set up a two-year pilot of a unique policing unit, the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit. The unit, based in London, was launched in April 2002, with the Home Office providing 25 per cent of the funding requirement.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.6/3">The Home Office is also actively supporting the credit card companies in their work towards implementation of Chip and personal identification number (PIN) by April 2005. Under this initiative, microchips will be introduced into payment cards to help authentication. This will be combined with the introduction of PIN as a more secure method of authentication than signature.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.6/4">Officials are in frequent contact with the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) to discuss and encourage implementation of other credit card fraud reduction initiatives such as verification of Internet transactions.</p>

Information on the age of victim is only available from the 2000 sweep of the British Crime Survey (BCS). The BCS estimates that in 1999 there were 273,000 personal crimes in England and Wales committed against those aged 65 and over. Those aged 65 and over represent 20 per cent of the population for England and Wales, but only experience 4.9 per cent of all personal crimes. The BCS also estimates that there were a further 1,090,000 household crimes against households headed by persons aged 65 or over. These BCS figures cannot be reliably broken down to constabulary level.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/2">Personal offences here covers assault, robbery, theft from the person, other personal theft. Household offences here covers bicycle theft, burglary, theft in a dwelling, other household theft, theft of and from vehicles and vandalism to household property and vehicles. The BCS does not cover crime against those not living in private households, for example in care homes.</p>

	<p pid=".681W.5/1">British Crime Surveys show that elderly people are far less likely to suffer crime than younger people. But we recognise the impact that crime can have on elderly people. In addition to the work we are pursing to reduce crime generally, we have funded several schemes specifically to tackle crime against the elderly.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.5/2">We have set up a Distraction Burglary Task Force, with &pound;1 million Home Office funding, to gather data, publicise good practice, raise awareness and provide guidance for victims of this type of burglary, which is committed predominantly against the elderly.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.5/3">We have allocated over &pound;1 million, under the Crime Reduction Programme, to three distraction burglary projects in Leeds, Sheffield and a consortium of forces led by Derbyshire.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.5/4">We have funded a two-year programme to provide home security upgrades for low income pensioners in areas with burglary rates above the national average. This scheme runs in conjunction with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA's) Warm Front scheme, which provides heating and insulation improvements. By the end of May, some 114,000 eligible homes had been surveyed, of which over 58,000 are receiving additional locks or bolts.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.5/5">We know that people over the age of 65 are among the most likely to fear crime despite being the group least likely to become a victim of crime. Research suggests this may in part be because the impact of crime can be far more traumatic for the elderly and vulnerable than for those of a younger age.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.5/6">We are working closely with Age Concern and Help the Aged to identify ways to tackle misperceptions about the risk of victimisation and also to educate the elderly as to the sensible precautions they can take to protect themselves. The Home Office are seeking to run a workshop at the Help the Aged annual conference in October during which these issues will be addressed; solutions identified will be incorporated into the Home Office strategy for reducing the fear of crime.</p>

However, we are aware from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) ninth annual survey published this year of their concerns about the level of crime affecting retailers and the concerns they have that this is being driven by theft by drug and alcohol abusers. We are carrying out a commercial crime victimisation study of retail and manufacturing sectors later this year (the first for 10 years). This will give a firm basis for identifying the main crime problems affecting business and give valuable indicators of the best ways to tackle these issues.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.0/1">We do not collect this information.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.0/2">Our recent White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&mdash;Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain&quot; contains a proposal to allow those present in the United Kingdom (UK) in some other capacity to fill local vacancies as ministers of religion. It is envisaged that it is more likely that those who have already spent some time in the UK will have absorbed something of our culture and be better able therefore to relate their particular faith to the context of the UK. In addition, someone who has been in the UK is more likely to be able to speak English, which will enable him or her to play their part effectively as a religious leader and aid community relations. It will also be easier to verify the religious training or studies that have been undertaken by individuals whilst in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-14">14 January 2002</phrase>, the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) introduced two new guaranteed services at its counters: a premium same day service for renewals and a fast-track one week service for all applications. The standard service, available by post or through the UKPS High Street partners (i.e. selected branches of the Post Office and Worldchoice travel agents) is two weeks. This is not guaranteed but is currently being met in 99.5 per cent of applications. A pilot exercise to test the possibility of extending the fast track service to the High Street partners is currently taking place. Applications for passports can also be completed by telephone or on the Internet; the completed form is posted to the applicant for signature. Improvements to the electronic application channel are being developed on which the UKPS has sought the views of the Consultative Panel of Passport users. It would be technically possible for the improved electronic application channel to be available through private sector partnerships but there are no specific proposals at present.</p>
