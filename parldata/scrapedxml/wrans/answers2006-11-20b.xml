We expect that 26 schools will be eligible to make proposals under these arrangements in 2007, although it is not known how many will take up the opportunity. By 2008, we anticipate that 60 high performing schools will have used the 'presumption' arrangements to establish new sixth forms. Assumptions cannot be made at this time about 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.3W.0/2">We are also providing the capital investment to back this up. Refurbishment and new building of school science laboratories is a priority in most of the Department's capital programmes. Overall, we are supporting capital investment in schools of &pound;5.5 billion in 2005-06, &pound;5.9 billion in 2006-07 and &pound;6.4 billion in 2007-08. Every secondary school and every local authority is, for example, able to invest in laboratories, where this is needed. Our strategic programmes, Building Schools for the Future and Academies, are also providing brand new science laboratories: planning is underway for almost a third of secondary schools, with every school due to benefit over the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="b.3W.0/3">To back up the strategy and the investment, we are also ensuring that science facilities are designed to meet curriculum needs and to inspire excellent teaching and learning. &quot;Project Faraday&quot; has been launched to address this need. Teams of leading designers and educationalists with expertise in science teaching will develop a range of exemplar designs for school science laboratories by mid-2007. Science demonstration projects will then be built to provide practical examples, to act as benchmarks and to disseminate the learning. We will evaluate the project over a number of years.</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.2/1">Art and culture can play a significant role in regeneration. Examples of this can be seen across the country, such as the Lowry in Salford, the Sage in Newcastle-Gateshead and the Bellenden renewal area in Peckham, South London. My Department's publication &quot;Culture at the Heart of Regeneration&quot; highlighted how culture can drive regeneration by reviving town centres, drawing communities together and promoting economic development. The role of culture in regeneration has been strengthened by a joint agreement on sustainable communities, signed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, my Department and a number of its key non-departmental public bodies in July this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers and officials hold regular discussions with the Chinese Government on the full range of international issues, including Africa and the arms trade. This dialogue includes working with China as it seeks to improve its export controls and encouraging China to support work towards an arms trade treaty which would end the irresponsible trade in conventional arms. We are actively seeking to broaden and deepen our dialogue with China on issues relevant to Africa, both bilaterally and together with EU partners. For example, the EU/China summit in September agreed to a structured dialogue on Africa that we hope will begin soon. Key themes for this enhanced dialogue will be how the EU and China can work in ways which reinforce the principles for poverty reduction and sustainable development identified by the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development: peace, security, democracy, good governance, human rights and sound economic management.</p>

Although there will be no requirement for them to do so, sellers may include a commercially produced environmental report in the pack. These reports commonly include information on actual or potential environmental hazards, including the proximity of overhead transmission lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.10W.2/2">Government planning for housing policies aim to ensure that new housing is developed in the most sustainable locations. In deciding whether to allocate land for housing and whether to grant planning approvals, local planning authorities need to make assessments and consider a wide range of matters about the most appropriate and most suitable location for new homes. Such assessments would include the proximity to high voltage overhead power lines as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.15W.6/2">The FSA makes no distinction in its regulatory treatment of the sale of sealed pack, off-the-shelf, insurance policies and other forms of non-advised sales.

	<p pid="b.15W.6/3">For all products that they regulate, the FSA applies the principle that firms should treat their customers fairly and provide them with clear information. Firms are required to take reasonable steps to ensure that customers do not buy policies under which they are ineligible to claim benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.15W.6/4">Firms are also required to give customers a policy summary, in addition to the full policy information, to provide key information in a clear and easily digestible form. The summary must set out the significant features and benefits of the insurance and significant or unusual exclusions, so that customers can check that the insurance is appropriate for their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.15W.6/5">FSA rules also require that for non-investment insurance contracts firms offer retail customers a minimum cancellation period of 14 days for general insurance contracts and 30 days for pure protection contracts.</p>
