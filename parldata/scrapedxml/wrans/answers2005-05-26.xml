	<p pid=".158W.2/1">A table has been placed in the Library of the House showing the percentage change year-on-year on a like-for-like basis (i.e. after adjusting the base year for changes in the funding and functions of local authorities) of formula grant for the period 1999&ndash;2000 to 2005&ndash;06, together with the average percentage change over this period. Authorities have then been ranked by the average percentage increase over the period within class.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/2">Formula grant consists of the sum of the following grants (where appropriate):</p>

	<p pid=".158W.2/9">SSA reduction Grant (SSA Review), SSA Reduction Grant (Police Funding Review) and Central Support Protection Grant were damping grants provided to protect authorities from year-on-year changes in Revenue Support Grant, Redistributed Business Rates and Police Grant. In 2001&ndash;02 Central Support Protection Grant was replaced by floor and ceiling damping within Revenue Support Grant for authorities with education and personal social services responsibilities. In 2002&ndash;03, floor and ceiling damping was extended to all authorities. Floor and ceiling damping refers to the increase year-on-year in formula grant.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/10">As different classes of authorities provide different services it would be inappropriate to compare all authorities. Please note that the Combined Fire Authorities became precepting bodies in 2004&ndash;05, and therefore the average percentage increase in formula grant for these authorities refers to the two-year average for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.4/1">The UK has provided over &pound;100 million in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan since 2001. Afghanistan is gradually moving from being a failed state with urgent humanitarian and relief needs, to a post-conflict state with a growing economy and new state structures in need of sustained support. In response to this process of slow stabilisation, and at the request of the Afghan Government, DFID is increasingly focusing on support to long-term reconstruction and development.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.4/2">The UK continues to provide some targeted humanitarian support to Afghanistan through international agencies. In 2004&ndash;05, DFID gave &pound;2.5 million to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and &pound;0.5 million to the International Organisation for Migration to help Afghan refugees return to their homes. DFID contributed &pound;3 million to the Afghan Government's drought appeal in September 2004, of which &pound;0.7 million has been reallocated for flood protection following heavy rains in early 2005. Our support to cash for work programmes to help poppy farmers and labourers move to alternative livelihoods (over &pound;20 million in 2005&ndash;06) also meets humanitarian needs.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.4/3">DFID continues to provide substantial multi-annual support to the major multilateral organisations who deliver humanitarian assistance globally. A number of these, for example, the UNHCR and the United Nations Children's Fund, are still implementing major humanitarian programmes in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid=".163W.8/1">Donor co-ordination takes place at a number of levels: internationally, regionally and within partner countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) is the main international forum for bilateral donors to discuss co-operation and increased effectiveness of development assistance. As well as annual high-level meetings for heads and deputy heads of development agencies, there are a number of working parties and groups dealing with specific subject areas.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.8/2">The Paris High Level Forum in March this year brought together Ministers, heads of aid agencies and other senior officials from 60 partner countries, bilateral donors and the main multilateral institutions, to agree ways of making aid more effective. The Paris Declaration is the best statement yet of internationally agreed best practice on aid effectiveness with around 50 commitments, plus indicators and targets, to improve country ownership and donor harmonisation and alignment.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.8/3">The EU also provides a mechanism to increase coordination and harmonisation among member states. Last year the EU agreed an Action Plan on Harmonisation which included measures to improve co-ordination of EU development assistance at country level. The World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring and annual meetings also provide an opportunity for donors to coordinate policy on aid and development.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.8/4">There are also co-ordination mechanisms at regional level. For example the Strategic Partnership for Africa seeks to support poverty reduction in Africa by increasing the quality and quantity of aid.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.8/5">At country level World Bank led Consultative Groups review overall progress on poverty reduction and donor commitments to help governments achieve their poverty reduction objectives. The development of Poverty Reduction Strategy papers or similar national development strategies provides an opportunity for developing countries to coordinate donor support. In some countries partner governments lead donor co-ordination processes aimed at improving the overall coherence of donor support (for example, the Government of Tanzania are leading a joint assistance strategy). In some countries, donors have begun to undertake joint strategic planning. For example, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and DFID are developing a joint plan in Cambodia. There are also sector co-ordination processes in many countries particularly in health and education where many donors are present.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.8/6">DFID is working hard to improve the effectiveness of co-ordination and to increase developing country voice at all these levels. A principal concern is that there is no international forum in which total aid allocations to each country are reviewed. We believe that this results in some countries consistently receiving less than their fair share of aid.</p>

Through the programme, funding of &pound;500,000 has been allocated to equip 78 cinemas with subtitling and audio description equipment (&pound;350,000); develop a web-based information service to raise awareness of subtitled and audio-described screenings (&pound;50,000); assist UK distributors with producing subtitled and audio-described film prints (&pound;60,000); and conduct research into the ongoing needs of disabled audiences, both technically and in terms of awareness of available films and cinemas (&pound;40,000). The programme has so far been rolled out only across England, as the funding is an initial allocation from Arts Council England.

	<p pid=".174W.0/1">The Crown Prosecution Service's policy in cases of this kind is for the crown prosecutor concerned to write to the complainant to explain why the charge of rape has been discontinued or substantially altered. The Crown prosecutor will also offer a meeting with the complainant to discuss the decision. The meeting will usually be held at a CPS office or other suitable venue. The wishes of the complainant will be taken into account when deciding the venue.</p>
	<p pid=".174W.0/2">The policy affords the complainant an explanation for the decision and allows her to decide whether she wishes to have a meeting to discuss that decision further.</p>

	<p pid=".174W.3/2">The CPS policy is to prosecute rape cases as robustly and effectively as possible. In so doing, prosecutors should take advantage of special measures provisions, including now the ability to use a video recorded interview as evidence in chief, where it is right to do so. This has to be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the views and needs of the complainant. As such, there is no specific policy in relation to the use of video interviews.</p>

	<p pid=".188W.2/1">Since its beginnings in 1998, European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) has developed considerably. It has enabled the EU to launch three peacekeeping operations: in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2003); Macedonia (2003); and Bosnia (December 2004). The Bosnia operation took over from NATO's Stabilisation Force and is proving the efficacy of the Berlin Plus arrangements agreed in 2003 for EU access to NATO assets.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/2">The EU has also launched a number of civilian ESDP missions. These include police missions in Macedonia, Bosnia and the Democratic Republic of Congo; a rule of law mission in Georgia; and, most recently, an integrated rule of law mission for Iraq, to provide training for high and middle-ranking officials in the criminal justice system. The EU's first security sector reform mission, with both civilian and military elements, will be launched in the Democratic Republic of Congo on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-02">2 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/3">Beyond operations, successes include the establishment of the European Defence Agency in 2004 to drive forward capability development and improve defence-industrial co-operation; the continuing development of a capacity for military and joint civil/military planning, based on agreed consultation arrangements with NATO; and the establishment of Initial Operating Capability for the rapid-response Battlegroups initiative, with Full Operating Capability expected in 2007. Most recently, a Civil/Military Cell has been established to strengthen strategic planning for joint civil/military missions. It is still recruiting staff; once recruitment is complete, it will play an important part in the EU's efforts to improve the co-ordination of its wide range of security instruments in order to act more coherently and effectively in crisis management, not least in liaison with other key actors, such as the UN and the African Union.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/4">More broadly, the development of military and civilian capabilities continues, including post-tsunami work on improving the EU's disaster response capability. The agreed military Headline Goal 2010 focuses on deployability, sustainability and interoperability.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/5">The UK continues to play a leading role. For example, we proposed the Battlegroups initiative jointly with France, and have made a national Battlegroup available on standby for the first six months of Initial Operating Capability (January-June 2005); and the December 2004 Council agreement on planning capabilities was based on a UK-France-Germany proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/6">The Luxembourg Presidency will issue a report on ESDP progress at the European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-16">16 June</phrase>, which will be issued to Parliament for scrutiny.

	<p pid=".197W.8/2">Import and export entry clearance can now be handled, via electronic means, from any location. Given this, it is sensible to locate clearance activity where the best service can be provided to UK trade. Dover has three times as many staff as Chatham and, unlike Chatham, can provide a 24-hour service, seven days a week. Preliminary soundings among trade representatives has confirmed that this level of service will meet their operational needs.</p>

	<p pid=".198W.2/2">Felixstowe, Tilbury, Dover, Southampton, Manchester and Heathrow have been identified as the locations with the greatest volumes of activity. Together they currently handle around 85 per cent. of all UK imports and exports, have substantial numbers of trained staff who can handle the remaining 15 per cent. and are strategically located throughout the UK. The future of non location critical activity at these locations is being considered as part of a major international trade project. The trade are being consulted during this project.</p>

	<p pid=".202W.9/1">The Government's Improving Behaviour and Attendance Programme plays a crucial part in the drive to reduce antisocial behaviour in schools. We have a range of measures in place to reduce truancy and poor behaviour and reinforce parental responsibility for their child's behaviour. They include in-school Learning Support Units, multi-agency Behaviour and Education Support Teams, key workers for children at risk of crime, police in schools, and positive activity programmes in the school holidays. The programme also includes training for all school staff in managing pupil behaviour and preventing violence, as part of the Secondary National Strategy and Primary pilot. And we are encouraging schools to begin working together in collaborations to jointly tackle behaviour and attendance issues, greatly reducing the problems of persistent truancy and disruptive behaviour through early intervention and shared resources.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.9/2">In addition, the Anti-social Behaviour Act, which came into force in February 2004, has introduced penalty notices and parenting contracts for truancy and parenting contracts and orders for bad behaviour in schools.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.9/3">We also think it is important to tackle this through the school curriculum, where pupils learn about socially responsible behaviour as part of Citizenship education. And in primary schools, all pupils will soon have access to the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning materials, which we believe will contribute greatly to addressing the problems early and reducing antisocial behaviour both in and out of school.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.9/4">Last week it was announced that a new Stakeholder Group, to be chaired by the Minister of State for Schools and 14&ndash;19 Learners, has been formed to establish a strong partnership between Government and key stakeholders in the area of discipline in schools; and an expert Practitioners group will advise these key stakeholders on a range of behaviour issues. The Practitioners group will bring together school leaders with real, front line experience of turning schools round.</p>

There are a range of sanctions and penalties that may be imposed on candidates found guilty of breaking the regulations.

	<p pid=".204W.2/2">Academies' most recent GCSE figures show improvements on average in the number of children gaining five or more good GCSEs: in 2003, their first year, the average 5+ A*-C GCSE results in the three open Academies was 24 per cent., compared to an average of 16 per cent. in their predecessor schools in 2002. The rate of improvement in Academies' Key Stage 3 results is outstripping the national average: for the 11 Academies reporting results in 2004&mdash;compared to those of their predecessor schools in 2001&mdash;KS3 English and maths results on average improved by nine percentage points (from 34 per cent. to 43 per cent., and 38 per cent. to 47 per cent.) compared to a six and seven percentage points increase nationally (from 65 per cent. to 71 per cent., and 66 per cent. to 73 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid=".206W.9/1">Tackling homophobic bullying in schools is an issue which is taken seriously by the Department; as with any other kind of bullying it cannot be tolerated. We must challenge homophobic language and attitudes wherever we find them and support our children and young people to do the same.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.9/2">In November 2004, we organised, in conjunction with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), the first ever National Anti-Bullying Week which had a strong emphasis on combating homophobic bullying. During the week Stephen Twigg attended the 5th birthday celebration of the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Award for Young People, where he announced a new Diana Anti-bullying Award, for which we have given funding of &pound;50,000. At this event, he also launched new guidance for schools entitled &quot;Stand Up for Us: Challenging Homophobia in Schools&quot; which was prepared by the National Healthy Schools Standard with considerable input from the Department. Stand Up For Us sets out a practical approach for schools to assess quickly the scale of homophobic bullying they face. And it offers practical steps schools can take to create an environment where everyone can feel welcome and valued and where specific instances of bullying are identified, challenged and dealt with effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.9/3">During anti bullying week, we also published &quot;Homophobia, Sexual Orientation and Schools: a review and implications for action&quot;. This review, by the Thomas Coram Research Unit, looks at three areas: behaviour and bullying; teaching and learning about sexual orientation and relationships; and employment issues. It collates, summarises and assesses both peer reviewed research material, from this country and abroad, and less formal work conducted by bodies active in this area. It also reports the views of a wide range of organisations, 28 in all, with an interest in this area to paint a picture of how the issues are currently perceived. The report is available on the DfES website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research</a> and the findings will be used to inform future work in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.9/4">The Departments work in this critical area is on-going and we supported Schools Out in promoting the first Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) History Month in February 2005, and have funded the development of a website which will raise awareness and encourage participation. The website suggested activities and events that schools, colleges, universities, libraries, museums, galleries, archives, and theatres could organise and offered teachers specific lesson plans and assembly suggestions to encourage and support schools in marking LGBT History Month. It also provided an online notice board of events and link to current news relevant to LGBT History Month.</p>

In addition, 'Don't Suffer in Silence' the Department's anti-bullying guidance to schools advises that explicit reference be made to homophobic bullying and racist bullying in this policy. The guidance also offers a range of strategies to counter all forms of bullying and create an environment in which all members of the school community can thrive, and feel respected, safe and secure.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.2/2">The DfES Five Year Strategy states our expectation that all schools will sign up to the Anti Bullying Charter for Action, which is a voluntary commitment to creating a school community where bullying is not tolerated, and is signed by the Head Teacher, Chair of Governors and a Pupils' Representative. The anti-bullying Charter, which includes specific reference to homophobic bullying, went to every maintained school in England and is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies.</p>

	<p pid=".212W.2/1">This Government is wholeheartedly committed to the principle of real choice for parents and pupils so that they can choose between excellent local schools, including those with a distinctive ethos or specialism. Parents have the right to express a preference for whatever school they wish their child to attend and we want as many parents as possible to be able to send their child to their preferred school.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.2/2">School admission authorities have a statutory duty to comply with parental preference, unless a particular school is oversubscribed, in which case places must be allocated according to the published admission arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.2/3">We have introduced a number of measures to make it easier for the best schools to expand in line with parental demand including making dedicated capital funding available for the expansion of successful and popular secondary schools. Schools wishing to expand must follow a statutory process&mdash;consulting interested parties and publishing a statutory notice. The final decision is taken by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or an independent Schools Adjudicator. Our guidance to SOCs and adjudicators makes it clear that there is a presumption in favour of approving proposals to expand a successful and popular school.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.2/1">There is no national limit for secondary school classes as there is for infant classes of five, six and seven-year-olds. The average size of secondary school classes taught by one teacher nationally is 21.7. In Hertfordshire the average is 20.8. Only 8.7 per cent. of Hertfordshire's secondary classes have more than 30 pupils and there are no classes at all above 35 pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/2">Decisions about secondary class sizes are a matter for each school, using their delegated budget as they consider best. The funding that individual schools receive is a matter for local authorities through their locally agreed funding formulae and local authorities are best placed to know the needs and priorities of their schools. In terms of resourcing schools in Hertfordshire, in 2005&ndash;06 Hertfordshire have had an increase in their School Formula Spending Share of 5.5 per cent. per pupil.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.5/1">Local authorities will have the responsibility to develop children's centres to meet the needs of their communities building on existing provision such as Sure Start Local Programmes, neighbourhood nurseries and primary schools. Local authorities were given their funding allocations for children's centres in early April. The Department has not estimated how much additional funding will be given to children's centres from sources other than public funds. However centres will provide services that have grown from a range of existing provisions which have a number of funding streams eg health services, Jobcentre-Plus, family support and early education. They will also often include private sector funded services such as childcare nurseries or training of staff. Centres would also be able to generate additional revenues by charging parents for some of their services such as childcare.</p>

	<p pid=".215W.9/4">However, we always recognised that there would be a small number of people who we could not pay into any sort of account, including some of those with mental health problems. These customers are paid by DWP cheque which they can cash over the counter at a Post Office branch. We wanted to ensure that we properly met the needs of those vulnerable customers who we could not pay into an account, and settled on cheque payments following extensive discussions with customer representative groups&mdash;including Mind (the leading mental health charity). For example, cheque payments offer the flexibility to pay people with mental heath problems for a short period until they feel that they are able to manage a bank account again.</p>

For example, a patient is to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels the operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday, then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.</p>

Every hospital with a critical care services is now included in one of 29 critical care networks that work to locally agreed common standards and protocols, supporting improvements in service standards and assisting commissioners and providers in planning service provision. The Department, working closely with the critical care stakeholders' forum, will continue to support the national health service in developing critical care services, taking into account the recommendations of the NCEPOD report.</p>
