	<p pid="b.350W.3/1">The changes we have made to charity law and accounting and reporting thresholds have resulted in savings for up to 50,000 charities and up to &#163;5 million per year. The new Charitable Incorporated Organisation, planned for next year, will give charities the advantages of incorporation without the burden of dual regulation by both the Charity Commission and Companies House. Departments are also cutting red tape for third sector organisations and will be reporting on further progress later this month. The Government and National Audit Office (NAO) have produced guidance to reduce red tape associated with the &#163;12 billion a year the sector gets from Government. The Government have introduced further measures to facilitate the use of Gift Aid, with particular support for smaller charities, including reforms to simplify the record keeping and auditing process.</p>

	<p pid="b.354W.9/1">In the run up to and following Afghanistan's 2009 presidential elections, we met with a range of presidential candidates and continue to encourage all parties to work together for the good of Afghanistan. It is not for the UK to dictate to Afghanistan's political leadership the makeup of any future government, or prescribe the degree to which the Afghan government should formally work with its opposition. What is important is that with UK and international community support, the Afghan government and other key Afghan partners reach out across the political spectrum in order to deliver progress on the key issues President Karzai outlined in his inauguration speech: security, governance, peace and reintegration, economic development and regional relations.</p>

	<p pid="b.355W.5/1">The effort in Afghanistan is cross-departmental, with the bulk of the UK's efforts supporting the economy coming from the Department for International Development (DFID). However, one of the greatest needs for the Afghan economy is stability. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) efforts across Afghanistan and wider region, supporting stability will therefore have the greatest indirect impact on the Afghan economy, although it is not possible to measure this contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.355W.5/2">There are a number of projects, procurement and salaries in the local economy which have a direct impact on the local economy. Local purchases amounted to &#163;6.8 million in 2008, much of which will have fed directly back to the Afghan economy. Local staff salaries were an additional &#163;549,000. Spending in 2009 is likely to be similar. In addition, the FCO supports numerous programmes which support activity in Afghanistan. This financial year (2009-10) the total budget for non-DFID civilian programmes in Afghanistan is &#163;88.4 million. Of this, it is predicted that &#163;54.1 million is administered with the promotion of economic development and welfare-officially Overseas Development Authority-spend. This does not include DFID spending.</p>

We welcome the principle of empowering individual communities to take a greater role in providing their own security. We will remain in close contact with the Afghan Government and the US on its progress and look forward to discussing the results of this pilot with them in due course. Only once the pilot has been rigorously evaluated will any decisions on expansion, including to Helmand, be taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.369W.3/1">The Government have not made such an estimate. However, the Horserace Betting Levy Board informs me that the levy payable by betting exchanges is equivalent to 10 per cent. of their gross profits, defined as gross commission on British Horserace Betting Business deducted from winnings paid out to bettors and bet-takers. In the year ended <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, Betfair also made a voluntary contribution to the Levy Board in respect of British Horserace Betting Business conducted by their off-shore website in Malta.</p>
	<p pid="b.369W.3/2">Betting exchanges operate a business model that does not deliver product through shops. When bookmakers accept risk on bets and do so in shops, liability to levy and gross profits tax is calculated without the deduction of overheads. This leads to a proportionately larger contribution to the levy than would be the case for a betting exchange.</p>

I congratulate all those involved in the SCAR report in particular those UK scientists, most notably from the British Antarctic Survey, who played a leading role. The Government are committed to the protection of the Antarctic environment and strongly support the Antarctic treaty and its environmental protocol. I recently launched for consultation the draft Antarctic Bill which will add to the protection we give to Antarctica. The report will be discussed in detail at the Antarctic treaty meeting of experts on climate change in April 2010 and also at the Antarctic treaty consultative meeting in Uruguay in May.</p>

This is because the Government, throughout the lifetime of the Bellwin scheme, has thought it reasonable to expect authorities to cover costs themselves up to a certain level. Every local authority is required to maintain reserves, one of whose main purposes is to meet unexpected costs.

	<p pid="b.396W.5/1">The commitment to offer free personal care at home to those with highest needs is expected to cost up to &#163;670 million per full year. The Government, through the Department of Health, will provide the bulk of this funding (&#163;420 million per full year). It is right that councils play their part, and the remainder of the funding will come from efficiencies in local government. However, it is not for central Government to micro-manage the budgets of local authorities. They are best placed to make decisions on how to fund this important commitment. It is for this reason that the additional funding being provided by central Government will be distributed on a non-ringfenced basis. The Department of Health is consulting separately on the formulae that will be used for distributing the grant to councils.</p>

With this support, local government has shown the capacity to generate significant levels of efficiency. Since 2004-05, local government has delivered &#163;4.5 billion in efficiency savings. Last year alone, as part of the Government's efficiency drive, local authorities reported a &#163;1.7 billion saving on their &#163;5.5 billion target between 2008-09 and 2010-11. Work is already under way through Total Place and Smarter Government to identify new ways of maintaining high quality local services in a time of public expenditure constraint.

For example, prior to 2006-07 funding for schools was included within formula grant; from 2006-07 onwards funding for schools was provided by the dedicated schools grant. For this reason, we therefore adjust the prior year's formula grant, for comparison purposes only, so that it reflects the notional amount of formula grant an authority would have received in that year had we been financing the same services as in the current year.</p>
	<p pid="b.397W.5/22">The Department only holds data on year-on-year changes in formula grant on a like-for-like basis from 1997-98.

	<p pid="b.410W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.8/2">The new employment rights introduced on April 2003 gave parents of children under six and disabled children under 18 the right to request flexible working, this was extended to carers in April 2007 and parents of children aged 16 and under in April 2009. The proportion of employees with children (under 16 years old) who have requested to work flexibly by region and nation in Great Britain are provided in the following table. These figures are from the Flexible Working Survey (2005) however information is not available for Newport East and due to a small sample size of respondents in Wales reliable information is only available for all employees' requests for flexible working, not those employees with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.8/3">Later information comes from the Work Life Balance Survey (2006), which asked 2,081 employees in Great Britain whether they made a request in the last two years to change their working arrangements. Again, the relative small sample size representing Wales mean reliable statistics are not available for parents of young children; however the survey found that 18 per cent. of all respondents in Wales requested flexible working, 17 per cent. for all of Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="b.411W.5/2">The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 provide for a statutory retirement procedure which includes an employee's right to request to stay in employment beyond retirement age and a default retirement age of 65 that employers can use if they wish. The Government fixed the default retirement age at 65 for sound policy reasons and the High Court has confirmed that it is objectively justified. There is therefore no requirement for employers to give a reason why they are retiring someone if using the default retirement age.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.5/3">We have brought forward the planned review of the default retirement age from 2011 to 2010. The review will consider whether the default retirement age remains appropriate and necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.416W.11/1">The level of fees that will apply in the future when fingerprint biometric passports are introduced has not been set and will depend on the future fee strategy for passports and identity cards. However, the current standard fee for an adult passport is &#163;77.50 and &#163;30.00 for an identity card. Once fingerprint biometric passports are introduced, anyone applying for a passport, whether as a first time applicant or as an existing passport holder, would have the choice of being issued with a fingerprint biometric passport or a fingerprint biometric identity card or both documents.</p>

	<p pid="b.419W.5/2">DEFRA is continually evaluating research relevant to energy from waste as our departmental priority is to secure a healthy environment in which we and future generations can prosper. In particular over the last ten years, we have commissioned and evaluated the following research:</p>
	<p pid="b.419W.5/3" class="indent">Emissions (i) &quot;Emissions from waste management: framework for assessment of data quality and research needs&quot;; the project is still underway.</p>

	<p pid="b.419W.5/5">In May 2002 the Environment Agency produced its own report on solid residues from municipal incineration. It has not commissioned outside bodies to carry out research in this area. It evaluates reports that come to light in order to keep abreast of developments but does not maintain a list of these.</p>
	<p pid="b.419W.5/6">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has commissioned no research in this area in the last ten years but recently reviewed the latest research on the health effects of modern municipal waste incinerators. It concludes that while it is not possible to rule out adverse health effects completely, any potential damage from modern, well-run and regulated incinerators is likely to be so small that it would be undetectable. Moreover, it recommends that since any possible health effects of emissions are likely to be very small, studies of public health around modern, well managed municipal waste incinerators are not recommended. A statement can be found on the HPA's website.</p>

	<p pid="b.421W.3/1">The Planning Act 2008 requires the Government to consult the public and stakeholders on the draft National Policy Statements (NPSs) before they can be designated. The consultation is ongoing and therefore we do not yet have detailed costs associated with each event. We estimate that, on average, each of the 10 events, including design, strategic planning, production, marketing, staffing and transport, will cost in the region of about &#163;60,000. Between four and seven DECC staff attend each event over the course of each three day exhibition (open from 8 am to 8 pm) and public meeting. Accommodation and subsistence costs are not finalised at this early stage in the consultation and we would expect that these will vary depending on the location. However, we would expect all these costs to be within civil service guidelines, with hotels costing around &#163;60 per person per night for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.3/2">The primary target audience of the Nuclear NPS events is the local community, therefore we would not expect members of the public to incur accommodation costs and only limited travel costs to attend the events. Venues were chosen to be as close to the proposed nuclear power station site. We took into account a number of principles which helped us in choosing the exhibition location . These included:</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.3/3" class="indent">Journey time to proposed site</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.3/4" class="indent">Historic evidence of attendance levels to similar consultations</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.3/5" class="indent">Existence of multiple proposed sites in one area</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.3/6">A wide range of venues were considered for each location. Suggested venues have been recommended by local authorities and energy companies (who have undertaken similar events in the past) and we have endeavoured to use as many of these recommendations as possible. The priority was finding the largest possible venues, nearest to the site.</p>

This can lead to a reduction in reliance on fossil fuels. Under the revised Waste Framework Directive the recovery of energy from waste is placed fourth in the waste hierarchy, which shall apply as a priority order, and above waste disposal which includes incineration without energy recovery. The regeneration of waste oil into base oil by re-refining is classed as recycling and is placed third in the waste hierarchy.</p>

	<p pid="b.422W.6/22">Local authorities were responsible for the registration and inspection of children's day care facilities from 1997 to 2001. Responsibility transferred to Ofsted from 2003 and correspondingly, the categories of childcare changed from day nurseries, playgroups and pre-schools, childminders, out of school clubs and holiday schemes to full and sessional day care, childminders, out of school clubs, and cr&#232;che day care. Therefore, data from 2003 are not directly comparable with data prior to 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/23">Data were not collected for 2002 during the transfer of responsibility to Ofsted. Due to changes in legislation Ofsted have changed the way they publish statistics on registered childcare providers and places. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September 2008</phrase>, Ofsted started to record providers in line with new legal requirements using the categories of childminders, childcare on domestic premises, and childcare on non-domestic premises. This change means that the total numbers of providers and places (excluding childminding) shown in its returns up to and including August 2008 and from December 2008 onwards (the last under the old system, and the first under the new system) are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="b.424W.2/1">Statutory guidance contained in 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' sets out the processes for managing individual cases when there are concerns about the welfare of a child, including of an unborn child. It also sets out the minimum time periods for reviewing a plan. The local authority should record the plan electronically in its IT system, known as the Integrated Children's System, and update the plan as appropriate following a review. The same processes apply when there are concerns about an unborn child: any pre-birth plan will need to be reviewed following the baby's birth. When a new plan has been developed, the previous plan should be archived in order to provide an audit trail of the reasons for changes agreed at each stage of the decision making process.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.2/1">The legal aid and judicial impact test (LAJIT) was introduced in 2005 to formalise the arrangements under which Departments responsible for policy change had an obligation to meet the downstream costs falling to other agencies. The purpose of the LAJIT is to ensure that policy makers are aware of the potential impact that their proposals could have on legal aid and the courts so that resources can be better managed and, where appropriate, funding secured from other Government Departments. The Better Regulation Executive (BRE) has oversight of the overall Impact Assessment process across Government, and owns the relevant templates and guidance. Its guidance toolkit includes specific guidance for policy makers in Departments on the LAJIT.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.2/2">The models and analysis used to assess the impact of proposed policy changes on the legal aid budget include identifying instances where legal aid could potentially be required and applying suitable unit costs, These estimates are agreed between the MoJ and the Department introducing the policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.2/3">No formal research or assessment of the legal aid impact test has been carried out. The BRE is, however, revising the impact assessment template, toolkit and guidance in order to promote the continued improvement of impact assessments. This work is due for completion in the first half of 2010. As part of that project, Ministry of Justice officials are working with BRE to review the legal aid impact test.</p>

	<p pid="b.436W.2/1">The legal professions have attracted significant criticism over the years for not representing the diverse society in which we live. However, this criticism has put diversity at the top of the agenda for the professions and their response has been encouraging.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/2">In 1998 women accounted for 53.6 per cent. of traineeships registered with the Law Society. This increased steadily to 63.4 per cent. in 2007-08. Therefore the focus of the debate has in many ways shifted towards ensuring that diversity is maintained at all levels within the professions and that progression is not in any way linked to an individual's gender.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/3">In 1998 women made up 17 per cent. of partners at law firms in England and Wales, compared to 24 per cent. in 2008. In 1998 less than 6.5 per cent. of all Queen's Counsellors were female; a decade later this figure was 10 per cent. In addition to this progression in law it is important to remember that according to the Association of Women's Solicitors (AWS), women are more successful when working in-house in the legal departments of industrial and commercial companies; for example, women head the legal teams at BT, Serco and the London Development Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/4">A variety of programmes has been initiated in order to improve further women's career progression in the legal professions. 11 per cent. of judges and recorders in 1999 were female; today this figure is 19.4 per cent.. The Ministry of Justice is devoting considerable effort and resources to continue to improve diversity in the judiciary. In April 2009 the Lord Chancellor established an independent Advisory Panel on Judicial Diversity, to identify the barriers to progress on judicial diversity and make recommendations on how to make speedier and sustained progress to a more diverse judiciary at every level. The panel is expected to build upon the work that is already under way in this area, and to draw on lessons learned from current initiatives, including the Judicial Appointments Commission's Judicial Diversity Forum and the follow-up work from the Lord Chief Justice's conference on &quot;A Judiciary for the 21st century&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/5">In the private sector, the Association of Women's Solicitors, alongside major City law firms such as Lovells, have undertaken research which identifies that key barriers for women are that they do not have role models or are self-promoting enough. Accordingly they are running 'soft skill' programmes to encourage women to acknowledge their own success more, and for 20 years AWS have run a mentoring scheme so that new entries into the profession can be paired with more experienced female lawyers in order to pass on experience and contacts. AWS is also at the centre of encouraging law firms to adapt flexible working, so that mothers can still have a legal career alongside their family lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/6">60 per cent. of new solicitors are now female. It may take up to a decade for these new lawyers to become partners in big city firms, and we look forward to more diversity at all levels of the legal profession in the future thanks to the progress we are making now.</p>

	<p pid="b.452W.2/1">Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) was not re-branded the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) and continues to exist and fulfil its core activities, including responsibility for the publication of legislation and the management of Crown copyright operating from within The National Archives. In 2005, OPSI was created as a result of implementing the Re-Use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005 No. 1515). The decision to create OPSI was taken by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster as the Minister responsible for the Cabinet Office. Activities relating to these regulations are undertaken under the OPSI name. OPSI merged with The National Archives in 2006. The National Archives is an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, for which I have responsibility. Her Majesty was consulted on these changes when they took place.</p>

There has been no remuneration to the Chair, as no appeals have been submitted to the PAAC. Any appeals received would be administered by staff from existing tribunals. The Department has incurred no direct costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.464W.2/3">The Ministry of Justice cannot separately identify domestic violence offences from other offences of assault and violence against the person. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) advise that domestic violence cases have to be referred by the police to a prosecutor for a charging decision in accordance with the Director's Guidance on Charging. A report of domestic violence to the police is unlikely to have been the first incident, and for that reason cautions should be rarely administered in these cases. If there is sufficient evidence of an offence, the public interest will usually mean that the decision is taken to prosecute the case in the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.2/4">The number of domestic violence prosecutions undertaken by the CPS has increased from 34,839 in 2004-05 to 67,094 in 2008-9. The proportion of successful cases has also risen from 55 per cent. in March 2005 to 71.9 per cent. in September 2009.</p>

A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. However, admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 3. In Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data cannot be filtered using Merseyside or Southport constituencies as the PQ requests; consequently data is provided using PCTs of residences that approximate to required areas.<br/> Merseyside is made-up of the following PCTs: Wirral PCT, Sefton PCT, Halton and St. Helens PCT, Liverpool and Knowsley PCT (or their equivalents in 2005-06 and 2004-05). Southport falls under Sefton PCT of Residence (or its equivalent in 2005-06 and 2004-05).<br/> Owing to the fact that in July 2006, the NHS reorganised PCTs in England from 303 PCTs into 152, data from 2006-07 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years.<br/> Data for the years 2005-06 and 2004-05 have been presented using the equivalent PCTs to the ones listed above. These are as follows: Sefton PCT = (Southport and Formby PCT, South Sefton PCT), Wirral PCT = (Birkenhead and Wallasey PCT, Bebington and West Wirral PCT), Liverpool PCT = (North Liverpool PCT, Central Liverpool PCT, South Liverpool PCT) and, Halton and St. Helens PCT = (St. Helens PCT, Halton PCT).<br/> 4. To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> 5. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 6. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> HES; Outpatients, The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.476W.5/1">Residential treatment is one of a number of treatment modalities for drug misuse. Before a drug user receives national health service care in a residential drug treatment service, care planning needs to be undertaken between the service user and their clinicians to assess whether it will help the user to change their behaviour and if so, the nature and duration of the treatment that will be needed. They will also consider the care that will be needed following residential treatment.

	<p pid="b.480W.8/1">Hand hygiene is only one part of our comprehensive strategy to reduce health care associated infections, and the evidence base shows that it prevents infections. All acute trusts signed up to the National Patient Safety Agency's 'cleanyourhands' campaign and independent evaluation of this campaign suggests a strong association with a reduction in infections. We do not specifically fund or assess individual hospital campaigns and mortality rates have not been specifically investigated.</p>

	<p pid="b.495W.6/1">The estimate of 110,000 younger adults eligible for free personal care at home is based principally on the referrals, assessments and packages of care (RAP) data from councils for 2007-08. In the absence of data on the proportion of younger service users whose needs are assessed as critical under fair access to care services (FACS) critical, for the purposes of the impact assessment, it is assumed that there could be some 100,000 younger adult local authority funded users receiving personal care in the critical category. It is likely that most of these receive their care free, as their incomes are generally low. It has therefore been assumed that 90 per cent. already receive free personal care at home and that 10 per cent. make a means-tested contribution towards the cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.495W.6/2">Little is known about the number of younger adults who currently fund their own care at home. It has been assumed that around a further 10,000 younger adults may be brought under state funding following the introduction of the Personal Care at Home Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.495W.6/3">The figures have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 to reflect the uncertainty. The figure of 110,000 should therefore be treated as an estimate.</p>

The &#163;1,000 per person figure referred to is based on an estimate of 30 hours of care at &#163;30 an hour and an allowance for some equipment.

As part of plans for a national care service, we have been considering a number of proposals which include insurance schemes, so that people with high care needs will not find themselves faced with unexpected care costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.496W.8/1">No estimate has been made on future investment in social care. However, we know that, in order to ensure that a new care and support system is affordable, we will need to be prepared to take tough decisions to ensure that existing resources are targeted on those who need them the most. But we know that the money already in the system will not be enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.496W.8/2">In 20 years' time, we expect there to be 1.7 million more adults needing care and support than there are now and proportionately fewer people of working age to help pay for the funding of that care and support. We will not be able to pay for the care that is needed simply by reprioritising the money we already have. As a society, we are going to have to spend more on care and support if we are to maintain a care and support system that gives older people and disabled people quality of life, dignity and peace of mind about their future care costs.</p>

It also estimates the costs of providing reablement services over the same period at &#163;130 million, bringing the total costs of the proposals to approximately &#163;670 million. The impact assessment only covers the period from October 2010 to the end of 2012-13. Estimating beyond this point to 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030 is problematic because of the uncertainties involved.

	<p pid="b.499W.5/3">Health care workers involved in direct patient care can also receive the H1N1 vaccine. This applies to about one million individuals in England. There are an estimated 4,000 people who fall into this category working in Stockport national health service trusts.</p>

	<p pid="b.499W.11/7">These groups were selected because they are at highest risk of severe illness. As vaccine became available, in some areas priority groups i to iii have been vaccinated concurrently, rather than in order of priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.11/8">In addition to these groups, frontline health and social care workers have been offered the vaccine at the same time as the first clinical risk group as they are at increased risk of infection and of transmitting that infection to susceptible patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.505W.8/6">We continue to promote job-sharing and job vacancies must explicitly address the scope for flexible working opportunities in posts and state that applications are welcomed from candidates with part-time, job-share or other flexible working arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.8/7" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Speed, dated 9<sup>(<i> th</i>)</sup> December 2009:</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.8/8">The Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has asked me to reply to your question how many and what percentage of staff of his Department, its executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies work flexibly or part-time; and what his Department's policy is on making jobs available on a job-share or flexible basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.8/9">As at 19/11/2009, we have the following numbers of staff who are working flexible working patterns:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.505W.8/12"> <td><i> Working pattern</i></td> <td><i> Number of employees</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.505W.8/13"> <td>Flexible working scheme</td> <td>575</td> </tr>

	</table>
	<p pid="b.505W.8/20">We also offer our staff flexi-time, but we do not record centrally the numbers of staff that use this working pattern. We also do not hold records centrally of the number of staff that job share. Job sharers are included in the table as part-time workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.8/21" class="italic"> Recruitment Policy for Flexible Working</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.8/22">The Insolvency Service strongly encourages opportunities for part-time, job share and other flexible working arrangements. When advertising posts, recruiting managers are not able to specify a specific working pattern e.g. full-time, part-time etc, unless a business case has been made through a relevant Director, and agreed by Human Resources. Applicants are not required to indicate their current or proposed working pattern. It is only at the point where an applicant is contacted to be offered the job that a recruiting manager will discuss with the applicant the proposed working pattern.</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.8/23">Recruiting managers are encouraged to accommodate all working patterns, but where there is any doubt on whether a working pattern can be accommodated, the applicant needs to discuss the proposals with their line-manager to establish what options are available to accommodate the pattern. Where the pattern cannot be accommodated, the recruiting manager provides the applicant with written objective justification for the decision.</p>

	<p pid="b.508W.2/1">The Department is supporting the development of electric vehicles through a number of measures including the Technology Strategy Board led Low Carbon Vehicle Innovation Platform, worth approximately &#163;150 million of public sector support; the work of the Research Councils and Energy Technologies Institute; and the Automotive Assistance Programme.</p>

Accredited provision provides a higher quality of learner experience and leads to the gaining of a recognisable, transferable qualification upon completion. The impact of moving from shorter to longer courses is a reduction in overall learner numbers.</p>

	<p pid="b.510W.0/1">The UK Innovation Investment Fund will operate on a fund of funds structure which means it will not invest directly in companies, but rather invest in a small number of specialist technology funds that have the expertise and track record to invest directly in companies. These underlying funds will focus on investing in growing small businesses, start-ups and spin-outs, in strategically important UK sectors including clean technology, life sciences, advanced manufacturing and ICT. Investments in individual technology funds will be a commercial decision for the fund of funds manager based on the quality of the investment opportunity and the fund's investment strategy. There is no restriction on the spread of spending across technology sectors, with the exception of &#163;25 million minimum investment in each of low carbon and life sciences.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-09b.303048.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-09b.510W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" speakername="Kevin Brennan" colnum="510W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091209/text/91209w0037.htm#09120978009193">
	<p pid="b.510W.3/1">The Office of Fair Trading's (OFT) registration scheme for money laundering was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July</phrase>. No fees were sought or received prior to <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July</phrase>. Forecasts for fee levels in 2010/11 onwards are subject to future public consultation (to start in January 2010). The OFT will be seeking input on its future supervisory approach and fee structures to support supervisory activity. Future costs and fee levels have not yet been estimated. The OFT receives no central funding for its anti-money laundering supervisory role. The regime has to be self funding and the OFT can recover its reasonable costs through fees. The consultation will enable the firms supervised by the OFT to influence future costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.3/2">Regarding the hon. Member's questions in relation to impact assessments and research on the effect of registration on the estate agency sector, I refer to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-21">21 July</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-07-21.1676"><i> Official Report</i>, column 1676W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.3/3">The OFT does not have a figure solely for the administrative costs of operating the system of estate agent registration. This is because there is no differentiation made in the OFT's budget for anti-money laundering between estate agents or Consumer Credit Financial Institutions. The OFT estimates that the cost of setting up and operating the OFT's money laundering registration in 2009/10 is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.3/4" class="indent">Staff costs: &#163;397,000</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.3/5" class="indent">Non-staff costs: &#163;407,000</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.3/6" class="indent">Total: &#163;804,000</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.3/7">This figure does not include (i) any costs for corporate support such as IT, finance or accommodation, which is totalled elsewhere in the budget, (ii) recovery of the set-up costs from 2008/09 associated with registration, or (iii) the estimated cost for 2009/10 associated with the operation of the registration system since registration launch on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July</phrase>, which is &#163;150,000. Forecasts for administration costs in 2010/11 onwards are subject to future public consultation and will be dependent on the proportion of firms who register with OFT during the initial six month registration period. These costs have not, as yet, been estimated.</p>

	<p pid="b.520W.2/1">The Union Learning Fund (ULF) is not used to directly fund the provision of education or training courses. Over the last five years my Department has provided &#163;86 million to help trade unions boost their capacity as learning organisations and use their influence with employers, employees and learning providers to encourage greater take up of learning in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.2/2">There are now over 23,000 trained Union Learning Representatives who, supported by ULF, have helped more than 800,000 workers back into learning since the Fund was introduced in 1998. Over 220,000 were helped last year, many from those hard to reach groups, who employers and training providers find it so difficult to engage with, including over 33,000 workers with poor basic literacy and numeracy skills.</p>
