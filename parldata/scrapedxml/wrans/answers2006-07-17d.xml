	<p pid="d.4W.0/2">Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980 makes it an offence to obstruct a highway without lawful authority. The pedestrian footway is part of a highway. The police may issue a fixed penalty notice for such obstruction. However, in London, by virtue of section 8 of the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003, authorised officers of borough councils and Transport for London are also empowered to issue a fixed penalty notice for the offence of obstruction under section 137 of the 1980 Act.</p>

	<p pid="d.7W.6/1">Evidence on office space allocation and occupancy was submitted to the Administration Committee's inquiry into House of Commons Accommodation earlier this year. This evidence is published with that Committee's Third Report of the Session, HC 1279. The answer that follows is based on that information, which represents a sample at a given moment in time.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.6/2"><i> (a)</i> The Accommodation Whips have approximately 14,800 sq m of office space available to allocate to Members, an average of 22.9 sq m per Member. In practice, however, some of this accommodation is unoccupied or occupied by Members' staff. Of the office space currently used by Members, the average area available for each Member is 14.3 sq m.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.6/3"><i> (b)</i> and <i> (c)</i> Of the total office space available to the Accommodation Whips, 1,300 sq m is designated ministerial accommodation, an average of 16.9 sq m per Minister. This leaves 13,500 sq m of office space not designated ministerial accommodation which the Accommodation Whips have available to allocate to other hon. Members. However, Ministers also occupy some Members' accommodation not designated for Ministers, while some ministerial rooms are occupied by Members' staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.6/4"><i> (d)</i> The average space available to individual Members' staff is estimated at 9.2 sq m per person, based on 1,230 desk spaces in areas allocated by the Serjeant at Arms and in Members' accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.6/5"><i> (e)</i> 1,735 staff of the House, 1,257 of whom are desk-based, occupy 13,140 sq m of office space, giving an average density of 7.6 or 10.5 sq m per person depending on the method of calculation used. Disaggregated information is not held on space occupied by senior staff of the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.22W.2/1">The average domestic rate for households in Northern Ireland consists of the average of the 26 district council domestic rates plus the domestic regional rate.</p>
	<p pid="d.22W.2/2">The formula for calculation of the average rate for households is as follows: Each year, district councils' estimated net expenditure is reduced by anticipated general grant payments and any balance that councils have indicated they wish to apply, to determine the net amount to be raised from district rates. This figure is divided by the total penny product (the income from one penny in the rates) to give the average non-domestic rate. The average non-domestic rate is then multiplied by the Northern Ireland growth factor to determine the average domestic rate. The average domestic rate for 2006-2007 is 157.33 pence</p>
	<p pid="d.22W.2/3">The regional domestic rate is a single rate applied uniformally across Northern Ireland. It is determined by dividing the domestic rate revenue required in the Budget by the domestic tax base, currently defined in rental values.</p>
	<p pid="d.22W.2/4">The average domestic rate in 2006-07 is 355.50 pence, which is the sum of the uniform regional domestic rate of 198.17p and the average district rate of 157.33p.</p>

	<p pid="d.25W.13/2">These new commitments do not set a separate target for gas and electricity consumption on the Government estate. Instead Government have set targets on overall energy efficiency, carbon emissions and carbon neutrality, all of which will apply from April 2006. A table of the new targets follows as annex A. In addition, the existing commitment that Government Departments should source at least 10 per cent. of their electricity from renewables will remain in place until 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.13/3">Departmental performance against Government estate targets, including carbon emissions and energy efficiency, has been published in annual Sustainable Development Government Reports. The last report was produced by the Sustainable Development Commission, the independent watchdog, in December 2005.

	<p pid="d.28W.3/1">Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are required to submit Greenhouse Gas Inventories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) every year. These inventories are compiled using methodologies devised by the International Panel on Climate Change and agreed by the UNFCCC. Once submitted, the inventories are scrutinised by international experts to ensure their completeness and accuracy.</p>
	<p pid="d.28W.3/2">In the UK, inventory data are subject to an audited quality control and assurance programme. This ensures that the data sources are reliable and quality checked, that the choice of methodologies is transparent, and that data are consistent over time, complete, comparable, and assessed for uncertainties. When required, methodological changes are made to take account of new data sources, new guidance from the IPCC, relevant work by other international organisations, new research, or specific research programmes sponsored by DEFRA. Such improvements to the methodology are applied retrospectively to ensure a consistent time series of emissions.</p>
	<p pid="d.28W.3/3">DEFRA periodically tests the accuracy of key source sector estimates in the national inventory by undertaking independent peer review. Reviews completed to date include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion and agriculture. DEFRA also funds independent verification of the reliability of the emissions estimates by combining measurements of the concentrations of selected greenhouse gases at Mace Head in Ireland and a model of atmospheric transport developed by the Met Office.</p>

UK nominations of 11 tonnes for critical uses in 2007 continue the downward trend.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.2/3">Methyl bromide is an ozone depleting substance and the Government's policy is to support further critical uses only where lack of availability would cause significant market disruption and there are no technical or economically feasible alternatives.</p>

	<p pid="d.29W.8/1">No. It is inappropriate to place private ministerial correspondence in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.8/2">However, it might be helpful to explain and put into context the current role of Nirex in the management of radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.8/3">Responsibility for securing the safety of the public and the environment rests with the independent regulators&mdash;the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the environment agencies (the Environment Agency, EA, in England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, SEPA, in Scotland).</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.8/4">The nuclear operators are required to demonstrate to the regulators that the risks to the public and the environment from their activities, including the management of radioactive waste, are reduced as low as reasonably practicable. In support of their safety cases for the packaging and disposal of radioactive waste, the operators may seek advice from Nirex.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.8/5">Nirex is not a regulator. It is a company that is jointly owned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) that advises nuclear site operators on the preparation of the industry's safety case submissions to the regulators for the conditioning and packaging of waste.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.8/6">It is the independent regulators who take decisions on the acceptability of waste conditioning and packaging safety cases submitted to them. The environment agencies have teams that scrutinise Nirex's contribution to the safety case process. It is regulators who are responsible for applying and determining the statutory safety requirements of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and the Radioactive Substances Act 1993.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.8/7">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is the strategic UK-wide body with responsibility for securing the clean-up and decommissioning of public sector nuclear liabilities and the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials including radioactive waste. It is the owner of most of the UK's radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.8/8">The majority of Nirex's current funding&mdash;over 90 per cent.&mdash;comes from a contract with the NDA. The remainder comes through an agreement with the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The company also receives payment from nuclear site operators for supply of their waste conditioning and packaging advice.</p>

	<p pid="d.33W.2/1">The UK is in regular contact with both the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF, the lead UN agencies working to eliminate child labour. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's recent discussions with these organisations have not focused specifically on child labour. DFID is a major funder of both organisations, with a current commitment of over &pound;15 million to the ILO's programmes to combat child labour and the trafficking of children. DFID also provided &pound;19 million in core funding to UNICEF programmes in 2005, including support to their Child Protection programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.33W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development regularly holds meetings with UK-based non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which often have issues relating to child labour on their agenda. However there has been no specific discussion of child labour in recent meetings. DFID funds a number of UK-based NGOs, including Save the Children Fund (SCF) and World Vision, to implement projects addressing child labour issues, including trafficking and street children.</p>

	<p pid="d.33W.5/1">DFID's overarching mission is to address extreme poverty which is the underlying cause of most child labour. DFID supports many activities which will enable children and families to survive without depending on income from child labour.</p>
	<p pid="d.33W.5/2">In the White Paper published last week, the Government restate their commitment to the elimination of child labour and the development of social protection measures to ensure that poor families and vulnerable children do not need to depend on child labour.</p>
	<p pid="d.33W.5/3">A number of DFID programmes already support social protection. For example, DFID is supporting the development of the Ghana Social Protection Strategy. One of the flagship projects of this strategy is the provision of cash payments to families living in chronic poverty, some of whom currently depend on their children's income. In Zimbabwe, DFID is providing &pound;30 million to the Protracted Relief Programme which is supporting food security for &pound;1.5 million households in extreme poverty and will mean that many children, including those orphaned by AIDS, will not have to undertake harmful work to survive.</p>

	<p pid="d.34W.2/1">DFID uses data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF to estimate the extent of child labour.

	<p pid="d.36W.2/1">Since October 2004, when an electronic absence recording system was introduced, records of sick absences have been held centrally by DFID. This has afforded better management control of frequent and long-term sick absences. However, we are still in the process of defining the types of reports we will require on a regular basis. To provide the information in the format requested requires intensive manual manipulation of the data. We have also changed the basis of recording working patterns from days to hours, which compounds the problem of producing ad hoc reports. We are working with an external consultant towards implementing a simpler process for extracting information from existing systems, but we are unlikely to be able to produce the data until later this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.36W.5/19">DFID's domestic travel policies ensure that staff travel only when necessary, to minimise cost and environmental impact from carbon emissions. Only top management staff may buy business class tickets. However, DFID benefits from an arrangement used by a number of Government Departments whereby travellers on flexible economy tickets may be upgraded to business class at no extra cost. We are keen to reduce the number of internal flights and time spent travelling. We instruct staff to consider whether meetings are essential, and we have invested in modern communication systems, including video conference facilities, to reduce the need for travel.</p>

	<p pid="d.37W.2/2">We will shortly be mapping out our Disability Equality Scheme and preparing our Disability Action Plan. At this stage we will involve disabled people's organisations as well as development organisations with a disability focus&mdash;both in the UK and in our partner countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.37W.2/3">DFID is already taking a number of steps to address disability issues in its approach to development. For example, DFID commissioned a Disability Knowledge and Research programme, and we have since been adopting a twin track approach to disability research. This involves mainstreaming disability into existing research initiatives and working directly towards the establishment of an emancipatory model of research with an umbrella Disabled Peoples' Organisation in Southern Africa.</p>
	<p pid="d.37W.2/4">DFID is also consulting disabled people's organisations, and development organisations with a disability remit, about the development of a good practice note for its staff on Inclusive Development. This will have a strong focus on the involvement of disabled people and their representatives in partner countries to ensure that disability issues are taken into account across DFID's programmes.</p>

	<p pid="d.37W.5/1">DFID has committed some &pound;2 billion to education over the last 10 years. In April, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pledged to increase this sum to &pound;8.5 billion over the next 10 years, and last month the Prime Minister promised to increase DFID's annual budget for education to &pound;1 billion a year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.37W.5/2">Most of this funding will be channelled to the Governments of developing countries to invest in long term, comprehensive investment plans for the education sector. We will be working with our partners to ensure that access to education by children with disabilities is part of these plans. For example, in India, DFID has supported the District Primary Education Programme, which promotes inclusive education and has helped states integrate disabled children into mainstream schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.37W.5/3">We will also continue to fund discrete civil society projects focused on children with disabilities. DFID has partnership agreements with a number of organisations that support disability-focused activities, such as World Vision, HelpAge International, Save the Children and VSO, among others. In addition, through our partner Action on Disability and Development, with whom we have a six-year Programme Partnership Agreement, we work to promote greater participation and inclusion of disabled people and their organisations in decision-making processes, particularly on partner Governments' Poverty Reduction Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="d.38W.2/1">The Global Monitoring Report, which we regard as the most reliable source of education data, estimates that only 2 per cent. of children with disabilities in developing countries are enrolled in school. Civil society organisations working in this field make similar estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.2/2">All children, including those with disabilities or living in difficult circumstances, should have equal access to a good-quality basic education. DFID is committed to working with the Governments of developing countries towards the education of all children, including those with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.2/3">DFID's policy paper, 'Reducing poverty by tackling social exclusion', which has been deposited in the Libraries of the House, sets out our broad-based approach to tackling social exclusion across all sectors.

	<p pid="d.38W.5/1">The negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are continuing and are due to be finalised by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.5/2">Based on our strategy on development and trade as outlined in the Trade and Investment White Paper 2004 (in which we supported improved trade opportunities for developing countries in line with their broader development strategies), the Government have responded to the EPA negotiations. We published a policy statement in March 2005 on how we think EPAs should be designed if they are to help the ACP countries develop. This policy determines how we will influence the EPA negotiations and assess their outcome.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.5/3">Secondly, at ACP countries' request, DFID has provided substantial financial and independent technical assistance to help inform their positions in the negotiations. This includes support for the west African, eastern and southern African and Caribbean countries as well to the regional bodies which negotiate on their behalf. The UK is the largest bilateral donor in the EU providing such assistance for EPAs.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.5/4">Thirdly, UK international development assistance will also respond to the needs and priorities of the ACP arising from EPAs in order to help them develop their ability to trade. DFID will provide funding through the European Development Fund. Support for developing countries, including the ACP, will also be provided through our own bilateral initiative, Aid for Trade, to which we have committed &pound;100 million per year by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="d.40W.2/2">I attach details of our bilateral general health sector spend by country for the financial years 1997-98 to 2004-05. This totalled nearly &pound;267 million in the financial year 2004-05. We are still in the process of validating expenditure data for 2005-06 and cannot release this under National Statistics Protocols.</p>
	<p pid="d.40W.2/3">DFID also supports work to improve health through our regional and central programmes (including research programmes) that complement the work of our country programmes. In 2004-05, this additional support brought our total bilateral spend on the health sector to some &pound;363 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.40W.2/4">In addition, we provide funding to UN agencies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, and bodies such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, which are all primarily concerned with helping countries improve their health services. In 2004-05, expenditure on multilateral organisations that have a significant focus on health was &pound;108.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.40W.2/5">DFID also provides general Poverty Reduction Budget Support to several developing countries to help build basic services. Some of this funding goes on health services, but is not captured within our sector specific spending figures which therefore somewhat underestimate our overall contribution to improving health in developing countries.</p>

In addition, DFID provides targeted support; for example in Vietnam, DFID has co-financed with the Government of Vietnam, the World Bank and other donors the Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children programme, a &pound;243 million project which was launched in October 2003 and includes a strong focus on inclusive education. In Kenya, DFID is supporting an innovative pilot project with Sightsavers and the Ministry of Education to provide assistive technology to all totally blind and severe low-vision students at Kenyatta University and three Teacher Training Colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="d.49W.5/2">Since then WHO has been working with the Ministry of Health in Iraq to improve drug supply systems. In addition to training staff, WHO is working with Iraqis to build new systems, monitor and plan the supply of essential drugs, establish quality control, and assist emergency planning. This has included direct supply of some essential medicines to Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="d.49W.5/3">Shortages remain and WHO advises that the national drug supply management system is still in need of technical and logistical assistance.</p>
	<p pid="d.49W.5/4">DFID has given most of its assistance to the Iraqi health sector through financial contributions to international organisations, including WHO, that have particular expertise in health. These contributions include:</p>
	<p pid="d.49W.5/5" class="indent">&pound;5 million to WHO, which has helped to fund the delivery of emergency medical supplies, supported clinics and hospitals in Baghdad and Basra, and supports the Iraqi Government's Health Sector Working Group.

	<p pid="d.49W.5/7" class="indent">&pound;70 million to the United Nations and World Bank multi-donor trust funds for Iraq. These trust funds finance reconstruction in a number of areas including health. The UN trust fund has approved 10 health and nutrition projects, in total valued at $96 million. The World Bank trust fund also has a $25 million health rehabilitation project which finances priority emergency services, including basic medical equipment and essential drugs.

	<p pid="d.50W.2/1">In the three financial years from 2002-03, DFID spent &pound;3.1 million, &pound;2.5 million and &pound;2.12 million in Kosovo, all on technical assistance. Our allocation for 2005-06 was &pound;2.7 million. Expenditure figures are being finalised. We intend to provide approximately &pound;3 million in 2006-07 and expect this level to continue for the next two financial years. Virtually all EC support to Kosovo is given through the European Agency for Reconstruction which provided &euro;63 million in 2003, &euro;73 million in 2004 and &euro;77 million in 2005.

	<p pid="d.52W.8/1">Improving infrastructure is essential for achieving economic growth in developing countries. There is also a pressing need to increase the efficiency of infrastructure to give greater access to the poor and better value for money. Current investment flows are insufficient to fund these additional needs and the public sector alone cannot bridge the financing and efficiency gaps. A significant contribution from the private sector will be required. However, attracting private capital and participation is difficult&mdash;according to World Bank figures, private investment in developing country infrastructure fell from US$ 49.6 billion in 1997 to US$ 12.5 billion in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/2">Among the main constraints to successful private sector participation in infrastructure are the lack of appropriate policies, laws, regulations and institutions and the weak capacity of the public sector to effectively manage private sector involvement. The PPIAF is a global technical assistance facility managed by the World Bank to address these constraints and, where requested to do so by developing country governments, facilitate and, where appropriate, raise the quality of private sector involvement in infrastructure. The PPIAF is a good example of successful donor harmonization in development. It is supported by 14 donors with a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience. As of April 2006, it had approved US$ 108.7 million funding for 495 activities in 101 countries. This funding mobilised an additional US$ 59.8 million co-financing from Governments and other donors.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/3">A particular strength of the PPIAF is its open and transparent systems of governance. These include procedures governing the application for, and allocation of, activity funds. As a partner in a multilateral facility, DFID abides by the endorsed systems and governance arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/4">DFID fully endorses the PPIAF's objective to help developing countries to improve the quality of their infrastructure to the benefit of the poor through effective public-private partnerships. In practice, this is largely achieved by helping Governments improve their policies, laws, regulations and institutions (their &quot;enabling environment&quot;). Our other objectives are to encourage greater donor coordination in designing solutions to meet the demands of developing countries, reducing transaction costs for developing countries and effective dissemination of lessons learned.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/5">DFID does not earmark its contribution to the PPIAF. Funding is pooled with that of other donors. The breakdown of total PPIAF expenditure in US$ by sector for each of the last three years is provided in the table. Future allocations will depend on demand from Governments of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.52W.8/29">As a partnership arrangement, the PPIAF is jointly governed. The PPIAF has four policy and administrative organs. DFID is represented on the first two:</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/30" class="indent">The Program Council is the governing body of the PPIAF, composed of representatives of the 14 donors contributing resources to the PPIAF, and chaired by the World Bank. The Program Council, which meets once a year around June time, is responsible for defining programme policies and priorities, approving an annual work plan and financial plan, reviewing PPIAF performance and overseeing other PPIAF organs.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/31" class="indent">The Donor Steering Group provides strategic direction to the Program Council. Membership of this group is on a voluntary basis and decided in consultation with the full Program Council.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/32" class="indent">The Technical Advisory Panel (TAP), comprises six international experts. It provides independent advice on strategy and evaluates the impact of the PPIAF programme by carrying out evaluations of a sample of PPIAF projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/33" class="indent">The PPIAF Program Management Unit (PMU) is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the facility with a focus on reviewing proposals, arranging delivery of PPIAF programmes and activities, and proposing and administering the work plan and budget.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/34">Further details on these organs and the PPIAF governance structure are provided in the PPIAF Program Charter, dated May 2001, as amended from time to time, available from its website:</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/35" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ppiaf.org">www.ppiaf.org</a></p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/36">All project proposals are assessed for value for money and their potential for impact by the PPIAF. Once approved, all activities follow World Bank procurement rules that require open and transparent competition to ensure value for money. A sample of activities are systematically evaluated by the Technical Advisory Panel of independent experts that reports to the Programme Council. PPIAF evaluations have confirmed that 84 per cent. of its activities have satisfactorily achieved their original objectives.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/37">In 2004, PPIAF donors also commissioned an independent evaluation&mdash;the 'Strategic Review', of the first five years of PPIAF's operations. The objective was to evaluate PPIAF's progress against its original objectives and identify ways for improving its performance. The report, issued in the final quarter of 2004, was very positive, concluding that the PPIAF is making an important contribution to development.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/38">A number of recommendations were made that the PPIAF has since implemented. The recommendations included strengthening the strategic direction of the programme; increasing stakeholder involvement in the Program Council, more focus on outcomes rather than outputs; enhancing PPIAF's identity as an autonomous multi-donor facility and improving impact measurement.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/39">Changes facilitated by the PPIAF often take a few years to deliver the anticipated improvements to the enabling environment. This has made it difficult to assess direct poverty impact to date. Improving impact measurement is an issue that is currently being addressed. One proposal is that PPIAF activity should be more closely anchored to planned infrastructure projects. Further work is in hand to gauge the impact of PPIAF activity on the International Financial Corporation's national 'doing business' ratings that address various aspects of the enabling environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/40">Country-specific activities may be undertaken only where governments seek the assistance of the PPIAF.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/41">Consensus building is essential if reforms are to be successful. Governments are responsible for leading the process. The PPIAF has played an important supporting role. For example, the PPIAF has supported the development of a series of training courses on utility regulation and finance that have been targeted at key stakeholder groups including Ministers and senior Government officials, journalists and consumer associations. The aim of the training courses is to equip stakeholders with a sound knowledge with which to appraise reforms. Two training workshops have also been held for stakeholders. The first workshop was held in South Africa in June 2005 and the second was held in Costa Rica in February 2006. Feedback provided to PPIAF on the workshops has been very positive.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/42">DFID last reviewed its involvement with the PPIAF in July 2005, when considering a request for continued support. This review drew heavily on the findings of the independent strategic review and progress on implementing its recommendations. The strategic review reported that the PPIAF has a comparative advantage over other facilities by demonstrating clear focus, global reach, strong donor support and efficient management. It confirmed that demand for PPIAF services by Governments of developing countries is growing and that continued DFID support is critical to growth and increasing the leverage of funds required for scaling up. On this basis, DFID agreed to continue its contribution to PPIAF for a further three-year period&mdash;July 2005 to June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/43">Donors are asked annually to consider a financial plan incorporating an estimate of future calls on donors based on the anticipated demand by Governments. The PPIAF then considers requests for funding from Governments once a quarter in light of available funds and donor pledges. DFID has agreed an indicative biannual payment schedule for meeting our commitment to the PPIAF based on the financial plan. DFID funds are only ever released on evidence of need and good performance.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.8/44">DFID consults with members of the public, NGOs and other stakeholders when setting the UK policy for international development. It is not practical to consult the public on the many individual funding decisions that DFID takes to deliver this policy.</p>

	<p pid="d.55W.2/1">Improving infrastructure is essential for achieving economic growth in developing countries. There is also a pressing need to increase the efficiency of infrastructure to give greater access to the poor and better value for money. Current investment flows are insufficient to fund these additional needs and the public sector alone cannot bridge the financing and efficiency gaps. A significant contribution from the private sector will be required. However, attracting private capital and participation is difficult&mdash;according to World Bank figures, private investment in developing country infrastructure fell from US$ 49.6 billion in 1997 to US$ 12.5 billion in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.2/2">Among the main constraints on successful private sector participation in infrastructure are the lack of appropriate policies, laws, regulations and institutions and the weak capacity of the public sector to effectively manage private sector involvement. The PPIAF is a global technical assistance facility managed by the World Bank to address these constraints and, where requested to do so by developing country Governments, facilitate and raise the quality of private sector involvement in infrastructure. The PPIAF is a good example of successful donor harmonization in development. It is supported by 14 donors with a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience. As of April 2006, it had approved $US 108.7 million funding for 495 activities in 101 countries. This funding mobilised an additional US$ 59.8 million co-financing from governments and other donors.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.2/3">A particular strength of the PPIAF is its open and transparent systems of governance. These include procedures governing the application for, and allocation of, activity funds. As a partner in a multilateral facility, DFID abides by the endorsed systems and governance arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.2/4">DFID fully endorses the PPIAF's objective to help developing countries to improve the quality of their infrastructure for the benefit of the poor through effective public-private partnerships. In practice, this is largely achieved by helping governments improve their policies, laws regulations and institutions (their &quot;enabling environment&quot;). Our other objectives are to encourage greater donor coordination in designing solutions to meet the demands of developing countries, reducing transaction costs for developing countries and effective dissemination of lessons learned.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.2/5">DFID does not earmark its contribution to the PPIAF. Funding is pooled with that of other donors. The breakdown of total PPIAF expenditure in US dollars by sector for each of the last three years is provided in the table below. Future allocations will depend on demand from Governments of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.55W.2/41">All project proposals are assessed for value for money and their potential for impact by the PPIAF. Once approved, all activities follow World Bank procurement rules that require open and transparent competition to ensure value for money. A sample of activities are systematically evaluated by the technical advisory panel of independent experts that reports to the Program Council, which is composed of representatives of the 14 donor members. PPIAF evaluations have confirmed that 84 per cent of its activities have satisfactorily achieved their original objectives.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.2/42">In 2004, PPIAF donors also commissioned an independent evaluation the 'Strategic Review', of the first five years of PPIAF's operations. The objective was to evaluate PPIAF's progress against its original objectives and identify ways for improving its performance. The report, issued in the final quarter of 2004, was very positive, concluding that that PPIAF is making an important contribution to development. A number of recommendations were made that the PPIAF has since implemented. The recommendations included strengthening the strategic direction of the programme; increasing stakeholder involvement in the PPIAF's Program Council; more focus on outcomes rather than outputs; enhancing PPIAF's identity as an autonomous multi-donor facility, and improving impact measurement.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.2/43">Changes facilitated by the PPIAF often take a few years to deliver the anticipated improvements to the enabling environment. This has made it difficult to assess direct poverty impact to date. Improving impact measurement is an issue that is currently being addressed. One proposal is that PPIAF activity should be more closely anchored to planned infrastructure projects. Further work is in hand to gauge the impact of PPIAF activity on the International Financial Corporation's national 'doing business' ratings that address various aspects of the enabling environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.55W.2/44">DFID is an active member of the PPIAF's Program Council and we are involved in discussions about the strategic direction of the PPIAF. Over the past couple of years, DFID and other donors have sought to encourage the PPIAF to make better progress on measuring the impact of its activities on poverty alleviation and to better co-ordinate its activity with others.</p>

	<p pid="d.57W.2/2">The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI) alliance board recently approved US$15 million for the completion of clinical trials of rotavirus vaccines in Africa and Asia during the period 2006-09. Furthermore, the board requested the development of an 'investment case' for the introduction of rotavirus vaccine, to be submitted to the November 2006 joint meeting of the GAVI alliance and GAVI fund boards. If approved, GAVI would finance rotavirus vaccine in GAVI-eligible countries (those with GNI of below $1000 p.a).

	<p pid="d.59W.2/2">Firstly, the UK played a key role in negotiating and ratifying the WHO'S Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which sets international standards on tobacco price and tax increases, tobacco advertising and sponsorship, labelling, illicit trade and second-hand smoke among others. Secondly, we have recently given the International Development Research Centre a &pound;1.1 million grant over 3 years for research into effective tobacco control policies and programmes that will minimize the threat of tobacco production and consumption to health and human development in developing countries. Thirdly, we provide advice to tobacco-dependent poor countries on constraints to their economic development and the livelihoods of their citizens.</p>

	<p pid="d.74W.2/1">Code of practice A issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 regulates contacts with the police and the public in the exercise of police powers to stop and search.</p>
	<p pid="d.74W.2/2">Code A requires that a record of the stop or stop and search must be made at the time unless there are exceptional circumstances. If the record is not given at the time, the person must be notified by the officer of their entitlement to a record if requested within 12 months and informed how a copy can be obtained. The decision to retain records after that period is a matter for individual chief officers, irrespective of whether the record relates to an adult or a juvenile and the outcome of the stop or stop and search.</p>
	<p pid="d.74W.2/3">Code A does not make special provision for the handling of a stop or stop and search involving a person under the age of 17 years old. Officers exercising these powers must do so fairly, responsibly and with respect for people being stopped or stopped and searched. It would be an operational matter for the officer concerned to determine whether any additional support or action would be required owing to the vulnerability of the individual; and guidance due for publication this summer by the National Centre for Policing Excellence highlights the need for officers to take account of the person's age and vulnerability .</p>

	<p pid="d.75W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.2/2">At present, improvement in literacy and numeracy for adults in custody is measured by reference to their overall contribution towards the Government's Skills for Life targets by counting the qualifications achieved. For young offenders and juveniles in custody, the Youth Justice Board measures improvement by those serving custodial sentences of more than six months through an assessment at the start and end of the sentence that shows what they have achieved, and whether or not they have gained a qualification.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.2/3">As new Learning and Skills Council-led delivery arrangements for offender learning are introduced across England from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July</phrase>, data on individual achievement by offenders will start to become available for adults, young offenders and juveniles in custody, and on those serving sentences in the community.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.2/4">A system of star ratings exists for prison health services. This is based on a framework of measures, including prison self-assessments, external inspection reports and prisons' performance against key areas such as mental health and dental waiting times.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.2/5">Since April 2006, HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) and the Healthcare Commission have worked in partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding. HMIP continues to inspect and report on the health outcomes for prisoners in all public sector establishments. The Healthcare Commission now assesses the effectiveness of primary care trusts' commissioning arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="d.75W.5/1">All public service schemes pay cash equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in respect of accrued rights in compliance with pensions law. Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under Public Private Partnerships or Public Finance Initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

	<p pid="d.76W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department has not issued any advice in response to this case. However, The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) National Fingerprint Board has issued a document dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-04">4 April 2006</phrase> entitled 'Erroneous and disputed identifications: Learning from experience elsewhere'. This document is for guidance only and is not a policy document; it was circulated to all fingerprint bureau in police forces in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/2">The ACPO report referred to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary Scotland's inspection of the Scottish Criminal Records Office (SCRO) that commenced on April 2000. The key recommendations of the inspection report were that the SCRO should:</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/3" class="indent">Move towards a non-numeric standard;</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/4" class="indent">Reform management and scope demands for staff levels;</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/5" class="indent">Consider moving to a centralised model for a national fingerprint service;</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/6" class="indent">Have external provision and management of competency testing for experts to provide a sustainable and defensible programme;</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/7" class="indent">Move towards a competency-based standard for expert qualification that all fingerprint experts within the SCRO should undergo;</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/8" class="indent">Provide a common procedure to deal with failure in the course of competency testing; introduce an improved automated manual system of case tracking.</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/9" class="indent">Produce national guidance on fingerprint standards and procedures and issue it to all fingerprint staff;</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/10" class="indent">Establish a national policy which encapsulates an independent review process to deal with all erroneous and disputed fingerprints.</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.2/11">ACPO and the Home Office place a strong emphasis on ensuring forensic standards in fingerprinting. The Home Office will shortly be consulting about the creation of a forensic regulator (in accordance with the evidence given by the <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">then Minister of State, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, before the Science and Technology Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase>). The creation of the National Policing Improvement Agency through the Police and Justice Bill will also be very significant in providing an Agency dedicated to continuous improvement of policing, including the area of forensic science.</p>

	<p pid="d.77W.3/1">Police forces do not routinely provide the Home Office with information on specifically alcohol-related crime, and so it is difficult to gauge the effect of occasional events such as the World Cup on this. Police recorded crime statistics covering the period of the World Cup will be released in September.</p>
	<p pid="d.77W.3/2">The Home Office funded an Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC) during the month preceding the World Cup. Part of the intention for this was to set the tone of acceptable behaviour during the competition itself. Results from this campaign will be released shortly.</p>
	<p pid="d.77W.3/3">Research has suggested a link between major sporting events and domestic violence. Because of this, a Domestic Violence Enforcement Campaign took place in some areas during the World Cup. Data from this campaign are still being collected and analysed, and the results will be released when they are ready.</p>

In accordance with the European Union handbook on policing co-operation in respect of international matches the costs were met by the host authorities. A Home Office press officer was attached to the police delegation. Some minor costs and reimbursements will be met by the Home Office. These are yet to be claimed or calculated.

	<p pid="d.78W.3/1">The information requested is not collated centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost (code of practice on Access to Government Information, part 2, clause 9). The cost of a stamp is a post office cost. The cost of stationery is difficult to estimate but around &pound;1 when all the overheads in terms of posting, computer costs and paper are taken into consideration. Staff time varies considerably based on the length of the letter. It is impossible therefore to estimate an average cost for all the letters sent out.</p>

	<p pid="d.80W.15/1">There is no compulsory retirement age for all coroners. However, coroners who held office immediately before April 6, 1978, and did not opt out of the statutory provisions, can be required by the relevant council to vacate office if they have completed 15 years service and attained the age of 65 years. Coroners' pensionable service under the applicable local government scheme will come to an end at the age of 70 years.</p>

	<p pid="d.84W.3/1">The following table shows the number of mortgage possession orders made in county courts in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight (includes Aldershot and Farnham, Basingstoke, Portsmouth, Southampton, Winchester and Newport) since 1987. These are the only county courts in Hampshire and Isle of Wight that deal with mortgage repossession matters.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.3/2">The civil procedure rules provide that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, these county courts cover areas that are not necessarily consistent with other administrative or constituency boundaries, and therefore for instance repossessions at Portsmouth county court may relate to properties in other constituencies besides Portsmouth.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.3/3">These figures do not indicate how many houses have been repossessed through the courts, since not all the orders will have resulted in the issue and execution of warrants of possession.</p>

Housing cases are considered a priority for funding, and the Funding Code criteria for legal representation in housing cases reflect this. Cases in which the roof over the applicant's head is directly at issue are considered to be of &quot;overwhelming importance&quot; to the applicant and can be funded in a wider range of circumstances than other housing cases.</p>

	<p pid="d.86W.20/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that criminal cases are dealt with in a speedy fashion commensurate with the interests of justice.

	<p pid="d.86W.20/2">We have put in place a number of measures to work towards this aim, such as the High Cost Cases Review Board, a cross-CJS board which aims to bring greater scrutiny to the way that high cost cases are managed.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.20/3">The judiciary have also issued a number of protocols on the management of heavy fraud and other complex cases, terrorism cases and of the disclosure process, which are intended to ensure that judges actively case manage to minimise the length of trials, and that prosecution and defence teams comply with deadlines and directions.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.20/4">The Criminal Case Management Framework promotes robust judicial case management among operational practitioners and provides guidance as to how cases should be managed efficiently and effectively from pre-charge through to conclusion. The Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 add a degree of prescription to the practices outlined in the CCMF by ensuring that criminal cases are dealt with efficiently and expeditiously.</p>

	<p pid="d.89W.6/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) has an important role in the social exclusion agenda. We are promoting the benefits of good early advice services for those most in need. Evidence shows that this can prevent relatively simple civil legal issues spiralling into more complex problems. We are also encouraging closer working across Whitehall. Our role is crosscutting in highlighting the worth of advice services to Government colleagues. DCA is also the facilitating Department for other Government Departments that require a final remedy to be decided upon by a court or tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="d.89W.6/2">Specialisation and innovation in the courts system is also relevant. We are looking at both preventing crime through community justice initiatives, and re-integrating offenders into society. The Community Justice Centre in North Liverpool is spearheading such an approach.</p>
	<p pid="d.89W.6/3">Another main area of influence is the role of family courts. The recent Review of the Child Care Proceedings System in England and Wales (produced jointly with DfES) aims to achieve better lives for children and their families by improving the care proceedings system and eliminating unnecessary delay in care cases, while ensuring that the process remains a fair one. The DCA is also a key player on the Domestic Violence Inter-Ministerial Group. There are currently 25 Specialist Domestic Violence (DV) courts. A bidding process is currently under way to establish a second tranche of these courts by <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.90W.2/1">Good, early advice services can prevent relatively simple civil legal issues developing into more complex and numerous problems. This is evidenced by the recent Legal Services Research Centre's &quot;Causes of Action&quot; publication, which also highlights the tendency for inter-related problems to develop around a key theme (broadly around 'family', 'homelessness' and 'economic' clusters). The Legal Services Commission's new Community Legal Service Strategy is informed by this research, and proposes that newly created Community Legal Advice Centres are located in areas of high deprivation in order to target the most vulnerable. My Department's recent Getting earlier, better advice to vulnerable people document underlines the need for ensuring advice is people focussed, with problems not being considered in isolation. It also highlights the importance of getting advice right first time, and ensuring more effective referral networks are in place so that people get the service they need regardless of their point of access to the system.</p>

	<p pid="d.90W.5/1">As part of its role in delivering legal aid, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) considers the need for its services to help prevent social exclusion. The LSC can play its part by ensuring that services are better co-ordinated, focussed and effective, and that acts of advice/assistance increase. The new Community Legal Service (CLS) Strategy proposes that Community Legal Advice Centres (CLACs) are located in areas of high deprivation in order to target the most vulnerable. In less densely populated areas Community Legal Advice Networks (CLANs) will ensure that clients are able to access a range of high quality advice services regardless of their geographic location. Community Legal Service Direct also allows easy access for clients. The new CLS Strategy, in proposing that CLACs and CLANs will cover all five areas of social welfare law (Community Care, Housing, Debt, Employment and Welfare Benefits), will further promote social inclusion.</p>

We continue to urge both parties to act with restraint and to end the current cycle of violence. The case for the temporary international mechanism is strengthened by the worsening humanitarian situation. The mechanism has already provided emergency fuel supplies to generators at Gaza hospitals, keeping vital services going. Other assistance to continue health services is expected to begin shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.93W.7/1">My Department sees maintaining the pre-eminent position of London within the global art market as vitally important. Through Arts Council England, we have invested around &pound;480,000 of lottery capital funding into London studio spaces for artists. The Arts Council also supports a number of art fairs, including the Frieze Art Fair which last year attracted 31,497 people, encouraging new buyers for contemporary art and leading to &pound;32 million of sales.</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.7/2">My Department sponsors a number of museums and galleries, a number of which have important contemporary collections. The Arts Council has also stimulated public interest in contemporary art through its Own Art Scheme, which offers interest free loans to open up the market to a wider range of people. Own Art, although primarily focused on the regions, is to be expanded to involve a number of art colleges in London.</p>

However, should English Heritage's plans for a new visitor centre and access arrangements at Stonehenge go ahead, along with the published scheme for improvements to the A303, it is estimated that visitor numbers are likely to stay the same as at present. Any increase in visitor spending is likely to be balanced by the cost of operating the new facilities.</p>

	<p pid="d.105W.2/1">Access to good quality sporting provision, including swimming pools, is essential if we are to encourage people to lead healthier, more active lives. There has been significant public investment in sports facilities in recent years&mdash;by 2006 over &pound;1 billion of Exchequer and lottery funding will have been committed to develop over 4,000 new or refurbished facilities. Swimming has been the single greatest beneficiary of sport lottery funding, having received some &pound;249 million since 1997. Peterborough has benefited from 31 awards totalling &pound;699,823.</p>

However, Sport England are encouraging and helping local authorities through the development of swimming strategies and toolkits to aid strategic planning. According to the Active Places database (available at <a href="http://www.activeplaces.com">www.activeplaces.com</a>) there are 14 swimming pools within a 10 mile radius of Peterborough.</p>

	<p pid="d.106W.6/1">At its meeting in December 2005 the Commission gave outline approval to the NAO's proposed refurbishment of its headquarters building in Buckingham Palace Road, London, subject, however, to three conditions. First, that the NAO should produce a detailed, fully costed business case for the project. Second, that the NAO should carry out a cost-benefit analysis of an alternative approach to its accommodation requirements, namely moving its headquarters to a North of England location. And third, that the NAO should provide a fuller explanation of its decision to rule out the possibility of acquiring alternative accommodation in London as part of the Government estate.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.6/2">At its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-04">4 July 2006</phrase>, the Commission considered the NAO's response under each of those headings.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.6/3" class="italic"> The Business Case</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.6/4">The business case produced by the NAO gives the total cost of the project as &pound;77.44 million, spread over five years starting in 2006-07. In the longer term, there will be a small increase in annual resource costs to the NAO, resulting from higher business rates, capital charges and depreciation, partially offset by reduced running costs through greater building efficiency. Since submitting its original proposals the NAO has revised its approach to the decanting of staff which will be necessary while the building work is in progress. It is now hoped to carry this out in a single rather than a two or three stage process, depending on the availability of suitable decant accommodation. On the basis of the business case, the NAO made a persuasive argument in support of refurbishment as the most cost-effective way of avoiding what would otherwise be&mdash;because of the building's current deficiencies&mdash;an unacceptable risk to the Office's continued ability to function efficiently. The Commission was, however, conscious of the sensitivity surrounding the timing of the project, since, under the NAO's plans, the bulk of the expenditure would occur in the years covered by the next, and potentially difficult, comprehensive spending review. We therefore pressed the NAO on the implications of deferring the project (which, because of the need to avoid coinciding with the competing demands on the construction industry from Olympics-related activity, would entail a delay until 2013). The NAO satisfied the Commission that, given the deteriorating condition of the current building, waiting a further seven years before undertaking remedial work would pose an unacceptable risk to the NAO's operations and therefore to the service it provides to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.6/5" class="italic"> The Possibility of Relocating to the North of England</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.6/6">In response to the Commission's request, the NAO examined Manchester as a possible location for a provincial headquarters building. Of a number of cities considered, Manchester was judged to come nearest to meeting the Office's principal requirements: good transport connections; and a sufficiently large local pool of qualified accountants to enable the NAO to recruit and retain key professional staff. On the latter count, the available pool in Manchester, though large in comparison with other provincial cities, is much smaller than London's and is insufficient to support the NAO's requirements. The cost-benefit analysis carried out by the NAO indicated that the basic costs associated with relocating would be broadly similar to those for the option of staying on in a refurbished Buckingham Palace Road. On the other hand, the analysis suggested that the uncertainty over the number of staff who would be willing to relocate posed a risk both of additional, but unquantifiable costs of redundancy and resettlement packages, and of disruption of core business activity. The Commission was satisfied that, for these reasons, relocation was not a realistic option. The NAO is, however, proposing to expand its presence in the North, concentrating on its existing team in Newcastle.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.6/7" class="italic"> Alternative Accommodation in London</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.6/8">As part of its consideration of alternative sites in London for its headquarters building, the NAO has examined the portfolio of vacant, or about to become vacant, properties maintained by the Office of Government Commerce. The NAO's assessment, which the Commission accepted, is that there is at present no building available of a size and configuration to meet the NAO's requirements on a long term basis, and at a cost competitive with the headquarters refurbishment option, taking account of the resultant loss of the current peppercorn rent. Taking all these factors into account, and having carefully considered the NAO's business case, the Commission gave its formal approval to the proposed refurbishment of the Buckingham Palace Road building. The Commission noted that, depending on how quickly the refurbishment work can begin, it may be necessary for the NAO to submit a supplementary estimate for the financial year 2006-07. The Commission will consider any such request if and when it is received. In the meantime, the Commission looks to the Treasury to make room within the public expenditure envelope for the relevant years for the resources needed for the refurbishment. For its part, the Commission will monitor carefully the progress of the project against both time and budget.</p>

	<p pid="d.110W.6/1">Two London Gateway transit schemes were allocated &pound;34 million of Community Infrastructure Fund (CIF) funding in November 2004 to provide support to the 2012 Olympics bid. In addition, the Government received 104 expressions of interest in January 2005 for the remaining &pound;166 million of CIF funding. These were reviewed and in March 2005 the Government announced that 48 schemes would be invited to prepare full bids. Following detailed assessment of the bids received, 25 schemes have been allocated CIF funding, with a further six schemes receiving Department for Communities and Local Government funding. The Government are working with local partners to look into other funding options for a small number of the remaining schemes.</p>

	<p pid="d.113W.8/2">Information collected by my Department about households accepted by local authorities as unintentionally homeless and in a priority need group identifies those where the applicant or a household member was vulnerable as a result of mental illness or disability.

A summary of information back to 1990 is presented in the table.

	<p pid="d.122W.2/2">Allocations to Lancaster city council of capital funding for housing purposes over the period 1997-98 to 2005-06 exceeds &pound;30 million. This includes the major repairs allowance first introduced in 2001-02 specifically for the improvement of local authority stock alongside the Decent Homes standard which sets out minimum standards to be met by 2010.</p>

This amounted to an 11 per cent. on year increase in funding.</p>

	<p pid="d.128W.10/1">Graphite brick cracking is a well known life-limiting feature of British Energy's advanced gas-cooled reactors, and all of these reactors are undergoing the same degradation process at varying rates. All of the UK's nuclear power stations are subject to robust regulation by the independent regulator, HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), and I am advised on nuclear safety matters by the NII's Chief Inspector.</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.10/2">I am satisfied that the NII would not allow any nuclear power station to continue to operate if there was an unacceptable risk to the general public.</p>

The Government are leaving no stone unturned, working closely with industry, to find solutions and reduce the impact. The new Business Energy Forum, co-chaired by the Secretary of State and Richard Lambert of the CBI, met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase> and is monitoring this work and looking at other strategic energy issues impacting on business. Higher energy prices in the UK reflect higher global prices, caused by rising demand and supply constraints (for oil and gas), the lack of EU energy market liberalisation, and domestic factors, such as the tight winter supply demand balance in the UK gas market.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.11/2">The importance of the Government's activity in pushing for European energy market liberalisation was highlighted in a Global Insight report in 2005. The report estimated that the lack of effective liberalisation and the dominance of oil-linked long-term supply contracts in Europe would cost UK industrial consumers of gas some &pound;2.6 billion over the following year. Ofgem analysis suggests that the cost to UK gas consumers of Interconnector flows not always being in line with price signals during the last winter was &pound;1.5 billion and would cost &pound;3 billion if repeated during the coming winter. The European Commission has been active in reviewing competition in gas and electricity markets.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.11/3">During the past two years there have been several investigations and reports into competition in UK gas and electricity markets. These include the Ofgem gas price probe, and two inquiries from the Trade and Industry Select Committee. The Ofgem gas price probe found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in the UK gas market. More recently, Ofgem published a &quot;Domestic Retail Market Report&quot;, which concluded that, &quot;competition remains effective and vigorous in all segments of the domestic energy market.&quot; Independent research by Oxera concluded that in 2004 the UK had the most competitive electricity and gas markets in the EU and G7 (available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file28425.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/files/file28425.pdf</a>).</p>

	<p pid="d.136W.8/1">The Government consider that the world's oil resources are sufficient to prevent global total oil production peaking before 2030, by which time the International Energy Agency's reference case scenario in its 2005 World Energy Outlook shows global oil demand reaching 115.4 million barrel per day, nearly 40 per cent. higher than current levels. The exact levels and years of the peaks in global conventional and total oil production will depend on assumptions about a number of factors, including the rate of global oil demand growth, the rate of investment in the global oil sector, and technological developments in finding and producing oil.</p>
	<p pid="d.136W.8/2">Market mechanisms will ration the remaining global supplies of oil and provide the incentive for a shift to alternative sources of energy. This process needs to be supported by Governments. The UK Government are already putting in place policies that will help ease the UK economy away from power supplied primarily through fossil fuels and is also promoting international efforts, for example through the G8 Gleneagles Plan of Action, to develop cleaner energy technologies and promote energy efficiency.</p>

However, net exports of refined oil products meant that the UK remained a net exporter of overall oil (crude, NGLs, feedstocks, and refined products). Details are given in tables 3.1 and 3.2 of the June 2006 version of UK Energy Trends available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/trends/index.html">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/trends/index.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="d.146W.2/1">The Government introduced statutory controls on spam emails by means of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which were enacted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>. The regulations provide a first line of defence against spam originating in the EU where the recipient has no knowledge of the advertiser of the products being marketed. The regulations require that spam must not be sent to an individual subscriber without prior permission or unless there is a previous relationship between the parties. The regulations can be enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the EU. There is regular contact between my Department, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Information Commissioner's Office on the operation of these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.2/2">The Government recognise that most spam does not come from the UK and have therefore extensively promoted international co-operation. A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase> between the enforcement authorities of the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, to reduce the problem by working together to investigate those sending spam. The UK also plays a leading role in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s Anti Spam Task Force and other multilateral initiatives. In late 2004, the UK launched the world's first and only anti-spam enforcement network, the London Action Plan, which now spans five continents and includes authorities and industry from countries particularly affected by this issue, such as Nigeria, China and India.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.2/3">The end user has a role to play in acting to avoid being a target for those sending spam, as well as acting to filter spam. Information has been made available to the public and to business by the DTI, the Information Commissioner's Office, the Office of Fair Trading as well as a number of sites provided by service and software providers. These messages have been reinforced by the Get Safe Online initiative launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>. This is an initiative between Government and Industry to help individuals and businesses protect themselves against internet threats, including spam.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.2/4">Our response to the problem of spam continues to develop. I have taken careful note of the views of the Information Commissioner's Office on the powers available to him, and DTI officials are working with the Information Commissioner's Office on this matter.

	<p pid="d.148W.3/1">There has been a substantial fall in UK-Zimbabwe trade in recent years. In 2000, UK and Zimbabwe two-way trade amounted to &pound;143 million. Imports from Zimbabwe were mainly agricultural products with tobacco, making up approximately 31 per cent. of the total imports. Exports were mainly manufactured goods, with office machines and ADP equipment topping the table at &pound;5.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.3/2">By 2005, two-way trade had fallen to &pound;66 million. The principal change was in tobacco imports, which fell to &pound;4.8 million from &pound;31 million in 2000 down 85 per cent. Exports also fell, with the leading export, road vehicles, topping the table at &pound;3.5 million. The decline in trade can be attributed to the policies of the Government of Zimbabwe which have brought about the fall of both imports and exports.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.3/3">A breakdown of UK exports and imports by sector for 2004 and 2005 is shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.3/4">HMG have not imposed any economic sanctions or restrictions on doing business in Zimbabwe and two-way trade continues, although as the aforementioned figures show, at a substantially reduced level. It is our view that economic sanctions would harm the people of Zimbabwe at a time of humanitarian crisis, while having very little impact on the ZANU (PF) leadership. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered enough.</p>

Our longer term estimate of the overall costs is around &pound;175 to &pound;225 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="d.150W.3/2">This potential cost consists of two main elements. First, allowing larger lump sums to be taken out and taxed at marginal rate at age 75 would have a tax cost because additional pension savings would be induced.</p>
	<p pid="d.150W.3/3">The up-front tax cost of these additional pension savings is estimated to be in the region of &pound;300 to &pound;500 million per annum. Around three quarters of this would be reclaimed as income tax on the resulting retirement benefits. This gives a broad range for this part of the costing of &pound;75 to &pound;125 million per annum. We used the lower range of this estimate for our conservative initial cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.150W.3/4">Secondly, allowing individuals to leave pensions untouched until death and then bequeath the capital would reduce income tax on pensions in payment. As any additional savings held in pension assets at death would largely displace other liquid assets, held inheritance tax (IHT) would not increase to offset this income tax lost. Even if wealth held at death were to increase as a result of the tabled amendments, the average effective rate of IHT on such assets would still be far below the rate of income tax. Only 6 per cent. of estates have an IHT charge.</p>
	<p pid="d.150W.3/5">The longer term costs of this behaviour are very uncertain but are estimated at &pound;100 million per annum in lost income tax. But this would take time to build up and we have used one quarter of this amount for our conservative initial cost.</p>

The level of these contributions is also dependent in negotiation of the annual EU budget and HM Treasury plays an active role in these discussions, see below. The UK's contributions fluctuate from year to year as can be seen in Tables 31 and 3.2 of the &quot;European Community Finances&quot; White Paper (Cm 6770, page 15 and 17). These fluctuations occur for a variety of reasons, as explained in paragraph 3.6 of the &quot;European Community Finances&quot; White Paper (Cm 6770, page 15).</p>

This budget disciplined approach helps restrict the growth in UK contributions.</p>
	<p pid="d.153W.8/3">Of course most of the annual budget is pre-set by treaty obligations and multi-annual spending programmes. Furthermore the UK is but one of 25 member states. Decisions in the Council on the annual budget are taken by Qualified Majority, and the final budget must be agreed with the European Parliament. Nevertheless by working effectively with like-minded member states, the Government are able to influence the outcome.</p>

	<p pid="d.158W.6/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">17 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer plans to review the methods of collecting local authority population statistics in order to take account of immigration from EU accession countries in the period since May 2004. (85001)</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/4" class="indent">Migration of accession country citizens to and from the UK is captured via existing data sources that are used to estimate population change. For population estimation purposes, the definition of a migrant is someone who changes their country of usual residence for a period of at least a year which is the UN recommended definition of a long term migrant. The 2005 mid-year population estimates, due to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-24">24 August 2006</phrase>, will therefore include an estimate of the number of long term immigrants from the EU accession countries, based on the UN definition.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/5" class="indent">It is recognised that information about short-term migrants is needed, both nationally and at local levels, for policy and planning purposes and for service provision. In May of this year, ONS set up an Inter-departmental Task Force on Migration Statistics. The Task Force will report to me by the end of August, making recommendations on timely improvements that could be made to the estimates of migration and migrant populations in the United Kingdom, both nationally and at local level.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/6" class="indent">ONS are also carrying out an extensive programme of work titled Improving Migration and Population Statistics (IMPS) Project which is designed to investigate improvements to the population and migration statistics produced by ONS. Further information on this work can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a>. In particular:</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/7" class="indent">The IMPS programme of research is taking forward recommendations from the National Statistics Quality Review (NSQR) into International Migration. The quality review made recommendations for improving the estimation of total migration flows to and from the UK and the allocation of international migration to local areas. This work includes investigating administrative sources that may be used in producing or quality assuring the international migration estimates (such as the Worker Registration Scheme data), investigating potential sources of information about short-term migrants and making improvements to the current source of information on international migrants, the International Passenger Survey (IPS).</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/8" class="indent">The latest Progress Report on taking forward the recommendations of the NSQR on International Migration can be found at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="d.158W.6/9" class="indent">Also, as part of the IMPS programme, ONS are conducting Local Authority case studies. These aim to get a better understanding, from a local perspective, of the administrative data sources that are currently used in the population estimation procedure. They will also investigate any other high quality sources that the local areas use themselves for population purposes. The local areas selected for these studies are ones that are known to have reasons which make their population difficult to estimate, e.g. those with a high volume of migratory moves. It is intended that these studies will contribute towards the improvement of both internal and international migration statistics.</p>

	<p pid="d.160W.6/1">Child tax credit (CTC) includes a family element of &pound;545 per year. It also includes a baby addition at a rate of a further &pound;545 per year for families for periods when they are responsible for a child aged under one year. Equivalent payments are made to families receiving their child support via income support or jobseeker's allowance. Abolishing these elements would reduce expenditure on CTC by around &pound;3.3 billion per year, based on 2004-05 awards. The extra child benefit expenditure resulting from adding the weekly equivalents to the rate for the eldest child would be around &pound;4.3 billion per year. Therefore, the net cost would be &pound;1 billion per year.</p>
	<p pid="d.160W.6/2">The recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report &quot;What will it take to end child poverty?&quot; suggested that the child tax credit was probably the most cost-effective way of reducing child poverty.

	<p pid="d.167W.2/1">Services to care leavers in Lancashire are provided directly by Lancashire county council. Services for care leavers in West Lancashire are co-ordinated by the county's south area leaving care team which supports young people who live in a wide area, from Skelmersdale to the boundaries of Preston and Southport.</p>
	<p pid="d.167W.2/2">Every care leaver must have a pathway plan based on an assessment of their personal needs, setting out the services that will be necessary to support them to greater independence. Leaving care services in the West Lancashire area draw on a wide range of professional staff to contribute to the support of individual care leavers including foster carers, children's home staff, social workers, specialist leaving care staff, Connexions staff and specialist welfare rights and housing staff. Care leavers in West Lancashire also have opportunities to take up work experience arranged by the Looked After Children Employment Skills (LACES) project.</p>
	<p pid="d.167W.2/3">The exact level of financial support provided to any care leaver will be recorded in the individual's pathway plan. Up until the age of eighteen, the local authority will usually be his/her primary source of income. Lancashire, as is the case for other local authorities, is responsible for funding accommodation, maintenance and other expenses (e.g. travel and leisure costs). Once care leavers reach 18, they are entitled to have access to the same mainstream arrangements for obtaining financial help as other young people. It will be the role of their leaving care personal adviser to assist them to access this help. However Lancashire, as the responsible local authority, has a continuing duty to provide assistance, for as long as the young person remains in an approved programme, with the costs of education or training.</p>

This team comprises a manager, one qualified social worker, one support worker, two leaving care co-ordinators and an administrator. Two members on this team are specifically available to provide support as leaving care personal advisers.</p>
	<p pid="d.167W.5/2">The level of contact that is maintained with each individual care leaver depends on their personal needs. In Lancashire, where young people entitled to care leaving services continue to remain looked after by the local authority, their social workers must visit at least every three months. However, when young people are being actively prepared to leave care, contact will be far more frequent than this and where a young person requires intensive support, contact might take place several times a week. The team estimates that, on average, all care leavers in West Lancashire are seen at least fortnightly.</p>
	<p pid="d.167W.5/3">Young people are also able to make contact with the leaving care team without formal appointments. They make regular contact by phone, occasionally write letters or e-mail and increasingly prefer to communicate by text message. All young people have their social worker's mobile phone number and if they leave a message in working hours their social worker will aim to respond the same day.</p>

	<p pid="d.172W.2/2">The first, &quot;Dropping Out: A Study of Early Leavers from Higher Education&quot; (DfES, RR386, December 2002), surveyed around 1,500 early leavers from HE.

	<p pid="d.172W.2/4">The second, &quot;Review of Gap Year Provision&quot; (DfES, RR555, July 2004), provided a comprehensive summary and analysis of existing literature and research into gap years. It noted a range of benefits of gap years to individuals, employers and society. These included &quot;improved educational performance&quot;. However, it did identify a couple of studies which suggested that</p>

	<p pid="d.175W.2/1">As at November 2001, some 2.6 million individuals in England had opened an individual learning account through the national framework launched in September 2000. Of these, over 347,000 were opened during 2000. (Prior to the launch of the national framework, over 200,000 members applied via TECs, of whom, nearly 80,000 transferred their membership to the national framework and are included in the overall total.)</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.2/2">Total expenditure to the point of closure was &pound;261 million, the majority representing payments to learning providers but also including Capita contract payments, development pilots and other related programme costs. The Department paid learning providers &pound;223 million from the inception of the scheme to its closure. &pound;31.1 million of this was paid during 2000 and &pound;191.9 million during 2001.</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.2/3">Key design principles of the national ILA framework were to encourage more people into learning by helping to tackle the financial barriers to learning and to allow people to take responsibility for their own learning. ILAs were not intended to be a guarantee of quality for learning or learning providers. Nevertheless, many account holders who used their account to book a course stated that the learning met or exceeded their expectations (York Consulting Research Report 295). The Government initially made the decision to withdraw the programme in light of an increasing number of complaints. Subsequently, Ministers closed the programme early because of the compelling and growing evidence of abuse.</p>

	<p pid="d.176W.0/1">The Government remain committed to protecting school playing fields. In this respect there is a general presumption against the need to change the current pattern of school playing field provision by disposal or change of use. However, some playing fields can be genuinely surplus and it can make sense to allow them to be sold and the proceeds used to provide new or improved sports or education facilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.176W.0/2">In the first instance, applications to dispose of school playing fields are considered by the independent school playing fields advisory panel.

Non-accredited learning is currently funded mainly through safeguard personal and community development funding (PCDL), but also within WBL and FE. In WBL, Entry to Employment (a programme of other training and life skills for learners not in employment) has been introduced in response to the Cassells Review of Modern Apprenticeships. Funding for internally certificated learning is also available through FE institutions. Additionally, courses co-financed with European funding are not necessarily qualification based.</p>
	<p pid="d.176W.3/14">However, in 2004-05 it is estimated that 39 per cent. of FE learners and 98 per cent. of PCDL learners were taking non-externally accredited courses (which could be either qualifications which are not externally accredited or non-qualification based).</p>

	<p pid="d.182W.5/2">The School Meals Review Panel considered the need for a specific standard for trans-fatty acids to be included within their proposals, and concluded against imposing a specific standard for the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.5/3" class="indent">Evidence shows that adult intakes of trans-fatty acids are well below the maximum threshold level for health;</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.5/4" class="indent">Adopting a standard to limit the fat content of school meals would contribute towards controlling levels of trans-fatty acids; and</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.5/5" class="indent">Food-based standards would include restrictions on foods which tend to be higher in trans-fatty acids (for example, savoury snacks and confectionery).</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.5/6">The School Food Trust supported the panel's view that their proposals would sufficiently control trans- fatty acids, and that there was no need to develop a specific standard for trans-fatty acids which had the potential to complicate the new standards unnecessarily, making it more difficult for schools and local authorities to implement them.</p>

	<p pid="d.197W.5/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Maurice Smith, has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of his reply has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Maurice J. Smith dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/4" class="indent">You asked what criteria Ofsted use to assess school sporting provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/5" class="indent">Since September 2005 Ofsted's school inspections have focused on the school's overall effectiveness. During one of these inspections Ofsted inspects sports provision in a very general way as part of the inspection of the quality of education provided. There is not a specific focus on physical education unless it is a particularly important subject in the school. Schools with specialist sports college status, for example, will have their distinctive aims and characteristics taken into account and the extent to which the specialist aims are met.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/6" class="indent">Every child matters: The Framework for the inspection of schools in England from September 2005 sets out the principles for school inspections. The guidance outlines what inspection will cover and the work that inspectors need to do. This common inspection schedule for schools and other post-1 provision is supported by non-statutory guidance, published in two parts:</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/7" class="indent">Guidance on using the schedule</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/8" class="indent">Guidance on conducting inspections.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/9" class="indent">The Guidance on using the schedule contains specific criteria and benchmarks to support inspectors in knowing where to pitch their judgments. Equally, they should be an aid to schools in the process of self-evaluation. The amount of evidence on physical education will vary according to the priorities and focus of the inspection.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/10" class="indent">In addition to section five inspections, Ofsted has a new subject inspection programme which, in the case of physical education, involves 30 primary and 30 secondary schools each year. Every third year a report on physical education is published using the accumulated evidence from these visits. The first is due in 2008. General guidance is provided for the HMI and additional inspectors who are involved with this programme. Ofsted is currently developing subject-specific guidance which exists in draft form. The contents are intended to help inspectors and all other staff to evaluate standards and achievement, quality of provision, leadership and management and other factors that might have a bearing on what learners achieve in physical education. For example, when reporting on the standards achieved by pupils in physical education inspectors:</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/11" class="indent">interpret test, examination results and awards gained by pupils</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/12" class="indent">judge the standards of work seen, highlighting what pupils do well and could do better</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/13" class="indent">evaluate how well pupils are achieving, evaluating standards by the ends of the different key stages and highlighting any differences in achievement for different groups of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/14" class="indent">During the inspection, an inspector's view of standards is supplemented by:</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/15" class="indent">examining pupils' targets in physical education and the basis on which they were set and progress towards achieving them any performance trends over time</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/16" class="indent">identifying strengths and weaknesses in attainment against the knowledge, skills and understanding set out in the National Curriculum attainment target.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/17" class="indent">Grade characteristics are illustrated in order to help inspectors make judgments. For example, when judging standards in physical education to be good, inspectors will look for the following characteristics:</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/18" class="indent">Standards achieved in examination courses are good, above national averages or as reflected in contextual value added. Standards show upward trends over time. Learners' skills, knowledge and understanding in most of the four aspects of the attainment target and across most areas of activity are good. The progress of the great majority of learners, across key stages, is good and for some it is very good, and show that almost all achieve well compared with their prior attainment and ability in physical education, and compared with those in similar schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/19" class="indent">When making judgements on standards and achievement, inspectors will also look for evidence on the 10 high quality outcomes promoted by the Physical Education, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL) strategy.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/20" class="indent">Most subject inspections focus on a specific subject issue, identified from the previous inspection, performance data or as part of a specific survey on, for example, the PESSCL strategy. For the subject 'issue' being inspected, a single grade is required and for this the general grade criteria have been interpreted in terms of the particular issue. Guidance pages are provided for each issue to support grading.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/21" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight and will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="d.199W.0/2">As part of the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC), schools are required to record ethnicity data to reflect the main categories used in the 2001 National Population Census. Children of Somali ethnic origin are recorded under the category of &quot;Black African&quot;. Following a consultation exercise in 2002, local authorities (LAs) were given the option of using extended ethnicity categories in their schools if they felt that the main ones did not meet their local management needs. The extended ethnicity categories do include a separate &quot;Somali&quot; code but not all LAs have chosen to use the extended categories. The majority of authorities use a mixture of main and extended codes and, therefore, the Department does not hold complete data for the extended ethnic background categories.</p>

	<p pid="d.204W.5/14">Full details of UFI funding are available only from 2001-02 onwards. Prior to 2001-02 funding was made available through the FEFC, for which we do not hold information. UFI (initially called the &quot;University for Industry&quot;), the organisation responsible for learndirect, has successfully pushed the boundaries of learning methods, by making innovative use of technology to make learning more flexible. It is the largest Government supported e-learning initiative in the world, and provides high quality learning for the post-16 learning and skills sector. It particularly reaches those with few or no skills and qualifications who are unlikely to participate in more traditional forms of learning. It is not an awarding body and does not have the status of a university.</p>
	<p pid="d.204W.5/15">Since 1999, more than 2 million people have improved their skills either at a learndirect centre, from work, or from their home computer. Since April 2003, over 120,000 people have achieved their first skills for life test pass in literacy or numeracy through learndirect. UFI is now delivering over one fifth of the post-19 sector's skills for life test passes annually. Almost 200,000 small and medium sized employers have also used learndirect services. The learndirect advice service has delivered more than 33 million information and advice sessions on the telephone and online.</p>

The impact of recent improvements in life expectancy was fully taken into account in developing the benefit structure of this scheme, including by setting a preserved pension age at 65. There have also been changes to the benefit structure of the old pension scheme, the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975, to ensure its long term affordability. The age at which a preserved pension is paid was delayed from 60 to 65 for all service, from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. Some of these savings were reinvested in the scheme in the form of an increase in the death in service lump sum to three times pay.

	<p pid="d.212W.8/1">The procurement of meat in the Falkland Islands is consistent with the Ministry of Defence's wider procurement policy. In accordance with this policy, contractors are encouraged to purchase British produce whenever it is competitive and consistent with meeting quality standards. The MOD is, however, bound by European legislation, and is required to seek value for money in the Single European Market. The MOD's Food Supply Contractor sources all meat procured for use by the UK armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="d.220W.5/1">We have seen no need so far for specific discussions between my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Defence and for Work and Pensions on ensuring that employers are informed of the skills of Service leavers. High rates of employment for Service leavers are already achieved through the Department's Career Transition Partnership (CTP) as part of the resettlement process. Of those who wish to work and are eligible for the service, over 50 per cent. are in employment within one month of discharge, rising to about 95 per cent. six months post-discharge.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.5/2">The CTP commercial partner, Right Management Ltd. is a highly experienced outplacement company with a proven track record. It has a very effective marketing arm that carefully targets prospective employers who can offer quality jobs to Service leavers. Those employers who engage Service leavers are seldom disappointed and tend to seek more when vacancies arise.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.5/3">The cultivation of prospective employers is a continuing process, not only for Right Management but for all others involved in the resettlement of departing Service personnel. It is an area of further development under the new CTP contract, with particular emphasis on tying together, at both local and national level, jobs and resettlement training opportunities and exploiting those who have passed successfully through the CTP process to attain posts of influence in civilian employment.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.5/4">For the minority of early Service leavers who are not eligible for CTP services, a resettlement briefing is provided which signposts employment help available from Other Government Departments and ex-Service charities: contacts are arranged on their behalf as necessary, and these are followed up by the briefing officer. This group of early leavers is also assessed for vulnerability to social exclusion and extra help is given where this is identified as a concern. The effectiveness of these arrangements is being kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="d.221W.2/1">There have been no recent discussions on the subject between Secretaries of State. Since 1948, it has been the policy of successive Governments that health care for veterans should be provided by the NHS. Priority NHS treatment applies to veterans who are war pensioners for their accepted disorders. Officials in the Ministry of Defence and the four UK Health Departments work closely together, and they are at present developing delivery models to ensure high quality mental health services for veterans across the UK. My predecessors and I have been closely briefed on this and other work in the area of veterans' health. Should there be any issues following this work, or otherwise, I will discuss these with Ministers from the Department of Health and devolved Administrations through the Veterans Ministerial Task Force, as appropriate.</p>

The MOD will meet about 70 per cent. of the cost of this research from the Veterans Challenge Fund. The Department is not currently undertaking any research into veterans in prison but is leading a project with the Home Office, ex-Service charities and other voluntary sector organisations to assist ex-Service offenders in custody and on release, and their families, to reduce the risk of re-offending. In a related area, the Department has funded research on the possible merits of mentoring for vulnerable veterans which looked in particular at the needs of personnel discharged from the Military Corrective Training Centre.

Equipment can also be accessed through other provision, for example, the adviser discretion fund (ADF), which enables the purchase of almost anything, up to a limit of &pound;100 within a 12-month period, that will help a customer obtain a job or take up an offer of employment. NDDP customers can access ADF through Jobcentre Plus advisers.</p>

	<p pid="d.240W.5/1">Details of the public appointments to public bodies sponsored by The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) can be found in &quot;Public Bodies&quot;, copies of which are in the Library. &quot;Public Bodies&quot; has been published annually since 1980 and the most recent edition provides figures for 2005. Each edition of &quot;Public Bodies&quot; contains details on the number of public appointments and remuneration details for that particular year. DWP was established in June 2001 and stewardship of those of its public bodies in existence before this time sat within its predecessor Departments. Comparable information for 1976, 1986 and 1996 in respect of DWP public bodies could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.243W.2/1">The European Commission's Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) does not make formal recommendations concerning the classification of chemicals. The responsibility for this falls to the Classification and Labelling Working Group established by the European Chemicals Bureau and this Group has not considered the classification of sulphuric acid as a carcinogen. However, in its deliberations leading to recommendations on occupational exposure limits, SCOEL undertakes an assessment of the evidence on all aspects of the substances under consideration, including whether or not a substance may have particular properties, including the potential to cause cancer in humans.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.2/2">In relation to sulphuric acid mist, for which a Recommendation for an occupational exposure limit was published in October 2004, SCOEL felt that the balance of evidence from studies in worker populations was sufficient to indicate that sulphuric acid mist has the potential to cause laryngeal cancer in humans. However, there were insufficient data to reliably inform on the airborne exposure conditions that were associated with the increased incidence of laryngeal cancer in these studies. In relation to the mechanism whereby sulphuric acid mist causes laryngeal cancer, SCOEL concluded that it is based on long-term chronic irritation of the laryngeal epithelium, and that airborne exposures that are below the threshold for the induction of such irritant effects would not lead to any increased risk of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.2/3">SCOEL recommended that an 8-hour time-weighted average occupational exposure limit, set at 0.05 mg.m-3, would not lead to any adverse health effects in workers, and would not be associated with any increased risk of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.2/4">In November 2001 the Health and Safety Executive published a Chemical Hazard Alert Notice for sulphuric acid mist, which recommended that employers should control mist exposure to below 0.3 mg.m-3, in line with advice from the National Sulphuric Acid Association. The 8-hour time-weighted average occupational exposure standard (OES) for sulphuric acid, formerly set at 1 mg.m-3, was withdrawn by the Health and Safety Commission in May 2003. There is currently no British occupational exposure limit.</p>

	<p pid="d.244W.9/1">Although the H5N1 virus has a reported fatality rate of around 50 per cent. in humans, there is some question regarding the accuracy of this figure. This is partly because we cannot guarantee that all H5N1 cases have been recorded. It is important to remember that fatality rates for pandemic flu have historically been lower than H5N1 avian flu. For example, the 1918 pandemic was the most severe in the 20th century and this had a fatality rate of around 2 per cent. This 2.5 per cent. figure was informed by international consensus and expert advice. Our modellers have taken the fatality rate of the H5N1 virus into consideration when agreeing this figure.</p>

	<p pid="d.247W.8/2">The continued use of the suite of rooms forming the Fraser Day Hospital for health-related services is being investigated and, as such, the value of the primary care trust's legal interest in this accommodation is not required at the present time. The provision of local health care facilities is the responsibility of the Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust (PCT), with the support of their strategic health authority. It is for the PCT to estimate any costs of changes in service arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="d.256W.0/1">The areas of greatest challenge identified in the delivery resource pack in relation to 18 weeks are orthopaedics, endoscopy, echocardiography and audiology. National projects are required in these category 'A' areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.256W.0/2">In orthopaedics, a co-ordinating group of key stakeholders has been established, and a musculoskeletal services framework was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July 2006</phrase> on the Department's and the 18 week patient pathway websites. Work continues to identify and then tackle local performance levels.</p>
	<p pid="d.256W.0/3">In endoscopy, work is well under way to identify performance levels and best practice, building on the work begun by the NHS Modernisation Agency. In cardiology, the project is identifying those tests that present the greatest challenge in terms of intervention rates and performance, including echocardiography.</p>
	<p pid="d.256W.0/4">In audiology, most adult hearing services are accessed directly from primary care, and are therefore provided outside of the pathways covered by the 18-week target. However, waiting times for adult hearing services are too long and do need to be tackled, not least to ensure that referrals to such services are not diverted via ear, nose and throat departments (which are covered by 18 weeks) to benefit from the 18-week maximum wait that will apply by December 2008. Work is under way at official level, with stakeholders to be involved, and a plan will be published in due course, following ministerial approval.</p>
	<p pid="d.256W.0/5">In terms of the high risk, category B areas, the eight 18-week pioneer health communities will soon turn their attention from developing the mechanisms by which whole pathways will be measured to redesigning pathways in the high risk areas identified in the delivery resource pack. The table shows the specialties being addressed by each of the pioneers. Magnetic resonance imaging, computerised tomography and non-obstetric ultrasound diagnostic tests are being addressed as part of these pathways.</p>

	<p pid="d.258W.0/1">Key areas of challenge to delivering the 18-week waiting target were outlined in section two of the publication, &quot;Tackling Hospital Waiting: The 18 Week Patient Pathway&mdash;An Implementation Framework&quot;. Since publication, national projects have begun in orthopaedics and endoscopy, and the national project in cardiology is in development. Work is under way at official level on an audiology action plan and this will be published in due course following ministerial approval. The 18-week programme team and the Department have highlighted the key challenges at numerous events in the past few months, including the NHS Confederation conference. The team will shortly be holding events in each of the new strategic heath authorities to help prepare for delivery.</p>
	<p pid="d.258W.0/2">This publication, which is available in the Library and on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/13/46/69/04134669.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/13/46/69/04134669.pdf</a> also sets out the key messages for all groups involved in the delivery of 18 weeks, including the key actions required by various parties.</p>
