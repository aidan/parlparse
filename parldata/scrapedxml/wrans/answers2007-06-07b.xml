The regulation required vehicles carrying explosives to be marked front and rear with an orange rectangle and on the sides with an orange diamond carrying in black the classification division and the compatibility group and some cases the explosives symbol. Following the incident at Peterborough, the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) obtained the agreement of consignors of explosives to implement the vehicle marking requirement before the regulations formally came into effect.</p>

The HSE advised that only where the rapid application of water would have a good chance of preventing an explosion, should an attack by firefighters be attempted.</p>
	<p pid="b.628W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="1992-05-06">6 May 1992</phrase>, Chief Officers Letter 6/1992 item 7 introduced Technical Bulletin 1/1992: Explosives Guide.

It is confident that the mandatory ceremonies will be funded within its &pound;2 billion revenue budget. The bid projects and signature events and the UK-wide cultural festival will be delivered and funded in partnership with a range of public and private partners. For example, the Legacy Trust will invest at least &pound;40 million in funding cultural and sporting activity in the run up to the 2012 Games.</p>

	<p pid="b.632W.6/1">Support for children with special educational needs (SEN) accounts for a high proportion of all school expenditure. We do not hold information centrally about expenditure on dyspraxia, but information collected from local authorities (LAs) shows planned expenditure on the education of school-age children with SEN of &pound;4.5 billion in 2006-07. This is about 13 per cent. of all education spending.</p>
	<p pid="b.632W.6/2">Schools and LAs provide support to children with SEN, including those with dyspraxia, by taking account of guidance set out in the SEN Code of Practice (2001). The code recommends school based interventions at two levels&mdash;&quot;School Action and School Action Plus&quot;. If a child does not make adequate progress or cannot access the curriculum at &quot;School Action Plus&quot;, and it is considered the child may need support over and above what the school can provide, the LA may carry out a statutory assessment of the child's SEN, with the view to the issue of a statement. A statement sets out the child's needs, the provision to meet those needs, and the school the child attends.</p>

	<p pid="b.632W.6/4">A statement may also, in the case of a child with dyspraxia, set out the support to be provided by health services, for example occupational therapy.</p>
	<p pid="b.632W.6/5">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is responsible for funding further education provision for post-16 learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including those people with dyspraxia. We do not hold information on the specific expenditure on dyspraxia. However, overall investment in provision for these learners has increased significantly over recent years, and in 2004/05 the LSC helped support more than 640,000 learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities accounting for nearly &pound;1.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.632W.6/6">Continuing investment in this provision remains a priority and the LSC has made clear in their Annual Statement of Priorities for 2007-08 that they expect the proportion of learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities to be maintained.</p>

	<p pid="b.634W.5/2">The proposals in Clause 17 of the Further Education and Training Bill, to allow Further Education institutions in England to apply for the power to award Foundation Degrees, emerged after informal discussions with a number of interested parties in the further and higher education sectors. These followed up Sir Andrew Foster's recommendation that</p>
	<p pid="b.634W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;consideration should be given to allowing some colleges, that meet quality criteria, the ability to award their own qualifications, rather than working through awarding bodies&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.634W.5/4">Officials discussed with the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) how these proposals might be taken forward prior to the publication of the Further Education and Training Bill. The views of the Association of Colleges and other representative bodies from the Further Education sector were also sought.</p>
	<p pid="b.634W.5/5">Since publication of the Bill, the Department has undertaken extensive and extremely constructive discussions with a wide range of representatives from the Higher and Further Education sectors, as well as other interested stakeholder bodies. Over thirty written submissions were received in response to a circular letter inviting comment on the proposals; these included responses from a number of Sector Skills Councils and the Council for Industry and Higher Education. Ministers and officials have also maintained frequent contact with sector bodies such as Universities UK and the Association of Colleges, and have also corresponded with representatives from individual institutions in both sectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.635W.2/2">The available information on the qualification rates of students on foundation degrees was published in January 2007 in 'Foundation degrees: key statistics 2001-02 to 2006-07' by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The information, covering students registered at higher education institutions, looked at the qualification rates of students on courses with expected course lengths of two and three years who qualified within these time frames.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.2/3">The key findings were that, overall, around 77 to 86 per cent. of students had either qualified within the expected course length or were still studying either on a foundation degree course or on another higher education programme. The exact proportion varied depending on the length and mode of study of the course.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.2/4">The report also contained comparable figures for students on HNDs. These showed a slightly wider variation in the proportion of students who had either qualified within the expected course length or were still studying either on a HND course or on another higher education programme of between 74 to 86 per cent. Again, the exact proportion depended on the length and mode of study.</p>

	<p pid="b.635W.5/2">The LSC has been undertaking a major restructuring exercise under theme 7 of its 'Agenda for Change' reform programme. This exercise is expected to be completed later this summer, and will result in some 1,100 fewer staff posts across the whole of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.5/3">The LSC set aside provision of &pound;55.7 million in its 2005-06 accounts to cover the one-off costs associated with these staff changes. Of this, &pound;30.4 million is for redundancy and severance costs, &pound;2.1 million for pension costs and &pound;2.29 million for outplacement costs. The remainder is for property and HR related activities. Final outturn figures for 2006-07 are not yet available but will be published in the LSC's annual report and accounts in July.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.5/4">We expect the LSC to achieve year-on-year savings of &pound;40 million as a result of these changes. This is in addition to the &pound;50 million savings it is already making year-on-year compared to predecessor bodies.</p>

	<p pid="b.640W.2/1">Following the announcement in the pre-Budget report, details have been developed for a competitive bidding process to determine the allocation of the &pound;6.3 million of this funding that is available in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.640W.2/2">Organisations will be able to bid, against a set of criteria, for resources to support them in the development and delivery of local area-based initiatives designed to promote the installation of energy efficiency measures in households and tackle fuel poverty. Organisations will be encouraged to work in partnership with others and are required to secure agreement from the relevant local authority(ies), as their involvement is important in ensuring the success of local initiatives. Bidders will have to demonstrate their ability to provide a cost effective and sustainable service that works effectively and efficiently with the Energy Efficiency Commitment and Warm Front. I expect the open tender to be launched soon, with the successful bidders being selected on a competitive basis thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="b.641W.2/1">Along with all other pesticides approved for use in the UK, Diquat has been subject to the review programme initiated under the Plant Protection Products Directive 91/414/EEC. This ensures that risk assessments are updated in the light of the most recent scientific information. Diquat was approved under the directive, but aquatic use was not allowed because of the risks to fish, invertebrates and non-target plants. This restriction took effect in June 2004. As an interim measure, an emergency authorisation for the aquatic use of Diquat in the UK was granted in 2005 and in 2006 to enable the control of weeds. Emergency authorisations can be granted where there is an unforeseeable danger that cannot be controlled by other means.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.2/2">In 2006, Ministers concluded that no further emergency authorisations would be granted until the Advisory Committee on Pesticides was satisfied by evidence that risk mitigation measures would render the aquatic use of Diquat acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.2/3">Earlier this year, the Committee considered an application for a further emergency authorisation. It concluded that it was not appropriate to recommend a further emergency approval this year. The Committee noted that no new data were available proving acceptable risk. Furthermore, there was no evidence that alternative methods of control had been tried.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.2/4">If the Government receive new evidence which demonstrates that this herbicide can be used without unacceptable risks to the aquatic environment, we will ask the Advisory Committee to review it and will consider any resulting advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.642W.0/1">The Government are committed to promoting freedom of expression worldwide and to defending and protecting the professional independence and right of journalists and media professionals to work without fear of reprisal during armed conflict. Journalists, media professionals and associated personnel must be provided with the protection that they need under domestic and international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.0/2">Last month, at the World Press Freedom Day, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, reaffirmed our commitment to promote, defend, and protect the professional independence and right of journalists and media professionals to work without fear of reprisal. He also spoke out against impunity for crimes deliberately targeted against journalists. To intentionally direct an attack against civilians not taking direct part in hostilities is a war crime as defined under Article 8 (2)(b)(i) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Under Article 79 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, journalists are regarded as civilians, provided they do not take action adversely affecting their status. These provisions provide journalists, media professionals and associated personnel with protection under international law. The key challenge for the international community is to ensure that international law is respected and enforced in order to provide a strong deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.0/3">To assist this process, and raise awareness of the violence directed against journalists in conflict zones, the UK and its EU partners tabled UN Security Council Resolution 1738 in December 2006. The resolution condemned violence directed against journalists in conflict zones. It called on parties involved in conflict to stop deliberate attacks against journalists and respect them as civilians under international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.0/4">In addition to our discussions over the tabling of Resolution 1738, we also discussed this matter with outside experts at the meeting of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Advisory Panel on Freedom of Expression on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-24">24 May</phrase>. We will continue to work with our EU partners and others to support efforts to promote and strengthen respect for international law, in particular in this area. An essential part of this is our strong support for the international criminal tribunals, including the ICC, which are a key part of international efforts to combat the crimes of most concern to the international community. We also discuss with EU partners and others joint action to protest at mistreatment of journalists.</p>

We currently start routine fingerprinting of asylum seekers at the age of five. Fingerprinting of asylum seeking children and dependants of asylum seekers who are aged under five years may be carried out when considered appropriate. Fingerprinting helps to protect children from being presented several times as dependants by different asylum applicants, provides us with a tool to combat possible trafficking operations and will help with identity management in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.674W.2/1">All staff joining the Home Office require security clearance, and the level at which this is carried out is dependent on particular roles and responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.2/2">Staff are security cleared to Enhanced Baseline Standard level and some are additionally cleared at a higher level&mdash;Counter Terrorist Checks, Security Check or Developed Vetting. Where a higher level check is carried out an individual is asked to complete a questionnaire which asks about involvement in terrorism, sabotage or actions intended to overthrow or undermine Parliament by political, industrial or violent means. Where Developed Vetting is carried out&mdash;the highest level check&mdash;there is a mandatory face-to-face interview where these questions are put to individuals again and may be explored.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.2/3">If at any stage of the vetting process, or subsequently, information comes to light that a person has any affiliations which give cause for concern, full inquiries are made and appropriate steps taken. These could include refusal or withdrawal of clearance or even dismissal. Against the background of these checks, it would be redundant to ask Home Office staff to declare membership of extremist organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.682W.8/1">The Passport Application Support System (PASS) contains the personal data provided by the individual on the application form, the progress history of the application, and details of the passport issued, as shown on the personal data page of the passport.</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.8/2">Thus, the personal details held on the system are:</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.8/3" class="indent">(1) applicant's name,</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.8/4" class="indent">(2) gender,</p>

	<p pid="b.682W.8/16" class="indent">(14) nationality.</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.8/17">In addition, the full progress history of an application is held on the system. This would include information such as the date the record was created, the date the issue of a passport was authorised as well as any notes made by UKPS staff during the consideration of the application. A complete copy of the application form is also stored on the system. Supporting documents provided by applicants to verify information provided may also be scanned into the record and since December 2003, all completed forms reporting lost, stolen or recovered passports have been stored on the database.</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.8/18">The system also holds information about all passports issued to a person under the same name. Furthermore, since September 2004, when an applicant has applied for a renewed passport and has changed their name, PASS automatically adds notes linking the new and previous passport records.</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.8/19">The UK Passport Service has an outsourced PFI contract with Siemens Business Services, a component part of which is to provide support and maintenance to PASS. The contract provides for per transaction charges which also includes receipt, cashiering and data capture of all passport applications, therefore it is not possible to separate the amount relevant solely to the system costs.</p>

The first exercise compared 5,543 offence records extracted from the Court Proceedings database with the equivalent information on the Police National Computer. This comprised court results for all courts in England and Wales on a single day selected at random.

The main outcome of the conference was the Government of Iraq's commitment to take the lead in providing support and security for its citizens, including for those who have fled the country. The conference also agreed a new UN Strategic Framework for humanitarian action in Iraq, which will coordinate UN action in support of the Iraqi Government's efforts. Further assistance to support the displaced was also pledged by a number of international donors. We are now working with the UN and other partners to ensure that the Strategic Framework is taken forward.</p>

We will consider how to take this forward in consultation with stakeholders, including issues related to technology and communications. Energy suppliers are separately undertaking a programme of work, overseen by Ofgem, to address the issue of inter-operability of smart meters. This work includes an examination of the communications systems that underpin smart meters.</p>

However, the owner of the Weald Smokery served a Statutory Blight Notice on the Secretary of State and this was accepted. The property has therefore been acquired under the blight provisions contained in section 154(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. This property is now being managed by the Highways Agency's property agents. To enable the existing business to continue to trade throughout the marketing period for a new lease, a short term lease has been provided to the Weald Smokery's former business manager.</p>

	<p pid="b.701W.2/2"><i> </i>Only the Dartford crossing is the responsibility of the Highways Agency and all drivers are informed, through signage at the entrance to the tunnels, to remain in their vehicles for their safety if there is an incident.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.2/3">Both tunnels at the Dartford Crossing have 100 per cent. CCTV coverage, which is constantly monitored in the control room located in the adjacent compound. In addition the crossing has its own dedicated traffic officers and regular patrols are made through each tunnel. These measures allow Crossing staff to attend an incident within five minutes to assist all drivers and passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.2/4">In 2005, an Accessibility Audit Report was prepared for the crossing as a whole looking at the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Various improvements relating to the tunnels have been identified which will assist in improving safety conditions for all users. A programme of improvement works, taking into account the constraints of the tunnels, is being developed in conjunction with the EU Directive on Tunnel Safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.2/5">In addition a live exercise is planned for later this year to test the logistics of evacuating disabled people from the tunnels. Any lessons learnt will be reviewed and if possible incorporated into improvement works.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.2/6">With regard to the other crossings mentioned, these are the responsibility of <i> (b)</i> Merseytravel, <i> (c)</i> and <i> (d)</i> Transport for London and <i> (e)</i> Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority. As public authorities, all these bodies are subject to the Disability Equality Duty and must ensure that the needs of disabled people are taken into account throughout all their functions and services, including provision of highway infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.2/7">The operators of these tunnels also have additional duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as service providers. In particular, we would expect them to have developed detailed plans covering all eventualities in their tunnels.</p>

	<p pid="b.703W.2/2">Following consultation, the current departure noise limits were introduced in December 2000. The daytime limit (0700-2300) 94dBA (a reduction of 3dB) came into effect in February 2001. The night time limit (2330-0600) 87dBA came into effect in March 2001. The previous night-time limit of 89dBA (a reduction of 2dB) was retained for the shoulder periods (2300-2330 and 0600-0700). These limits are kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/3">The Government's Aircraft Noise Monitoring Advisory Committee (ANMAC) considered in 1999 the feasibility of setting noise limits for arriving aircraft. It concluded that it would not be appropriate to do so, due to the very limited discretion available to pilots once established on the final approach. ANMAC recommended the development of a code of practice for arriving flights for air traffic controllers, airlines and airport managers. The code was originally produced in 2002 with a revised edition being issued in November 2006. The code focuses on the use of continuous descent approach as the practice most conducive to noise abatement.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/4">Annual noise contours representing noise from both arriving and departing aircraft are produced by the Civil Aviation Authority's Environmental Research and Consultancy Division. These contours are based on data from fixed and mobile noise monitor sites installed by BAA under departure tracks at Heathrow. The data are used to monitor compliance with Government noise limits at Heathrow and is reported regularly through the airport's Noise and Track Keeping Group and the Consultative Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/5">These contours which have been produced for many years also give the local community an indication of how many people are affected by a level of noise. The 57dBa Leq is used as the level of daytime noise marking the approximate onset of significant community annoyance.</p>

	<p pid="b.704W.2/1">The increase in first vehicle registration fee from &pound;38 to &pound;50 was implemented to ensure that the DVLA driver and vehicle registration costs continue to be covered by the fees levied. This is necessary for the DVLA to comply with its statutory duties as an executive agency and trading fund. The initial vehicle fee increase was mirrored by a smaller increase from &pound;38 to &pound;45 for the first provisional driving licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.704W.2/2">The fee increases result from three public consultations over a two-year period in which the different options for meeting the DVLA budget envelope were explored in detail and gradually focused on the two fees noted. The consultation reports and conclusions were shared with respondents to the consultation and are published on the DVLA website. The explanatory memorandum to the changes in regulations summarises these. In essence, the DVLA undertakes 62 different registration transaction streams to maintain the vehicle and driver registers, but is only able to levy fees on 10 of these. Hence 16 per cent. of the transactions carry the costs for all the register maintenance and, of these, the 3,000,000 first vehicle registrations and the 950,000 first provisional driving licences bear the brunt. Other transactions such as change of vehicle keeper or of address are not fee-bearing, to encourage compliance, and these transactions have increased in number far faster than chargeable transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.704W.2/3">DVLA has made very significant productivity gains over the last four years and by <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> will have reduced its costs for the 2004 by some &pound;50 million. However, its volumes have increased by around 15 per cent. during the same period. This has resulted in a rise in total costs. Conclusions drawn from the consultations were that the preferred way of addressing this was to increase the fees.</p>

	<p pid="b.704W.5/2">The Department is conducting a full strategic review of the Blue Badge Scheme. The review will consider the issue of temporary badges, including the potential impact of their inclusion within the Scheme. The review and upcoming reforms will help to make the scheme fairer, more consistent, tougher on fraud and easier to understand. We are scheduled to receive the findings in September 2007.</p>

The Department for Transport's 2007 annual report details estimated capital spending of over &pound;5.9 billion in 2006-07 to support reliable and efficient local, regional and inter-regional transport systems. Furthermore, the Transport Innovation Fund will provide more than &pound;9 billion over seven years from 2008-09 to support schemes of benefit to national productivity, and innovative local transport packages aimed at tackling congestion.

	<p pid="b.708W.15/1">HM Revenue and Customs aim to minimise the costs of cancelled event and conference bookings by confirming the availability of attendees prior to booking.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.15/2">However, since HMRC is an operational department which has been undergoing a rapid degree of reorganisation in recent years, it is an unfortunate fact: (i) that members of staff are often obliged at short notice to pull out of prior commitments to attend events or conferences because of their operational responsibilities, and (ii) that the restructuring or reorientation of staff responsibilities will also occasionally make planned events and conferences redundant.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.15/3">Where this necessitates the cancellation of events or conferences, the department's contract with Travelocity requires Travelocity to negotiate down any cancellation fees to the minimum possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.15/4">It is the view of HMRC's management that where conferences and events cease to be viable due to low attendance or become redundant due to the restructuring of unit and team responsibilities, it is the least costly option simply to cancel the event and incur any necessary cancellation fees, rather than pressing ahead with such an event, thereby incurring the higher direct costs of the event and the opportunity cost involved in wasting staff time.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.15/5">In the period between <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, a total of 39 conferences and events were cancelled with the resulting imposition of cancellation fees, around 7 per cent. of the total number of events and conferences organised during that period.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.15/6">Around a third of this total relates to cancellations in October 2006 alone, when extensive reorganisation within the department and operational pressures led to the cancellation of 14 separate events at late notice with resulting fees totalling &pound;24,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.15/7">Excluding the exceptional month of October, the average monthly number of cancelled events incurring cancellation fees over this period was three, and the average monthly cost was &pound;3,400.</p>

	<p pid="b.709W.8/3">Following publication of the 2004-05 overpayment statistics in May 2006, HMRC had two years of overpayment statistics to inform this costing. Unlike in 2003-04, awards in 2004-05 were based on the previous years' income making them much more representative of future years awards. In addition the first stage of the finalisation process for 2005-06 was completed in August 2006, adding to this body of knowledge. This allowed HMRC to publish a separate cost for the disregard in November 2006.</p>

Unfortunately, we are unable to provide the quantity of overpayments made by the Agency at the Parliamentary Constituency level. The Agency uses a sample of cases to measure overpayments throughout the Agency, and as a result of the size of this sample this information is only accurate at the Agency level.</p>

As the new scheme went live in March 2003 this information should be interpreted as a naturally growing caseload. It is not possible to provide this information going back the full five years.</p>
