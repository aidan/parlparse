	<p pid="a.182W.6/1">The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that of the 46 million women who have an abortion each year, 19 million are estimated to be unsafe. That is, carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimum medical standards. They do so because they do not wish to go through with an un-intended or unwanted pregnancy. One important reason for this is that many millions of women still lack access to reproductive health and family planning services, and thus have no choice about when and if to have children.</p>

	<p pid="a.183W.0/1">Following the tsunami, the Government allocated &pound;75 million to meet the immediate needs of those affected. To date &pound;68 million has been disbursed through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement and non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children Fund, CAFOD and Help the Aged. The balance will be allocated for disaster risk reduction and early warning initiatives across the affected region. We are currently looking at proposals for programmes to utilise these funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/2">The complexity of the response and the changing situation on the ground meant that some organisations have not been able to spend funds according to their original timetable. However, where people still need help, DFID has allowed some partner organisations to extend the end date of relief programmes using DFID funds if we decide that the programmes remain appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/3">In circumstance where DFID judges that extending the life of a programme would be of little value to those affected by the tsunami and is not an appropriate use of UK funds we will request that the balance of the DFID grant be returned. The UK will not provide financing in advance of need as this money could be usefully spent reducing poverty and saving lives in other parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/4">The Disasters Emergency Committee website (<a href="http://www.tsunami.dec.org.uk">www.tsunami.dec.org.uk</a>). contains details and an evaluation of how the major UK non-governmental organisations (NGO)s utilised the funds they were given.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/5">DFID will allocate &pound;65 million to meet longer term reconstruction needs. From this amount, &pound;60 million has been committed to Indonesia. Of the &pound;60 million, &pound;13.5 million has already been allocated. Some of the funds have been put into a multi-donor trust fund which provides grants for a range of reconstruction activities including housing, infrastructure, and land titling projects. Additional funds have been used to support the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s livelihoods programme and to support a range of smaller technical assistance packages. Of this, &pound;13.5 million, we estimate that &pound;12.5 million has actually been spent. It is difficult to be precise about how much of the UK funds have been spent from the Multi-Donor Fund because it is a pooled funding mechanism. The Multi-Donor Fund estimates that it will have spent $102 million of the $228 million received from donors by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/6">We are looking to spend the remaining funds over the next 2 to 3 years. Our immediate priority is to support urgent livelihoods activities and other initiatives which will help to build a sustainable peace in Aceh. We have pledged an additional &pound;20 million to the Multi-Donor Fund, but we will look to allocate this and any remaining funds as needs are identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/7">The remaining &pound;5 million balance of the &pound;65 million has been allocated to India and Sri Lanka. The recovery programme in Sri Lanka is fully financed, but DFID allocated &pound;2 million to help speed up implementation of reconstruction programmes and to ensure equitable distribution of assistance. To date, &pound;1.3 million has been spent on technical assistance and expertise. The remaining funds will be spent in 2006&ndash;07 to help people affected by the tsunami re-establish their livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/8">In India technical assistance worth &pound;3 million has been provided to help ensure effective, transparent and equitable programming of relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.184W.2/1">The threat of avian influenza is of global significance and requires a co-ordinated global response. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January</phrase>, at the International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Pandemic Influenza in Beijing, the UK pledged &pound;20 million to help achieve this. We also expressed our willingness to consider requests from developing country Governments to reprioritise DFID country programmes to finance work on influenza. We will ensure that UK support is co-ordinated with the efforts of individual countries and other international donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.184W.2/2">In Nigeria, DFID has committed &pound;800,000 to combat the spread of the disease. Of this, &pound;250,000 was used for the immediate purchase of 15,000 personal protection kits for UN Agencies to distribute through the Nigerian Ministries of Agriculture and Health to front-line workers and those involved in surveillance of the disease. The remaining &pound;550,000 has been given as a grant to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is leading the international response to avian influenza. The WHO will use the funds to support the Government of Nigeria at both federal and state level in reducing the opportunity of human infection, ensuring that the surveillance systems are in place and active, and undertaking assessment of laboratory facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.184W.2/3">The UK has not provided direct assistance to Niger or Cameroon to tackle avian influenza. We do not have major programmes in either country, though we do support forestry reform in Cameroon and have provided significant humanitarian assistance to Niger. We are closely monitoring the situation in both countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.184W.2/4">Through our ongoing involvement in Africa, DFID is keeping abreast of countries' own plans and the activities of international organisations and donors relating to avian flu. We are in regular discussion with African countries about possible UK support to help develop and implement their influenza strategies. For example, DFID has committed &pound;1 million to prevention and control of the disease in Ethiopia. &pound;700,000 will be used for early detection, prevention and control and &pound;300,000 will be used to establish a national focal point to address the threat posed by a human influenza pandemic.</p>

Flooding has been most intensive in the lower Zambezi and Pungue river basins. Nonetheless, the DNA is optimistic that any further large scale flooding on the Zambezi will be avoided, because the amount of water entering the lake behind the Cahora Bassa dam is falling, thus reducing the need, to increase discharges into the lower river. Based on historic patterns the likelihood of more extensive flooding will diminish from the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.2/1">The relief effort in Guatemala in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan is coordinated by the Guatemalan Government Agency, CONRED (Co-ordinadora Nacional para la Reduccion de Desastres) and involves a wide number of Government Departments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), donors and local community groups. Rehabilitation programmes are planned for periods of six-12 months and activities have begun for many of the 1,063 affected communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/2">DFID provided &pound;253,000 to the emergency in Guatemala and El Salvador, channelled through Plan International UK and CARE International UK. &pound;172,000 of this is benefiting Guatemala. This is in addition to &pound;690,000 provided as the UK share of European Commission assistance following the disaster. DFID has kept informed of the recovery process through the reports of Plan International and CARE International, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and through contact with the Government of Guatemala.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/3">The most affected parts of the country were the south coast and the western region where 59,000 people were displaced. Since October 2005, at least 12,310 families have been given temporary familial shelters or have been reintegrated into their communities. The Guatemalan Government have undertaken extensive surveys of potential new land for these communities to minimise future risk of exposure to floods and mud-slides.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/4">A key reconstruction priority was ensuring access to safe reliable water, and much of the rehabilitation effort has focused on this. Waterborne disease remains a risk for affected communities and the Ministry of Health have been supported in the provision of transportation services, basic health kits including mosquito nets, and training for communities in health and nutrition awareness. Overall progress in reconstructing sanitation units has been slow, which in many cases has only reached 10 per cent. of target so far. However, some areas have benefited from intensive NGO efforts to ensure safe water, with as many as 10,000 water filters being provided and treatment plants in three municipalities. The installation of systems has been undertaken in close conjunction with local government authorities and communities to ensure sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/5">Children have been badly affected by the hurricane the most, and those who remain in shelters will continue to receive psychological and educational support from rehabilitation partners. A continuing concern is the restoration of the livelihoods of the communities affected, either through agricultural support to those who returned to their homes, or through income generation opportunities for those who remain in shelters or have been relocated. DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have been in discussions with the Guatemalan Government to assess how those worst affected by Stan can begin to rehabilitate their livelihoods.</p>

	<p pid="a.189W.0/1">Last year in its Global Report the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimated that around the world, at least 12.3 million people were victims of forced labour. The report makes clear that poverty and social exclusion are at the root of much contemporary slavery and forced labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.0/2">The Government supports long-term programmes to help tackle the poverty and social injustice which makes people vulnerable to exploitation. It also supports programmes that specifically target forced labour. DFID has provided over &pound;2 million to support the ILO's Special Action Programme on Forced Labour and an additional &pound;2 million for the ILO's regional programmes in West Africa and South East Asia. DFID has also committed almost &pound;14 million to ILO and non-governmental organisation programmes in South East Asia to stop the trafficking of children for forced labour.</p>

	<p pid="a.189W.3/1">There is no universal definition of a small firm. While several criteria can be used to define a small firm, including annual value of sales turnover and value of capital assets, the most common defining feature is number of workers employed. DFID regards &quot;small&quot; firms to be those with 1 to 50 employees. Firms employing over 50 employees are considered medium-sized. In international development usage, small firms with less than 10 employees are generally termed &quot;micro enterprises&quot;. Modern small firms differ from micro enterprises in several important respects, namely:</p>

	<p pid="a.189W.6/1">Street Children in Latin America are victims of deprivation and exclusion. Overwhelming poverty, unemployment and social dislocation leave many children with no option other than to leave home to find work and by-pass the education system. Street children are excluded from accessing key services such as health and education. They are powerless and lack supportive kinship and social networks. Many street children suffer and are at greater risk from organised violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and HIV/AIDs.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.6/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is assisting street children in Honduras and Guatemala through our support to the international financial institutions, the European Commission and our civil society partners. DFID is supporting the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDE) to strengthen their programmes to tackle the widespread poverty, inequality and social exclusion that forces many children on to the street. DFID assistance through the IDB has included $145,000 to build the capacity of Guatemalan non-governmental organisations and public sector officials to reintegrate street children back into society. Our contributions to the European Commission are also assisting the Commission to implement a social cohesion programme in Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.6/3">DFID contributed &pound;1 million in 2004 to support participation of both civil society and the Government of Honduras in developing their poverty reduction strategy. The Strategy includes an analysis of child poverty and the plight of street children and commits the Government to reduce child labour, improve the quality and equity of education and improve child health coverage. DFID support to the Save the Children Fund (SCF) through a global agreement has also assisted the SCF Honduras office to work on youth justice initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.190W.2/1">Up to now the impact of restrictions on the operation of humanitarian organisations in West Darfur has been minimal, despite the reduction in the number of international staff working in the region. This has been due to the agencies themselves anticipating the deteriorating security situation last January, and pre-positioning relief materials. This has enabled basic water, food and medical supplies to be provided through national staff and local non-governmental organisations (NGO)s.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.2/2">However, security restrictions mean that the UN and NGOs can undertake only emergency life saving interventions in some parts of West Darfur. This, and the reduction in staff numbers, means that the international community is now less able to respond to a major challenge such as an outbreak of disease or a further large-scale displacement of the population. Reduced staff numbers mean that the UN's ability to afford protection of civilians is also more limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.2/3">We remain closely engaged with NGOs and the UN and stand ready to provide additional assistance if required.</p>

The most recent information suggests that the ratio of girls to boys in primary education in the country as a whole is 99 per cent., highlighting that the number of girls in primary school is very nearly equal to the number of boys. This information is not broken down specifically for northern Uganda because of the problems that population movement and security have created for the collection of data.</p>

Information on whether ministerial approval was specifically sought in relation to individual licensing decisions is exempt from disclosure as its release would prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs.</p>

	<p pid="a.194W.0/2">It is not possible to make an assessment of the impact of these increases on households earning the minimum wage, due to the different working patterns of those individuals within this group. We do, however, have data on the proportion of household disposable income spent on energy bills by quintile and country for 2003&ndash;04 and overall by country, which is shown in the table. The proportion of income spent by the middle quintile may be thought of as a measure of average proportional spend:</p>

	<p pid="a.194W.0/14">It is not possible to work out the impact of recent energy price rises on these statistics. These price increases are likely to have increased the proportion of income spent on fuel, though. Work on the best way to tackle the impact of the price rises for those in fuel poverty in the light of rising energy prices is being taken forward in the context of the Energy Review.</p>

	<p pid="a.196W.0/1">Data on the proportion of household disposable income spent on energy bills is available from the Expenditure and Food Survey conducted by the Office for National Statistics. The most recent data containing full income information corresponds to 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.196W.0/2">The proportion of household disposable income spent on energy bills by those in receipt of income-related benefits in Wales represented 4.0 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.5/2">The European Commission definition is based on headcount, turnover, balance sheet and independence criteria. A small firm is defined as having:</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.5/3" class="indent">Maximum headcount of 49 (employees and self-employed)</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.5/4" class="indent">Maximum annual turnover of &euro;10 million (euros)</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.5/9">The Companies Act 1985 only defines small firms for the purpose of certain exemptions from accounting and auditing requirements and is not applied universally. The definitions in the Companies Act 1985 are themselves set to the maximum allowed under European law. Amendments to the Companies Act 1985 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-30">30 January 2004</phrase> and state that a company is 'small' if it satisfies at least two of the following criteria:</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.5/15">In addition, there may be other occasions where an alternative definition of a small firm may be appropriate. For example, the DTI's &quot;Small Firms Loan Guarantee&quot; is open to young firms with a turnover up to &pound;5.6 million to concentrate on those most likely to experience difficulties raising debt finance and to simplify eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.5/16">The DTI definition of a small firm for official statistics publications, such as the SME Statistics for the UK, is a business having between 0 and 49 employees.

Recent Initiatives in the Palestinian territories have focused on the Education and Training sector, Infrastructure and Aid-funded business. UKTI funded a scoping mission to the West Bank and Gaza by the British Consultants and Construction Bureau in July 2005 and Palestinian participation in Education and Construction trade fairs in September and November 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.200W.2/2">In assessing the applications, the EDC team can draw upon expert advice from their colleagues in the Department's Offshore Environment and Decommissioning Directorate.

	<p pid="a.200W.2/3">The Department has established a Research Advisory Group (RAG), which brings together representatives from a number of Government Departments to co-ordinate the priorities for research work into the potential impact of offshore renewables projects. The results of this work will be available to Ministers in considering requests for consent from wind farm developers. The research is funded from a &pound;2.5 million budget held by the DTI, but this money is supplemented by contributions from other parties, for example, other Government Departments and the wind farm industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/4">DTI also facilitates a number of stakeholder groups which bring together the offshore renewable energy sector with environmental, navigation and fishing interests. These groups exist to consider how wind farms can be successfully integrated into the marine environment and provide evidence and analysis relevant to consent decisions.</p>

As reflected in my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's joint statement with President Lula, the UK remains committed to an ambitious, balanced, pro-development outcome to the round. We believe that all the main parties in the talks need to take bold steps to go beyond established negotiating positions to improve their offers on agricultural market access and domestic support, NAMA and services. Those offers must also take account of the needs of developing countries by delivering improved market access in both agricultural and non-agricultural goods that is comparably high, but in a balanced and proportionate manner, consistent with the principle of special and differential treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.8/1">This Government have given an unprecedented high profile to tackling bullying and supporting those who have been bullied. Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti-bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying. Our anti-bullying work, including the anti-bullying Charter for Action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&mdash;for example prejudice&mdash;and to helping those who are bullied.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.8/2">As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on prejudice driven bullying. At the beginning of this month, we launched our new advice 'Bullying around racism, religion and culture; how to prevent it and what to do when it happens' as the first of this suite of materials. The advice is presented as a set of interactive web pages on the teachernet website and is being supported by a national programme of dissemination events. Feedback from schools and local authorities so far has been overwhelmingly positive. We will be following this with specific advice on countering homophobic bullying later in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.8/3">We have secured a very broad consensus, with all the teaching professional associations and the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) signing up to our Anti-Bullying Charter for Action. The Charter is a voluntary commitment to creating a school community where bullying is not tolerated. In 2006 we plan to share examples of where the Charter has been particularly well implemented with other schools so that they can learn from this best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.8/4">Through our work with the ABA, an organisation comprising over 65 leading anti-bullying charities and experts, we provide schools and local authorities with expert help to tackle bullying. The National Strategies' behaviour materials provide schools with support in reducing and responding to bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.8/5">We have put more adults than ever in our schools&mdash;teachers, classroom assistants, learning mentors, Connexions personal advisers, Behaviour and Education Support Teams and police officers&mdash;so that a wide range of people are available to help prevent and tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.8/6">Anti-bullying week continues to be a successful event with a large number of schools taking part in November 2005's activities through a wide variety of national and local events. There was a considerable amount of positive press coverage and this year over 325,000 anti-bullying wristbands were distributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.8/7">Our anti-bullying resource pack for schools &quot;Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, updated in 2000 and September 2002 will be revised and re-issued in the summer term 2006 to ensure schools have the most up-to-date information available on tackling bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.8/8">In addition the Department has recently launched the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource&mdash;an intervention to develop children's social, emotional and behavioural skills from Foundation Stage to Year 6. It is available to all primary schools and the evidence from the pilot suggests that it helps reduce bullying and promotes positive behaviour generally. It is an important arm of the Department's longer term policy to promote positive behaviour and attendance. The Department is hoping to build on the work carried out in primary schools by providing a similar whole school curriculum based resource for secondary schools (SEBS). At present the programme is in a very early pilot stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.216W.2/1">We are aware of the importance of children drinking water during the school day and the benefits that it brings. The interactive Food in Schools Toolkit, published jointly by the Department of Health and DfES, provides a wide range of guidance, resources and interactive tools to inspire and support schools in taking a whole school approach to healthy eating and drinking, including water provision. The 'Water Provision' guidance supports schools in reviewing and improving current provision and promoting water consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/2">The Cross Departmental &quot;Healthy Living Blueprint&quot;, issued to all schools, brings together all government advice and examples of best practice about healthy eating and drinking in schools. It provides schools with advice on how to improve children's approach to food and drink and exercise, and shows how developing whole school approaches can help bring about significant improvements to the health of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/3">Healthy School Lunches guidance, published by the DfES, contains the Secretary of State's expectation that drinking water should be available to all pupils every day, free of charge. This view is mirrored in the 'Healthy Living Blueprint for Schools', which states that,</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;all pupils should have access to drinking water at all times at a number of points around the school, preferably not from taps in the toilets. Pupils should be permitted to carry water with them and consumption encouraged both in class and during break and lunch time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/5">The School Meals Review Panel (SMRP) made a reference to drinking water in recommendation 7 of their report&mdash;Turning the Tables: &quot;There should be easy access to free, fresh, chilled drinking water throughout the school day (paragraph 2.32)&quot;. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase> and the responses are being analysed.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/6">It is the responsibility of head teachers and school's governing bodies to decide how and when water should be made available. We consider that they are best placed to make these decisions in their role of having responsibility of the day to day running of the school and with their knowledge of the individual circumstances of their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.219W.8/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has an extensive range of support to meet the different types of learners' needs, this includes those who already hold a full level 2 qualification and would like to study at the same level. In 2006/07, unless the individual is within an exempt category, the assumed fee contribution of individuals will be 32.5 per cent. Consequently, the LSC will offer substantial financial support to repeat level 2 learners by funding 67.5 per cent. of the total cost of the tuition fees. Individuals can also benefit from access to discretionary learner support funds; this could include assistance with the costs of transport and child care. Also available is a commercial bank loan to support the costs of learning and there is access for all to information and advice through an integrated service. This includes information and advice through learndirect and through local nextstep services.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.8/2">Those exempt from fees in further education are: 16&ndash;18-year-olds; unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance; those in receipt of income-based benefits; the unwaged dependants of those listed; and, asylum seekers in receipt of equivalent income-based benefit and their dependants.</p>

	<p pid="a.220W.2/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is responsible for identifying national and local learning and skills needs, and for setting and implementing strategies and plans for meeting those needs. Good information on labour market and skills trends is essential for the council's work in steering post-16 education and skills provision. In developing its plans the LSC takes account of a wide range of information about current and future skill needs, including the national employer skills survey, research into learner and employer views of learning, and data contained in the Working Futures 2004 to 2014 reports, commissioned by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA). The LSC is also required to consult and take account of the plans of other organisations, including local authorities and the regional development agencies, and, at the national level, sector skills councils help to identify the skills that are needed for each sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.220W.2/2">Each year the LSC produces an annual statement of priorities. Plans are then formally reviewed throughout the year by the LSC's management group, and adjustments are made in the light of changing priorities if necessary. Changes to the LSC's internal organisation will further strengthen its research capacity, and ensure even more effective delivery against individual and employer needs at national, regional and local level.</p>

This has over 8,000 members, representing a very broad range of institutions, including the LSC national and local offices, universities, colleges, training providers, national and local government, policy organisations, local authorities, schools and research institutions. The aim of the newsletter and web pages is to provide easy access to up-to-date information on education, training and learning, including research and labour market information; and to enable the sharing of good practice in teaching and quality improvement between providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.220W.5/4">The new LSC structure will enhance the LSC's ability to share best practice through the new partnership teams feeding into the regional structure. This will be strengthened with the development of regional quality improvement partnerships.</p>

The School Meals Review Panel report: Turning the Tables: Transforming School Food, concluded that the average cost of ingredients in primary schools was 48.5p; and in secondary schools was 59.8p. This shows that schools are already well on the way to meeting the Government's aspiration of helping schools to provide meals with ingredients costs of 50p for primary schools and 60p for secondary schools. In some cases, where they have already made significant improvements, schools are spending more than 50/60 pence.</p>

	<p pid="a.237W.5/1">Within the Liverpool, Riverside constituency the Granby ward is a designated priority ward because of its high level of unemployment and high concentration of ethnic minorities. According to the 2001 census, ethnic minorities made up 30.7 per cent. of the population (aged 16&ndash;74), and the overall rate of unemployment stood at 26.0 per cent. Across the constituency as a whole the overall rate of unemployment was 15.0 per cent. and 23.4 per cent. for ethnic minorities. The rate of inactivity was 51.7 per cent. overall and 57.2 per cent. for ethnic minorities. The latest benefit statistics (August 2005), show that there are 10,700 people receiving incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance and 10,400 income support claimants across the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.5/2">The Department looks at local information on deprivation, need and diversity to help target the services we deliver. We use this data to help us with our resources allocation across Jobcentre Plus. We give higher priority to wards with high levels of unemployment (one and a half times the national average) and high concentrations of ethnic minorities (three times the national average). Granby is one such ward.</p>

	<p pid="a.250W.10/1">While the 2004 abortion statistics showed a slight increase in the abortion rate per 1,000 resident women aged 15&ndash;44, the under 18 and under 16 abortion rates decreased. In addition, more abortions were performed at an earlier gestation. The 2004 statistics are available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/11/75/74/04117574.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/11/75/74/04117574.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.10/2">It is a key aim of the Government to reduce unintended pregnancy rates, as featured in both the sexual health and teenage pregnancy strategies, and provision of good quality contraceptive services are essential to achieve this. We are investing &pound;40 million over the next two years to improve access to contraceptive services. We have asked primary care trusts (PCTs) to complete a national questionnaire of contraceptive services. The results will inform the publication of best practice guidance by the Department and will help PCTs determine how best to meet gaps in local services. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has published guidance on long-acting methods of contraception which should raise awareness and usage of all the methods.</p>

	<p pid="a.256W.0/31">From October 2002, PCTs took over responsibility for community pharmacies from HAs. Thereforedata on the number of pharmacies in England with NHS contracts is broken down to HA level until 2001&ndash;02, and PCT level from 2002&ndash;03 onwards. The change from HAs to PCTs may have resulted in some boundary changes and this is reflected in the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.0/32">Information on the number of community pharmacies is collected from PCTs via the annual PHS1 data collection. The latest data available on General Pharmaceutical Services (1994&ndash;95 to 2004&ndash;05) was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.256W.0/33">The survey collects information on openings and closures of community pharmacies. Changes of address, relocations within the PCT are excluded. However, pharmacy minor relocations across PCT boundaries are included as an opening or closure as appropriate. Establishments that close under old ownership and re-open under new ownership within 10 days are regarded as staying open, even if the period between closing and opening straddles review periods.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.6/1">The Bread and Flour Regulations 1998 require the addition of calcium carbonate, iron, thiamin and nicotinic acid (or nicotinamide) to wheat flour other than wholemeal. The regulations do not specify any particular sources from which these substances must come. Further, the addition of these substances does not need to be indicated on the label.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/2">If a claim is made that any food is suitable for vegetarians or vegans, then all the ingredients should be from appropriate sources. The Food Standards Agency will shortly issue guidance on the use of these terms in food labelling.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.2/1">The European Commission has indicated that it will bring forward discussion documents in spring 2006 to consult member states about the setting of maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The board of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has considered this issue and proposed a two-tier approach with the use of advisory labelling statements where levels exceed those based on a scientific risk assessment. The objective is for this approach to be promoted in meetings with the European Commission and member states and in discussions on future documents from the Commission for meetings with stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/2">Letters have been written to health Ministers in all member states and relevant members of the European Parliament informing them of the approach agreed by the FSA Board. Departmental officials last discussed these issues with the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-03">3 March</phrase>. FSA officials met with officials at the Ministry for Health in the Netherlands on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. Both meetings provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on the United Kingdom's position for setting maximum safe levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/3">Meetings were held with the organisation, Consumers for Health Choice on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase> and with Which? on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/4">The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will be carrying out the assessment of the dossiers submitted in accordance with the food supplements directive, and is prioritising dossiers for assessment. It is the responsibility of companies who have submitted the dossiers to provide additional information to EFSA. Until EFSA begins its assessment it is unclear as to what the impact on the market beyond 2009 will be. We are continuing to explore with the Commission what further flexibility may be available in the directive after 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/5">Both initiatives by CODEX and the recent report from the World Health Organisation take into account the need for maximum levels to be set based on scientific risk assessment, and this approach underlies the approach proposed by the FSA. A formal assessment of the implications for setting maximum safe levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements following these publications has not been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/6">The final outcome of this case from the World Trade Organisation has yet to be published. An assessment of the implications for the setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements following the interim report case in relation to barriers to trade in genetically modified organisms has not therefore been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.263W.8/1">The genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic waiting times audit collects data on waiting times for all GUM clinics in England for a period of one week every quarter. All patients attending a GUM clinic with a new episode or registering for the first time are asked to complete the short questionnaire on waiting times. This audit has been chosen as the method of monitoring and improving access to GUM services. Current analysis is published on numbers seen within 48 hours. The most recent survey is for November 2005 which shows that 49 per cent. of attendees were seen within 48 hours and a further four per cent. of attendees were offered an appointment within 48 hours but did not attend.</p>

	<p pid="a.275W.3/2">The enhanced requirements for overseas doctors and dentists to obtain work permits do not have significant implications for national health service dental services. The only implications for dental services are where overseas dentists, from outside the European Union (EU), are seeking employment in the hospital or community dental services and where it will be necessary to show that there is no dentist from the United Kingdom or the wider EU dentist able to fill the post.</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.3/3">The great majority of dentists in England work as independent, self-employed contractors in primary care. In these cases, dentists from outside the EU, who have undertaken vocational training, will continue to be able to seek entry under the &quot;Person Intending to Establish Themselves in Business rules&quot; and are not affected by the enhanced requirements for work permits. A non-EU dentist who has not undertaken vocational training will require a work permit, but vocational dental practitioners are included on the Home Office's list of shortage occupations and will not be affected by the enhanced requirements announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.277W.11/1">The Department makes financial allocations direct to primary care trusts (PCTs). The responsibility for the provision of these services rests with the national health service at local level. The consideration that PCTs give to this is part of a range of factors that they must take into account in discussions with local health bodies and patient groups in deciding their policy on the provision of treatment services for their locality. This policy will reflect local health needs and priorities.</p>
