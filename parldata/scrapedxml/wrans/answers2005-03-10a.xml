The council did not do so; instead it has sought to resolve the claim, and a second one in respect of a linked path, by persuading landowners to dedicate the routes as bridleways. At my request Defra officials have written to the council requesting details of how the council proposes to resolve the matter and its timetable for doing so. I shall review the issue in light of this response.</p>

	<p pid="a.1915W.2/1">The regulation does not define a major hazard operation. However, in order to ensure that the controls are applied evenly across the country, Defra has issued guidance on how we intend to apply the regulation in relation to intermediate plants. The guidance is the result of our interpretation of the legislation and our assessment of the risks to human and animal health associated with handling animal by-products at intermediate plants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1915W.2/2">In the guidance we differentiate between loading operations that we regard as a major hazard (e.g. tipping of slaughterhouse waste) and operations that we consider to be a lesser hazard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1915W.2/3">A major consideration is the physical characteristics of the material to be handled. The handling of slaughterhouse waste (containing viscera, bones, specified risk material etc.) is more likely to result in environmental contamination due to spillage of material or associated fluids than the handling of entire carcases.</p>

Continued extension of temporary approvals for non-compliant premises would disadvantage those operators who have invested to meet the required standards, and as a general rule we are not granting such extensions. However, we recognise that in a very small number of cases, short-term approval may be appropriate to allow for specified remedial works to be carried out to an agreed deadline. A temporary approval will only be issued in these circumstances. If the operator cannot provide us with a clear deliverable schedule of works, for example because he has not obtained planning consent, we will not issue a temporary approval.</p>

	<p pid="a.1916W.5/1">The Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 requires Intermediate Plants to have a covered space&quot; to receive animal by-products. It also requires the plant to be constructed in such a way that it is easy to clean and disinfect, and that floors must be laid down in such a way as to facilitate the draining of liquids. The plant must also have appropriate arrangements for protection against pests, such as insects, rodents and birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1916W.5/2">As stated in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-12">12 February 2004</phrase>, in our view, the combination of these requirements is such that it would be necessary for the plant to have a roof, walls and a floor before we can approve it. I am not aware of any operator who has been able to demonstrate that their plant complies in another way. However, it is open to them to propose alternative ways of complying with all of the above requirements.</p>

Local prevalence of bovine TB is reviewed annually, and this is used to determine parish TB testing frequencies.

In addition, divisional veterinary managers can increase the level of testing in their areas to reflect changes in the local TB situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1918W.5/4">Testing every six months would detect some infections sooner but there would be resource restraints on such a policy. In order to target resources most effectively, only cattle herds which have recently suffered a TB breakdown are tested after a six-monthly interval.</p>

	<p pid="a.1920W.14/2">There is no evidence to suggest that the resumption of reactive culling would reduce the incidence of bovine TB in cattle. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) has continued to collect data from the reactive areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial and recent analyses are consistent with results presented in late 2003, with the confidence limits providing no evidence for a beneficial effect of the reactive strategy over the time scale under study. Further detailed investigations based on the distribution of TB breakdowns in space and time are underway to investigate whether the observed increased incidence was linked to proximity to reactive culling. In addition, as further TB incidence data are obtained, the ISG will continue to analyse data from reactive areas. If the TB incidence rates in reactive and survey areas become more similar over time, this finding would indicate that the observed increase in TB breakdowns in reactive areas, compared with survey-only areas, was associated with reactive culling.</p>

	<p pid="a.1924W.5/1">Defra does not hold a list of countries that are recorded as having endemic diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and bovine tuberculosis (TB). The internationally recognised central source for official information on the distribution of animal diseases is the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Also known as the World Organisation for Animal Health, the OIE is the world organisation responsible for the collection and dissemination of information on international animal health&mdash;it has a role analogous to the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
	<p pid="a.1924W.5/2">Information on countries with FMD, HPAI, BSE and TB can be found on their website, at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="a.1924W.5/3"><a href="http://www.oie.int/eng/enindex.htm">http://www.oie.int/eng/en index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1924W.5/4">Community rules establish lists of countries from which food of animal origin can be imported. These lists are complex and can vary depending on the type of product eg fresh meat, cooked meat and milk. In addition to this, most food of animal origin has to be accompanied by appropriate animal and public health certification and has to come from approved establishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1924W.5/5">Defra provides information on import requirements in the form of Trader Information Notes (TINs) which set out the conditions under which food products of animal origin should be imported. The TINs are available on our website:</p>

	<p pid="a.1924W.5/7" class="italic">Safeguards</p>
	<p pid="a.1924W.5/8">If there is an outbreak of disease in an exporting country, community legislation allows member states to take appropriate emergency safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of animal products from all, or parts, of that country, pending emergency action at community level. Once community measures are put in place the safeguard measures will reflect them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1924W.5/9">All meat and milk imported into the EU from third countries must enter at designated border inspection posts where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks. At least 20 per cent. of consignments of animal products undergo physical checks. These checks ensure import conditions are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.1925W.2/3">&pound;25 million of new money has been made available over three years 2003&ndash;04, 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 to tackle illegal imports of products of animal origin (POAO) and plants and plant based goods (PBG) from third countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1925W.2/5">Customs have over 3,500 Detection staff who have anti-smuggling responsibilities for POAO and PBG. Within this Customs has dedicated around additional 100 officers specifically to POAO and PBG; 10 POAO detector dogs are also deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1925W.2/6" class="italic">Food of animal origin</p>
	<p pid="a.1925W.2/7">All products of animal origin imported from third countries must enter at designated border inspection posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections to make sure they comply with EU import rules. BIPs are approved by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. There are currently BIPs at 11 ports and five airports in England that are approved to check imports of products of animal origin for human consumption. The inspection services at the BIP are the responsibility of the local authority. Officers from the State Veterinary Service regularly visit BIPs to offer advice and check on compliance with EU requirements. FVO inspectors inspect BIPs to ensure that they are operating correctly. EU law requires the local authority to recover the costs of the import checks from importers: details of budgets are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1925W.2/8">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1925W.2/9" class="italic">For non-animal food</p>
	<p pid="a.1925W.2/10">Food imports from countries outside the European Union must meet food safety and food standards requirements equivalent to those for UK produced food, and can be subject to checks by local food authorities at UK ports and inland to ensure they comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1925W.2/11">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for allocating local authority budgets, and funding for imported food controls would form part of the Revenue Support Grant arrangements. The Food Standards Agency has made further specific funding available through grants for local authority sampling and surveillance of imported food. In 2003&ndash;04, a total of &pound;600 000 was allocated to 110 authorities and, in 2004&ndash;05, &pound;840 000 to 140 authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1925W.2/12">Under the Imported Food Regulations 1997, the person importing food not of animal origin shall provide all such facilities as may be reasonably required for the examination of the food. In practice, facilities are provided by the port operators and vary according to the type of port and the nature and size of the foods imported. We have been discussing with the European Commission the possibility of sharing BIP facilities with authorities checking non-animal food goods.</p>

	<p pid="a.1927W.8/1">It will take some time to assemble this information from Government regional offices as files are having to be called back from depositories. I will write to the hon. Member as soon as it is available. The reasons for authorising extended temporary closure fall into two categories: either to protect public safety or to allow for completion of works. It is not possible to say when each footpath under a temporary closure will be re-opened as this is a matter for the local highway authority. Government offices are required to take care to ensure that no temporary order (or subsequent extensions) will allow, in effect, the permanent closure of a public right of way.</p>

	<p pid="a.1928W.2/2">The need for monitoring in relation to incidents where harmful cargoes are lost overboard is determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the physical and chemical characteristics of the cargoes, and the characteristics of the local environment and resources that are under threat. This may involve monitoring of fish stocks and other marine wildlife. Such monitoring is usually focused on the substances contained in the cargoes and is limited to the duration of the incidents and shortly thereafter, although periodic monitoring over a longer period is done when it is justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.1931W.0/1">No systematic collection of bird mortality caused by wind farms has been undertaken in the UK in the last three years or is planned in the immediate future. Collision mortality is very difficult to assess comprehensively due to the problems experienced in carcase recovery at inaccessible sites i.e. at sea offshore or over hilly terrain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1931W.0/2">In the UK ornithological assessments are conducted for proposed wind farm sites as part of the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). The EIA forms part of the environmental statement submitted by wind farm developers in support of a planning application.</p>

	<p pid="a.1934W.8/30">Export refunds bridge the gap, for subsidised exports, between the high EU domestic prices and the lower world price. Expenditure on export refunds may vary for a number of reasons including, principally, conditions on world and domestic markets, changes in the &euro;/$ rate of exchange and changes in the level of domestic institutional prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1934W.8/31">Changes in domestic and world market conditions are specific to individual commodities and it is therefore difficult to generalise. However, the EU-world price gap narrowed for a number of important commodities around 2001, primarily due to an increase in world prices (thus reducing the unit rate of export refund required for subsidised exports). Changes in the exchange rate have an impact across commodities: the value of the euro against the dollar declined between 1999 and 2001 thereby reinforcing the affects of the trends in world prices, in euro terms. In addition, domestic institutional prices for cereals and beef were subject to a stepped reduction, starting from 2000, under the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1934W.8/32">It is significant to note that expenditure on export refunds remains highest in the sugar and dairy sectors where the UK is pressing for further reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.1935W.2/2">The current LIFE Programme has three strands: Environment, Nature and Third Countries. LIFE Environment supports demonstration and pilot projects on methods for the protection and enhancement of the environment with particular emphasis on innovative technologies and new approaches. LIFE Nature supports the implementation of EU nature conservation policy, particularly Natura 2000. Applications from the UK are submitted through Defra to the European Commission for competitive evaluation against those from other member states. LIFE Third Countries funds technical assistance activities for capacity building in non-EU countries bordering the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas which have signed association agreements with the European Union and, therefore, the UK does not submit applications to this strand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1935W.2/3">Since 1992, in the UK, LIFE has contributed over &euro;100 million towards 122 innovative demonstration projects through LIFE Environment and 38 nature conservation projects through LIFE Nature.</p>

On average around 50 per cent. of project costs are co-financed, meaning that the programme has generated around &euro;200 million worth of investment in environment actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1935W.2/5">The current phase of LIFE (LIFE III) has, to date, supported 36 projects in the UK with &euro;47 million of co-financing.

	<p pid="a.1937W.2/1">The increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, during the period 1970 to 2000 was approximately 13.5 per cent. During the same period methane increased by approximately 26 per cent. and nitrous oxide by 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1937W.2/2">Of the radiative forcing due to man-made greenhouse gases experienced in the year 1970, about 65 per cent. was due to carbon dioxide, about 25 per cent. to methane, and about 5 per cent. to both nitrous oxide and the halocarbons. In 2000, about 60 per cent. of the radiative forcing from man-made gases was due to carbon dioxide, about 20 per cent. was due to methane, about 5 per cent. due to nitrous oxide, and the remainder due to halocarbons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1937W.2/3">Due to complexities in the climate response to greenhouse gases, there is no simple link between radiative forcing and temperature change. There has been a global temperature rise of 0.5c between pre-industrial times (1860) and 1990, and a further temperature rise of approximately 0.2c since 1990.</p>

This includes the major repairs allowance, part of local authorities' housing revenue account subsidy entitlement for the capital costs of maintaining their housing stock in its present condition and to repay the capital element of housing debt. It excludes Gypsy sites funding. The Housing Corporation, sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, has allocated around &pound;396 million to schemes within the growth areas as part of their approved development programme for 2004&ndash;05 to 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1944W.11/5">The local authorities in the growth areas have been allocated a combined total of over &pound;8.6 million between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 as part of the planning delivery grant (PDG) for their contributions to housing delivery. Provisional figures indicate that these LAs will receive a combined PDG allocation total of around &pound;9.5 million for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1944W.11/6">10 growth area local authorities are also benefiting from the neighbourhood renewal fund, with a combined allocation total of around &pound;278 million from 2001&ndash;06. In addition six growth area local authorities have been allocated a combined total of around &pound;314 million between 2000&ndash;01 and 2010&ndash;11 from the new deal for communities fund. Three local authorities within the growth areas are also receiving a combined total of over &pound;10 million in funding allocated by the Department's liveability fund, from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1944W.11/7">Between 2004&ndash;05 to 2007&ndash;08 English Partnerships will be allocating around &pound;600 million to a variety of schemes in the growth areas, including London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1944W.11/8">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister provides the majority of funding to the regional development agencies' (RDAs) single programme which is coordinated by the Department of Trade and Industry. The RDAs undertake activities that will contribute to delivering Government and regional economic priorities, including in the growth areas. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's contribution for the four RDAs whose regions include the growth areas, is estimated as &pound;462.2 million 2004&ndash;05; &pound;454.2 million 2005&ndash;06; &pound;467.9 million 2006&ndash;07; and &pound;478.6 million 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="a.1947W.6/1">The UK Government are committed to increasing access to medicines in developing countries, including drug treatment programmes for HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria. In recent years, there has been considerable progress in making medicines for the treatment of HIV and AIDS, TB and Malaria more affordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.6/2">The UK has worked with the pharmaceutical industry to encourage differential pricing that provides affordable medicines for developing country use. This includes recommendations agreed with industry on differential pricing from the UK Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in Developing Countries in November 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.6/3">The UK supports developing countries to make use of internationally agreed flexibilities in the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) agreement, that allow recourse to the use of generic versions of proprietary medicines where there is a public health need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.6/4">The UK has pledged &pound;259 million to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). 49 per cent. of GFATM grants go towards the procurement of drugs and commodities for AIDS, TB and malaria resulting in 130,00 people on HIV treatment, 385,000 treated for TB and 300,000 people treated with effective artemisinin containing treatments (ACTs) for malaria. Additional commitments for each of the three diseases are set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.6/5">The HIV and AIDS Treatment and Care Policy, published in June 2004, sets out the UK's commitment to increasing access to HIV treatment in developing countries. The UK has provided &pound;3 million to support the work of the World Health Organisation on HIV and AIDS, with a strong focus on its role supporting the target of 3 million people on treatment by 2005 (3 by 5). In total, the UK has committed to spend &pound;1.5 billion on HIV and AIDS from 2005&ndash;07, a significant part of which will support increased access to treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.6/6">The UK has provided &pound;2 million to the Stop TB Partnership since 2002. The Partnership has established mechanisms, which support countries to access stable supplies of effective anti-TB medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.6/7">DFID is the largest funder of the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partnership, having contributed &pound;48 million to date. The UK is working with RBM and other partners to secure greater international commitment for affordable pricing of ACTs. DFID Kenya has also recently awarded a start up grant of &pound;35,000 to support increased cultivation of artemisia annua in Kenya. This is the key raw material for ACT production and is currently in short supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.6/8">Effective health systems are equally important if all medicines are to be delivered safely. The UK has committed over &pound;1.5 billion since 1997 to help developing countries strengthen the health and supply systems. Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in Developing Countries: UK Policy and Plans', published in June 2004, gives further information on UK positions and activities in this crucial area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1949W.5/1">One of the outcomes of the recent London Meeting on Supporting the Palestinian Authority (PA) was a commitment by the international community to more streamlined donor co-ordination and support. DFID will play a full part in strengthening donor co-ordination, including the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee. Follow up to the Meeting includes the establishment of a new Working Group on security, and it is anticipated that the World Bank and the PA will jointly convene a donor Consultative Group in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1950W.0/1">There are seven countries affected by conflict that could potentially qualify for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Last year, the UK was at the forefront of efforts to extend the Sunset Clause of the HIPC Initiative beyond December 2004, thus extending the initiative for a further two years. This could allow these remaining conflict affected HIPC countries to benefit from HIPC debt relief, once they have met the criteria required to qualify. In addition, the UK has announced that it will hold in trust any debt service payments received from these countries and this money will be returned for spending on poverty reduction once they qualify for the initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950W.0/2">In January 2005, DFID set out in its publication Why we need to work more effectively in fragile states,&quot; how it will tackle the challenges of poverty in difficult environments. This included reviewing the way aid is allocated to fragile states; joining with other Government Departments to ensure our policies are coherent; doing more regional programming; getting the balance right between humanitarian and development aid and staying engaged over a longer timeframe (five to 10 years). Copies of this publication have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It can also be accessed at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950W.0/3">DFID is actively involved in supporting conflict resolution initiatives, through among other things the Global and Africa Conflict Prevention Pools, as well as delivering humanitarian aid in conflict situations. DFID is funding operations as well as building the capacity of organisations working on reducing conflict in conflict affected countries, including the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank and the African Union and several Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). DFID is directly supporting programmes that address insecurity&mdash;a barrier to poverty reduction&mdash;through our Security Sector Reforms and Small Arms Strategies, and support to Disarming, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) programmes in conflict affected countries.</p>

This includes increasing the amount of EC aid committed to and spent in low-income countries.</p>

The project was designed to establish the best methodology for undertaking such measurements and was not a part of a national measurement audit. The project considered those sites with the accepted characteristics of microcell and picocell base stations. Of the 3,000 sites that fall into this category, 20 sites were randomly selected for survey. The study found that exposures at all sites surveyed werewell below the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) levels (the highest level recorded was 8.6 per cent. of the ICNIRP public reference level). The study demonstrated a viable measurement protocol.</p>

	<p pid="a.1965W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-07">7 January 2004</phrase> the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) announced a new regional management structure to help drive forward its work in the regions and develop relationships at a regional level. This has allowed for a more streamlined and effective management structure that avoids additional bureaucracy, and delivers the LSC's agenda with fewer staff overall. Except in London, each LSC Regional Director also has responsibility for a specific local LSC within their region, and the region itself maps on to the same geographical areas as those covered by the relevant Government Office for the Region.</p>

	<p pid="a.1965W.3/1">Competitions for replacement secondary schools will take place only where the local authority decides that statutory proposals for a new secondary school are necessary. The time scale will therefore be the same as for any other reorganisation, with the addition of four months for prospective promoters to prepare their bids. We would expect the local authority to take this into account in planning future reorganisations and discussing them with schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1965W.3/2">Since competitions will take place only where proposals for new schools would be required in any case, there should be no increased pressure on staff, parents and pupils. The competition requirement, and increased time for preparation of possible alternative options and provision for people to comment on those proposals, will together give greater opportunities for staff, pupils and parents to have a say about the type of school that they believe will best meet local needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1972W.4/1">The current essential small pharmacies scheme (ESPS) enables pharmacies dispensing fewer than 26,100 prescriptions per year and located more than 1 km from the next nearest pharmacy to receive financial support. This is currently &pound;43,150 per year. There were 223 ESPS pharmacies in England as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>. National health service primary care trusts (PCTs) can in addition support, or commission services from, other pharmacies with lower dispensing volumes in their area that do not meet the ESPS criteria if they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.4/2">The new community pharmacy contractual framework, due to go live from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase>, will include special measures for pharmacies with lower dispensing volumes. The ESPS will continue and in 2006&ndash;07, we plan that these pharmacies will be able to choose whether to convert to being a local pharmaceutical services (IPS) pharmacy and retain their current ESPS entitlements or to transfer to the new contractual framework. In addition, a standard form of IPS for other pharmacies, with lower dispensing volumes, is being developed. This may help increase income for such pharmacies where they provide services which meet local health care needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.4/3">We expect these support arrangements to continue to be in place in 2008. We also expect NHS PCTs will, in reviewing their assessment of pharmaceutical needs, continue to consider what support can be offered to pharmacies with lower dispensing volumes which contribute effectively to meeting such needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.4/4">Pharmacies dispensing between 1,100 and 2,000 items a month will continue to receive the professional allowance until <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. This ranges from &pound;9,300 to &pound;18,000 per year, depending on prescription volume. Pharmacies dispensing fewer than 2,000 prescriptions per year will also receive the new practice payment. Pharmacies dispensing under 1,100 prescriptions per month will receive a payment of &pound;500 per annum as part of the practice payment. Additionally, pharmacies will have the option, during the first year of implementation, to decide whether they wish to relinquish their right to provide NHS services and to receive compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.4/5">We discussed and agreed as part of our negotiations with the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee that pharmacies would be entitled during the first year of the new contractual framework to claim an exit payment. That framework will enhance the range and quality of pharmaceutical services contractors offer&mdash;and which patients will come to expect&mdash;in future. None the less, we recognised that some contractors may not wish to continue to provide services though we hope this number will be very few. We believe we have allowed a reasonable time limit within which contractors should come to a decision. To prolong the period for deliberation risks depriving all patients of the benefits the new arrangements will bring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.4/6">We estimate that some 650 community pharmacies in England&mdash;or approximately 7 per cent. of the total&mdash;will be eligible for these special support arrangements in 2005&ndash;06. We have not estimated the number of such pharmacies that will close when these arrangements come to an end in 2008. That is a commercial decision for the contractor concerned. Consequently, we have not estimated any savings that may accrue. We do however fully expect all contractors to take advantage of the significant opportunities the new framework offers to expand the range and quality of services they offer and to be remunerated accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1978W.8/1">Sections 1 and 3 of the NHS Act 1977 do not refer directly to mental disorder&quot;, but do require the Secretary of State to provide a health service to secure improvement in physical and mental health and to prevent, diagnose and treat illness&quot;. Illness&quot; is defined by section 128 of the Act as including mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1978W.8/2">Transsexualism is defined in the International Classification of Diseases&mdash;tenth edition (ICD-10)&mdash;as a mental disorder and it is therefore likely that it would be regarded as a mental disorder for the purposes of the 1983 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1978W.8/3">The ICD-10 classification reads as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1978W.8/4" class="indent">F64.0 Transsexualism</p>
	<p pid="a.1978W.8/5" class="indent">A desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1978W.8/6">Guidance on gender dysphoria was included in the national definitions set for specialised services, which suggests that primary care trusts should commission such services collectively. Specialised services for mental health, including services for people with gender dysphoria, are being reviewed by the national director for mental health, Professor Louis Appleby, and a report is due in May.</p>

	<p pid="a.1987W.2/1">Contracts for the refitting of surface ships, including those for HMS Edinburgh and HMS Ark Royal, are awarded following open competitions. Royal Navy surface ship work is competed fairly and all tenders within the same competition are assessed against identical criteria, such as technical and commercial compliance, partnering proposals and price. The outcome is judged on overall value for money against these criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.1987W.8/2">The surface ship support study (SSSS) is looking at the ways in which the Ministry of Defence might engage with the United Kingdom naval surface ship refit and repair contractors to make best use of the industrial base, taking account of the future size of the Royal Navy surface fleet. The study includes consultations with industry (BAE Systems, Devonport Management Ltd., Babcock International Group, Fleet Support Ltd. and A and P) and aims to deliver recommendations for the way ahead and an outline implementation plan to defence Ministers during spring 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1987W.8/3">SSSS forms part of a wider strategy intended to optimise UK industry's warship and submarine sector; other elements include the maritime coherence study, the UK naval shipbuilding industrial strategy, the submarine acquisition modernisation project and the future defence supply chain initiative. The aim is to create an overall 'road map' that will identify how and when the outcomes of these studies might converge to improve overall efficiency.</p>

The Action Plan asks the Institutions of the European Union and the member states to discuss improvements to existing instruments for providing assistance in emergencies, including better co-ordination, and to discuss the setting up of a European rapid response capability including its relationship with the existing civil protection mechanism and EU humanitarian aid. The UK has, along with other member states, contributed ideas on how the EU might further improve its co-ordination of disaster response. These ideas have been discussed at various levels in the Council and its working groups, andbetween Capitals. The European Commission and Javier Solana are considering the ideas put forward andproducing options papers for consideration and discussion by member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.1995W.7/1">The Department of the Environment played no part in the repositioning of the carriages at Crosshill. I understand that this work commenced before <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-19">19 December 2003</phrase> when the regulatory powers for waste management transferred from district councils to the Department's Environment and Heritage Service (EHS).</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.7/2">I understand that the original method of moving the carriages was modified as they were too heavy to be removed in one piece. The carriages were removed by cutting them into three sections using large mechanical shears. The work was undertaken by an operator trained in asbestos removal, who did not observe any asbestos when the work was being carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.7/3">The site was inspected by my waste management officials on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-13">13 February 2004</phrase> and they saw no evidence of railway carriages or asbestos waste, findings reinforced by photographic and documentary evidence on file. The site is also subject to regulation by EHS under the terms of the Water (NI) Order 1999. In the course of a regulatory site visit on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-24">24 February 2004</phrase>, EHS Water Management officials noted that no carriages were visible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.7/4">In addition, EHS has undertaken independent water quality and soil sampling tests at the site and concluded that there has been no breach of the water order consent nor evidence of contravention of waste licensing controls. The Department therefore has no grounds to take action against the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.7/5">EHS will continue to monitor the Crosshill site for the presence of asbestos to ensure full compliance with the water order consent. Independent air quality monitoring will be a condition of any subsequent waste licence or permit application.</p>

The Department recognises that outdoor activity centres such as Cabra Towers are a valuable educational resource and they enhance both curriculum delivery and the learning experience. However, the relevant aspects for the statutory curriculum can be delivered successfully without availing of the services of such centres and ultimately it is the responsibility of individual schools to decide which educational resources they use.

The total amount offered to these was &pound;1.3 million, contributing towards a total planned investment of &pound;5.5 million. This assistance is generally drawn down over a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1998W.6/2">In addition, there were 350 offers of assistance made to new start-up businesses within the constituency. The value of assistance offered to these start-ups was just over &pound;1 million, contributing towards an estimated total planned investment of &pound;6.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1998W.6/3">Since being established in April 2002, Invest NI has been actively working with over 25 client companies in the constituency, providing them with access to a full range of support programmes, a number of projects in these companies are currently at differing stages of development.

	<p pid="a.2001W.5/1">The Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan team comprises 31 staff in total. There are currently 13 staff working on the draft Ards and Down Area Plan 2015. It is not possible to provide processing times for planning applications within the Strangford Area as processing times are collated on a district council basis. Nevertheless, the Planning Service is committed in its Modernising Planning Processes (MPP) change programme, through a wide variety of projects and initiatives, to improving the processing times for all planning applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.2002W.2/1">A spatial analysis methodology was used in the recently published draft Integrated Impact Assessment to assess the equality impact of proposals for domestic charging under the reform of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland. Analysis of impacts in respect of religious belief was performed at electoral ward level using community background&quot; data from the 2001 census. Analysis of impacts in respect of political opinion was performed at district council level using Electoral Office data based on first preference votes at the 2001 local elections. These data were combined with information regarding recent house sales from the Valuation and Lands Agency. The conclusion that Protestants and Unionists are likely to bear a disproportionately greater burden of domestic water and sewerage charges reflects the fact that there is a markedly higher representation of these groups in those areas of Northern Ireland with higher domestic property prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.2/2">This methodology allows broad assessments to be made, however data are not available on individual properties to enable calculations to be made of the likely average water and sewerage charge for Protestant and Unionist households. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the percentage by which Protestant and Unionist households may be disproportionately affected, nor by how much in relation to the average family income for each broad policy option.</p>

	<p pid="a.2012W.6/1">These targets were agreed as part of the 2004 spending review which covers the period 2005&ndash;08. No assessment of progress against these targets has yet been made. However, progress against the similar SR2002 targets was published in December 2004 in the Department's autumn performance report, a copy of which is available in the Library.</p>
