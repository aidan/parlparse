	<p pid="a.468W.2/1">In 2009, the gap between full-time men's and women's median earnings was 12.2% rising to 22% when comparing median earnings for all men and women. The Government do not produce a forecast of the gender pay gap and has made no assessment as to when the gap will close. The Government are committed to tackling the gender pay gap and is taking a range of measures to improve women's position in the labour market including making pay secrecy clauses unenforceable, extending the right to request flexible working to all employees, consulting on a new system of parental leave, and promoting gender equality on company boards including asking Lord Davies to fully investigate the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.494W.5/2">The LSC has contracts with 1,750 solicitors firms for criminal legal aid work in England and Wales. Some of these firms provide services in a number of different locations.

	<p pid="a.494W.5/3">It is not possible to answer this question in full in respect of civil legal aid contracts at this time.

The LSC is currently finalising the contract documentation, after which time the final number of organisations delivering services under these contracts will be available by procurement area and access point. It is currently estimated that there will be in the region of a thousand contracts in total for non-family civil legal aid, some of which will be with organisations with multiple locations and/or for multiple categories of law.

	<p pid="a.494W.5/4">Tenders for Family and Family with Housing services were set aside following judicial review proceedings by the Law Society.

	<p pid="a.496W.5/1">As per my answer on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-27">27 October 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-10-27.357"><i> Official Report</i>, column 357W</phrase>, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) is not able to collate statistics in respect of numbers of lost original documents without reference to individual cases. Thus, estimates as to frequency would be no more than speculative.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.5/2">As with any process reliant on the submission of paper material, the loss of original documents will, unfortunately, occur on occasion. The OPG takes information security very seriously and focuses consistently on minimising the potential risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.5/3">However where original documents are lost, the cost to be borne is minimal. The OPG scans all applications on receipt and therefore where an original copy is misplaced, an office copy of the instrument can be provided. Where the original is subsequently identified, measures are in place to ensure it is then forwarded to the applicant. Office copies are afforded the same weight in law as the original. Costs are therefore limited to the resource to produce and issue any replacement material.</p>

PERs include individuals who are not failed asylum seekers, such as foreign national prisoners and illegal immigrants. Some failed asylum seekers are removed at carriers' expense so their costs are not included in the figures above.</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.5/1">The Government are committed to ending the detention of children for immigration purposes. A review is currently under way to consider how this can be done in a way which protects the welfare of children while ensuring the departure of families who have no right to be in the UK. We need to be sure that any new process works in practice so we are testing out a range of new approaches aimed at keeping families with children in the community. We have also been working closely with a range of interested parties in the voluntary and statutory sectors who have experience and expertise in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.5/2">In the meantime, detention is being used only as a last resort after families have exhausted their appeal rights, refused an offer of assisted return and failed to comply with arrangements put in place by the UK Border Agency for their departure. The number of families detained in immigration removal centres has reduced significantly during the course of the review, and it is no longer the case that families are detained for long periods of time.</p>

	<p pid="a.506W.8/1">Powers under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 contain important safeguards to prevent their misuse. All authorisations are intelligence based and approved by a police officer of at least inspector rank. The power is only used in a 'locality' within a police area, and only for 24 hours (with the option to extend this to 48 hours if authorised by a superintendent).</p>
	<p pid="a.506W.8/2">However previous guidance did not place any restrictions on its use within the locality of an authorisation. The code now includes new requirements to ensure that officers do not stop and search individuals unconnected with the purpose of a section 60 authorisation. Furthermore, following a period of statutory consultation, we have amended the guidance so that it now clearly states that when selecting persons or vehicles to be stopped officers must take care not to discriminate unlawfully against anyone on the grounds of any of the protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010. In addition to this we are currently examining the guidance and safeguards around section 60 in light of the judgment in Gillan and Quinton <i> v</i>. the United Kingdom to see if any further work is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.509W.2/1">The Government share the concerns about disproportionality in the use of stop and search powers. We are working with the police service to help ensure that stop and search powers are used appropriately. There is, however, no single cause of disproportionality. It is important, therefore, to look at levels of disproportionality, and any specific demographic or other factors, in individual forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.509W.2/2">The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) have developed 'Next Steps', a diagnostic tool to ensure that a force's use of Stop and Search is not driven by unjustified factors such as discrimination or stereotyping. 'Next Steps' is currently focused on Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). The NPIA will support forces to implement 'Next Steps' and will target forces with high levels of disproportionality. The NPIA has recently commenced the roll out of 'Next Steps' in Dorset, Merseyside, and one borough of the Metropolitan police service.</p>

	<p pid="a.511W.2/1">Yarl's Wood, like all immigration removal centres, provides free onsite primary healthcare to the same level of care as NHS general practices in the community. This involves access to nursing care 24 hours per day, and visiting GPs who are on call outside of normal hours. All detainees, including children, are seen by a nurse within two hours of their arrival, and are provided with an appointment to see the GP within 24 hours. The nurse may make an earlier appointment if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.511W.2/2">The centre also provides dedicated services to meet the needs of families and children including a paediatric nurse, health and midwife visitors, weight and immunisation clinics which are able to prescribe malarial prophylaxis for identified risk groups, access to children's acute mental health services (CAMH) and counselling services.</p>
	<p pid="a.511W.2/3">The GP refers detainees to the local primary care trusts where secondary treatment is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.511W.2/4">Yarl's Wood provides a wide range of recreational facilities for children including a cinema, youth club overseen by a qualified youth worker, grassed and hard play areas with swings and climbing frames, an area for football and netball and a covered outdoor area with an all-weather pitch. The centre's cr&#232;che has a bouncy castle and a children's pet area with guinea pigs and rabbits.</p>
	<p pid="a.511W.2/5">Yarl's Wood has an Ofsted-registered cr&#232;che and school with four classrooms and play area delivering 30 hours per week of tuition by qualified teachers for children aged 5-16 years. The cr&#232;che is staffed seven days a week from 9-5 by appropriately qualified child care professionals for children under school age. The centre's gym and sports hall are available for five hours PE Monday to Friday during school hours as part of the delivery of the national curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.511W.2/6">The centre provides for the varied range of faiths and celebrates various religious festivals/cultural events. Multi faith rooms are available daily as are holy books of different faiths. The centre's resident faith ministers are accessible to all, including children.</p>
	<p pid="a.511W.2/7">While the facilities at Yarl's Wood are of a high standard, the Government have committed to ending the detention of children for immigration purposes as part of their coalition agreement. In July, the Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40528" name="Nicholas Clegg">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr Clegg)</phrase> announced the closure of the family unit at Yarl's Wood. We will agree a timetable for closing the unit when we announce the new model for managing family cases which support the Government's immigration policies. However, in the meantime, we must continue to ensure families those applications have failed continue to leave the UK promptly.</p>

	<p pid="a.523W.3/2">The review that Darren Henley has been asked to carry out will make recommendations on any new route by which that funding will be made available. Following the spending review the Government have protected frontline spending on schools so that we can ensure that investment reaches schools directly.

	<p pid="a.524W.0/2">The Department considered carefully the options for securing the requisite services from an external organisation. Given the need for specialist skills and experience to be in place quickly, it was decided to award a time-limited grant to NSN.

There have not been any discussions with the Cabinet Office relating to this award.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.0/3">NSN has championed the development of parent and teacher promoted schools and has been providing advice and support to those interested in establishing new schools since 2009. It has also been developing networks among interested groups and individuals. This experience makes it ideally placed to fulfil the role. The Department has given similar grants in the past, such as to the NSPCC, the Holocaust Education Trust, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust and the Youth Sport Trust.</p>

An Education Bill will follow to introduce the legislation needed to make the vision set out in the White Paper a reality. The Government trust head teachers and want to give schools the freedom and flexibility to make the right decisions to deliver high quality education to all children and young people. This means freeing schools from excessive central prescription and significantly reducing the amount of guidance and advice given to schools. We are currently reviewing the thousands of pages of guidance issued to schools and will remove any unnecessary documents. We will also significantly strip back and consolidate what remains into a small number of clear, readable and useful guides on key issues.</p>

The Government currently sponsor the I Sign project-a three-year pilot led by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and the National Deaf Children's Society-which supports our position of giving parents greater choice by putting in place the British Sign Language (BSL) skills infrastructure necessary to make BSL a viable option for families.</p>
	<p pid="a.531W.5/2">Through investment in BSL courses for interpreters and tutors and the development of a new Level 3 Certificate in Learning Support (Communication Support Worker), the I Sign pilot aims to help improve the educational attainment of deaf and hearing impaired pupils by increasing the BSL skills of the workforce for ail those who work with deaf children and families, including those in mainstream settings.</p>

As part of that, we will be looking at how to increase local solutions to better enable localities to develop provision that makes the best use of staff and specialist resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.531W.5/4">The Government value the important contribution from those organisations and individuals working to support deaf children and their families and welcome their input into how the needs of these children can best be met. The recent National Deaf Children's Society's Hands up for Help! report, as well as contributions received during the recent Green Paper call for views, will be considered in informing the development of the forthcoming Green Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.532W.2/1">The grant currently allocated to the Youth Sport Trust by the previous Government funds them to work on a range of policy areas in connection with PE and sport in schools. The Department's grant funding agreement with the Trust expires at the end of March 2011. In his letter to the Youth Sport Trust of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October 2010</phrase>, the Secretary of State explained that he had no plans to commission further work from the Youth Sport Trust in these areas. The money saved will not be fed through the Dedicated Schools Grant and further details on the Coalition Government's approach to school sport will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.2/2">This Government's approach to PE and school sport differs fundamentally from that of the last Government. While the network of school sport partnerships has helped schools to increase participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, the fact remains that the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools. Through the comprehensive spending review, the Secretary of State has ensured that front line budgets for schools have been protected. The removal of centrally driven, top down programmes will mean that schools will have more flexibility to use their funding in areas which they identify as their own priorities. This includes competitive sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.2/3">The Coalition Government will encourage more competitive sport through the creation of an Olympic-style school sport competition. Over the next year, the Department for Education will work closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to develop a model to take this forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.544W.2/1">We are firmly committed to freeing schools and colleges from centralised control and reducing bureaucratic burdens. We have already made a number of changes to make it easier to offer the Diploma-removing the entitlement, removing the requirement for schools and colleges to be in consortia and removing the need for schools and colleges to go through the time-consuming Diploma Gateway process.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/2">Working with Ofqual and the awarding organisations, we are now planning to reform the Diploma further to make it simpler to teach and award so that it can take its place alongside other qualifications, without the need for additional support. This is part of our commitment to improve vocational education, and we will consider any decision on the reform of the Diploma in the light of Professor Wolf's review of vocational education, which we expect in the spring.</p>

Training bursaries of &#163;9,000 are available to people taking up postgraduate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) places for design and technology as this is one of the shortage subjects. In addition, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) are funded to train 400 existing teachers by March 2011 in teaching practical cooking within the design and technology curriculum. Many of these teachers are not existing design and technology teachers.</p>

	<p pid="a.545W.8/2">We do not have information about the number of children who are not in full-time education.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.8/3">Local authorities in England and Wales have had, since February 2007, a statutory duty to make arrangements to identify all children missing from education in their area. The duty applies in relation to children of compulsory school age who are not on a school roll, and who are not receiving a suitable education otherwise than being at school (for example, being educated at home, privately educated or in alternative provision).</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.8/4">It is important that schools and local authorities implement the systems and regulations and follow the guidance in place around keeping registers, excluding pupils and removing pupils from the school roll. Schools must fulfil their requirement to inform local authorities when pupils are deleted from the school roll or have &quot;disappeared&quot; following 10 days unauthorised absence from the school. Notifying the local authority is important because the local authority can then attempt to trace the children and ensure that any pupils that are removed from the roll of a school are receiving a suitable education.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.3/1">The temporary closure and rationalisation rules of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) are intended to incentivise industry to maintain production at their most efficient installations. The provision to retain full allocation during periods where a company is rationalising production or temporally shutting down production provides flexibility for companies to move their allocation to the sites that are still at full production in order to meet their compliance needs. Companies can also sell their allowances in order to raise finance in response to the economic situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.3/2">The EU ETS Directive was amended in 2009 for phase III (which runs from 2013-20). The rules for closures are currently being discussed in Europe, but there will be rules which cover significant capacity reductions, partial and full cessation of activities to ensure that installations do not benefit from continued free allocation when they are not carrying out an EU ETS activity.</p>

The international community have a regular dialogue with the Afghan Government on human rights, including on the need to ensure the security of all Afghans, regardless of religion.</p>

	<p pid="a.549W.0/1">An estimated 31,343 Afghan National Police (ANP) officers have been recruited by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Training Mission Afghanistan (NTM-A) between January and October 2010. ANP attrition has been decreasing over time and is currently at approximately 18% per annum, with monthly attrition at 1.5%. There are no specific data available on the number of ANP officers who were recruited in 2010 and have subsequently left the force. The total strength of the Afghan National Police (ANP) stood at 116,367 in October 2010. The growth target of 109,000 by October 2010 has been exceeded, and a number of initiatives to encourage more effective recruitment have been implemented, including tripling the number of recruiters, setting up a Recruiting Command and setting up mobile sub-recruiting stations.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.8/1">There are no reliable statistics on the effectiveness of Israel's security barrier, which was commissioned following the 2nd intifada of 2000. Although we believe Israel has every right to defend itself, we believe that barriers are not the best way to achieve this in the 21st century. Where it is constructed outside of Green Line Israel, the Israeli separation barrier is illegal both according to international and Israeli law. It is worth noting that the barrier on some 40% of the intended route remains unbuilt. We judge that Prime Minister Fayyad's reform of the Palestinian security sector has played the most significant part in reducing the violence committed by Palestinian groups against targets in Israel. The best way of ensuring Israel's security is to come to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace agreement with its neighbours.</p>

Defence has a long standing record of providing assistance in the event of a civil emergency, providing specialist capabilities which may not be available in the civil community or augmenting civil capacity if it is overwhelmed by the scale of an event. Military assistance is normally provided on a reimbursement basis at the request of, and in support of, other Government Departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) made estimates of the cost savings accrued from measures in the strategic defence and security review for the purposes of formulating policy. Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. Release of further detail may prejudice the MOD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. Furthermore, final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trade unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety. The MOD is therefore not able to release more detailed figures at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.585W.2/1">The Commission applauds the aims of the 10:10 campaign, and recognises the significance of the targets it promotes, but does not plan to join it. In October 2009 the Commission agreed it should avoid lending the House's name to particular campaigns and should participate only in exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.585W.2/2">The House has set a target to reduce its carbon emissions from energy by 7% by 2010-11, relative to 2008-09. In the 12 month period to the end of October 2010 the House has recorded a 5.6% reduction in its carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.590W.2/1">We want to make it easier for businesses of all sizes to take on apprentices and access the benefits they can bring to the workplace, which is why one of our first announcements was to redeploy &#163;150 million from Train to Gain to create 50,000 more apprenticeship places. Just last month, we built on this by confirming that we will boost spending on apprenticeships by up to &#163;250 million above the funding inherited from the last Government, before the end of the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.2/2">Small businesses are the cornerstone of our economy and high quality training opportunities like apprenticeships are key to supporting their growth and success. I know that small businesses place great value on apprenticeships and are prepared to invest in them.</p>

	<p pid="a.590W.5/1">As set out in our recently published strategy Skills for Sustainable Growth, this Government are committed to expanding apprenticeships. By 2014-15, we will have in place sufficient funding to train 75,000 more adult apprentices than the previous Government were providing.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.5/2">While Government funding supports training for apprentices, we rely on employers to make the opportunities available to their new and existing staff. As employer of around one-fifth of the country's work force, the public sector will be a key part of this. Apprenticeships are now available in around 200 job roles and are no longer only about traditional trades in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.5/3">I want to see an increase in public sector apprenticeships because they improve productivity and offer a great way to meet the skills needs of the work force, which will ultimately result in better public service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.590W.5/4">However, I do not believe we should try to achieve that through arbitrary central Government targets. Instead, Government should encourage and enable public sector employers to take advantage of apprenticeships. That is why the National Apprenticeship Service has representatives in place in every region of the country to support public sector employers with advice and guidance. We have also ensured that within central Government apprentices are exempt from the civil service-wide recruitment freeze. I was also pleased to offer my support to the Department for Health who announced earlier this month that the NHS apprenticeship programme will receive &#163;10 million to create around 6,000 new NHS apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="a.602W.2/1">Further education institutions are responsible for recruiting their own staff. Teaching in the FE sector is generally not a choice of first career for graduates. For the majority of teachers and trainers in the sector, it is a second or third career.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/2">The sector requires highly skilled professionals from all walks of working life-plumbers, engineers, technicians, beauty therapists-to have reached the stage of their first career where they have the capability and capacity to train future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/3">Measures have been taken to enhance and recognise professional status. From September 2007 regulations have required all new teachers to the FE sector to be appropriately qualified in their own subject specialism and hold or work towards achieving the required teaching qualifications and gain qualified teaching learning skills (QTLS) status. Around 40% of FE teachers have a degree, but many hold a wide range of other qualifications that are relevant to their area of vocational expertise. Following the completion of their diploma in teaching, the teacher undergoes professional formation to demonstrate effective teaching practice in order to gain full professional status of qualified teacher learning and skills (QTLS) which is conferred by the Institute for Learning (IfL).</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/4">Higher education institutions are responsible for recruiting their own staff and promoting higher education as a positive career option, to graduates and others. The higher education sector has published a report outlining the benefits of working on the sector, which is available here</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ucea.ac.uk/objects_store/where_are_we_now">http://www.ucea.ac.uk/objects_store/where_are_we_now</a>._the_benefits_of_working_in_he.pdf</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/6">The report highlighted the quality of working life in higher education and indicated it compared well with other sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/7">However, the UK Government fund a number of dedicated postdoctoral fellowship schemes, notably national academy schemes, such as the University Research Fellowships, Newton International Fellowships, and Dorothy Hodgkins Fellowships, which seek to attract the best early career researchers from around the world to UK institutions. Research Councils UK (RCUK) are also working to ensure the quality of research skills is improved and that researcher training will become increasingly part of mainstream research practise.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/8">RCUK remains fully committed to the maintenance of a high level skills agenda through its research careers activities, support for the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. RCUK also recognises significant progress made by the sector since 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.604W.5/1">The Government are absolutely committed to an open internet. The internet has brought huge economic and social benefits across the world precisely because of its openness, and that must continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.5/2">The Government expect all operators providing an internet access service-both fixed and mobile-to offer all legal content. Consumers should always be able to access any content or service they want to and content providers and applications should be able to access consumers. ISPs should not be able to discriminate unfairly against services or users. That means no blocking or discriminatory degradation of services or applications for commercial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.5/3">There is not yet any evidence that discriminatory practices are emerging, or that there is a problem with regards to how ISPs or networks manage the traffic that flows over them (something they all engage in for technical reasons to deliver the best possible service to consumers). And this is enforced by the initial responses to Ofcom's recent consultation on the issue. In addition, under new provisions in the Electronic Communications Framework review operators must present information about their service, including the nature and extent of their traffic management policies and their impact on service quality in a clear, visible and easy to understand form for all their customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.5/4">A contributing factor to the success of the internet has been the lack of legislative restraints that have been placed on it. It is our belief that improved transparency, along with a competitive market place and the ability to switch providers will mean that regulation in this area will be unnecessary. It is important that we give the market the opportunity to self regulate but Ofcom will closely monitor how the market develops and if it develops in an anti-competitive way they will intervene.</p>

This includes the introduction of new fee loans from the 2013/14 academic year, providing the opportunity for FE learners to access the funds they need to gain intermediate and higher-level skills. We recognise that this is a significant reform and that is why we will over the next few months engage with colleges, training organisations and others on the details of how fee loans will be implemented. The changes will be phased in over the spending review period to provide the sector with sufficient time to plan effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.5/2">Each of DFID's funding schemes for civil society organisations has different criteria and a specific application process. However once funding has been agreed there are a number of conditions that DFID applies to all NGOs. For example they are required to provide quarterly financial reports, a copy of their annual audited accounts and annual reports detailing progress made against agreed objectives. Funds can be used only to support activities and objectives agreed with DFID. All NGOs are also required to produce a project evaluation and project completion reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.5/3">In addition, the UK Government are introducing a new Aid Transparency Guarantee, which commits us to making our aid fully transparent to citizens in both the UK and developing countries, increasing accessibility and feedback, and pushing our international partners to follow our lead. Under this guarantee we will publish full and detailed information on our projects and programmes on our website-in a standardised, accessible format so that it can be freely used by third parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.3/1">The Government monitor international food supplies and price movements carefully. Our current assessment is that despite poor weather in southern Russia and Ukraine earlier this year, other regions of the world did well, and contributed to 2010 having the third largest cereals harvest on record. Global supplies remain adequate to meet expected demand, and available data and past evidence suggest that there is unlikely to be a shortage of food over the coming year. However prices remain higher than they were at the start of the year, reflecting the tighter supply situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.3/2">We are working with others, particularly G20 partners, to seek to avoid a price spike similar to the one seen in 2008. This involves urging greater trade liberalisation, promoting greater sharing of information on existing stocks, and discouraging disruptive actions such as export bans and panic buying, which limit supplies and drive up prices. G8 countries have also pledged to support the L'Aquila Food Security Initiative to increase food supplies in developing countries, and make markets work more effectively. In 2008 high prices affected developing countries differently, and any international response to a further price spike would have to be on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.5/1">Threats to food security come from a variety of sources, and over different time periods. In the short-term, countries heavily dependent on imports to meet their food supply needs are most vulnerable to price volatility on the international commodity markets. In 2008 this was the case in many West African countries heavily dependent on rice imported from Asia. Countries which are more self-sufficient in food are vulnerable to local harvest failure, as happened in the Sahel earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.5/2">In the longer term, slow economic growth, rising populations, and climate change pose the greatest threats to food security in developing countries. The Government remain committed to improving the food security of developing countries in collaboration with G8 and G20 partners.</p>

We conduct regular fiduciary risk assessments to assess the risk of funds being misspent and identify appropriate safeguards. Our funding to the Palestinian Authority (PA) is administered through a World Bank managed trust fund, which strictly controls how funds are used and has stringent audit requirements. For aid other than financial assistance to the PA, we work with all partners on project design to ensure that UK funding will be spent most effectively. Our partners are United Nations agencies and reputable non-governmental organisations with proven track records in effective delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.620W.4/1">In February 2009 DWP officials held a series of focus groups across the country with a number of key external stakeholders, including disability charities, business groups and ethnic minority groups about plans to refocus the Access to Work programme. There was general agreement about the value of the service that Access to Work provides but that the programme should be more flexible; more available to those who are in need of most help; and that larger employers could contribute more. These changes were announced in December 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.620W.4/2">Access to Work guidance has for many years specified that funding cannot be provided for standard equipment that an employer would need to provide for any employee to do their jobs.

This list will be updated from time to time to ensure it reflects latest developments. The list of examples provided is not exhaustive and advisers have the discretion to identify other types of equipment as standard for a particular industry or occupation.</p>

	<p pid="a.621W.0/1">We are unable to estimate the number of people caring for a person receiving the middle rate care component of disability living allowance who are not in receipt of carer's allowance. This is because estimating the take-up of carer's allowance would require combining information in relation to the carer's allowance eligibility criteria about both the disabled person and their carer, who may not be part of the same household.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.0/2">To receive carer's allowance, a person must be caring for someone who receives either attendance allowance or disability living allowance care component at the middle or highest rate. In addition, the carer must not have earnings from employment of more than &#163;100 a week after deduction of allowable expenses, and must not be in full-time education. In consequence, receipt of the disability living allowance care component at the middle rate by the disabled person does not necessarily automatically qualify their carer for carer's allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.622W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions assesses variances in average rates of sickness at office and agency level. The Department has succeeded in reducing sickness absence from an average of 11.1 days per employee in 2007 to 8.3 days per employee currently. This has been achieved through compliance with policy, sharing best practice and, where necessary, by focusing additional efforts in under performing offices.</p>

	<p pid="a.623W.0/1">Entitlement to disability living allowance (DLA) depends on the effects that disability has on a person's life and not on a particular disability or diagnosis. This means that people living with the same illnesses or disabilities may not necessarily have the same care or mobility needs. The current entitlement conditions can be open to interpretation which can lead to inconsistent and subjective decisions about benefit entitlement. It does not always focus support on those who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.0/2">As set out in Budget 2010, the Government intend to introduce a new assessment for disability living allowance to allow us to more accurately, objectively and consistently assess individuals to determine who is likely to benefit most from additional support. The Department remains committed to the social model of disability and it is not our intention that the new assessment will just be based on the medical model of disability and focused solely on an individual's impairment.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.0/3">We are not intending to introduce any other assessments in addition to this.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.0/4">We are currently in the process of developing the new assessment with the help of an independent group of specialists in health care, social care and disability, which includes disabled people. We are planning to consult publicly on our proposals later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.6/1">By the end of 2014-15, the Department for Work and Pensions estimates that there will have been around 300,000 lone parents with children over the age of five affected by the changes to conditionality announced in the June 2010 Budget. Of these, it is estimated that over 90% will be women.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.6/2">A framework of flexibilities and support is in place to help lone parents balance their caring responsibilities and work search. This includes access to specialist advisers in Jobcentre Plus who can provide advice on child care, local employers with flexible working vacancies, and financial incentives; the right to restrict availability for work to the child's normal school hours where the youngest child is 12 or under; and enabling lone parents to be deemed available for work during school holidays if appropriate, affordable child care is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.6/3">Lone parents will also be helped by the universal credit which aims to make sure that all amounts of work will be more financially rewarding than inactivity, and remove the current barriers to small amounts of work. Improving the incentives to take up mini-jobs, for example, will particularly help those who are not able to take up full-time employment. Promoting a culture of employment will not only help those individuals but will also tackle the intergenerational cycles of worklessness and welfare dependency.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.0/1">Based on the Making Automatic Enrolment Work review recommendation thresholds, and full employer compliance, we expect between 2.3 million and 2.6 million of the automatically-enrolled population to work for employers with fewer than 10 employees. These individuals make up 17% to 18% of the automatically-enrolled population.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/2">The effect on small businesses of the Workplace Pension Reform Regulations is set out in the 2010 impact assessment. The impact assessment looks at the impact on employers by employer size, looking specifically at small employers (defined as those with fewer than 50 workers) and micro employers (defined as those with fewer than five workers). Annex A presents the detailed assessment, as well as elements of the reforms that are designed to help small and micro employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/3">Copies of the impact assessment can be found in the Commons Library or at:</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/772/pdfs/uksiem_20100772_en.pdf">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/772/pdfs/uksiem_20100772_en.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/5">An independent review of the workplace pension reforms &quot;Making automatic enrolment work&quot; was published on the <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-27">27 October 2010</phrase>. One of the things the review team examined was the impact of the reforms on business. David Yeandle, of the Engineering Employers' Federation, was part of the review team to ensure that business interests were well represented in the review process.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/6">The review team recognised that easing burdens on business was important. So a number of their recommendations are aimed specifically at making things more straightforward for employers and we have accepted these recommendations in full. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/7" class="indent">Increasing the threshold at which an individual is automatically enrolled (currently &#163;5,035 at 2006-07 prices) to align it with the PAYE tax threshold (&#163;7,475 in 2011-12) and aligning the threshold at which contributions become payable (currently &#163;5,035) with the national insurance contributions threshold (currently &#163;5,715).</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/8" class="indent">A simpler way for employers to check that their defined contribution schemes meet the required standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/9" class="indent">An optional waiting period of up to three months before an employee needs to be automatically enrolled.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/10">Such recommendations will give employers greater flexibility in how they implement the new requirements and will mean that there is a much more proportionate impact on employers. The increased earnings threshold and waiting period are particularly beneficial for smaller employers, as they tend to have more lower earners and higher staff turnover.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/11">The review team recommended a range of further measures specifically aimed at helping smaller businesses including:</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/12" class="indent">Ensuring that micro employers are aware that the design of NEST specifically takes account of their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/13" class="indent">Providing the maximum possible comfort to small employers that they will not be held liable for their scheme choice, particularly if they opt for NEST or a stakeholder pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/14">In addition, smaller businesses will not be required to do anything until 2014, once larger employers have been fully brought in. This gives them more time to prepare and more time for us to ensure that the processes work well. Even then they will not be required to contribute the full 3% minimum contribution until October 2017. New businesses will be given further protection by being brought into the reforms last. Any new businesses set up after April 2012 will not have to automatically enrol until March 2016 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.0/15">The Government are taking forward the recommendations from the review as part of the forthcoming Pensions and Savings Bill, which is scheduled for introduction to Parliament in January 2011. The accompanying impact assessment will set out in detail how the changes affect smaller employers.</p>

	<p pid="a.629W.2/1">The relative effectiveness of the consumer prices index (CPI) and retail prices index (RPI) in measuring the increases in living costs for pensioners has been considered with regards to the coverage or &quot;basket of goods&quot; and methodology of each.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.2/2">The CPI excludes mortgage interest payments, which are not relevant to the majority of pensioners: only 7% of pensioners have a mortgage<sup>(1)</sup>. The RPI includes mortgage interest payments, which are variable and consequently can have a marked effect on that index. This means that in some years the RPI faces significant downwards or upwards pressure from a cost of living irrelevant to 93% of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.2/3">For example, in the 12 months to September 2009 the RPI fell by 1.4%, leading to many pensions being frozen, for example additional state pensions, public service pensions and some occupational pensions. Without downwards pressure from mortgage interest payments, the RPI would have grown by 1.3%<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.2/4">In addition in terms of population coverage the RPI excludes a significant group of pensioners (pensioner households who receive 75% or more of their income from the state). The CPI includes those pensioners<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.2/5">The methodology used to calculate the CPI takes into account the fact that many people tend to trade down to cheaper goods when prices rise. This contributes a significant portion of the gap between the CPI and the RPI and is known as the &quot;formula&quot; or &quot;substitution&quot; effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.641W.9/1">All sums of money in this answer have been rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/2">In 2006, 2007 and 2008 HMRC spent nothing on legal costs in cases involving the FA Premier League and clubs playing in that league.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/3">In 2009, HMRC Solicitor's Office recorded solicitors' time charges and other costs of &#163;8,000 in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/4">So far in 2010, HMRC Solicitor's Office has recorded solicitors' time charges and other costs of &#163;170,000 and spent &#163;102,000 + VAT on Counsel's fees in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/5">Some of these costs are recoverable from other parties. Portsmouth City Football Club Ltd (&quot;PCFC&quot;) was ordered to pay HMRC's legal costs of its unsuccessful attempt to have HMRC's winding-up petition struck out. These were agreed by the joint administrators of PCFC in the sum of &#163;100,000. This is, however, a debt which is subject to the terms of PCFC's company voluntary arrangement (&quot;CVA&quot;), and HMRC therefore only expects to recover these costs to the extent of 20p in the &#163;.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/6">The joint administrators of PCFC were also ordered to pay HMRC's legal costs of its challenge to the validity of their appointment. These costs are an expense of the administration and so are not subject to the terms of the CVA. HMRC therefore expects to recover these costs in full. The amount of these costs has yet to be agreed between HMRC and the joint administrators of PCFC.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/7">Finally, HMRC was ordered to pay the legal costs of the joint administrators of PCFC in relation to HMRC's unsuccessful challenge to the CVA in the High Court. The joint administrators' claim was for &#163;335,000 and HMRC has been ordered to pay &#163;200,000 of this on account. The final liability under this head will only be known once the joint administrators' claim has been subject to detailed assessment by the court. It will not under any circumstances exceed &#163;335,000 plus the costs of assessment; but it may in the event be substantially less than &#163;335,000 depending upon the view that the court takes of the reasonableness of the amounts claimed.</p>
