The research outputs are available at: <a href="http://www.fao.org/trade">www.fao.org/trade</a>.

	<p pid="c.866W.5/1">The UK Government are committed to the development of an open and rules-based international trading system that fulfils its potential to contribute to the reduction of poverty in poorer countries. Our key policy commitments on trade and development, as well as our objectives for the current round of multilateral trade talks, are set out in the Government's White Papers, Making Globalisation a Force for Good&quot; (July 2004) and Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor&quot; (December 2000). The UK Government are working hard to support the poorest and most vulnerable producers, be it through multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or regional trade agreements such as the Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
	<p pid="c.866W.5/2">At the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July, we made real and substantial progress for developing countries on more and better aid, deeper debt relief, and re-affirmed our commitment to a successful conclusion to the current round of WTO trade talks. The G8 also agreed to provide increased funds for trade related capacity building to assist developing countries take advantage of the new opportunities from a positive conclusion to the round. There is increased international support for increased 'Aid for Trade' as reflected at the recent World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings and the G8 summit in Gleneagles. It is important that we build rapidly on the outcome of these meetings.</p>
	<p pid="c.866W.5/3">The forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong represents an important opportunity to make a significant contribution to reducing global poverty. The UK Government are working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest. These gains should include improved participation by developing countries in the world trading system, through substantially increased market access for developing countries and the dismantling of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies by industrialised countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.867W.2/1">The UK has been closely engaged with Indonesia concerning illegal logging since preparing for the Ministerial Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) Ministerial Conference in Bali in September 2002. The resulting declaration led to the UK-Indonesia Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which aims to tackle illegal logging in Indonesia and ultimately eliminate trade in illegally harvested timber between the two countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.867W.2/2">Our ambassador in Jakarta and DFID officials have maintained frequent and direct contact with the Indonesian Minister of Forestry and his officials concerning implementing the MoU and we are making steady progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.867W.2/3">My most recent direct contact with the Minister of Forestry was to invite him to visit the UK in September to discuss progress and future activities. Unfortunately the Minister had to postpone his visit.</p>
	<p pid="c.867W.2/4">Since the trade issues must be dealt with at the EU level, these cannot be tackled under the MoU and DFID, together with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, have been working to put in place the EU forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) action plan. These will provide for voluntary partnership agreements between the EU and timber producing countries with a licensing scheme to control illegal trade as their focus. The European Commission is leading on preparations for such an agreement with Indonesia, which we hope will supersede and strengthen our MoU. Our ambassador underlined the importance of such an agreement in a meeting with the Indonesian Minister of Forestry last July and DFID officials, through the commission in Brussels and its delegation in Jakarta, are lending practical support to the current preparations.</p>
	<p pid="c.867W.2/5">The UK has been working closely with the Government of Cameroon over a number of years to tackle illegal logging and forest governance problems. We have supported the Government to develop a comprehensive national programme to address illegal logging and improve forest management and have also supported an independent monitor in Cameroon to help the Government combat forest crime. We worked closely with the Minister of Forests and Prime Minister to support Cameroon hosting the Pan African Ministerial Conference on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in 2003. Most recently DFID officials met the Minister responsible for Forestry and Ministry of Finance in October to finalise plans for our support to the national programme and to further understanding about the opportunities afforded by the voluntary partnership agreement with Europe for the timber trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.867W.2/6">The UK has been supporting the Cameroon Government in preparing for negotiations with the European Commission for such an agreement alongside Germany, who co-ordinates this work for the member states. The Forest Minister recently indicated to us that they would like to negotiate a partnership agreement in July 2006 when work reviewing the legal code is completed.</p>

This is a 'not for profit' organisation with a board comprising all those involved in the industry as well as Government, human rights organisations and unions representing the workers. Pilot audits, which include assessments of exposure to chemicals, on eight farms, revealed that while some problems exist the industry generally is socially responsible. But to ensure that internationally recognised social business practices are being followed, the HEBI has produced a code of practice for flower farmers. This includes a regular independent audit and inspection of flower farms and a better understanding by growers and workers of their social and legal rights and obligations.</p>

	<p pid="c.870W.5/1">It is not currently possible to give a percentage figure for funding spent directly on TB control and treatment from total direct budget support which DFID provides. This is because national governments do not have financial accounting systems that trace the proportion of direct budget support spent on individual diseases. However, DFID provides a significant part of its funding directly to government budgets in support of their overall strategies for poverty reduction ('Poverty Reduction Budget Support'). DFID provided &pound;423 million in 2004&ndash;05 in this way, partner governments may use some part of this directly for TB control activities, or for building up health services to diagnose and treat TB as well as other major causes of ill health.</p>

In March 2005, DFID published a policy paper entitled Partnerships for Poverty Reduction: changing aid 'conditionally'&quot;. The policy commits us to only using conditionality to ensure that aid is used effectively for the purposes intended and can be accounted for to the UK Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/2">We are committed to supporting governments in developing countries to make their own decisions about how to develop their economies and provide services to their people, based on evidence of what works best to reduce poverty. DFID will not make aid conditional on specific policy decisions by partner governments or attempt to impose policy choices on them, including in sensitive economic areas such as privatisation or trade liberalisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/3">DFID also encourages developing countries to make their own decisions about service delivery, including whether or not to open their service sectors to foreign providers. However, developing countries are not obliged to accept any request or to open up their services sectors. It all comes down to which option is the most effective in reducing poverty, a decision for governments of developing countries to make through their own political process. Nothing in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) forces them to privatise or prevents them from establishing appropriate regulation.</p>

	<p pid="c.873W.9/1">No biomass products or biomass by-products have been reclassified as waste since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.9/2">The definition of waste&quot; in force in Great Britain since May 1994 is the definition in Article 1<i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended) which provides that waste is</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.9/3" class="indent">. . . any substance or object . . . which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.9/4">Whether or not a substance is discarded as waste is a matter which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the interpretation of the definition of waste and the meaning of discard&quot;. ECJ judgments are binding on member states and their competent authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.9/5">It rests in the first place with the producer or holder of a substance to decide whether it is being discarded as waste. However, the Environment Agency is designated as a competent authority for the purposes of implementing the directive in England and Wales. It is the agency's view that residues from the incineration or co-incineration of biomass (e.g. poultry litter) disposed of as waste in compliance with the EU Animal By-products Regulation are waste within the meaning of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.9/6">The classification of a substance as waste does not preclude its use. For example, waste ash from the incineration or co-incineration of biomass may be used as a fertiliser and spread to land for benefit to agriculture. The Government continue to encourage the recovery of waste by means of recycling, re-use and reclamation. This encouragement includes the use of the Government's discretion under Article 11 of the waste framework directive to provide exemptions from waste management licensing. Licensing exemptions for the recovery of certain kinds of waste ash are provided in paragraphs 9A, 13 and 19A of Schedule 3 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 (as amended).</p>

	<p pid="c.883W.12/1">The price of electricity varies over time. The value of losses will be dependent on the value of electricity at the time the losses occurred. This means it is very difficult to determine an accurate value of the level of losses in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.12/2">A certain amount of electricity is used by generators to operate their businesses. Generators have strong financial incentives to restrict their losses as any electricity lost means they have less to sell. Approximately 1.5 per cent. of the electricity put on to the transmission network is lost. This represents approximately 0.6 per cent. of the average standard credit electricity bill. The level of electricity lost on the distribution networks varies from network to network. The simple average of losses on distribution networks is 6.3 per cent. This equates to about 2.4 per cent. of the average standard credit electricity bill. There are no figures available to answer the fourth part of this question. Energy inefficiency in the household is being tackled and the Government support the Energy Savings Trust's save 20 per cent. campaign.</p>

	<p pid="c.888W.11/1">The Government's target of renewable energy sources contributing 10 per cent. of our electricity by 2010 is for all forms of renewables, not just wind. However it is clear that wind will make the main contribution. At this stage it is difficult to predict precise numbers. There are already just under 1,450 wind turbines of various sizes, currently in operation. These turbines are sited both offshore and onshore.</p>

For this period the trend was for a consistent and continuing decline in the numbers of pollution incidents in UK waters accompanied by reductions in the annual total number of incidents attributed to the handling and transportation of oil around the UK coastline.

	<p pid="c.894W.2/1">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency uses data provided by the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) and statistics are not available in the form requested. It can however be confirmed that such instances are few in number, coastguard experience suggests that around five or six incidents of cargo being lost overboard occur over the course of one year in United Kingdom waters and only a few of these can be listed as dangerous or harmful. In a circumstance where a dangerous or harmful cargo has been reported to have been lost overboard in UK waters the Maritime and Coastguard Agency would execute recovery where necessary and operationally possible.</p>

The Department's new expert advisory body on cycling, Cycling England, has made an assessment of the scheme and has decided it has been sufficiently successful to include in their work plan for the next three years. The scheme did not appoint any school travel advisers but did appoint four Bike It officers who add value to the work of local authority school travel advisers.

	<p pid="c.898W.0/1">Recently published European legislation will extend the mandatory requirement for the installation of seat belts to buses (except urban buses), coaches and goods vehicles. This is broadly in line with UK requirements in place since October 2001. European legislation will also prohibit the installation of sideways facing seats in new types of vehicle. Certain types of coach used to provide conferencing facilities are exempt from this until October 2010. Accident data will then be reviewed to determine whether the exemption should be extended. Otherwise, these requirements will apply to new types of vehicle being brought to the market from October 2006 and to all newly registered vehicles from October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.898W.0/2">Regulations are in preparation to come into force in 2006 (subject to Parliamentary approval) which will introduce a requirement for passengers in buses and coaches aged three years and above to wear seat belts where they are available when in seats other than the front. This follows a Departmental consultation in 2004 about changes needed in seat belt wearing regulations to transpose the requirements of European Directive 20/2003/EC into domestic legislation. The consultation document and the subsequent decision letter are available on-line at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_rdsafety/documents/divisionhomepage/039143">www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_rdsafety/documents/divisionhomepage/039143</a>.hcs.</p>

	<p pid="c.906W.5/16">Direct comparison between the input and wastage figures in any particular year can be misleading because of varying course lengths and fluctuations in numbers under training. The overall underlying wastage rate at Phase 2 over the last few years has, however, shown a slight increase. It should also be noted that, since April 2002, the Infantry has run a combined Phase 1 and 2 course at ITC(C); figures since this date therefore include numbers for Phase 1 where generally the level of wastage is higher.</p>

	<p pid="c.907W.5/2">Concurrently all three services have introduced enhancements to induction training for new staff and to the arrival briefings given to trainees.

In addition, arrival briefings for trainees have now been revised to include more emphasis on diversity and potential self-harm and bullying issues, including how to look out for each other and how to take appropriate referral action.</p>

Since April 2004, the total number of civilians employed by the Department (including its trading funds) has reduced from 109,050 full time equivalents to 106,270 (<phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October 2005</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="c.910W.5/1">Roles and responsibilities within the Carrier Alliance will be underpinned by commercial arrangements designed to align all parties to common project objectives. The industrial participants will agree contracts which will set out clearly their responsibilities in terms of areas of work related to the Carriers and the interface between the various parties, the risk that each party is taking on and where the accountability for each of these lies. These will form part of the overall shipbuild strategy and will be finalised when the main investment decision is taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.910W.5/2">Estimated costs are being constantly refined and will not be bound until the main investment decision, though we are confident that the continuing work to mature our cost, schedule and risk information will ensure the capability required is affordable.</p>
	<p pid="c.910W.5/3">Given that both the UK and France are embarking on major, complex carrier procurement projects, we are examining areas of mutual benefit and opportunities to deliver economies. It is for industry to put forward proposals which will be judged on their merits and in light of national policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.910W.5/4">As one would expect in the development of any Government strategy which requires the perspective of several Government Departments, there have been a number of meetings at ministerial level with Ministers and officials from other Government Departments.

	<p pid="c.911W.5/1">A programme of research, overseen by an independent panel of experts, has investigated the possible adverse health effects of the combination of vaccines and tablets which were given to UK personnel to protect them against the threat of biological and chemical warfare during the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict.</p>
	<p pid="c.911W.5/2">The core study in the programme has been undertaken at Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), Porton Down and involved monitoring for a range of effects in marmosets for up to 18 months following the administration of vaccines and/or pyridostigmine bromide (the active ingredient in nerve agent pre-treatment tablets). Interim results, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-04-01.55"><i>Official Report</i>, column 55WS</phrase>, have been published and showed no apparent adverse health consequences. Final results are expected to be submitted for peer-reviewed publication shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.911W.5/3">A second study has investigated the specific combination of anthrax and pertussis vaccines. This work was carried out by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. Publication of the final results was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-07-21.117"><i>Official Report</i>, column 117WS</phrase>. In mice, pertussis vaccine, vaccine combinations, or aluminium salt caused illness; anthrax vaccine produced little effect; diluted vaccine combinations produced less serious side effects of shorter duration. As the researchers pointed out, caution should be exercised in applying these results to humans because of the relatively high dosage used in the tests and the very different sensitivity to these vaccines in mice and humans.</p>
	<p pid="c.911W.5/4">A third study has examined whether staff from Dstl Porton Down who received multiple vaccinations, including anti-biological warfare vaccinations, in the course of their duties have higher levels of recorded sick leave than their unvaccinated colleagues. The results of this study will also be submitted for publication shortly.</p>

The protocol reinforces the fact that primacy for conducting investigations into all deaths, or serious deaths where death is likely, on military establishments in the UK rests with the chief officer of the Home Department police force under whose jurisdiction the death occurs. The protocol, which covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was signed on behalf of the Secretary of State and a representative from the Association of Chief Police Officers on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase>. Copies of the protocol will be placed in the Library in the near future.

	<p pid="c.921W.10/1">The UK Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000, sets out the Government's strategic approach to tackling climate change, including our policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to ensure we meet our target under the Kyoto Protocol and to move us towards our domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. Significant policies the Government have put in place to reduce emissions include the renewables obligation, the climate change levy and climate change agreements, and the voluntary greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme&mdash;the first such economy-wide trading scheme in the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.921W.10/2">The programme also explained how climate change will affect the UK and the action we are taking to prepare for this. We are reviewing the programme, looking at how existing policies are performing and the range of policies that we might put in place in future. In the Energy White Paper, published in February 2003, we said we would put the UK on a path towards a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of some 60 per cent. by about 2050.</p>

	<p pid="c.927W.8/1">In 2003/04 and 2004/05 adult learners in Further Education (FE) were assumed to contribute 25 per cent. of the basic course cost of their learning unless fees were remitted because the learner was receiving an income based benefit or on a Skills for Life programme. This proportion increased to 27.5 per cent. in 2005/06, and will rise again in 2006/07 to 32.5 per cent. and to 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08. In average terms, this means a rise from an hourly rate of &pound;1.42 this year to &pound;1.94 by 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.8/2">However, we know that historically many FE providers choose to waive the fees for some of these 'fee-paying' learners:</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.8/3" class="indent">In 2003/04, FE providers collected &pound;152 million out of an 'expected' &pound;261 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.8/4" class="indent">In 2004/05, &pound;159 million was collected out of an expected &pound;277 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.8/5">The Skills Strategy White Paper set out a vision for transforming the way in which the Learning and Skills sector can support higher national investment in skills, which included ensuring that the state, employers and individuals all contribute towards the costs of their learning, in line with the benefits received by each.</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.8/6">In order to increase the levels of fees collected, from 2005/06 the LSC agreed a fee income measure with each FE funded provider. To assist providers in developing a strategic approach to, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published a good practice guide to fee income earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.8/7">Clearly, with the increase in the fee assumption, it will be important that FE providers recover as much money as possible from learners as employers..</p>

	<p pid="c.928W.5/1">The Department is deeply concerned about the distress bullying causes and the effect it has on lives and we are determined to help schools reduce and respond to bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/2">Since 1997 our work has included conferences and events to disseminate good practice, alongside the development of guidance and resources for schools. The anti-bullying Charter for Action has fostered a wide consensus among schools, the voluntary sector, and professional associations. We have supported an award scheme to share and celebrate the excellent work of schools and children and young people in this area. We have given funding to the voluntary sector to embed effective practice and offer training and support to schools, children and young people and their parents. We have run a number of public information campaigns encouraging children to 'tell someone' and to support their friends. Anti-bullying work is embedded in the Primary and Secondary National Strategies Behaviour and Attendance strand, including through the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) materials. Details of specific initiatives follow.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/3" class="indent">2000 and 2002 updated anti-bullying guidance folder for schools, 'Don't suffer in silence'</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/4" class="indent">September 2003 public information film 'Tell Someone' launched, to encourage children who are being bullied to tell someone, and not suffer in silence.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/5" class="indent">November 2003 anti-bullying Charter for Action for schools launched</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/6" class="indent">2003&ndash;04 'Make The Difference' campaign conferences held in each Government office region, targeted at head teachers and Chief Education Officers. Postcards and posters in English and a range of other languages created to encourage children and young people to tell someone if they are being bullied, and to support parents and schools in helping bullied children</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/7" class="indent">July 2004 Anti-Bullying Alliance work, funded by DfES, to sustain momentum of 'Make The Difference', launched. Funding announced for dedicated anti-bullying Diana Award</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/8" class="indent">November 2004, during the first national Anti-Bullying Week, blue anti-bullying bands campaign&mdash;Make A Stand, Wear The Band&mdash;launched by the Department, Radio One and the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), all working in partnership. This has been a significant success, with 1 million children and young people making a stand and wearing a band.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/9" class="indent">November 2004 second public information film, 'I Am', produced to coincide with the campaign. In this celebrities read lines from a poem written by a child who had been bullied to show young people that they are not alone if they are being bullied and can get help.</p>

	<p pid="c.928W.5/24">We assess the success and effectiveness of our anti-bullying work as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/25" class="italic">Qualitative evidence of success and effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/26" class="indent">The Department's 2003&ndash;04 Make the Difference conference series was heavily over subscribed.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/27" class="indent">Delegates told us that they left feeling inspired and motivated to promote continuing changes and improvement in their schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/28" class="indent">The overall evaluations for the London conference were 100 per cent. positive, and for the series overall 97 per cent. positive.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/29" class="indent">The web statistics of a workshop used at the Wembley conference reflect the enthusiasm and interest generated by this conference. The number of hits on their site increased to over 20,000 the week following the conference, compared with 48 hits in their own launch week.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/30" class="indent">Last year's Beat Bullying campaign received support from a large number of famous personalities. Originally 100,000 blue bands were earmarked for the three-month-long campaign but within just 36 hours of the launch all had been allocated. By the end of December 2004 Radio One received the order for the millionth band.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/31" class="indent">The anti-bullying Charter for Action that was launched in November 2003 has been signed and returned to the ABA by about 4,000 schools. We believe that other schools have adopted the charter, but have not returned it to the ABA, and that more still have used it as the basis for developing their school anti bullying policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/32" class="indent">The two anti-bullying public information films ('Tell Someone', 2003, and 'I am', 2004) are the two most watched public information films created by the Department. It seems reasonable to assume that such a volume of interest has led to increased awareness, both of the need for children and young people to tell someone if they are being bullied, and of the fact that the person being bullied is not to blame.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/33">We have no statistical evidence, for example of a decline in incidents, available to show the impact and effectiveness of our strategy. This is because nationwide statistics on bullying are not available and we think it would be very unwise to make an estimate (although racist incidents in schools do have to be reported).</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.5/34">Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed it could be seen as a measure of effectiveness that as more children feel confident enough to report bullying it is likely that the number of recorded cases will rise.</p>

	<p pid="c.930W.5/1">The target for tackling basic skills in England is to 'Improve the basic skills levels of 1.5 million adults by 2007 and 2.25 by 2010' (since the launch of the Skills for Life Strategy in 2001). The 40 per cent. target refers to the Government's ambitions for 'Level 2': to reduce by at least 40 per cent. the number of adults in the workforce who lack NVQ2 or equivalent qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.930W.5/2">In 2001 the Government published the Skills for Life Strategy to tackle basic skills needs across England. Basic skills are a long term priority for this Government and basic literacy and numeracy learning is free to learners with skills below Level 2. Since 2001, we have put in place national standards and core curricula. We are continuing to focus on driving up quality of provision and are professionalising the workforce and extending the reach of the strategy. Since the strategy was launched in 2001, we have helped 1,130,000 adults achieve first qualifications in literacy, language or numeracy. In total, 3.7 million adults have taken up 7.8 million learning opportunities. Tackling basic skills underpins our Skills Strategy, 14&ndash;19 reforms, primary and secondary strategies, and our agenda set out in Every Child Matters.</p>

	<p pid="c.931W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January</phrase> this year, we introduced new 'Gateway forms' designed to ensure that any issues of domestic violence can more readily be raised at the very start of Children Act 1989 private law court proceedings. We have also commenced section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which clarified the definition of 'harm' in the Children Act 1989, which now makes explicit that it includes any impairment suffered as a result of seeing or hearing the ill treatment of another. In addition, section 1 of the Children Act 1989, which applies whenever the court is considering an application for a contact order, requires the court to have the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration. This is reinforced by the welfare checklist at section 1(3) of that Act, which requires the court to have regard to any harm the child has suffered, or is at risk of suffering.</p>

The programme will be a powerful, demand-led mechanism for changing the way in which training for adults is delivered. Employers will have greater choice of high quality provision, and colleges and providers will need to deliver high quality training programmes at a time, place and pace determined by the employer. A sum of &pound;230 million has been made available for the programme for 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;399 million for 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="c.936W.11/1">There have been a number of improvements based on the principle of collecting data once and sharing many times, primarily to help reduce burdens. The introduction of the Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) in 2002 has enabled individual pupil data to be collected electronically from schools and simplified the pupil registration process for national curriculum tests. The quality of data for both local and central use has also improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.936W.11/2">My Department is continuing a programme to streamline data collections and include them wherever possible within an enhanced school census. By 2007, six separate surveys will have been brought within the school census.</p>
	<p pid="c.936W.11/3">My Department has also developed a process by which data can be transferred automatically and securely between schools, local authorities and other agencies. The site is used to transfer statutory returns, national curriculum teacher assessments, and relevant data when a pupil moves to a new school. For the latter the New Relationship with Schools programme has facilitated every school being able to access missing information about their pupils to aid their learning plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.943W.8/1">The Geography Development Fund was established in 2004, to improve the teaching, learning and status of geography in schools. We judge the allocation to be sufficient to lay the foundations for subject development. The Fund is targeting strategic priorities identified by the subject community. In 2004/05 a significant part of the Fund was devoted to supporting primary teachers. The 'Geography from Square One' project provides accessible teaching ideas, particularly for non-specialists and the pilot 'Primary Geography Quality Mark' helps schools deliver quality geography and be recognised for doing so. These developments have been well received by teachers and will be built on through further work supported by the Geography Development Fund in 2005/06.</p>

	<p pid="c.945W.0/1">We are broadly maintaining the overall public funding that the LSC will be able to allocate to support adult learning on average through to 2007&ndash;08. But the pattern of that learning will change. To meet our national priorities, we need to shift the pattern so that we provide a greater number of longer and more expensive courses for adults, to equip them with the range of skills they need for employability and further progression to higher levels of training.</p>
	<p pid="c.945W.0/2">As a consequence, the number of publicly funded places on shorter courses which do not lead to national qualifications is likely to fall by around 500,000. But set against this, there will be some 400,000 places available through the National Employer Training Programme and over 260,000 places for adults taking full Level 2 programmes in mainstream further education&mdash;which is a total increase of 274,000 full Level 2 places compared with 2005&ndash;06. So while maintaining the overall volume of adult training, we estimate there will be a net reduction in publicly-funded places of around 230,000 (about 6 per cent.). That will result in a total of some 3.5 million places available for adults by 2007&ndash;08. We expect that this reduction can be offset by colleges and other providers offering a wider range of programmes at full cost. In addition, public funding will support an expected additional 46,000 16 to 19-year-olds in learning in FE colleges and schools by 2007/08 compared with 2005/06, and maintain the numbers on apprenticeships while increasing the numbers successfully completing the full apprenticeship framework.</p>

	<p pid="c.946W.2/1">The Government have introduced a wide range of reforms which have promoted substantial improvements in achievement rates since 1997. These include our Specialist Schools policy which enables some of our best schools to drive innovation and play a leading role in the system; the introduction of Academies to raise attainment in communities in the areas of greatest need; and the targeted challenge and support provided through the National Strategies to raise achievements in the core subjects. These reforms have been supported by an unprecedented level of investment in better teachers' pay; in more support staff; in new computers and other equipment; and in new school buildings.</p>
	<p pid="c.946W.2/2">Real improvements have followed. Compared with 1997, around 84,000 more 11-year-olds started secondary school this year with the basic literacy and numeracy skills to do well; and 50,000 more 14-year-olds achieved the target standard in English and mathematics this year than did so in 2001, when the Key Stage 3 Strategy was introduced. Schools in the most deprived communities have achieved faster than average improvements, especially in the proportion of good passes at GCSE, thanks to programmes such as London Challenge and Excellence in Cities which has also promoted collaboration between schools to raise standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.946W.2/3">The Schools White Paper published last month sets out our plans to improve the school system further, in particular by putting parents and the needs of their children at the heart of it, freeing up schools to innovate and succeed, bringing in new dynamism and external support and ensuring that failure or coasting is not an option for any school.</p>

	<p pid="c.949W.5/1">Gloucestershire county council bid to our Targeted Capital Fund for projects at Cleeve and Rednock schools. The Cleeve bid was successful and the Rednock bid, unsuccessful. I am putting a copy of the bidding guidance, which contains the criteria, in the House Libraries. We have provided feedback to the authority on its unsuccessful bid.</p>
	<p pid="c.949W.5/2">We increased the size of the fund from &pound;493 million to &pound;1.1 billion over two years and this enabled us to support about 45 per cent. of local authority bids, compared to 33 per cent. in the previous round. The fund is, however, very competitive and it is not possible to support all the worthwhile bids we receive.</p>
	<p pid="c.949W.5/3">Building Schools for the Future is our long-term strategic programme to transform the facilities for all secondary pupils over 15 years, subject to future public spending decisions. It does not involve bidding either by local authorities or individual schools. As Gloucestershire does not start in the programme until after 2011, we have just allocated the authority around &pound;20 million to rebuild one of its worst condition schools as a 'school of the future'.</p>

However, we do know that co-ordination of the secondary admissions process has resulted in fewer parents receiving multiple offers of school places and fewer being left with no offer at all. By giving local authorities a central role in co-ordinating the process for their areas, we have enabled them to obtain better information on children who have not had any offer, and this has led to them being able to intervene earlier to find school places. Local authorities estimated that, compared with the same stage in the process last year, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March 2005</phrase> (the national offer date for secondary schools) the number of children in London without an offer of a school place had reduced by 40 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.950W.11/1">Research published by my Department in 2004 suggests that nearly two thirds of pupils who currently travel to school by bus or taxi have their fares paid by their family, not their local authority, at an average cost of &pound;7.29 per pupil per week. Only around 10 per cent. of children entitled to free school meals travel three or more miles to school compared to 18 per cent. of children not entitled to free school meals.</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.11/2">The White Paper proposes to improve transport arrangements for the most deprived pupils by extending entitlement to free home to school transport for secondary aged pupils to any one of the three nearest suitable schools, where the distance travelled is between two and six miles. For the most deprived primary aged pupils, the entitlement to free transport will be extended so that they will receive free transport to their nearest school where this is more than two miles from their home. The estimated cost of these two extensions of entitlement is &pound;40 million per annum. Full costings and related assumptions will be included in the regulatory impact assessment that will accompany the Bill.</p>

In June 2001, my Department published The Impact of Study Support&quot;, which set out the findings of a three-year longitudinal study of around 8,000 pupils in 52 secondary schools. The research found that pupils participating in study support do better than their peers who do not in three key areas&mdash;attainment, attitudes to school and attendance at school. The study also indicated that minority ethnic pupils and pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds gain most benefit, and that participation increases the likelihood of subsequent participation. Young people can benefit from a wide range of activities, not just those which are linked to curriculum subjects.</p>

	<p pid="c.954W.3/1">There are a range of factors, in both the home and school, which are shown to influence a positive learning environment. Many of these factors are shown to particularly focus on supporting low achieving children, who disproportionately tend to be from lower socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.954W.3/2">Research shows that the quality of the home environment in the pre-school years has the strongest impact on child development at start of school and beyond, and is therefore the most important influence on child development in the pre-school period. The Department's effective provision of pre-school education (EPPE) study has shown that, for all children, the type and range of learning activities that parents undertake with their pre-school children (for example, reading, singing nursery rhymes and playing with numbers) are more important for intellectual and social development than parental occupation, education or income.</p>
	<p pid="c.954W.3/3">Research also highlights that school related factors such as, personalisation of learning, mentoring and tailoring the curriculum for pupils who are gifted and talented all contribute to a positive learning environment. Early findings from the excellence in cities programme and pupil learning credits pilot suggest an impact on attitudes, attendance and key stage 3 mathematics results. The research shows that the most progress in mathematics was made by pupils from the most deprived schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.954W.3/4">School organisation and ethos is also important in developing a positive learning environment. The behaviour improvement programme indicates that effective combinations of measures including behaviour audits, development of behaviour and attendance strategies, learning mentors, learning support units and multi-agency working, are effective in improving behaviour and attendance.</p>

	<p pid="c.955W.2/1">The Department has made no formal assessment of the impact of low level classroom disruption on under-achievement However, research evidence indicates that there is a complex relationship between behaviour, attainment and social class. Research shows that being in a school where there are high levels of disruption can impact negatively on pupils' learning and there is some evidence that it may have more of an impact on pupils from low socio-economic groups. In addition the Department's data shows that schools with higher levels of permanent exclusions tend to have lower levels of attainment as do young people who have been excluded.</p>
	<p pid="c.955W.2/2">Evidence also suggests that there is a link between social class and behaviour both at an individual and a school level. Pupils from low socio-economic groups are more likely to report having been punished or excluded from school; and evidence from teachers suggests that schools with high levels of children on free school meals have higher levels of classroom disruption.</p>
	<p pid="c.955W.2/3">We have made clear our support for schools to take a zero tolerance approach in tackling low level disruption in the classroom. We are further strengthening our programme of work to combat such disruption by taking forward the recommendations of an experienced group of heads and teachers, led by Sir Alan Steer, who had a specific remit to address the impact of low level disorder on teaching and learning. A number of these recommendations feature in the recent Schools White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="c.955W.5/1">Effective grouping of pupils by ability can raise standards and better engage pupils in their own learning. Putting children in different ability groups within a class is now commonplace in primary schools and over a third of classes are set by ability in secondary schools including the majority of lessons in English, maths, science and modern foreign languages.</p>
	<p pid="c.955W.5/2">It is for schools to use their own professional judgment to determine for themselves how and when to set or group pupils so as to ensure that it helps to raise the attainment of all pupils, including those from low socio-economic backgrounds. We set out proposals in our recent schools' White Paper, for support for schools to tailor education so that no child falls behind and no child is held back from achieving their potential. Our proposals include helping schools to learn from the best practices around setting and grouping as well as investing an additional &pound;60 million a year, and targeting &pound;335 million within the new dedicated schools grant to support personalisation in key stage 3, over the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="c.956W.2/1">Good schools have been personalising their teaching and learning, with great success for many years to raise standards and meet the learning needs of their pupils. We know that personalising learning, which includes assessment for learning; high quality tailored whole class, small group and one-to-one teaching; a flexible curriculum, effective school organisation and strong partnerships beyond the school, can raise pupil achievement particularly for low achieving pupils who disproportionately tend to be from low socio-economic backgrounds. We now want this to be common practice across all schools, particularly for children at either end of the ability spectrum whose needs can be the most challenging to meet.</p>
	<p pid="c.956W.2/2">We will therefore allocate &pound;335 million by 2007&ndash;08, specifically earmarked within our Dedicated Schools Grant, to provide the resources secondary schools need to start delivering personalised learning for pupils in Key Stage 3, focusing funding on deprived areas, particularly for those who have fallen behind in literacy and numeracy and for those who are gifted or talented. For those schools with the highest numbers of children who have fallen behind we will provide a further targeted &pound;60 million in each of 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, shared across the primary and secondary sectors, to provide more effective one-to-one and small group tuition. We will also provide all schools with best practice materials, guidance and access to training on the most effective teaching and learning strategies to personalise learning to the needs of each pupil.</p>
	<p pid="c.956W.2/3">Through School Improvement Partners and the new OFSTED inspection regime we will challenge every school to demonstrate they are planning and delivering effective tailored teaching and learning for every child, particularly for under-achieving groups of pupils, including those from low socio-economic backgrounds, as well as overall school performance.</p>

	<p pid="c.957W.2/1">We know that the way schools currently involve parents is varied. For example, we know that in primary schools there is a much more inclusive approach to parents, resulting in parents of primary school children feeling more confident about engaging with their child's school. However, we know this is not always the case with secondary schools, where establishing such a relationship is more difficult. Further, we know that some parents, due to the complexities of their own lives or their own educational history, are more reluctant to engage with their children's school.</p>
	<p pid="c.957W.2/2">We want to help parents and schools to work well together and raise children's achievement. We know that the key to improving parental involvement in children's education is changing attitudes and moving towards a situation where parents are accepted as co-educators and partners in their children's learning, not only in schools but also in local authorities. It is crucial we ensure that the importance of parental involvement is embedded throughout the education chain to establish a culture of parental involvement and encourage a positive, two-way partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.957W.2/3">To enable this, we are actively encouraging parents to become more closely involved in their children's education and learning at home and at school. Since 1997, we have sought to enhance parental involvement through a range of measures. These include information for parents such as videos, DVDs, the Learning Journey&quot; guides and the Parents Centre website; and materials for schools such as the Involving Parents, Raising Achievement toolkit.</p>
	<p pid="c.957W.2/4">Parental involvement is not only key to the standards agenda, but is equally central to creating a culture of lifelong learning and high aspirations in communities and families, regardless of background. This message has been reinforced by the White Paper Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.961W.2/1">Immediately after the recent beheadings in Central Sulawesi, President Yudhoyono condemned what he described as a sadistic crime&quot;, and sent extra police to the area to ensure that violence did not flare up. The British ambassador in Jakarta has discussed the issue with senior Indonesian officials and expressed the UK's shock at the incident.</p>
	<p pid="c.961W.2/2">In September this year, President Yudhoyono stressed that the state guaranteed every citizen religious freedom and called on the police and members of the public to act to prevent violence against any faith. We co-sponsored, with the Indonesian Government in Bali in July, an international conference to promote inter-faith understanding and harmony. We will continue to co-operate with them on this important objective.</p>

	<p pid="c.966W.5/1">Diagnostic testing for HIV, and any associated counselling is free to all. However, subsequent treatment should the test prove positive is not and those people who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, or otherwise exempt from charges, are expected to pay for any national health service hospital treatment provided. This has always been the case since the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations were introduced in 1989. We believe that the overseas visitors charging regime is about more than just the protection of NHS resources. Equally important is the protection of the principle that the NHS exists primarily for the benefit of those who are living legally in the UK, and not for those who are not. The Government have to balance public health responsibilities, and responsibilities to individual patients, with its wider responsibilities in terms of immigration and asylum policy. Such responsibilities cannot be assessed in purely monetary terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.966W.5/2">A number of voluntary bodies and other organisations with an interest in HIV/AIDS have written to Ministers on this matter in recent months. In addition, the Health Select Committee covered this issue in its report New Developments in Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Policy&quot; published in March 2005, to which the Government responded in July 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.969W.6/1">There has been no specifically commissioned research into malnourishment in Portsmouth or the number of people affected by this. However, there is a strong local awareness of this issue and a range of initiatives has been introduced in the city accordingly. Work is in progress to evaluate a fruit and vegetable delivery scheme in one of the city's target regeneration areas. Work is also under way, again in targeted regeneration areas, to increase cookery skills through schools and community centres.</p>

Licensing statistics are collected from the courts every three years and the last DCMS Statistical Bulletin on liquor licensing in England and Wales covers the period 2003 to 2004.

	<p pid="c.972W.6/12">No breakdown is available for the reasons why the licensing justices decided to revoke these licences and it is not therefore known what percentage were the result of selling alcohol to children.</p>
	<p pid="c.972W.6/13">In addition, under the Licensing Act 1964, following a second or subsequent conviction of a justices' licence holder for selling alcohol to children, the convicting court may declare the licence forfeit. There are no centrally held records of the number of licences forfeited for this reason.</p>

	<p pid="c.982W.6/1">In accordance with Cabinet Office guidance, the Home Office uses a variety of methods to assess an applicant's literacy and numeracy skills during the recruitment process. These include competency based application forms, the use of specific tests of ability, aptitude or potential and assessment centres for staff entering the service at Higher Executive Officer (HEO) and grade 7 level. For both of our assessment centres, candidates are presented with materials in written form and this provides a substantial test of literacy skills. Certain of the exercises we also use include numerical material.</p>

The &pound;465 million Neighbourhood Policing Fund has been set up to help provide for up to 24,000 CSOs by 2008.

Larger, more strategic forces will support neighbourhood policing as they will have the resilience to prevent the abstraction of neighbourhood policing teams to major incidents.

	<p pid="c.988W.8/1">Given that there is no physical security to prevent prisoners leaving Springhill, prisoners abscond rather than escape from the open estate. In the last three years the trend for absconds from Springhill has reduced significantly. During 2003&ndash;04, 64 prisoners absconded, during 2004&ndash;05 42 prisoners absconded and so far this year 28 prisoners have absconded.</p>
	<p pid="c.988W.8/2">During the last two years, management at Springhill has taken a number of measures to seek to reduce absconds. For instance, all prisoners are seen on induction by a governor who warns them about the implications of absconding. In addition, a protocol has been introduced with Thames Valley Police to prosecute through the courts all prisoners who abscond. Moreover, significant improvements have been made to the regime with the opening of a job club and two vocational learning centres offering industrial based qualifications in computing and bricklaying. Vocational qualifications have been introduced in catering and horticulture.</p>

To establish what representations there have been would therefore involve disproportionate cost. Prisoners are moved to open conditions only after a rigorous risk assessment, which determines whether a prisoner is suitable for open conditions.</p>

	<p pid="c.993W.8/6">The research is being undertaken by the Policy Research Bureau working with MACRO. It is taking place in 16 Youth Offending Team areas and includes interviews with magistrates and judges in those areas. It is similar in nature to earlier research undertaken in the adult criminal courts by Professor Mike Hough, Dr. Andrew Millie and Dr. Jessica Jacobson. Their findings were published in the report The Decision to Imprison, Sentencing and the Prison Population&quot; in 2003 by the Prison Reform Trust. It also supports a three year longitudinal study being undertaken by RDS section of the Home Office, using court records to explore the factors influencing sentencing decisions within both adult and youth courts. This study will be tracked to examine the relationship between offender characteristics, sentence content and outcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.993W.8/7">It is expected that the Youth Justice Board will publish the findings of the current research in the autumn of 2006.</p>

However, it should be noted that clause 23 specifies that the description must not be the same as the name or description of a registered political party, nor be so similar as to confuse with or lead an elector to associate the candidate with a registered political party.

	<p pid="c.1021W.5/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Gregory Campbell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what assessment he has made of changes in commuter travel time at peak times from junction 5 of the M2 motorway to Belfast City Centre over the last five years. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/4" class="indent">Roads Service monitors journey times on the strategic routes in Northern Ireland including the routes from Larne to Belfast to Newry (A8, M2, Ml and Al). These surveys commenced in 1996 and the most recent information available is for 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/5" class="indent">Unfortunately, we have no journey time information that relates to the specific journey between junction 5 (Templepatrick) and Belfast City Centre. However, a comparison of journey times between Templepatrick and the Divis Street junction on Westlink would suggest that the average journey time in the morning peak over this section has increased by 3 to 4 minutes between 1998 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/6" class="indent">We fully appreciate the significant delays experienced by southbound traffic approaching Sandyknowes on the M2. Roads Service acknowledges that these delays are a direct result of capacity restrictions downstream of Sandyknowes where only 2 traffic lanes are available to cater for both mainline M2 traffic and the considerable flow joining the motorway from the Sandyknowes roundabout. Consequently we plan to widen the Belfast-bound carriageway of the M2 motorway to create an additional southbound lane between the Sandyknowes and Greencastle junctions. This will make it easier for traffic to join the M2 from the Sandyknowes junction, particularly during the morning peak traffic, and also provide greater capacity on the Belfast-bound section of the M2 towards Greencastle. Construction of these improvements on the M2 is expected to start during 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/7" class="indent">The &pound;30 million M2 Widening Scheme is one of three schemes forming part of the &pound;100 million Roads Service Design, Build, Finance and Operate Package 1, along with the Ml/Westlink Project and the Antrim Hospital slip roads.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/8" class="indent">I can also advise that the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan proposes modifications to the Sandyknowes roundabout to minimise conflicts between different traffic movements and afford greater priority to the strategic M2 and A8 movements. Roads Service is currently investigating various design options.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.5/9" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.1024W.2/1">Following a review of public procurement, the new procurement policy was announced in the Northern Ireland Assembly in May 2002. The overall aim of the policy is to achieve best value for money&quot; in the procurement of goods, works and services over the lifetime of a contract. Best value for money does not mean the lowest initial cost. It means securing a procurement that meets the user's needs and achieves a balance between quality and cost throughout the life of the asset. Within this definition the policy allows for the consideration of wider policy objectives into procurement, that meet the tests of need, affordability and cost-effectiveness and comply with the UK's EC and international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1027W.9/1">Both the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and its agencies do not use call centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.9/2">The number of calls received to the main ODPM switchboard prior to January 2003 is unavailable. However, a total of 24,833 calls were received January 2003 to March 2003, 118,773 during 2003&ndash;04, 129,209 during 2004&ndash;05 and 61,408 from the start of 2005&ndash;06 to the end of September 2005. Abandoned call data are available only from October 2004, since when, out of 106,823 calls received, only 0.2 per cent. were abandoned by the caller after 15 seconds. Rather than receive an engaged tone when waiting for an operator to become available, the call continues to ring until answered.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.9/3">The Fire Service College have received 15,703 calls since July 2005 (no data available prior to this date). Out of those received, 14,388 (92 per cent.) were answered within the Fire Service College's performance target of 15 seconds. All calls to the main Fire Service College switchboard are handled by advisers: no data are available concerning abandoned calls. Calls to the switchboard continue to ring until answered rather than receive an engaged tone.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.9/4">The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre receives approximately 110,000 calls annually which none are handled by advisers: no data are held concerning abandoned calls. Calls to the main switchboard do not receive an engaged tone, but go straight to voicemail if unanswered after a short period of time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.9/5">Call data volume for the Planning Inspectorate are not held nor are statistics relating to abandoned calls. All calls to the switchboard are handled by advisers and calls are placed into a queue until an advisor is available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1043W.10/1">The nine pathfinders are working in parts of our northern cities and towns where three years ago the prices of houses fell well below their apparent worth. Those who could do so moved out. Homes were abandoned and some of the most disadvantaged in our society became trapped in neighbourhoods characterised by dereliction, crime, anti-social behaviour and poor services. This market collapse was an extreme manifestation of a wider problem of low demand which the Housing Market Renewal Fund addresses.</p>

Refurbishment, new build and some demolition are part of this approach as well as action with partners to improve economic and job prospect, education, crime and behaviour and health, tackle dereliction, provide high quality public space and capitalise on the rich heritage of many areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.1044W.11/1">Good progress has been made on all aspects of the project. In August, Wolverhampton Business Park was chosen as the site for the West Midlands regional fire control centre, following a fair and transparent procurement process. The building has recently received full planning permission. The West Midlands Regional Management Board have indicated their willingness to set up a local authority company as the governing entity for the centre, subject to a full consultation on the detailed proposals. Meanwhile, the procurement for the technology/infrastructure services that will supply all the new regional controls is well under way, and should be completed by spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1045W.8/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not envisage that changes to self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) introduced by colleagues in the Treasury will have any significant effect on housing markets in either rural or urban areas. In July we launched the Affordable Rural Housing Commission and invited it to consider the evidence and reach consensus on the relevant issues around affordable housing needs in rural areas. It is likely that the Commission will wish to consider the positive and negative aspects of second homes. The Commission will report next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1046W.2/1">The Government is funding free smoke alarms for 1.25 million vulnerable households in England under the &pound;25 million Home Fire Risk Check initiative over the period 2004&ndash;08. Many FRSs are fitting alarms for the deaf and hard of hearing under this initiative. Specific advice is already included in guidance prepared by the Chief Fire Officers Association. In summary, people who use hearing aids may be able to hear conventional interconnecting alarms, but if this is found not to be the case, specialist alarms should be fitted. We would expect all smoke alarms to meet appropriate British Standards.</p>
