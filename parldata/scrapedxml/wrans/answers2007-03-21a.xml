	<p pid="a.897W.9/1">Since 1997 the measure to address capacity issues on the Brighton Main Line has been to introduce new rolling stock for the Southern franchise. The old slam door fleet has been fully replaced, with 24 per cent. extra trains in total with each new train having more capacity than the train it replaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.9/2">The next phase of capacity enhancement will be implemented as the Brighton Main Line Rail Utilisation Strategy (BML RUS). The BML RUS will make better use of the existing capacity on the Brighton Main Line.

	<p pid="a.899W.7/1">Compared to the situation this time last year, there has been some small improvement in the humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): the overall numbers of new displacements per month has reduced slightly; the total number of displaced persons is now estimated by the UN Organisation for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) to be about 1 million; there has been a continuing flow of Congolese refugees returning from neighbouring countries with about 405,000 remaining outside the country and there has been a considerable reduction in the recruitment of child soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.7/2">However, there remains considerable cause for concern. The Congolese army continues to steal from and harass the population. This has been exacerbated where attempts to carry out a mixing process between the army and remaining militia groups has increased ethnic tensions in certain areas and has led to large numbers of people being displaced. In the Kivus, the population also continue to be harassed by the foreign armed group the FDLR (Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda). Throughout the region sexual violence remains unacceptably high and outbreaks of disease such as cholera, meningitis and plague add to the suffering of the population. For those areas where greater stability means that people can return home, they need help with the basics such as health care, clean water and assistance to restart farming. This is also true for many areas throughout the country where infrastructure and services have been destroyed or neglected.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.7/3">The DRC Humanitarian Action Plan, developed by the humanitarian community in DRC, estimates the total need for 2007 to be US $687 million. This includes interventions to save lives and to help people return home or to have access to basic services when there is no other support. DFID expects to spend about &pound;35 million on humanitarian aid for DRC in 2007. This will include a contribution of &pound;30 million to the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund (in support of the Humanitarian Action Plan). The first &pound;15 million for the pooled fund has already been transferred, as has &pound;2 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for their annual appeal for DRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.900W.2/1">The UK had &pound;67 million development assistance available to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in financial year 2006-07. Approximately half of these funds have been spent on emergency humanitarian support through the UN and non-governmental organisations, with the remainder on supporting the 2006 electoral process, improving transport links to some isolated areas, supporting police and justice reform, supplying anti-malarial bednets and basic health, education, water and sanitation services and tackling HIV/AIDS. Additionally, through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool, we are supporting: the EU mission advising on reform of the army; the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of militia groups; and the provision of tents, water and sanitation and human rights training to soldiers in the new integrated brigades (and their families and local communities) to try to stop them preying on civilian populations to make ends meet.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.2/2">Available funds are set to increase if the country continues to make progress. We are currently finalising our post-elections strategy for the DRC. We are doing this under the umbrella of the Common Assistance Framework&mdash;a joint strategy with all DRC's other major donors. This will help ensure that donor support to the DRC is co-ordinated and so more effective. All of our programmes are developed in consultation with other donors&mdash;such as the World Bank, UN, European Commission, the United States, Belgium and Sweden, and many will be jointly implemented. For example, the programme we are developing on road rehabilitation will be implemented through the World Bank, and also financed by the European Commission. Our humanitarian support to those most in need is implemented by the UN and non-governmental organisation and funded by several donors through a &quot;pooled fund&quot; mechanism which allows DRC's humanitarian co-ordinator to deploy funds quickly and flexibly to wherever the need is greatest.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.2/3">Under out post-elections strategy our planned portfolio will focus on:</p>

	<p pid="a.901W.2/1">The World Bank and IMF estimate that approximately 5 per cent. of the total outstanding debt of all HIPC countries (US$63.2 billion in Net Present Value terms) was owed to commercial creditors.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.2/2">Countries that receive debt relief from multilateral organisations and bilateral (Government) creditors are required to negotiate equivalent debt relief from other creditors, including commercial banks and companies. Many commercial banks are part of the 'London Club' and offer debt relief under the HIPC framework. However, a survey of 24 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) in 2006 led the IMF and World Bank to estimate that only a limited number of commercial creditors (holding approximately 5.5 per cent. of the total commercial debts) have provided their share of HIPC debt relief directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.2/3">Many of the remaining commercial creditors have agreed to around 90 per cent. debt reduction as part of operations managed by the World Bank under their Debt Reduction Facility (DRF), the remaining 10 per cent. of the debt is paid for by the World Bank and donors with some contribution from HIPCs towards the costs. By mid-2006, over $4.5 billion worth of commercial debt owed by HIPCs had been eliminated in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.2/4">However, some of the remaining commercial debt is bought by vulture funds. These companies wait until a country's circumstances have improved (for example after debt relief) and then press their case through the courts, seeking large settlements. We are working bilaterally and multilaterally with HIPC governments to raise awareness of this issue and encourage preventative action. DFID is co-funding a Debt Management Capacity Building programme and supports a wide range of other activities to strengthen public financial management and accountability. DFID also supports the World Bank's DRF, and we have recently agreed to provide a contribution of $3.5 million to a package that will help Nicaragua buy back over $1.3 billion worth of commercial debt.</p>

	<p pid="a.902W.8/1">The overarching framework for allocating budget resources in Uganda is the Government's own Poverty Eradication Action Plan. DFID participates in the process through which the Government of Uganda determines the distribution of budget funds which include assessments of performance and financing needs in individual sectors and an annual Public Expenditure Review in which development partners and civil society are consulted about budget plans for the next year and the medium term. Allocations to the Poverty Action Fund, through which poverty reduction expenditure is prioritised, are now nearly 40 per cent. of the Government's budget compared to about 20 per cent. at the end of the 1990s. DFID's Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) supplements the Government's own resources in the budget. Decisions about PRBS take into account the Government's commitments to poverty reduction, strengthening financial management and accountability and respecting human rights and international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.902W.8/2">The distribution of support to the country's regions is an important part of the discussions which DFID has about performance and financing needs in individual sectors such as health, education, water and agriculture. The provision of services at district level is largely funded by the central Government. Ensuring that the criteria for allocating resources to districts take proper account of poverty is a priority for DFID. We have worked closely with the Government in different sectors to improve allocation criteria so that the distribution of funds and the provision of services better reflects needs. In recent years there has been a shift in the allocation of resources in favour of poorer districts, although there is scope for further improvement. A recent NAO study noted the contribution DFID has made to bringing about positive changes in the district budget allocation system.</p>
	<p pid="a.902W.8/3">A particular focus for our discussion about support to Uganda's regions has been the situation in the North where the humanitarian consequences of conflict have created major additional needs on top of normal per capita expenditure, including the requirement for large scale food distribution. These additional needs have largely been met by the donor community. We have pressed the Government to do more. The Government responded in the 2006-07 budget by making available an extra &pound;5.3 million (approximately) for the districts of the north affected by conflict.</p>

	<p pid="a.907W.3/1">Only residual waste after recycling has taken place is sent for incineration with energy recovery. In 2006 residual waste collected from the parliamentary estate amounted to 1,299 tonnes. This material was combusted at an energy recovery facility regulated by the Environment Agency, generating 725,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. The recovered energy is classed as renewable energy by the UK Government, in line with Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/2">Recovering energy from waste is acknowledged in the stern review as an effective weapon in combating climate change, displacing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power generation sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/3">The carbon footprint associated with the combustion of this waste is made up of a number of components:</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/4" class="indent">(1) Direct emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), expressed as carbon equivalents</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/5" class="indent">(2) &quot;Avoided&quot; emissions of GHG (that is, emissions displaced from an equivalent amount of fossil fuel power generating capacity)</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/6" class="indent">(3) GHG emissions (additional or saved) from waste transportation</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/7" class="indent">(4) Net GHG emissions, taking account of direct, avoided and transport-related emissions</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/8" class="italic"> Direct emissions of GHG</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/9">GHG emissions from waste combustion are calculated in two steps. First, an estimate is made of the percentage of fossil and non-fossil carbon in the waste. Second, the emissions from the combustion of the fossil carbon within the waste are calculated. Emissions of non-fossil carbon do not contribute to global warming and are therefore not taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/10">Methane is not produced in combustion plants. The remaining greenhouse gases are released in trace quantities relative to emissions of carbon dioxide. Because their concentrations in the emission gases vary according to the composition of the waste, the total GHG effect expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (Teq) is estimated using emission factors developed by DEFRA, based on measured emissions averaged across UK energy recovery facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/11">Direct GHG emissions following the combustion of residual waste from parliamentary estates amounts to 415 Teq, of which 295 Teq is carbon dioxide.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/12" class="italic"> GHG emissions from waste transportation</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/13">A saving in GHG emissions is realized when residual waste from the parliamentary estates is combusted, since the energy recovery facility is just 12 miles from the House. Previously the waste was being transported to landfill further away from the Estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/14">The GHG emission factor developed by DEFRA for waste transportation varies between 0.37 and 0.49 kg carbon dioxide equivalents per tonne of waste transported, depending on distance travelled. For transportation of 1,299 tonnes of parliamentary estates waste, this amounts to a GHG emission of between 0.48-0.65 Teq. Since this is less than 1 per cent. of the emissions of direct or avoided emissions, the GHG saving in transporting the waste a shorter distance will be omitted when presenting net emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/15" class="italic"> Net GHG emissions</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/16">The carbon footprint associated with the combustion of waste from the parliamentary estates is obtained by subtracting avoided emissions from direct emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.3/17">This equates to a net GHG saving of 20 Teq. Therefore 20 Teq should be subtracted when determining the total carbon footprint of parliamentary estates.</p>

	<p pid="a.912W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question regarding which areas within Chorley borough have low electoral registration rates. (126613)</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/5" class="indent">The attached table provides information, for each electoral ward in Chorley, comparing the number of people who are registered to vote as local electors with the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over. The resulting percentages are labelled as 'registration rates' on the table and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/6" class="indent">These 'registration rates' are not published as National Statistics: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular, care needs to be taken when considering areas where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such an area might be one containing prisons (as is the case for Lostock ward) or accommodation for a United States Air Force base, as prisoners and American citizens are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated 'registration rate' calculated for such areas is considerably reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/7" class="indent">Please note that the population estimates have a reference date of <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, and electoral data a reference date of <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>. Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data (as they are under 18) to give the best possible comparison.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/8" class="indent">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is one of the main reasons some areas show rates in excess of 100 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.6/9" class="indent">The population data are estimates and as such are subject to a margin of confidence. The ward level population estimates are derived from estimates for a different geography that have been published with the status of experimental statistics. Therefore, the estimates, and electoral registration rates derived from them, should not be treated as being exact. The latest derived available ward estimates are for mid-2004 and therefore data are shown for this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of employment for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.2/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>

Table 2 also shows the number of persons, aged 16 to 74, in full-time and part-time employment expressed as a proportion of the total number of employed persons aged 16 to 74.</p>

However, internet technology changes extremely quickly and we recognise that the website is now in need of updating, ONS is part-way through a project to develop a new website to meet the needs of users. The new website is being designed to be effective and easy to use, and will also need to take on board organisational changes to ONS resulting from the Statistics and Registration Bill. Rollout of the new site is due to start in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.926W.11/1">The Battlefield Target Identification System (BTIS) is intended to help identify friendly forces, helping to reduce the risk of fratricide.

	<p pid="a.927W.11/2">Military patients admitted to Selly Oak hospital, or other hospitals of the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust, are accommodated in wards appropriate to their clinical need. The largest number of operational casualties have required treatment as trauma orthopaedic cases. They are therefore the focus for the military managed ward that has been developed at Selly Oak to enable military patients to be accommodated together in a single ward, where it is clinically appropriate to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.927W.11/3">The military managed ward offers the opportunity to accommodate military patients together in six-bedded bays or, when necessary, in side isolation rooms. A works project, now out to tender, will change the layout of the ward to produce a separate area for military patients, utilising the two bays and isolation rooms at the far end of the ward.</p>
	<p pid="a.927W.11/4">The treatment of military patients is the responsibility of the NHS Trust. A military trauma co-ordinator is responsible for liaising with clinical colleagues, military and civilian, to provide advice on Service issues and ensure that military aspects of military patients' treatment are fully taken into account. On the military managed ward, military nurses will always be on duty and currently include 19 qualified nurses and 5 health care assistants. They work closely together with NHS colleagues to provide nursing care, with special emphasis on military patients. A military ward manager, supported by three military deputies, is responsible for all aspects of the military presence on the ward.</p>
	<p pid="a.927W.11/5">Military patients at Selly Oak and elsewhere in the Birmingham area are supported by the work of two full-time community psychiatric nurses and four welfare officers of the Defence Medical Welfare Service. Families of injured Service personnel are provided with welfare support and accommodation when necessary. Accommodation available includes seven flats, plus a number of family rooms.</p>
	<p pid="a.927W.11/6">We shall continue to enhance the capability of the military managed ward and the care available for all military patients. The development of the ward would not have been possible without the close and enthusiastic support of the NHS Trust.</p>

	<p pid="a.930W.2/1">There is no mechanism in place for jobseekers to recommence their jobseeker's allowance claim without having to register in person.</p>
	<p pid="a.930W.2/2">To ensure people are able to reinstate their benefit claim quickly after a short break, Jobcentre Plus fast-track people through what is known as a rapid re-claim process. This is used for people who are returning to benefit within 12 weeks and whose circumstances (in relation to the claim) are unchanged. Rapid Reclaim supports the incentive to take up employment, including short-term periods of full-time work, by allowing the completion of a shortened claim form. To be able to move quickly back into benefit also eases the concerns felt about reclaiming benefits if the work suddenly comes to an end.</p>
	<p pid="a.930W.2/3">While rapid re-claim still requires a face-to-face contact&mdash;needed to put in place things such as the jobseeker's agreement, which is a legal requirement&mdash;the process is much streamlined and involves a shorter interview and much reduced paperwork. Interviews are typically undertaken with 48 hours and people being required to confirm their circumstances remain as previously stated in writing.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.3/14">Although the Government's aim is to raise the level of research and innovation across the UK economy, it is difficult to capture innovation in project based activities such as construction. The Department's innovation survey shows that 44 per cent. of construction enterprises were involved in some form of innovation activity between 2002 and 2004. The sector's main contractors and specialist engineering innovation activity is largely of a site-based problem-solving form, although some also undertake formal research and development.</p>

	<p pid="a.934W.5/1">The Department of Trade and Industry has recently reviewed its procurement procedures as part of its work to implement the public sector Duties to promote equality of opportunity for race, (imposed by the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000)), and disability, (imposed by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended by the Disability Discrimination Act 2000)).</p>
	<p pid="a.934W.5/2">The Department's invitation to tender documents now contain information alerting potential contractors to the need to demonstrate an understanding and application of the Disability and Race Duties in the services they provide or are seeking to provide. This information makes it clear that while contractors are not subject to these public sector Duties in an individual capacity, DTI's legal obligations extend to those organisation with whom they contract with. In addition, the Department also now requires its top 50 existing suppliers to, if requested, provide management information to demonstrate their compliance with the Duties. The Department, in its revised standard terms of contract, has the right to terminate a contract for non-compliance with the Duties. These provisions, specific to the Duties, complement the Department's pre-existing anti-discrimination best practice and contractual requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.934W.5/3">The Department's procurement guidance and documentation is available on the internet for agencies and sponsored bodies to access and apply at their discretion.</p>

	<p pid="a.941W.2/1">These are matters for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). Anthony Douglas, the Chief Executive, has written to my hon. Friend with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Anthony Douglas, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-20">20 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/3" class="indent">I am writing to you in response to the three Parliamentary Questions that you tabled recently:</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/4" class="indent">126086&mdash;To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, how long it took on average to produce a section 7 case in respect of Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service proceedings in (a) 2006-07 and (b) each of the preceding five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/5" class="indent">CAFCASS does not collect information on the duration of cases and has not done so since it was established in 2001. For the last 3 years, CAFCASS have operated to a guideline that a section 7 report will take on average 25 hours to produce. We operate to a standard of 12 weeks in which to file all private law reports. However, local filing agreements are made between CAFCASS teams and their Courts, and these agreements fluctuate from month to month and case to case. The way the 25 hours work will be distributed across the filing period will also vary from case to case. Urgent cases are always dealt with first.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/6" class="indent">CAFCASS currently has 72 teams and at <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January 2007</phrase>, 30.6% of teams filed their report within 12 weeks. 25% of teams filed within 14 weeks. 43.1% of teams filed within 16 weeks, and 1.3% (1 team) had a filing time of over 16 weeks. This figure varies with demand, for public law cases and other types of reports ordered to be produced by CAFCASS as well as section 7 cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/7" class="indent">126087&mdash;To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, whether he anticipates any reduction in the number of Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service self-employed contractors in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/8" class="indent">CAFCASS expects that the total number of self-employed contractors for 2006-07 will be 400, a reduction of 37 on 2005-06. Exact figures will not be available until after <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase>, the date which marks the end of the financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.942W.5/1">Our 10 Year Childcare Strategy has highlighted the need for further Government support to increase the child care options open to parents especially in rural or disadvantaged areas. Since April 2005, our emphasis has been on local authorities sustaining existing good quality child care places rather than creating new ones. While Sure Start Children's Centres in the most disadvantaged areas must offer integrated early learning and day care provision as part of their core services, we have never intended centres to set up in competition with good existing provision. Local authorities must consult private, voluntary and independent providers when planning their children's centres strategy and, by working in partnership with them, plan to make the best use of the experience and expertise of local providers.</p>

These projects range from universal services provided through mainstream settings such as extended schools and Sure Start Children's Centres through to early intervention, prevention and targeted commitments in the Respect and Social Exclusion Action Plans. Additionally, we will establish the National Academy for Parenting Practitioners which will enable increased training and dissemination of best practice for the parenting work force. This will result in improved delivery of evidence based parenting programmes. The NAPP will become fully operational in October 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.946W.0/1">After careful consideration we no longer intend to run the Youth Opportunity Card pilots. We have carried out, with excellent support from the 10 pilot local authorities, detailed and extensive work to assess whether the Youth Opportunity Card is deliverable and the associated costs, benefits and risks. Our conclusions are that the costs outweigh considerably the money being provided to young people, considerable risks and uncertainties remain and there is no off-the-shelf technological solution or one that can be developed with certainty at the present time.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.0/2">Therefore we do not believe that going ahead with the card at this point in time would provide value for money. However, I am absolutely committed to opening up new ways of giving young people the means to make their own choices and a real say over what is provided for them. I want to continue to work with the local authorities to develop alternative means of achieving the same ends.</p>

	<p pid="a.949W.2/1">We are taking into account all the available evidence in considering a way forward on badger culling, including the badger culling operations at Steeple Leaze, Dorset and Thornbury, Gloucestershire. However, there were no scientific controls set up at the time of these operations. The Krebs' review pointed out that the scientific merit of the results was limited because controls allow us to reduce the impact of possible confounding factors on the results observed. In the absence of scientific controls, it is not possible to distinguish the contribution of such factors from the effects of badger removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.949W.2/2">However, the review also suggested that both a before and after comparison, and a comparison with incidence in geographically close areas where no contemporary systematic removal of badgers occurred, provide useful information about the effect of culling.</p>
	<p pid="a.949W.2/3">A complete assessment of previous tuberculosis (TB) control strategies can be found in the 1997 'Report on Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle and Badgers' by Professor John Krebs and the Independent Scientific Review Group, which is available in the House Library.</p>

For example, the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 contains several measures that are designed to enhance the powers and capability of LAs and the EA to tackle fly-tipping.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/3">One of these measures involved giving courts the power to make an order against anyone convicted of the main offence of illegal waste disposal to pay for costs incurred by a landowner in removing waste that has been illegally deposited.</p>

I am also aware of the good work being done by the National Fly-Tipping Prevention Group, which has been working closely with organisations like the National Farmers Union, the Country Land and Business Association, Network Rail and the National Trust. The Group has recently produced guidance to landowners on how to deal with fly-tipping and gives tips and ideas for ways in which joint working can help tackle hot-spot areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.955W.0/1">Recycled plastic waste, usually derived from a number of sector sources, can displace virgin material in the production of a variety of different products. My Department does not therefore hold precise figures for the percentage of plastic from individual sectors recycled and used in the production of new plastics or for fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.0/2">Latest estimates from WasteDataFlow show that 38,000 tonnes of plastic waste from household sources were sent for recycling in 2005-06. Compositional analyses of household waste suggest that around 4 per cent. is dense plastic (e.g. bottles, packaging), equating to around 1 million tonnes in 2005-06. This suggests that around 4 per cent. of plastic in the household waste stream was sent for recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.0/3">A report published by the Environment Agency, 'Recycling Agricultural Waste Plastic', estimated that around 87 thousand tonnes of plastic waste arises from the agricultural sector in England, with approximately 1 per cent. of this being recycled.</p>

	<p pid="a.960W.8/1">Croatia must continue to address the issue of returning Serb refugees. Much progress has been made in repossessing properties occupied during the 1991-95 conflict, building new houses for returning Serbs and reconstructing housing destroyed during the fighting. The Government have also started providing social housing for those Croatian Serbs who lost their tenancy rights during the conflict. But the process needs to be accelerated, and this issue remains an important feature of the EU's political dialogue with Croatia. In addition our ambassador in Zagreb maintains a regular dialogue with the Croatian Government on this and other issues.</p>

The EU action plan provides a comprehensive approach to tackling this problem and the impact it has on its victims. A report on progress is due to be received before the end of 2007. The UK's action plan on tackling trafficking in human beings, which will be published soon, reflects the work being done by the UK.

	<p pid="a.972W.2/1">The Passport Validation Service (PVS) is used by organisations from both the private and public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.2/2">Public sector customers include the Criminal Records Bureau, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), Department of Work and Pensions, e-Borders, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, HM Revenue and Customs, Immigration and Nationality Directorate and the Police.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.2/3">Within the private sector, organisations regulated by the Financial Services Authority have to comply with the &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; requirements in order to guard against money laundering. As part of meeting these requirements, many financial institutions already check passports of individuals as part of opening accounts or taking out loans.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.2/4">PVS offers such institutions the ability to ensure that these checks are more effective and secure by confirming whether the passport presented is a valid passport and has not been reported as lost or stolen. Thus, this provides a deterrent against fraud and forgery. Private sector organisations using PVS do so via a call centre, they provide PVS with the details from the passport in front of them and PVS confirms or denies whether this information matches our records. No personal details are divulged by PVS.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.2/5">There are currently seven financial services organisations using PVS. Each is regulated by the Financial Service Authority and has been accredited before being allowed to enter into contracts to use PVS. Organisations are accredited to ensure they have a legitimate need to use the service and systems are in place to regulate staff using the service and to ensure adequate data protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.2/6">However, it is not intended that the names of these organisations should be published so as not to reduce the effectiveness of the Passport Validation Service as a deterrent to combat fraud.</p>

	<p pid="a.974W.0/1">As planned, the NOMIS Programme Board reviewed an independently assured plan for developing and testing the versions of C-NOMIS that are to be rolled out across England and Wales, including the timing of the upgrading of the IT infrastructure and how all of these are underpinned by a strengthened contractual arrangements with our suppliers. Lessons learnt from the highly successful introduction of the early version of C-NOMIS at HMP Albany on the Isle Wight were also taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.0/2">Going forward, we plan to introduce a second version of the application with an improved level of functionality no later than July 2007. At the discretion of HM Prison Service and private sector prisons management this could be implemented in as many as 25 suitable prisons. Work is already well advanced to confirm identification and scheduling of that group. This will begin with upgrading HMP Albany and going live at other two Isle of Wight prisons, HMPs Parkhurst and Camp Hill.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.0/3">Beyond that, the main C-NOMIS base release, encompassing full prison and probation functionality, will be available no later than July 2008. In the near future senior prisons managers will be meeting with colleagues from probation and the C-NOMIS Project deployment support teams to decide how they will schedule the remaining prisons for implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.0/4">Given this re-planning we now anticipate that this major roll-out schedule can now be speeded up significantly overall without cutting down on the time to implement for individual sites. We expect the roll-out of replacement of legacy systems&mdash;LIDS in the case of prisons&mdash;to be complete by the end of March 2009 which represents only a slight delay on the original plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.986W.2/2">From 2003-04 to date, the Adjudication Panel has imposed a sanction of five years disqualification in three cases, and a sanction of one year's suspension in 12 cases. For the same period, local standards committees imposed a sanction of three months suspension in 82 cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.2/3">Following the High Court judgment in the case of the London Mayor last October, doubt has been cast on the extent to which the remit of the code of conduct can extend to behaviour by a councillor which is not directly related to his or her role as a member. We are therefore seeking, in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, to amend the Local Government Act 2000 to allow the remit of the model code of conduct to include the behaviour of members in their private capacity, if it involves criminal activity, as well as official capacity.</p>

By making key information available to both buyers and sellers early in the transaction process it is expected that HIPs will lead to reduced transaction times, a reduction in wasted costs and more certain and transparent transactions. It is also anticipated that HIPs will pave the way for further, market-led changes that will bring substantial further benefits to consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.988W.5/1">Mobility was identified as one of the key issues in the Hills review of Social Housing. The Government are currently looking at these issue as part of responding to the review. The social housing pages on the Directgov website (<a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/socialhousing">www.direct.gov.uk/socialhousing</a>), provide information on the recent changes to social housing mobility and easy access to information and services; and signposts facilities for tenants to approach and apply to social housing landlords directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/2">Other services providers offer access to services to exchange social housing and we have also listed 10 of these direct access &quot;homeswap&quot; services and are reviewing the market in order to add to the schemes listed to offer the widest choice to tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/3">The new social housing pages on Directgov also link to other Government services such as the &quot;Looking for Work&quot; facility which links to the Jobcentre Plus database with job vacancies throughout the UK; a variety of pages relating to local information i.e. schools, hospitals and care services; and information on benefits. Users can also access the full range of other Government services available on Directgov.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/4">We are in discussions with London councils on providing a transitional service for the seaside and country homes (SSCH) and the LAWN mobility schemes, on a medium term basis under grant agreement. These arrangements are currently being developed. In the meantime, London councils are providing an information service to customers as arrangements are put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/5">The Department has also funded 26 local and sub-regional choice based lettings schemes, as well as one regional scheme for London, which will provide additional mobility services and the facility for social housing tenants to move home within areas and regions. Once operational, these will also be accessible through the social housing pages on Directgov. The first of these schemes (High Peak and Derbyshire Dales) is due to go-live next month.</p>

Information on local authority stock is reported by the local authorities. The aforementioned figures include estimates where individual local authorities have not provided any data.</p>

Increasingly social rent housing units are provided by registered social landlords who can lever in additional borrowing. By 2007-08 the annual provision of new social rent homes is set to reach 30,000 of which 28,000 will be delivered through Housing Corporation funding to RSLs and other developers.</p>

	<p pid="a.990W.2/1">Groups of tenants of local authorities have had a right to manage their homes since the introduction of The Housing (Right to Manage) Regulations 1994. A local authority is required to provide reasonable support to the group to assist it to set up a tenant management organisation. The tenant empowerment programme (TEP), now administered by the housing corporation, provides financial support to developing tenant management organisations. In the main stage of development, the local authority is required to contribute 25 per cent. of the TEP funding. Typically a local authority will contribute about &pound;28,000 towards the development, spread over three or four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.2/2">Once a tenant management organisation is up and running, its activities are funded from management and maintenance allowances paid for the functions for which they are responsible. These allowances are based on the local authorities' own level of expenditure for those functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.2/3">We are currently reviewing the right to manage regulations with a view to simplifying the process. A simpler process will reduce both the time and the cost of developing a tenant management organisation, though it may also encourage more tenants groups to explore the option. As part of the review we will assess the impact of proposed new regulations, including the impact on local authorities.</p>

Regenerating the Lower Lea Valley was a priority, under the Thames Gateway programme, before the announcement of the 2012 Olympic Games coming to London and continues to be a priority as part of the Thames Gateway. The future regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley will be undertaken by the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation. The Development Corporation's vision for the Lower Lea Valley includes the building of 35,000 homes and the creation of 50,000 jobs by 2016.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.10/2">The Government are concerned by the growing number of people being admitted to hospital as a result of alcohol misuse, and is determined to tackle this. As stated in the 2004 Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England, the Government are committed to reviewing the current strategy this year. We intend to identify what future action is required to help the majority of the population to stay within sensible drinking limits and to make those drinking at levels likely to cause harm to their health more aware of the risks. The responsibilities of the alcohol industry, consumers, and Government will each be part of the review.</p>

The order was made following advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Medicines Commission that kava kava poses a rare but serious risk of liver toxicity. Similar action was taken in relation to kava kava in foods. The Guernsey authorities have investigated the supply of kava kava by a company apparently based on that island.

	<p pid="a.1001W.2/2">There are no special legislative restrictions on the sale or supply of the hormone melatonin. Unless it is being supplied as an unlicensed medicine in accordance with the relevant statutory controls, a medicinal product containing melatonin requires a marketing authorisation before it may be lawfully sold or supplied. The status of melatonin under medicines legislation was first considered in 1989. The MHRA is unaware of any implication for public health by the classification of melatonin as a medicinal product. The MHRA refers complaints about the sale and supply of melatonin from the Channel Islands to the relevant regulatory authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.1007W.5/1">The Government consider that decision-making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional or complementary/alternative treatments, have to be a matter for local national health service providers and practitioners as they are best placed to know their community's needs. In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of any treatments, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend. If they are unconvinced about the suitability of a particular treatment, they cannot be made to refer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1015W.2/1">In the future, each person using the national health service will have an electronic NHS care record which will be made up of detailed care records, held locally by the NHS body that provides care to the patient, and a summary care record. At the local level detailed care records will be built up over time into a comprehensive health and care history.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/2">The objective of sealing, and sealing and locking information is to reduce the number of people who might otherwise feel the need to opt-out completely of having a summary care record because of their concern about only a small amount of sensitive information in their record. It will be open to any patient to ask to limit access to such information, including to request that specific sensitive information is accessible only with their consent. The sealed envelopes approach has the confidence of the professions in being able to provide appropriate controls for the support of patient confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/3">It is not possible to predict with any certainty how many people may in future choose to exercise this option as this will be the first time such an approach has ever been used. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that only a small minority would have concerns about the content of their medical records that would lead to their choosing to seal information. In response to a Consumer Association Survey (October 2002) question on this subject 60 per cent. of respondents said that they would remove nothing, around a quarter (24 per cent.) said they would remove a little, and around four per cent, said they would remove &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;all&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/4">This is paralleled by the available evidence about the likelihood of people to opt out of having a summary care record at all. The Scottish emergency care summary, which extracts data from general practitioners' records and hospital notes, currently contains records for nearly 4.93 million patients and less than 500 have opted out. Similarly, in the course of a consultation on establishing an electronic health record in the Wirral, of patients invited to opt out if they had concerns, only 25 opted out whilst 350,000 records were uploaded. And of the 1.3 million patients likely to be affected by a similar proposal in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, only some 1,150 decided not to have their records included in the data repository.</p>

We have introduced a number of interventions to help the national health service. Between April 2003 and March 2004 and October 2005 to September 2006, there has been a 10.2 per cent. reduction in the 12-month rolling total.

	<p pid="a.1020W.8/1">The first elements of the national health service care records service, to provide a transaction messaging service, a personal demographics service, a spine directory service and secure access controls via smartcards, went live on time and to budget in July 2004. Since then very substantial progress has been, and continues to be, made and the NHS is already effectively dependent on systems and services delivered through the national programme for the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Over 38 million patients can now benefit from Choose and Book, and over 2.7 million bookings have been made to date, with daily bookings now exceeding 18,000. Over 13.5 million prescription messages have been issued electronically, with the daily count exceeding 100,000. 73 picture archiving and communications systems have been implemented, and around 160,000 patients are treated each week using the technology. Through the new national broadband network (N3), 98 per cent. of general practitioners practices now have a broadband connection. NHS mail currently has over 230,000 registered users, each with an email address for life, sending a million e-mails per day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1020W.8/2">The national programme is being delivered by the Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency. The value of contracts let for the core components of the programme amounts to &pound;6.2 billion over 10 years. The National Audit Office have calculated that the full gross cost of the programme including national contracts and legitimately approved additions, other central expenditure, and local implementation costs is some &pound;12.4 billion at 2004-05 prices. However, this figure does not take into account anticipated savings in the price paid by the NHS for information technology goods and services due to the central buying power of NHS Connecting for Health, or in NHS staff time saved through using the programme's systems and services. The National Audit Office also acknowledge an independent evaluation that confirms that &pound;4.5 billion has been saved by central rather than local procurement, and also acknowledges a further &pound;860 million of savings achieved through centrally negotiated enterprise wide arrangements.</p>

In addition, over 16,000 local systems, with well over 300,000 users, have now been delivered across the NHS by the programme's five local service providers supporting accident and emergency units, hospital theatres, mental health and pathology services, and many others.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022W.0/1">The spine is the colloquial name given to the national database of key information about patients' health and care. It forms the core of the national health service care records service (NHS CRS). It also supports other key elements of the national programme for information technology, such as choose and book, the electronic prescriptions service (EPS), and 'GP to GP' record transfer, each of them using the spine's messaging capabilities as part of their own services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.0/2">The contract to set up and operate the spine under the national programme for information technology in the national health service is held by BT. Accounting information does not separately identify costs incurred in respect of the individual spine applications, and the information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.0/3">Up to <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-31">31 December 2006</phrase> total expenditure under the contract amounted to &pound;310.7 million, made up of &pound;232.8 million in set-up costs, and &pound;77.9 million in revenue costs. Set-up (capital) costs are incurred in phases as functionality is added to the spine through staged software releases over the implementation period. The ongoing service (revenue) costs average around &pound;45 million a year, although this will fall in a range between &pound;30-60 million in any particular year. These sums are in line with the contracted value of the work concerned, which is some &pound;620 million over nine years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.0/4">On a typical working day the spine database is accessed by around 50,000 authenticated unique users, and processes; approximately 1.3 million personal demographic service queries, 16,000 choose and book bookings, and over 100,000 electronic prescription messages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.0/5">Growth in these volumes is rising dramatically with the increase in functionality across the NHS CRS and continuing roll out of the various elements of the system. The spine is already the world's biggest structured healthcare messaging system whose cost represents an investment of no more than about one pound per NHS patient per year over the life of the contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022W.3/1">Existing national health service information technology (IT) systems and databases are typically incompatible with each other. They have frequently been designed around the specific requirements of individual NHS organisations, and therefore do not support the transfer of information, sometimes even within a single trust, or elsewhere in the NHS. These shortcomings can result in clinical decisions taken on the basis of incomplete or inaccurate information leading to suboptimal quality of care, avoidable inconvenience to patients and doctors, and additional administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.3/2">By contrast, the defining characteristic of the national programme for IT is provision of fully integrated systems that are interoperable, and ensure transmissibility of patient data across organisational boundaries. The national infrastructure will also speed up and make more certain the processes of identifying and contacting patients. This is becoming increasingly important as care becomes de-centralised from hospitals and takes place closer to, and in, patients' homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.3/3">More than 50 existing systems from a range of care settings&mdash;general practice, acute hospitals, independent sector providers, and community pharmacies&mdash;have already been accredited to interact with national programme services such as choose and book, the electronic prescription service, the secondary uses service, and the general practice electronic records transfer system. The necessary development and upgrading of these existing systems has been coordinated by the existing systems programme of the Department's NHS Connecting for Health Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1023W.2/1">Deployment of new hospital systems under the national programme for information technology involves several key stages between initial preparation for implementation through to go live, during which a number of important organisational and technical activities have to be completed, including planning, training, testing and clinical safety assessments. All the stages in the run-up to completion of go live involve some transfer of data from legacy systems to local service provider systems, though legacy systems remain live and in service until the process is complete. These arrangements are quite typical of major information technology systems deployments in both the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.2/2">The process will normally take several weeks, involving anything between 0.5 million and up to 10 million records. The time scale in each particular case is dependent on a number of factors, largely to do with the size of the trust and any complexities identified during data migration. These might include difficulties in collating data from legacy systems, or the need to incorporate specific local requirements late in the process of implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.2/3">Systems deployed under the national programme are now in place in every acute trust, and in some 98 per cent. of general practices. Almost 17,000 systems have now been delivered with around 330,000 national health service users. New systems are supplied every week to support one or more of patient administration, theatre management, accident and emergency and mental health unit, ambulance services, pathology services, and many more.</p>

	<p pid="a.1024W.0/1">There is no specific numerical target for year-on-year spending by national health service organisations on local implementation of the national programme for information technology. Each NHS organisation is free, and expected, to use its resources in the way that delivers the best possible value for money. However, evidence from the Department's most recent (2006) survey of investment in information management and technology in the NHS shows that the combined total of current and predicted future local NHS and central spending reflects significant progress towards the level anticipated in the 2002 Wanless Report &quot;Securing our Future Health&quot; as being necessary to deliver the breadth and quality of healthcare services envisaged in the report. Detailed information from the 2006 survey is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.0/2">Any costs associated with implementation of the national programme locally are very significantly outweighed by the savings accrued from participation in the programme. Most notably, an independent industry analysis has concluded that some &pound;4.5 billion has been saved by aggregate central procurement rather than local procurement, a figure confirmed by independent industry analysts. In addition, savings have been achieved in the prices paid by the NHS for information technology goods and services due to the central buying power of NHS Connecting for Health, as well as in NHS staff time saved through using the programme's systems and services. The National Audit Office have acknowledged savings of &pound;860 million achieved through centrally-negotiated enterprise wide arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1024W.3/1">The alternative to a central database for patient records has existed and continues to exist in the status quo prior to the inception of the national programme for information technology. It is characterised by information technology (IT) that does not support the transfer of information between systems, encourages the creation of multiple records for the same patient within a single organisation, tolerates the loss and delay of records during their slow transit by hand, the unavailability of key information when needed, and the compromise of security and confidentiality of patient data. These shortcomings regularly result in clinical decisions taken on the basis of incomplete or inaccurate information, suboptimal quality of care, avoidable inconvenience to patients and doctors, and additional administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.3/2">Running the national health service on that basis would have an enormous negative impact on both the quality and cost of care including medication errors; patient procedures being cancelled due to lost X-ray films; out-patient appointments not being kept because patients have little or no say over their date and time; and, because records cannot be located, countless patients being subjected to unnecessary repeat diagnostic procedures, and hundreds of millions of pounds a year to be wasted on uncontested clinical negligence claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.3/3">As for costs, as a result of the national programme some &pound;4.5 billion has been saved by aggregate central procurement of systems rather than local procurement, and a further &pound;860 million of savings achieved through centrally negotiated enterprise-wide arrangements. Before the national programme, money was devolved locally for investment against agreed national targets for electronic health records systems, an arrangement which both the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee have severely criticised because the money was often not spent as intended, but diverted to meet other NHS priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.3/4">The national programme, with the spine database at its core, is not just about IT. It is a transformation programme for the NHS that will underpin system reform. Only a ubiquitous, effective, national IT system of the kind it is putting in place across the NHS can deliver key reforms such as patient choice, the 18-week referral to treatment patient pathway, whilst at the same time retaining flexibility to adapt to, and adopt, future policy.</p>
