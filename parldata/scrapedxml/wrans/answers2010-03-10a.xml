	<p pid="a.308W.0/1">DWP lead the Government's response to some of the biggest issues facing the country-welfare and pension reform-and are a key player in tackling child poverty<sup>(1)</sup>. As the biggest delivery department in the UK, DWP makes a difference to millions of people every day, helping them to lead safer, fairer and more rewarding lives that are free from poverty. We want to give people more choice and control over their lives and are committed to providing greater choice and personalised support to everyone who needs it so they have the opportunity to get into and remain in work. We believe that work works. Even in economically challenging times we know that work works for the most vulnerable and the disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/2" class="italic"> Support to find work</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since January 1998, the number of people unemployed in Great Grimsby has increased by 8 per cent. to 4,704, but the number unemployed for more than one year has decreased by 37 per cent. to 745. From August 1997 to August 2009 the number of lone parents claiming income support in Great Grimsby has decreased by 15 per cent. to 1,950.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/4">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Since their inception over 2.2 million people in Great Britain have found work with the support of the new deal, and 6,820 have been helped in Great Grimsby.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/5" class="italic"> Support for children</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/6">We introduced a target to halve child poverty by 2010-11 on the way to eradicating it by 2020. Poverty is measured using a headline indicator of the proportion of children in households with an income below 60 per cent. of contemporary household median income before housing costs. This is in line with international best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/7">Statistics on the numbers of children living in poverty are not available at the constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/8" class="italic"> Support for older people</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/9">Since 1997 our strategy has been to target help on the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/10">This year we will be spending over &#163;13 billion more on pensioners than if we had continued with the policies that were in place in 1997. Around half of that money will go to the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/11">In 1997 the poorest pensioners, who received income support, lived on &#163;69 a week (&#163;98 in today's prices). Today pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, means no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;130 a week, &#163;198.45 for couples. As of August 2009 6,670 pensioners in Great Grimsby are benefiting from pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/12">In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners living in relative poverty in UK compared to 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs).</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/13">Statistics on the proportion of pensioners living in relative poverty are not available at the constituency level. But the latest data for the Yorkshire and the Humber Government office region show that the proportion of pensioners in poverty (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs) fell from 32 per cent. to 18 per cent. since 1997<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/14">Pensioners in the UK also benefit from a range of additional support such as the winter fuel payment which this winter is worth &#163;250 for households with someone aged between 60 to 79 and &#163;400 for households with someone aged 80 or over. These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than &#163;60 million per year was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-we now spend around &#163;2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In winter 2008-09 (the last winter for which information is available) 16,720 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Great Grimsby.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/15">We have also taken steps to strengthen and protect the private pensions system to ensure people can continue to have confidence to save for their future through the establishment of the Pensions Protection Fund, the financial assistance scheme and a more powerful and proactive pensions regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/16">The protection system ensures that, unlike in 1997, people aren't left without a pension even in the event that their employer becomes insolvent.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/17">In total 2,338 people in the Yorkshire and Humber Region are receiving compensation from the Pension Protection Fund (data not available at constituency level)<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/18">We have also taken forward a radical package of pension reforms in the Pensions Acts of 2007 and 2008 which will deliver a fairer and more generous state pension and extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/19">The state pension reforms begin to come into effect from 2010 and will mean around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to qualify for a full basic state pension compared to half without reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/20" class="italic"> Support for disabled people and carers</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/21">Since 2001, we have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Great Grimsby will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents who are entitled to state support, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. This will be trailblazed in eight local authority sites from late 2010. Older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.0/22" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The Department for Work and Pensions was created in 2001 and so information relates to the Department and its predecessors.</p>

	<p pid="a.314W.3/1">The definition of a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) for housing purposes is contained in section 254 of the Housing Act 2004. An HMO is an entire house or flat which is let to three or more tenants who form two or more households and who share a kitchen, bathroom or toilet. Local authorities are under a statutory duty to license HMOs of three or more storeys housing five or more persons forming two or more households. There are no planned changes to the Housing Act 2004 definition of a HMO.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.3/2">Currently planning legislation neither defines 'multiple occupation' nor HMOs as such but relies on the concept of a 'single household' and a 'family' in making distinctions for land use purposes. HMOs are unclassified by the Use Classes Order (UCO) and are therefore sui generis. Therefore as a general rule planning permission will be needed before a dwelling house could undergo a material change of use to a HMO. The current UCO uses six persons as its 'trigger' point.</p>

This will be the same as that included in section 254 of the Housing Act 2004 with some minor amendments to reflect planning concerns.</p>

	<p pid="a.317W.6/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/2" class="italic"> International Subscriptions</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/3">We amend our forecasts for the costs of the UK's international subscriptions throughout the year, both to take account of exchange rate movements and as we negotiate the budgets for each organisation for the year ahead (a number of international organisations, including the United Nations (UN) and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), agree budgets for calendar years rather than the UK financial year). As payments are made in the local currency of each organisation at different times of the year, and as the effect of exchange rate movements is only one of the factors in our forecasts for these payments, it is not possible to calculate the effect of exchange rate movements alone on the changes to the forecast since my response of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-03-26.598"><i> Official Report,</i> column 598W</phrase>, without incurring disproportionate cost. Our overall aim is to negotiate and limit any proposed increases to zero real growth in local currency terms for each organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/4">I have provided below our latest forecasts for the overall costs of international subscriptions. These forecasts remain subject to change in the light of continuing exchange rate movements.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/5" class="italic"> (i) 2009-10</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/6">The current forecast cost of the UK's international subscriptions in 2009-10 is &#163;175 million, an update on the forecast cost of &#163;193 million quoted in my response of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/7">As I explained in my response of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase>, for international subscriptions the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has a cost-sharing agreement with HM Treasury (HMT) where HMT will cover 60 per cent. of the additional funds required over &#163;102 million. Therefore the forecast cost to the FCO of the UK's international subscriptions in 2009-10 is &#163;131 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/8">The change in this forecast since my <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> response is due to successful FCO negotiations to limit the growth of the UK's contributions, including to the UN, combined with exchange rate movements over that period. (My response of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> quoted forecasts made before final UK contributions were agreed with NATO and the UN for calendar year 2010.) The cost sharing agreement with HMT means that 40 per cent. of the saving benefits the FCO's budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/9" class="italic"> (ii) 2010-11</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/10">The forecast cost for international subscriptions in 2010-11 is &#163;178 million. Based on the agreement with HMT, the FCO's share of this forecast cost is &#163;132 million. This forecast is likely to change as a result of exchange rate movements and the renegotiation of subscriptions as they come up for renewal.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/11" class="italic"> Peacekeeping</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/12" class="italic"> (i) 2009-10</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/13">The assessed peacekeeping costs in 2009-10 are forecast to be &#163;375 million, an update on the forecast cost of &#163;456 million quoted in my <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> response. The change in this forecast is due to savings achieved by the FCO through negotiations in international forums, in particular at the UN in June 2009, as well as exchange rate movements since March 2009. We currently estimate that these exchange rate movements will account for around &#163;9 million of the savings on the previous forecast, subject to final payments which are yet to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/14">Under current arrangements, the first &#163;374 million of assessed peacekeeping costs are met by HMT. Costs above that and, since April 2009, non-assessed peacekeeping costs as well, are borne by the FCO, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development from the conflict pools and/or from within departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/15" class="italic"> (ii) 2010-11</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.6/16">As my response of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> noted in relation to 2009-10 costs, UN peacekeeping assessed costs for 2010-11 will not be agreed by the UN General Assembly until June 2010. We are finalising peacekeeping budget arrangements for 2010-11 and will announce these in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.329W.2/1">The maintenance of local roads in England is a matter for each local highway authority. It is for each individual authority to assess which parts of its network are in need of repair and what standards should be applied, based upon their local knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/2">This Department endorses Well Maintained Highways, the code of practice for highway maintenance published by the UK Roads Liaison Group (UKRLG). The code of practice is available free on the UKRLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org">www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org</a></p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/4">The code advises local authorities to establish an inspection regime for their highways, and recommends inspection intervals for the various categories of highways.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/5">The Local Government Association have written to the Department requesting that funding be provided to local authorities to repair damage that they consider was caused by the 2009-10 winter. 13 authorities have also formally raised this issue. The Department is considering this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/6">The Highways Agency is responsible for the maintenance of the strategic road network in England. The Agency has a road maintenance programme to ensure that carriageway maintenance is carried out at the optimum time, to minimise deterioration in the condition of the road and damage caused by severe weather, while delivering value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/7">It is inevitable however that the recent severe weather will, in a small number of locations, cause a deterioration in the road surface condition. The Highways Agency does not however separately identify or estimate the additional maintenance costs directly associated with severe weather. The Agency's experience is that such costs are likely to reflect only a relatively minor part of the overall maintenance expenditure. Safety related defects such as potholes are treated promptly as part of the Agency's maintenance policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.329W.2/8">The Department, the Highways Agency and local authorities together with the Devolved Administrations, through the UKRLG, consider the need for research, and development of guidance and policy on all aspects of road maintenance. The Highways Agency and local authorities also meet with material suppliers to identify the need for new materials and the evaluation and performance of existing pavement materials, including those used for repairs.</p>

	<p pid="a.330W.0/1">The Highways Agency does not purchase salt directly. This is the responsibility of its contracted service providers, as part of their routine requirement to deliver the winter service to keep the strategic network safe and open during severe winter weather. Consequently the Highways Agency does not keep records on where its service providers have purchased salt and cannot therefore confirm if any overseas salt has been purchased during the last 12 years. Notwithstanding this, as a result of the national salt shortages experienced over the last two winters, the Highways Agency has helped facilitate the importation of overseas salt to its service providers. In 2008-09 season, the Highways Agency helped to import approximately 58,000 tonnes of salt from overseas sources, with a further 127,000 tonnes imported in the 2009-10 winter season.</p>

	<p pid="a.334W.3/5">In Stroud people are benefiting from this investment. Over the second half of 2009, nearly 430 people moved off of the claimant count each month on average. The claimant count fell for three consecutive months from September and now stands at nearly 5 per cent. below its August level. Long-term unemployment at the beginning of 2010 is nearly 65 per cent. lower than in 2000.</p>

These programmes address all serving personnel; there are also additional measures in place to assist commanding officers in countering the potential danger to their people. The sale of alcohol and individual consumption limits are regulated particularly, but not only, when personnel are serving operationally. These controls are supported by disciplinary measures where necessary. Individuals identified as being at risk receive counselling and welfare support. This can include attendance on preventative early intervention programmes designed to alert them to the harm that alcohol can cause to themselves and others. More serious cases are treated through specialist medical and psychological treatment and rehabilitation, including where appropriate as inpatients.</p>

This estimate of the total amount that will be payable, from Crown resources, over the next 70 to 80 years in respect of pension benefits already earned by some one million current and former service personnel.

However, they all receive a mandatory resettlement brief and a one-to-one resettlement interview within their unit before they discharge. These cover advice on accessing reemployment services such as Jobcentre Plus, advice on housing, the assistance available from ex-service welfare organisations and information about preserved pensions and compensation rights. If, as part of this process, an individual is deemed to be vulnerable to social exclusion then some specialist support is also provided by service resettlement advisors.</p>

JHC operational harmony guidelines are for crews to serve four periods at home for every one in theatre. The Merlin Mk1 is operated by the Royal Navy (RN), whose harmony guidelines state that no individual should exceed 660 days separated service over a rolling three year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.5/3">No Merlin Mk1, Mk3 or Chinook pilots are breaching harmony guidelines. However, 33 per cent. of pilots within the Apache force are not meeting harmony guidelines. This is a reflection of the rapid and successful introduction of the Apache into operational service, some three years in advance of the originally anticipated timescale.

	<p pid="a.354W.0/1">Current guidance for obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists is provided by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, (RCOG) which published its Green-top guideline No. 36 on the prevention of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcus disease in November 2003. In 2005, the RCOG, in collaboration with the National Screening Committee, established a national audit to evaluate practice in United Kingdom obstetric units against the recommendations of the guideline. The audit published in January 2007, reported that current practice followed the established patterns of care described in the RCOG guideline.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.0/2">The Department supports the Maternity Standards published by the RCOG in 2008, which state that maternity services should comply with evidence-based guidelines for the provision of high-quality clinical care.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.0/3">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guidelines for routine antenatal care, published in 2008, recommends that pregnant women should not be offered routine antenatal screening for group B streptococcus because evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness remains uncertain.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.0/4">Information for women on Group B streptococcus is contained in &quot;the Pregnancy book&quot;-a guide to health pregnancy, labour and giving birth, life with your new baby, which is given to all pregnant women during their antenatal care. A copy has already been placed in the Library. Information is also available on NHS Direct and NHS Choices website. Women who are concerned are advised to talk to their doctor or midwife.</p>

	<p pid="a.360W.2/1">The criterion for awarding senior civil servants (SCS) with performance related bonuses is set by the Prime Minister following independent advice from the senior salaries review body (SSRB). The level of payments takes into account a number of factors including individual performance against agreed priority business objectives and targets. Bonuses reward and provide incentives for in-year delivery of key results. Over the three years of SR 04 the Home Office met all its PSA objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.361W.6/1">The current underpinning assumptions used for planning purposes in preparing the cost report indicate that approximately 49 million products will be issued over the period April 2012 to March 2017 of which we expect approximately 32 million passports and 17 million identity cards. These are total product volumes, including transactions associated with the replacement of lost or damaged items, but excluding transactions that do not require product issuance, such as changes of address.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.6/2">It is Government policy that the public will be able to purchase a passport or an identity card or both. As such, the product mix of identity cards and passports depends on a number of factors including: the economic environment; the relative cost of the products to the public; and travel patterns, all of which can vary over time. The IPS cost report provides total product volumes predictions that attempt to take account of these variables and the figures given above are exactly in line with the 10-year financial projections in the October 2009 cost report.</p>

	<p pid="a.364W.7/1">Unique pupil numbers (UPN) are used to facilitate the tracking of pupils' movement and progress within the maintained school system in England. The number is allocated to each pupil according to a nationally specified formula on their first entry to school and is a unique identifier, which is intended to remain with them throughout their school career.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.7/2">The unique learner number (ULN) is a 10-digit identifier which is allocated by the Learning and Skills Council to pupils in schools in England in year 9 as they approach their 14th birthday. Pupils will retain the same ULN for accessing details of their education and skills participation and achievement through and beyond their post-14 school career.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.7/3">The Department currently holds all of the UPNs and ULNs it has collected via the School Census in the Department's national pupil database (NPD). The NPD is a longitudinal database, containing pupil and student characteristic information from the School Census, matched to attainment data at each key stage. The data held in the NPD is used to monitor achievement and participation in the education sector and also to inform, influence and improve education research and education policy. The information currently held in the NPD allows for the tracking of pupil attainment at key stage 5 with their achievement back to key stage 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.7/4">Our retention policy, including archiving data with the national archive, is currently being developed as part of gaining accreditation to ISO 27001.</p>

	<p pid="a.372W.5/1">Mandarin language skills are becoming increasingly important for the future of our economy and we wish to encourage schools to offer the language where possible. Languages will become compulsory for 7 to 11-year-olds from September 2011. The choice of which languages to teach is for schools to make. We are funding the development of the primary schools workforce to prepare for compulsory language learning, including beginning in 2010/11 a primary initial teacher training programme with a Mandarin specialism.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.5/2">Languages remain compulsory for 11 to 14-year-olds. Since 2008 we have widened the range of languages secondary schools can offer by lifting the requirement that schools must teach first a working language of the European Union. Research shows that 16 per cent. of secondary schools are now offering Mandarin Chinese either within or outside curriculum time, up from 9 per cent in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.5/3">Languages have not been compulsory for 14 to 16-year-olds since 2004. Since then, languages have been an entitlement subject and schools must offer the opportunity to learn a language to all pupils who wish to do so. While the overall numbers of entries by pupils for a GCSE in a language have declined, the number of pupils in England entered for a GCSE in Mandarin has increased by some 70 per cent. from 1,444 in 2002 to 2,448 in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.5/4">Finally, we will shortly be beginning a project to capture good practice in teaching Mandarin and about China, including bringing together in one place existing resources and considering what more might be done to promote further teaching of the language and culture of China.</p>

The Department provides capital to support this duty. From 2008-09 to 2010-11, over &#163;1.2 billion of capital funding has been allocated nationally through the Basic Need programme to local authorities for providing additional places. Basic Need funding is partly allocated on forecasts of growth in pupil numbers provided by each authority. Where providing additional places is a local priority, authorities can also use funding from other sources, including receipts, planning gains and other major schools capital programmes. In total, from 2008-09 until 2010-11, Hertfordshire has been allocated over &#163;90 million of schools capital which could be used to provide additional places where there is need.</p>

We have allocated &#163;274 million to 36 authorities. Hertfordshire did not apply for this funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.376W.5/12">The increase in the number of cases over this period reflects a sustained drive, led by the Government, to improve levels of school attendance including by encouraging local authorities to make more use of their powers to proceed against parents who are failing in their legal responsibility to ensure their children receive a full time education. The outcome has been a significant improvement in school attendance, with on average 71,800 more children attending school each day in 2007/08 than in 2000/01.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.2/1">Information showing the number of offenders found guilty at all courts and cautioned for offences of rape of a child under 13 and under 16, by age group, England and Wales, from 2006 to 2008 (latest available) is shown in tables 1 and 2 as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/2">The number of offenders cautioned for rape, by age group, England and Wales, 2004 to 2008 (latest available) is shown in table 3 as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/3">Data for 2009 are planned for publication in the autumn, 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/4">Guidance on the use of simple cautions is clear that they should not be used for serious offences. In the vast majority of serious sexual offences a caution would not be appropriate and a prosecution would be in the public interest. The decision to caution an offender for an indictable-only offence such as rape will always be taken by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/5">There will, however, always be exceptional cases in which it would not be in the interest of the victim or the public to prosecute, and in these circumstances administering a caution is considered to be preferable to taking no further action, and ensures that the offender is put on the sexual offenders' register and can be monitored. In some sexual offences cases, for example, it may be decided that the age, welfare or mental well-being of the victim or offender argues against putting them through a trial. In addition, children below the age of 13 cannot consent to sexual relations in law, and so such cases may be classified as rape even where the offence otherwise has the characteristics of a consenting sexual relationship.</p>

	<p pid="a.392W.14/1">The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) is a facility for additional lending to viable SMEs who sit on the margins of commercial lending decisions due to lack of security or track record. It enables loan facilities of between &#163;1,000 and &#163;1 million, to SMEs with a turnover of up to &#163;25 million. EFG may be used to enable new terms loans, refinancing of existing term loans, overdraft conversion, guarantees on invoice facilities, and guarantees on new or increased overdraft borrowing. Businesses are advised to approach one or more of the 44 approved EFG lenders, which includes the main UK high street banks to discuss their lending needs. However, all decisions on individual lending are at the discretion of the lender. Further details on EFG are on the BIS website:</p>

	<p pid="a.395W.2/3">The most recent estimates of take-up of maternity leave are based on the DWP &quot;Maternity Rights and Mothers' employment decisions in Britain: Survey of Mothers&quot; (2007). In 2006, when the mothers included in the study went on maternity leave, the statutory entitlement to ordinary maternity leave (OML) was 26 weeks, while mothers who had worked for their employer for a qualifying period of 26 weeks were also entitled to additional maternity leave (AML) of 26 weeks. The Office for National Statistics estimates that in 2006 there were 7,268 live births to women in the Manchester. The employment rate for women of working age (16 to 59) in Manchester in 2006 was 58.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/4">For mothers in Great Britain taking maternity leave in 2006:</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/5" class="indent">84 per cent. took 26 weeks or more maternity leave;</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/6" class="indent">35 per cent. took exactly 26 weeks maternity leave;</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/7" class="indent">46 per cent. of mothers took between 27 and 52 weeks and 3 per cent. were off for more than 52 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/8" class="indent">16 per cent. of mothers took less than the statutory minimum entitlement (ie 26 weeks in 2006)</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/9">The next &quot;Maternity Rights&quot; survey will be based on mothers who took maternity leave starting in summer 2008. It is due to report later in 2010. The &quot;Maternity Rights&quot; survey sample is not large enough to produce robust estimates at constituency or county levels.</p>
