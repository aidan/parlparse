	<p pid="c.1285W.7/1">The MOD has chosen not to adopt the specific Cycle-To-Work (C2W) scheme for Service Personnel (SP); instead it encourages greater cycle use under an equivalent scheme. Under the current arrangements eligible SP can claim a non-taxable benefit in the form of Home to Duty Travel allowance (Pedal Cycle) which reimburses them for commuting to work on bicycles. This is paid at a daily rate based upon the distance cycled. An internal review in June last year showed that this allowance is more advantageous than the likely benefits available under the C2W scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.1286W.8/1">Official entertainment is typically offered where we host foreign Defence Ministers, armed forces representatives and civilian officials in the UK to use our influence to prevent conflict, pursue UK security policy interests and enhance professional contacts. Commanding Officers may include entertainment in events for members of their unit to enhance and develop cohesiveness and team spirit. We may also include entertainment to further wider public understanding of defence, for example during an official parliamentary visit to a military unit or where we are launching a major defence initiative. Entertainment, which must be modest, usually takes the form of light refreshments, lunches, dinners or, more rarely, receptions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1287W.9/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about child maintenance, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="c.1287W.9/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many complaints he has received on the introduction of the CS2 Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.1287W.9/5" class="indent">In order to interpret the question correctly, clarification was sought from your office. They confirmed that you wanted to know (a) the overall number of complaints received since responsibility for the Child Support Agency transferred to the Commission and (b) the number of complaints received that have been specifically about the transfer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1287W.9/6" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission took responsibility for the Child Support Agency on the 1st November 2008. The latest data available shows that in the following two months a total of 4,469 complaints were received, slightly less than the figure for the same period the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1287W.9/7" class="indent">The Commission has been able to identify 18 complaints which were categorised as relating to 'Phasing/Transfer to New System', the most relevant category available. This would include complaints relating to difficulties arising from the 2003 review of the child maintenance system. Discussions with caseworkers, management and the Client Relations Director however, suggest there have been few, if any, complaints relating specifically to the transfer to the Commission.</p>

	<p pid="c.1288W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about child support, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as child support is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.1288W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what has happened to the so-called lost cases that were not transferred from the old to the new child support scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1288W.2/6" class="indent">At the end of December 2008 there were 628,200 cases on the original or old child maintenance scheme, these cases are not lost but continue to be managed by the Child Support Agency. As you will be aware, the problems encountered by the Child Support Agency following the launch of the Reforms in 2003 resulted in a decision to defer the bulk transfer of cases from the old scheme to the current child support scheme. This decision was kept under review until February 2006 when the Government asked Sir David Henshaw to review the entire system of child maintenance. His subsequent report led to the Government's White paper and to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008, which makes provision for a new system of child maintenance intended to be in place from 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.1288W.2/7" class="indent">Consequently, there will not be an opportunity to transfer cases from the original, or old, child maintenance scheme to the current scheme introduced by the reforms in 2003. Instead, we expect a new gross income statutory maintenance scheme to be introduced in 2011, and that all clients on either existing scheme will then be invited either to apply to the new gross income scheme or make a private arrangement. It is currently planned that this process will take around three years, after which both of the existing schemes will close.</p>

Anyone can write to the Listing Branch at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, 2-4 Cockspur Street, London, SW1Y 5DH requesting that a decision be reconsidered. This should be done within 28 days of notification of the listing decision.

Even though an entitlement has been transferred, the farmer receiving the entitlement may not necessarily have activated it on his SPS claim. An entitlement that has not been activated will not attract a payment for that scheme year. Therefore transfers of entitlements do not correlate directly into payments under the SPS.</p>

Overfishing of days or quotas by vessels flying the flag of other member states is a matter for the respective member states' enforcement authorities. The Marine and Fisheries Agency direct fishery protection activity, conducting inspections at sea within UK fishing limits and in UK ports to ensure that vessels from all member states are completing logbook records of their catches correctly. Most, if not all, of the other member state vessels fishing in the Bristol channel and the Celtic sea are above 15 metres in overall length. They are therefore also monitored by satellite position reports sent to the UK Fishery Monitoring Centre in the Marine and Fisheries Agency headquarters in London.</p>

	<p pid="c.1304W.8/2">Under the Water Industry Act 1991 it is for companies to propose schemes of charges and for Ofwat, as the independent economic regulator for the water industry, to approve them. Government guidance issued to Ofwat in 2000 states that surface water drainage charges for non-household customers should be set in a way that is sensitive to the actual use of the service by different types of premises and that the phasing in of any large, sudden changes in charges should be considered.</p>

The Government will continue to monitor this issue and engage further with Ofwat as necessary.</p>

	<p pid="c.1308W.0/1">A number of improvements have been made, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.1308W.0/2" class="italic"> West Coast Main Line</p>
	<p pid="c.1308W.0/3">The &pound;8.9 billion West Coast Main Line upgrade was completed and the new timetable introduced on time in December 2008. This has delivered reduced journey times, an increase in capacity by allowing 45 per cent. more long distance trains out of London Euston, and a full seven-day week fast service to the West Midlands and the North West.</p>
	<p pid="c.1308W.0/4" class="italic"> Thameslink</p>
	<p pid="c.1308W.0/5">The &pound;5.5 billion Thameslink Programme has already delivered platform extensions at Luton Airport Parkway and Mill Hill stations. Work is now underway at Blackfriars and Farringdon stations to allow 12 car trains to operate at these stations and to improve passenger circulation. Some new trains are now in passenger services on FCC routes, and the number of trains running through central London on the Thameslink route increased from eight to up to 15 per hour in peak hours. There are new journey opportunities for passengers travelling, for example between Bromley South and St. Pancras International with the introduction of additional trains on FCC routes and some Southeastern routes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1308W.0/6" class="italic"> Waterloo Ticket Gates</p>
	<p pid="c.1308W.0/7">In December 2008, on behalf of the Department, Network Rail (NR) completed the scheme to provide fully operational Automatic Ticket Gates (ATGs) on the main concourse and in the Peak Hour Subway (PHS) at Waterloo Mainline station&mdash;one of the busiest stations in London. The scheme was one of the largest of its type in Europe with 152 ATGs plus an additional 13 Wide Aisle gates being installed on the main concourse and in the PHS. The scheme is an essential element in the roll-out of Oyster and ITSO ticketing systems across the South Western network and across London.</p>

	<p pid="c.1308W.0/9">The Access for All Programme is continuing to install obstacle free, accessible routes into priority stations. 145 stations have been identified for enhancement through to 2015. 20 sites were completed in the last 12 months:</p>

			<tr pid="c.1310W.9/48"> <td colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i><br/> Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> <i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol.<br/> Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&mdash;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br/> Alcoholic gastritis<br/> Alcoholic liver disease<br/> Alcoholic myopathy<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome<br/> Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br/> Ethanol poisoning<br/> Methanol poisoning<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified<br/> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. However, admissions do not represent the number of in-patients as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/>  Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br/> Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

This top up has been maintained since 2004 with nurses and doctors also benefiting from a separate 20 per cent. civil service-wide pay increase, as well as modest yearly increases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1323W.2/2">According to data from the current financial year our assessment is that the gross pay of nurses now ranges from approximately &pound;63 a month for newly recruited nurse technicians to &pound;262 a month for Senior Nursing Officers. This compares favourably with, for example, teachers, who receive between &pound;50 and &pound;142 per month. Doctors salaries range from approximately &pound;260 to &pound;365 per month. Our assessment shows that there has been an increase of between 50 and 100 per cent. in the take home pay for doctors and nurses between 2004 and 2009. We believe that this has been a very important incentive for improved retention and morale, and has helped to reduce outward migration.</p>

Progress against the objectives of the EHRP is assessed on a bi-annual basis in national health sector reviews: Progress to date has been very encouraging, with objectives likely to be met. For example: the number of doctors graduating has increased from 17 per year in 2004 to 60 per year currently; the number of nurses leaving Malawi to work overseas has fallen from around 100 annually in 2002-04 to around 30 annually in 2007-08; and there are 40 per cent. more doctors and nurses practicing in the public health system than four years ago.</p>

DFID is commissioning this evaluation on behalf of the Ministry of Health and all other partners. It will provide valuable lessons for Malawi and also for other low-income countries with public sector human resource crises.</p>

	<p pid="c.1324W.2/2" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> More Malawian health workers are being retained within the public health system. For example, the number of nurses leaving Malawi each year has reduced from around 100 per year in 2004 to around 30 per year now. Immediate retention of nurses following training has significantly improved following the introduction of a five-year bonding scheme for nurses, with nearly all graduates now moving to the public health system. This has resulted in an improved nurse-patient ratio from one nurse per 4,000 patients in 2004 to one per 3,000 patients today. The doctor/patient ratio has improved from one per 62,000 to one per 53,000 today, and the Malawi Government is now considering how best to introduce a bonding scheme for doctors.</p>

The College of Medicine estimate that of their 254 medical graduates from 1991 to 2005, 60 per cent. are practising full-time in the public health system.</p>

	<p pid="c.1325W.0/2" class="indent">(i) In the 12 months prior to the Emergency Human Resource Programme (EHRP), in 2004, there were <i> (a)</i> approximately 140 doctors registered in Malawi, and <i> (b)</i> 3,250 nurses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1325W.0/3" class="indent">(ii) The most recent assessment was the December 2007 Human Resource for Health Census which recorded <i> (a)</i> 190 registered doctors and <i> (b)</i> 4,450 nurses, in Malawi.</p>
	<p pid="c.1325W.0/4">This assessment demonstrates a near 40 per cent. increase in doctors and nurses, nearly all of whom are full-time and practising. These numbers will continue to grow. The Malawi College of Medicine is now graduating 60 doctors a year, as opposed to 17 in 2004, and will graduate 100 doctors per year in the near future. In addition, 300 nurses now graduate every six months in Malawi, nearly all of whom are recruited and retained within the public health system.</p>

	<p pid="c.1328W.2/2">The ERO is intended to support those with short-term financial problems only. It restricts all enforcement, including the commencement of claims without leave of the court for up to 12 months where there has been a temporary, sudden and unforeseeable change in an individual's financial circumstances that leaves them unable to meet their commitments. However, as it is intended only for those with short-term problems, the court must be satisfied that there are realistic prospects of recovery, which will allow normal commitments to be met within six months, before an order can be made.</p>
	<p pid="c.1328W.2/3">In view of the strict qualifying criteria, I am not convinced that the ERO itself would provide the level of support that may be necessary for many people. Addressing financial problems at an early stage is essential in achieving a sustainable solution. The ERO was developed as one element of a package of targeted and complementary measures contained in Part 5 of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, which are designed to assist the over-indebted. These are intended to provide alternatives for those for whom the current statutory schemes, such as bankruptcy and Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs), may not be the best option.</p>

	<p pid="c.1328W.2/5">I consider that introducing the ERO in isolation would introduce a significant risk that consumers would apply for the order in inappropriate circumstances. This would lead to unnecessary pressure on the courts while also deflecting consumers from exploring more appropriate solutions and thereby, potentially, worsening their financial problems.</p>

The Information Commissioner is the independent regulator of the DPA and has stated that the video-mapping of cities does not necessarily breach the DPA. The Commissioner has confirmed that he will keep video-mapping activities under review and will consider any complaints raised.

	<p pid="c.1335W.11/1">There remain significant shortfalls in the deployment of equipment for the joint UN-African Union Hybrid Mission for Darfur (UNAMID) which limits the effectiveness of the force. There is still no pledge for either light or utility helicopters. This remains the single greatest shortfall, with six helicopters required for each of the three sectors. We continue to work closely with the UN and potential contributors, including in the UN Security Council, and call on all parties to facilitate the full and rapid deployment of UNAMID.</p>

They are required to follow up all reports of mistreatment whether they come from the individual themselves, from their friends, family or representatives, or from other sources. What form this follow up action will take will depend on the individual circumstances of the case. Most obviously, we can raise our concerns with the relevant authorities. Whatever action we take however, the objective remains the same: to end the mistreatment, and have the incident investigated and the perpetrators of any abuse brought to justice.</p>

Responsibility for their production and publication is a matter for the Department of Communities and Local Government. Under the provisions of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the UK Statistics Authority is responsible for monitoring the production and publication of all official statistics, for assessment as to whether the Code of Practice for Official Statistics has been complied with in relation to any official statistics, and for designation as National Statistics those official statistics which the Authority determines are compliant with the Code.</p>

Under section 16 of the Act, where the relevant body has not asked the Authority to assess a set of official statistics against the Code, but the Authority is of the view that it would be appropriate for it to do so, the Authority is required by the Act to notify the body accordingly and to lay a copy of the notification before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.1340W.5/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-06">6 January 2009</phrase>, the UK Statistics Authority notified the Department of Communities and Local Government that it wished to assess and determine whether the Code of Practice for Official Statistics has been complied with in respect of statistics on Council Tax Levels Set by Local Authorities. A copy of that notification was laid before Parliament. The Authority awaits a response from the Department of Communities and Local Government.</p>

The exceptions to this are the Energy Efficiency Fund and Sustainable Energy Imitative funds where the UK contribution to four fossil fuel projects financed by these funds in the last five years is &euro;864,336.

	<p pid="c.1348W.0/1">The tax credit system is specifically designed to provide additional support when people need it most, such as when income falls because of a move to working shorter hours.

	<p pid="c.1348W.0/2">Take-up of tax credits is already extremely high for people with children. People already claiming tax credits can notify HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) of their changed income and circumstances over the phone, and can then benefit quickly from any additional support they are eligible for. As announced in Budget, HMRC's tax credits marketing are now focusing on reminding people to provide up-to-date information when their circumstances change.</p>
	<p pid="c.1348W.0/3">Budget also announced an ambitious target to raise take-up of working tax credit (WTC) among people without children by 100,000 by April 2011. HMRC is expanding its work with employers to increase take-up, which currently reaches around 750,000 employees, and is working in partnership with trade unions to pass information about tax credits on to their members. In the coming year, HMRC will begin new research-driven marketing aimed at those people who stand to gain the most from taking up WTC, and will launch a pilot using data from pay-as-you-earn records to identify and contact potentially eligible people.</p>

	<p pid="c.1349W.2/1">It is not our policy to allow asylum seekers to work. The Government believe that managed migration is a valuable source of skills and labour to the British economy and there are recognised routes into the UK for those seeking to work. However, entering the country for economic reasons is not the same as seeking asylum and it is important to maintain the distinction between the two.</p>
	<p pid="c.1349W.2/2">We believe giving asylum seekers or failed asylum seekers permission to work would be likely to act as a pull factor and encourage asylum applications from those without a well founded fear of persecution, hence slowing down the processing of applications made by genuine refugees and undermining the integrity of the managed migration system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1349W.2/3">The only exception is asylum seekers who have been waiting 12 months for a decision where this delay cannot be attributed to them.</p>

This will ensure that the conditions of entry are closely monitored for those who are subject to immigration control.</p>

This same requirement only applies to the modification of buildings where this leads to the creation a separate dwelling or non-domestic unit that has heating, hot water or air conditioning. Enforcement of this requirement is a matter for local authority building control.</p>

	<p pid="c.1368W.6/1">The net increase in the numbers of dwellings in the South East region in 2007-08 was 35,407, 33,398 of which were newly built homes. A figure for 2008-09 is not yet available, although latest figures show 21,600 new homes were completed in the first nine months of 2008-09. The Government do not make projections of future housing delivery. The housing provision for the South East in RPG is 28,050 dwellings per annum, with an additional 1,500 from partial reviews of the Growth Areas of Milton Keynes and Aylesbury Vale and Ashford.</p>

Eastbourne's Borough Plan 2001-11 sets a target for the provision of 75 affordable housing units per annum representing just over 20 per cent. of the total allocation.

	<p pid="c.1372W.8/2">As my previous answer stated, in January 2009 we consulted on changes to the revenue and capital financing rules that would enable local authorities to apply for new specified properties to be excluded from the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system and thereby keep the full rental income from such properties and the full capital receipt should the property be in future sold (especially under the Right to Buy over which the local authority would have no control). This would provide greater freedom and flexibility for local authorities to build new properties using their own resources.

	<p pid="c.1376W.8/1">Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Note 15 (Planning and the Historic Environment) already advises that the outstanding international importance of a World Heritage Site is a key material consideration to be taken into account by planning authorities in determining planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.8/2">An amendment to the General Permitted Development Order in October 2008 conferred special protection on World Heritage Sites by removing permitted development rights for certain types of minor development which could, on a cumulative basis, have an adverse effect on the outstanding universal value of a World Heritage Site.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.8/3">Under the terms of the Town and Country Planning (Consultation) (England) Direction 2009, planning authorities are required to consult the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government before approving any planning application made on or after <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-20">20 April 2009</phrase> to which English Heritage maintains an objection and which would have an adverse impact on the outstanding universal value, integrity, authenticity and significance of a World Heritage Site or its setting. The Secretary of State then has the discretion to call-in the application for her own determination if she considers it appropriate to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.8/4">World Heritage Sites are 'sensitive areas' for the purposes of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) regulations. Local planning authorities must therefore require EIA to be carried out for any development proposal in or partly in a World Heritage Site if they think it is likely to have significant environmental effects.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.8/5">The Government consulted last year on a draft planning circular, and accompanying guidance prepared by English Heritage, which will further recognise in national policy the need to protect World Heritage Sites as sites of Outstanding Universal Value. These are being revised in the light of consultation responses and final versions should be published by the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.8/6">In addition, the Government have announced their intention to consult on a revision to planning policy on heritage protection (PPGs 15 and 16) soon. This will provide a further opportunity to comment on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.1381W.2/1">We have no plans to strengthen the inclusion of horticulture in local development frameworks and regional spatial strategies. 'Planning Policy Guidance note 17: Planning for Open Space, Sport and Recreation, 2002' (PPG17) already states that local planning authorities should make robust assessments of the needs of their communities for all open spaces of public value, which, by definition, includes parks and gardens, allotments, and city (urban) farms.</p>
	<p pid="c.1381W.2/2">Local authorities should use the information gained from their assessments of needs and opportunities to set locally derived standards for the provision of open space. These should form the basis for addressing the amount and quality of open space through the planning process. PPG17 also states that standards should be included in development plans, i.e. local development frameworks and regional spatial strategies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1381W.2/3">In March this year, CLG contributed &pound;1 million to the cost of training and employment for the first year of 60 additional horticultural apprenticeship places in some of the most deprived urban local authorities. This action complements CABE Space's work to raise skills across the green space sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.1381W.5/1">In 1995 English Heritage established a Register of Historic Battlefields, which contains 43 important sites. Of these, eight were identified as being at high risk in the 2008 Heritage at Risk Register, with pressure from development being the most common risk. The Government do not maintain detailed information about developments on individual battlefields, though we are aware that certain sites (such as Worcester and Stamford Bridge) have had substantial development. The effect of proposed development on a registered site is a material consideration to be taken into account in determining planning applications. It is also open to local planning authorities to designate as a conservation area any part of their area which has special historic interest and whose character or appearance it is desirable to preserve or enhance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1391W.2/1">Since September 2007 the revised professional standards for teachers provide clear career pathways for teachers from Qualified Teacher Status to Advanced Skill Teachers. These clarify what is expected at each career stage, including expectations about teachers' ongoing engagement in their own continuing professional development (CPD) and make clear that teachers are expected to teach challenging, well organised lessons and sequences of lessons across the age range they teach in which they, for example, use an appropriate range of teaching strategies and resources, including e-learning, which meet learners' needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1391W.2/2">To support the professional standards we introduced revised and robust performance management arrangements in September 2007 which ensure that teachers' performance is regularly reviewed and that all teachers have clear and robust development plans which take account of their own individual needs and the school's improvement priorities. Teachers play a key role in this process through engaging with their line mangers to agree their professional development plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.1391W.2/3">In this way teachers are fully involved in identifying potential training professional development needs and work within their schools to access the appropriate training.</p>
	<p pid="c.1391W.2/4">It is, of course, for schools to determine how to spend the funding they allocate for staff professional development from the delegated budgets they receive.</p>
