	<p pid="d.1W.3/1">Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.3/2">Stockport MBC initially declared AQMAs for nitrogen dioxide (NO <sub>2</sub> ) and particles (PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> ) in December 2001. It was subsequently predicted that the national objective for particles would not in fact be exceeded in Stockport. A new AQMA declaration in July 2005 replaced the 2001 declaration, and relates to nitrogen dioxide only. The AQMA covers single roads and groups of roads and areas close to them across the borough, including some in the north of the borough, in the Denton and Reddish constituency. Stockport MBC, in conjunction with the other Greater Manchester local authorities, produced a joint air quality action plan (linked with the Greater Manchester Local Transport Plan) which was publicly consulted upon in June 2004; my Department also commented on the plan. The action plan includes a range of both Greater Manchester-wide and borough-specific measures. Stockport are now engaged in implementing measures to work towards meeting the air quality objectives. The measures are aimed at traffic reduction and modal shift from cars to other forms of transport and include park and ride/walk schemes, green travel plans, and quality bus corridors. In the most recent Greater Manchester Air Quality Action Plan Progress Report (2005), Stockport MBC reported that they were on schedule in implementing the majority of their borough-specific measures.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.3/3">Greater Manchester authorities are now working closely with transport planners in finalising the new Local Transport Plan (LTP) which is due by the end of March 2006. Including measures within the LTP should also help increase the capacity to deliver cleaner air within the AQMAs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.3/4">The Government are also currently undertaking a review of the air quality strategy to identify potential new additional measures to move us closer to meeting the air quality objectives and generate cost-effective health benefits.</p>

	<p pid="d.2W.2/2">Stockport MBC submitted their last Updating and Screening Assessment in November 2003. Stockport subsequently carried out a Detailed Assessment in respect of nitrogen dioxide and particles (PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> ), which was submitted to my Department in December 2004, and they submitted a Progress Report in May 2005. In light of the conclusions of the Detailed Assessment, Stockport amended their AQMA declaration in July 2005. The AQMA was enlarged with respect to nitrogen dioxide, but the particles objective was removed from the declaration. The AQMA covers single roads and groups of roads and areas close to them across the borough, including some in the north of the borough, within the Denton and Reddish constituency. As part of their review and assessment work, Stockport MBC continue to monitor nitrogen dioxide at roadside locations in the north of the borough.</p>

	<p pid="d.2W.5/1">The following figures are available on the use of new powers introduced under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 for tackling enviro-crime:</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/2">Sections 40&ndash;41 introduced the power for local authorities to shut noisy premises for up to 24 hours in order to address or prevent a public nuisance. We do not have information on how many times this power has been used.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/3">Section 42 removed the requirement for local authorities to adopt the Noise Act 1996 and provide a specific level of noise service before the Noise Act 1996 could be used. In 2004&ndash;05, one fixed penalty notice was issued by local authorities in England for night noise offences.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/4">Sections 43&ndash;47 introduced new fixed penalty notices for graffiti and flyposting. In 2004&ndash;05, 19 fixed penalties were issued by local authorities in England for graffiti offences and 57 for fly-posting.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/5">Sections 48&ndash;52 introduced a power for local authorities to issue Graffiti Removal Notices requiring the clean-up of property defaced by graffiti; however, these powers have so far been available only in 12 pilot areas and the Government are not aware of any notices having been issued. This is largely due to the establishment of partnership arrangements in these areas for dealing with graffiti defacement.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/6">Section 54 made it an offence to sell aerosol paints to under 16-year-olds. No records of prosecutions under s.54 of the Act were notified for 2003 and 2004. Statistics for 2005 will be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/7">Section 55 extended certain enforcement powers to local authorities for use when investigating fly-tipping offences. No national data are collected on how frequently these powers are used as this is a matter for local authorities based on local enforcement policies. There is anecdotal evidence, however, that local authorities have been using these powers, particularly the stop and search powers, and that they have been extremely helpful to them when dealing with fly-tipping offences.</p>

	<p pid="d.3W.2/1">Defra has issued extensive guidance to all bird keepers, including specific guidance for zoos, on the biosecurity measures that will protect their birds from avian influenza.</p>
	<p pid="d.3W.2/2">We have also planned for a possible preventive vaccination programme against avian influenza for zoo birds in the UK, for conservation purposes. This will be based on a veterinary risk assessment. As part of our planning, we have ordered 2.3 million doses of vaccine as a contingency reserve for zoo birds.</p>
	<p pid="d.3W.2/3">However, at the present level of risk, currently available vaccines do not make vaccination effective or efficient. A high standard of biosecurity, separation from wild birds and careful surveillance for signs of disease are the most effective means of prevention.</p>

	<p pid="d.8W.3/1">DFID recognises that no serious strategy for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) can fail to address gender equality and women's empowerment as a central concern. We are committed to full implementation of the Beijing declaration and platform for action, and DFID participated in the review of progress on implementation of Beijing commitments which took place at the UN's 'Beijing plus 10' conference last spring. This meeting noted that progress had been made in improving the status of women and girls since the original conference in 1995 but that this progress had not been even across all areas and regions, and that considerable challenges remained. The conference called for strengthened efforts to implement the Beijing platform for action including critical areas such as health, education, tackling gender-based violence, economic empowerment and decision-making. The meeting also underlined the linkages between implementation of the Beijing commitments and achievement of the MDGs. These messages were reiterated by UN heads of state at the Millennium Review Summit in September.</p>
	<p pid="d.8W.3/2">As well as support to international processes, DFID is working to ensure that gender issues are made a priority area across our programme and that developing country partners integrate gender into their own national plans. DFID also supports specific activities to promote the rights of women and girls, including in the areas of girls' education, maternal mortality and reproductive health.</p>

The scheme includes an anemometer to monitor wind speeds and update the settings of the diversion signs.</p>
	<p pid="d.13W.2/2">The current scheme was not commissioned until January 2006 and the resurfacing scheme was completed in August/September 2005. As the resurfacing scheme was to the west of junction 38 and the current scheme is to the east of junction 37, they could not be completed at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="d.15W.6/2">The first extant records of the collection date from 1898. Because of the uncertainty surrounding many of the old manual records no exact figure can be given for the number of missing works. Currently 636 are listed as missing. These are mostly prints of relatively low value. Analysis of the records of missing works indicate that most of the losses occurred before the early 1990s. A large proportion of these were reported as missing in the late 1980s as a result of improvements in recording. It is likely that most of these losses had happened many years earlier but had not been reported at the time. The completion of a decade-long period of computerisation of records and employment of a professional museum register in1991 has led to a radical improvement in inventory control and resultant reduction in missing works.

	<p pid="d.17W.2/3">The foundation will have its own separate and unique identity, reflecting the innovative approach that it will take to securing extra investment in grass roots sport. In order that it should be operated as efficiently as possible, and to minimise administrative costs, I have decided that the foundation will use as much of Sport England's existing infrastructure as possible, including staffing, premises and their regional network. The Regional Sports Boards will play a key role in this delivery framework both in helping to identify new sources of funding and in ensuring that funding decisions match our strategic priorities for increasing participation in sport and physical activity.</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.2/4">My officials are working closely with Sport England to ensure that a robust governance structure will have been agreed upon prior to next month's launch. Key to these considerations is ensuring that we maximise the levels of new investment in grass roots and community sport.</p>

	<p pid="d.21W.2/1">D Notices were replaced by the Defence Advisory (DA) Notice system in 1993. The DA Notice system is overseen by the Defence Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee (DPBAC), a joint government/media body. The five standing DA Notices approved by the Committee (see <a href="http://www.dnotice.org.uk">www.dnotice.org.uk</a>) provide the media with guidance on the areas of national security that need to be protected; they also provide the basis for prior negotiation in cases of dispute. The DA Notice code is purely voluntary and is not supported by any form of legal sanction. The five standing DA Notices are used by the DPBAC Secretary&mdash;who administers the system on a day-to-day basis&mdash;to provide further guidance to the media or officials about reporting on specific events or circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.21W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-03">3 September 2004</phrase> the then DPBAC Secretary wrote a general letter to editors on the subject of protective countermeasures used by British forces in Iraq. In it he acknowledged that it was widely known that the British forces in Iraq were employing various types of countermeasures to protect themselves against the roadside ambush techniques being used by Iraqi insurgents. He went on to advise that the publication or broadcasting of the specific details of these countermeasures would pose a real and serious danger to life&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.21W.2/3">This was followed by two other general letters issued by the DPBAC Secretary to editors (respectively <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-22">22 August</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase>) repeating and elaborating the previous advice. All of these letters were written in response to developing concerns by British commanders that the publication or broadcasting of such details risked nullifying British countermeasures and thus increasing the risks faced by members of the British forces, not only in Iraq but also in other theatres.</p>
	<p pid="d.21W.2/4">No DA Notice advice has ever been offered which attempts to restrict the reporting of complaints from families of Service personnel killed in Iraq that British Army vehicles had not been equipped with anti-roadside bomb detection and protective devices.</p>

Decisions under the civilian element of the scheme were suspended last year following a High Court judgement that the criteria for deciding whether a claimant met the nationality criteria had resulted in unlawful indirect discrimination. This judgement is the subject of an appeal by both sides that is due to be heard in the Court of Appeal early next month.</p>

The Government have always chosen not to participate, as we believe that our employment objectives are better targeted through measures such as the welfare to work strategy and New Deal, which have contributed to the 2.3 million rise in employment since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="d.34W.3/1">In its role as regulator for the gas and electricity markets, Ofgem continually undertakes market monitoring in relation to both markets to ensure that they are operating effectively. As part of this monitoring role, Ofgem has been assessing the recent trends in GB gas and electricity prices. In addition, Ofgem has held several seminars in relation to the operation of the gas and electricity markets over winter 2005&ndash;06 which examined the supply/demand fundamentals associated with the recent prices. Details of the information presented at these seminars can be found on Ofgem's website at: <a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/ofgem/work/indexjsp?section=areasofwork/wholesalemarketmonitoring/wholesalemarketmonitoring01">http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/ofgem/work/indexjsp?section=areasofwork/wholesalemarketmonitoring/wholesalemarketmonitoring01</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/2">The Government understands the tough conditions that high-energy users are operating in and we are leaving no stone unturned, working closely with industry to mitigate the situation and reduce the impact. Our discussions with the Energy Intensive Users' Group have helped us focus our efforts on maximising gas supplies, improving the operation of the market, encouraging demand-side response and pursuing fair access to markets across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/3">The Government takes the issue of the potential impact of rising prices on the number of households in fuel poverty very seriously. Government, with other interested parties, has taken a range of measures to mitigate the impact of price rises, including further assistance to elderly households through the significant additional funding of &pound;300 million to tackle fuel poverty across the UK announced in the pre-Budget report in December 2005.</p>

In addition to the provision within further education colleges, this figure also represents college provision in locations other than college sites; however information on the exact locations is not held by the Department.

	<p pid="d.51W.9/1">The Get Safe Online campaign was launched the end of October 2005. The campaign is a joint public and private sector initiative to raise awareness of the internet security and to help people to go online line safely and with confidence.</p>
	<p pid="d.51W.9/2">The Cabinet Office is a proud sponsor of the campaign alongside BT, Dell, eBay, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Message Labs, Microsoft, securetrading and Yell.com. The Home Office, DTI, NISCC (National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre) and the National Hi Tech Crime Unit&mdash;soon to be part of SOCA (Serious and Organised Crime Agency) are also involved in the project.</p>
	<p pid="d.51W.9/3">Get Safe Online is very much a collaboration amongst all these organisations. Government as well as online companies in the retail, finance and technology sectors all have an interest in ensuring that people know what to do to protect themselves, their families and their businesses whether they are shopping, banking or interacting with government online. In particular, as our Transformational Government Strategy states: Government will also play its part to promote public confidence by leading a public/private campaign on internet safety&quot;, a commitment that Get Safe Online is successfully meeting.</p>
	<p pid="d.51W.9/4">The first phase of the campaign involved a PR campaign to raise awareness of the initiative and the website. A roadshow of internet security experts was taken round the major cities stopping at UK Online centres, shopping centres, colleges and libraries as well as Age Concern centres. There was also a competition through Metro newspapers around the country. The most prolific support for the campaign has been through the sponsors themselves. For example eBay, with over 13 million UK users a month, has given exposure to Get Safe Online on its website which would have cost in excess of &pound;10 million to date.</p>
	<p pid="d.51W.9/5">This kind of campaign activity through the current sponsors will continue and we intend for the campaign to run for two to three years. A further phase of activity is planned over the next few months which entails online advertising as well as PR activity. Importantly, the initiative is gaining momentum and cooperation across community organisations and local government. Many local councils have put a link to Get Safe Online to help their cooperation from community organisations such as the NCPTA (National Council for Parent Teachers Associations) which is sending out a 'Parent's Guide' to all secondary schools which will include advice and information from Get Safe Online later this month. Work continues to recruit new sponsors and partners to the initiative which is essential to maintaining the progress of the campaign and we hope to be able to make some important announcements in the summer about future plans.</p>

The Environment Agency has produced a search that they believe meets these criteria and this is now being considered in consultation with colleagues in Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), key industry stakeholders and consumer representatives.

	<p pid="d.64W.0/2">In that statement, it was reiterated that the cost pressures arising from the temporary reinstatement of the 85 year rule in the local government pension scheme will not fall on taxpayers; and the Government's commitment that costs to local authorities from meeting their requirements under the new Licensing Act will be fully met by fees within the national fee regime, provided they are incurred legitimately and efficiently.</p>

More specifically, paragraph 27(v) of PPS1, 'Delivering Sustainable Development', advises planning authorities in preparing their development plans to seek to provide improved access for all to education, as well as to other services and facilities, by ensuring that new development is located where everyone can access these facilities without having to rely on the car.

	<p pid="d.74W.7/1">Crown Prosecutors apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors in every case to decide if there is sufficient evidence of <i>(a)</i> dangerous driving or <i>(b)</i> careless driving. What amounts to sufficient evidence will vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case, and the fact of a death, while a very important factor, is not determinative of dangerousness or carelessness in any case. National charging standards exist to assist prosecutors to make consistent and appropriate decisions according to the evidence in each case.</p>
	<p pid="d.74W.7/2">Dangerous driving can range from a prolonged and deliberate course of driving with disregard for safety of other road users to a single but serious misjudgment. Typically, careless driving will consist of more minor errors or misjudgements. In deciding between the offences, prosecutors must take into account the manner of the driving and the circumstances in which the driving took place when deciding how far the driving departed from the required standard. To prove a charge of causing death by dangerous driving, the law requires the prosecution to show that the driving fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way was dangerous. To prove careless driving it is necessary for the prosecution to establish that the driving fell below that of a reasonable, prudent and competent driver.</p>

	<p pid="d.78W.2/1">The exact causes of the illness affecting a number of children and adults in Chechnya remain unclear. There is insufficient verifiable information to make an independent assessment of the situation. Russian Press reports refer to 93 cases, mostly in schoolgirls from Shelkovsk but some also in Grozny and Urus Martan. They have displayed a variety of symptoms, particularly neurological, spasms and fits, and respiratory, breathing difficulties and nosebleeds. The Russian authorities have sent experts in toxicology and forensic psychiatry from Moscow to the region. They consider that those affected are suffering from a form of hysteria associated with the extreme and chronic stress of the Chechen conflict and its aftermath. Some non-governmental organisations in the region assess there is a toxic cause. We understand that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has experience of a similar incident involving Albanian schoolchildren in Macedonia in 2002. After investigating that incident they found no evidence of poisoning and concluded that a form of mass hysteria was a plausible explanation. The WHO has not been asked for assistance in this case but remains in contact with the Chechen authorities. We continue to monitor these cases closely.</p>

	<p pid="d.78W.5/1">Ramzan Kadyrov's appointment raises concerns in light of reports that Chechen security forces under his control have committed human rights abuses in Chechnya. This is an issue we have raised with the Russian authorities both in bilateral and EU/Russia human rights consultations, most recently during the latest round of the EU/Russia consultations in Vienna on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-03">3 March</phrase>. Ramzan Kadyrov's appointment followed soon after the visit to the region, in February this year, of UN high commissioner for human rights, Louise Arbour. Following that visit, President Putin confirmed to high commissioner Arbour Russia's readiness to put into practice her recommendations, including those on the situation in the North Caucasus. Given the influential role of the Federal authorities in Moscow in Chechen affairs and political appointments, we would want to see this commitment positively influencing Mr. Kadyrov's premiership, both in terms of respect for human rights and the strengthening of democratic institutions.</p>

	<p pid="d.79W.5/1">The security situation remains fragile in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), particularly in Ituri and the Kivus. The UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC has carried out joint operations with Congolese military to disrupt the activities of foreign armed groups, including Rwandan Hutu militias. But these groups continue to persecute civilians. There are no recent indications of cross-border conflict with Rwanda or any of the DRC's neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="d.79W.5/2">We continue to urge regional governments to work together to resolve the issue of the foreign armed groups and to respect all states' territorial integrity. The recent UN Security Council Resolution 1653 reinforced this message. And the US-facilitated Tripartite Plus mechanism provides a forum for disputes to be resolved diplomatically.</p>

Given the clandestine nature of human trafficking, it is difficult to identify with certainty the routes used by human traffickers, but the limited evidence available to us does not point to trafficking from Central Asia being a problem that directly affects the UK. Nonetheless we deplore this vile crime wherever it takes place and we will continue to work with EU partners and others to combat it.</p>

	<p pid="d.82W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London and our embassy in Tehran maintain contact with a wide range of Iranians in many different fields. We are seriously concerned about human rights and political freedoms in Iran. Ministers and officials raise our concerns frequently with the Iranian authorities. We also take action through the EU, and in United Nations fora. We maintain a dialogue with those inside and outside the Iranian Government who are working to support reform and the rule of law.

	<p pid="d.82W.2/2" class="indent">We will not take sides in Iran's internal political debates&mdash;these are for Iranians to resolve and they are perfectly capable of doing so themselves. Given their history, Iranians are understandably sensitive about any hint of outside interference. But this does not mean that we should stop standing up for principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms which we hold dear to ourselves and which so many Iranians aspire to: freedom of speech; transparent, genuinely democratic and accountable government; respect for the rights of minorities and women; an independent judiciary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.2/3">Ministers and officials have no contact with an organisation proscribed under the Terrorism Act, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), which purports to be a democratic opposition movement, nor with the National Council for the Resistance of Iran, a group with which it has close links. The MEK has been responsible for numerous attacks resulting in many deaths. Its claims to be a democratic party are hard to square with a history of violence and its authoritarian nature, and it has virtually no support inside Iran.</p>

	<p pid="d.89W.5/1">We strongly supported the visit to China by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture in November 2005. We welcomed the preliminary assessment of the Special Rapporteur's visit in a UN press release on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-02">2 December 2005</phrase>, and look forward to publication of his full report in the near future. The press release can be found on the UN website at: <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/677C">http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/677C</a> 1943FAA14D67C12570 CB0034966D?opendocument. The Government agree with the Special Rapporteur's assessment that torture in China, though on the decline, particularly in urban areas, remains widespread and that this is increasingly recognised by Chinese officials. We hope the Chinese Government will consider carefully the Rapporteur's recommendations when they issue with a view to making a wholehearted effort to implement them.</p>

A limited visa service was re-opened in June 2002, firstly for urgent cases. The service was then gradually re-opened to students, applicants for settlement visas and visitors who had previously travelled to the UK in the previous five years and complied with the terms of their visas. The last category to re-open in Pakistan was first time visitors under 30 in May 2004, but due to capacity constraints this category was closed in July 2004, with a lowered age restriction of 25 with the exception of family visits. This category was re-opened in August 2005 after the Memorandum of Understanding on Managed Immigration was signed with Pakistan. Working holiday makers have not been able to apply in Pakistan since May 2002.

	<p pid="d.93W.10/1">Services to care leavers who are the responsibility of Essex county council are provided directly by the local authority through its Leaving and After Care Service, which is part of the Children and Young People's Service. The service operates four local teams, based in Colchester, Chelmsford, Harlow and Rochford. They comprise personal advisers (PAs) who are responsible for planning and providing support for all individual care leavers for whom Essex has a responsibility. There is, in addition, a county-wide Accommodation Team which has the remit of providing accommodation to meet care leavers' specific needs, ensuring that any accommodation they are allocated has the necessary support, to enable young people to develop their independent living skills.</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.10/2">Every care leaver is required to have a pathway plan, which is based on an assessment of their personal needs, setting out the services that will be necessary to support them towards greater independence. The exact level of financial support provided to any care leaver will be recorded in this plan. Up until the age of 18, the local authority will usually be his/her primary source of income. Essex, as is the case for other local authorities, is responsible for funding accommodation, maintenance and other expenses (e.g. travel and leisure costs). Once care leavers reach 18, they are then entitled to have access to the same mainstream arrangements for obtaining financial help as other young people. It is the personal adviser's role to assist them to access this help. However, Essex, as the responsible local authority, has a continuing duty to provide assistance, for as long as they remain in an approved programme, with the costs of education or training.</p>

	<p pid="d.98W.8/1">Following the meeting in March 2004, the Department for Education and Skills has been leading on work across Government to counter homophobia in our schools. Work on tackling homophobic bullying is one strand of this. As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on countering homophobic bullying as part of a suite of materials on prejudice driven bullying. We recently hosted a scoping meeting, involving leading experts from the fields of both anti-bullying and anti-homophobia, along with the professional associations and representatives from local authorities. The advice will be published during anti bullying week 2006, and between now and then we will be further consulting schools, local authorities and children and young people to inform its development.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.8/2">This guidance will build on advice already offered to schools in Stand Up for Us: Challenging Homophobia&quot; in Schools which was prepared by the National Healthy Schools Programme with considerable input from the Department. Stand Up For Us&quot; was made available to schools in November 2004 and sets out a practical approach for schools and suggests steps to create an environment where everyone can feel welcome and valued.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.8/3">To establish the baseline position here, we published Homophobia, Sexual Orientation and Schools: a review and implications for action&quot;, during anti bullying week in November 2004. This review, by the Thomas Coram Research Unit, looks at three areas: behaviour and bullying; teaching and learning about sexual orientation and relationships; and employment issues. It collates, summarises and assesses both peer reviewed research material, from this country and abroad, and less formal work conducted by bodies active in this area.It also reports the views of a wide range of organisations, 28 in all, with an interest in this area to paint a picture of how the issues are currently perceived. The report is available on the DfES website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research</a> and the findings will be used to inform the development of further advice to schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.99W.2/1">We are committed to introducing a new statutory Key Stage 3 test in Information and Communication Technology in 2008, subject to a successful pilot. The test is being developed in recognition of the place of ICT as an essential skill for the 21st century and as an independent measure of the attainment target for ICT at the end of Key Stage 3.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/2">Pilots of the test took place in 2004 and 2005. There will be further pilots in May 2006 and in 2007. All secondary schools should be taking part in these pilots to ensure that they are fully prepared for the test in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/3">The ground-breaking test design was recognised in the Computing Awards for Excellence 2005, where it was judged to be the Innovative Computing Project of the Year, and in the 2005 e-Government National Awards.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/4">The test system does not put a limit on the number of pupils who may take the test at any one time, which will be a matter for schools to decide. As many schools will not have sufficient workstations for all their pupils to take the test at one time, the QCA proposes that schools should be able to arrange test sessions to take place at any time within a four-week window. To ensure the necessary high level of security, the test's software automatically generates different versions of each task and randomly allocates these to pupils.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/5">The QCA gathered feedback from schools to inform their evaluation of the 2005 pilot and further development of the test. Schools' responses are summarised in the Report on the 2005 KS3ICT Test Pilot&quot;, which is available from the QCA's website <a href="http://www.qca.org.uk/7280.html">www.qca.org.uk/7280.html</a>. Feedback from participating schools was very positive and the new test was widely welcomed by teachers and pupils.</p>

We will also consider how to support parents with additional needs, including deprived parents. We will ensure schools provide better information and support for parents on the progress of their child at school, including materials to use at home for those parents who have children that have fallen behind in English and mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="d.100W.2/2">Since 1997, we have sought to enhance parental involvement in children's learning through a range of measures targeted at parents and schools.

	<p pid="d.105W.2/1">The requirement to record and report all racist incidents in schools came into force in November 1999. However, Lancashire county council independently kept records before that date. On the basis of information provided by Lancashire county council, in 1997&ndash;98, 52 racist incidents were reported to the then LA, of which 21 were in primary schools and 31in secondary. In 1998&ndash;99, 76 racist incidents were reported, (26 in primary, and 50 in secondary schools). In 1999&ndash;2000 110 incidents were reported (48 in primary, and 62 in secondary schools); in 2000&ndash;2001, 244 incidents (127 in primary, and 117 in secondary schools; and in 2001&ndash;02 , 289 incidents (190 in primary and 99 in secondary schools). In 2002&ndash;03, 396 incidents were reported to Lancashire county council (183 in primary schools and 173 in secondary); in 2003&ndash;2004, 351 incidents (165 in primary schools and 148 in secondary); and in 2004&ndash;05, the latest year for which figures are available, 472 incidents were recorded, of which 230 took place in primary schools and 191 in secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/2">For 2002&ndash;05, the combined numbers of racist incidents between pupils recorded in primary and in secondary schools are lower than the total number. This is because the total figure includes numbers of racist incidents recorded as taking place in nursery, infant, junior, special schools and short stay institutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/3">Information in relation to racist incidents among students in further education institutions in England, is unavailable as statistics are not routinely collated by the Department or by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), the main funding body for further education.</p>

	<p pid="d.106W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.106W.5/2">We have given careful consideration, in consultation with our national education partners, to the additional resources that schools might require in the financial years 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07 to implement guaranteed planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) time for allteachers. This included a survey of real schools including those with relatively low funding, small schools, and those in rural areas, to gain a better understanding of their starting points, how they planned to deliver PPA and the extent to which they could achieve this through the redeployment of existing resources and the additional resources required.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.5/3">In the light of this, we concluded that there would be an average additional cost pressure for nursery and primary schools of 0.8 per cent. to 1 per cent. per pupil in 2005&ndash;06 and 0.7 per cent. per pupil in 2006&ndash;07. We reflected these extra pressures by setting the minimum funding guarantee for primary and nursery schools for 2005&ndash;06 at 5 per cent. per pupil, compared with 4 per cent. per pupil for secondary and special schools and at 4 per cent. per pupil in 2006&ndash;07, compared with 3.4 per cent. per pupil for secondary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.5/4">The minimum increases for schools have been backed by substantial headroom at local authority level in each year, which authorities can use to support schools with particular pressures arising from PPA, including very small schools. In 2005&ndash;06, Gloucestershire received an increase in its Schools Formula Spending Share of 6.9 per cent. per pupil, and for 2006&ndash;07 it will receive an increase in its allocation of the new Dedicated Schools Grant of 6.8 per cent. per pupil (compared with its budgeted spending in 2005&ndash;06). These increases equal the national average increase in each year. It is for each local authority, in consultation with its Schools Forum, to decide on the distribution of funding between the schools in its area.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.5/5">Nothing in the review of staffing structure process compels schools to incur additional expenditure. Any changes to the staffing structure, and the timing of the implementation of such changes, are within schools' control, provided that they are implemented by <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.5/6">We have made no specific assessment of the impact of either the Schools Staffing Structure Review or PPA on headteachers1 workloads in small schools. However, we are aware that both the implementation of PPA time and the review of school staffing structures were major tasks for headteachers and school leaders to manage last year. Of course, headteachers who have a teaching timetable, which is most common in small schools, will themselves benefit from PPA time.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.5/7">Headteachers will also benefit from other elements of our workforce reform programme, such as dedicated headship time for headteachers (introduced in September 2005) and the provisions on work/life balance (effective from September 2003). We are very conscious of the need to bear down on headteacher workload and, in response to a School Teachers' Review Body recommendation, have announced an independent study into the roles, responsibilities, structures and rewards systems for the leadership group.</p>
	<p pid="d.106W.5/8">We provided all headteachers with a great deal of guidance to help them implement PPA and review their staffing structure. On PPA, national guidance has been issued by the National Remodelling Team, and that has been backed up by practical advice and support from a national network of local authority based remodelling advisers. On the staffing structure review, I refer the hon.

	<p pid="d.108W.8/1">Clause 36 of the Bill reaffirms the general rule that children should not be selected for admission to schools on the basis of academic ability. It prevents the introduction of any new selection by ability, and clarifies that any school that becomes its own admission authority will not be able to select pupils by ability, if it doesn't already do so.</p>
	<p pid="d.108W.8/2">Legislation will continue to allow exceptions to the general restriction on selection&mdash;i.e. by grammar schools and other schools which, in 1997/98, selected a proportion of their intake by ability or aptitude. It will also continue to be permissible for admission authorities to introduce selection of up to 10 per cent. of their intake on the basis of aptitude for prescribed subjects.</p>
	<p pid="d.108W.8/3">But there are other means of 'selecting' or giving pupils priority for admission to schools. Clause 40 of the Bill prohibits schools from interviewing either parents or their children as part of their admission arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.108W.8/4">Clause 37 will give a new School Admissions Code greater force than the existing Code of Practice. It will impose requirements on admission authorities and they will have to act in accordance with its provisions and guidelines.

	<p pid="d.109W.2/1">Promoters of new schools may bring forward proposals at any time in response to local parental demand. Before publishing proposals they must consult widely. The decision whether or not proposals are approved is made locally. Decision makers must have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State when considering proposals for new schools. The guidance requires them to take into account a range of factors, including the effect on standards, views of interested parties and the extent to which the proposals address the need to promote community cohesion. In particular, decision makers are required to consider any sex discrimination issues in relation to proposals for a single sex school. The number of new schools of any type which are established in future will continue to depend on local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="d.128W.2/1">The steps taken by the Department for Work and Pensions to achieve savings in procurement processes are delivered through a commercial strategy that applies to the entire Department, its agencies and associated non-departmental public bodies (NDBPs). The steps include:</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.2/2" class="indent">collaborating and sharing best practice on procurement with the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) and across the public sector. The Department leads cross-Government deals for stationery and postal services and recently successfully led procurement for public sector-wide frameworks for travel services including rail, air/ferry, car hire, hotels and conferences;</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.2/3" class="indent">expanding use of purchasing cards and e-commerce to improve the efficiency of the purchasing process. 80 per cent. of low value purchasing transactions are now processed electronically and all low value transactions will be traded electronically by 2007;</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.2/4" class="indent">a programme to develop procurement skills, with 75 per cent. of staff in specialist procurement posts CIPS qualified and the introduction of a Delegated Procurement Authority (DPA) to ensure all procurements are supported by suitably trained and experienced staff; and</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.2/5" class="indent">strategic relationship management of key suppliers such as EDS, BT, Land Securities Trillium and Royal Mail Group. A supplier performance index is being introduced for all key suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="d.128W.2/6">Through these steps and others the Department has made the biggest contribution of all Departments to support OGC in exceeding its SR00 and SR02 PSA targets. The Department has reported improving procurement Value For Money (VFM) gains for the last four years. In 2004&ndash;05 it reported procurement VFM gains of &pound;326.4 million to OGC; this was 7.6 per cent. of the Department's total commercial spend of &pound;4,289 million and 29.5 per cent. of the total reported by all Departments.</p>

For too long, people on incapacity benefit have been written off as incapable of work and consigned to a life on benefit. We know that a large proportion want to work and so we want to ensure that they are given the opportunity to do so. We do not believe in writing anyone off.</p>
	<p pid="d.130W.5/3">On the 24 of January 2006 we published our Green Paper: A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work&quot; which sets out our proposals for the reform of incapacity benefit. It is crucial that we get the details of these reforms right and the opinions of the public are very important. The publication of the welfare reform Green Paper began the official consultation phase, which will run until <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-21">21 April</phrase>, and we invite feedback and suggestions from all interested parties as we look for the best way to move forward.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.3/1">The measure of sustainability for jobs gained when leaving the New Deal programme differs across the New Deals. In the case of New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 plus, employment is regarded as sustained if a person gaining a job through these New Deals does not claim Jobseeker's Allowance for at least 13 weeks after gaining employment and leaving the programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.3/2">Employment sustainability for those participating on New Deal for Lone Parents is measured by employment records held by H.M Revenue and this measure has been used since October 2005. If a person leaves New Deal for Lone Parents to a job, and they are recorded through Revenue records as still being in that job 13 weeks later, their employment is recorded as sustained.</p>

	<p pid="d.133W.5/1">New deal for lone parents started in October 1998. All lone parents claiming income support are invited to attend a voluntary meeting with a personal adviser. This meeting is known as a new deal for lone parents initial interview and so far 1,158,000 have been held.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.5/2">In April 2001 mandatory meetings for lone parents were introduced, known as work focused interviews. Work focused interviews are conducted at the outset of the benefit claim and at set points during the claim, usually six months, 12 months and then annually. The frequency can also depend on the age of the youngest child, and the lone parent's duration on benefit. For example, quarterly work focused interviews are currently being introduced nationally for lone parents who have been claiming income support for more than 12 months, and who have a youngest child aged 14 or 15.</p>

	<p pid="d.135W.5/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="d.135W.5/2">Our long-term strategy to meet the child poverty target is not based exclusively on increasing financial support for families. Evidence clearly shows that work is the best route out of poverty for those who are able to work and our strategy focuses on policies to enable parents to participate in the labour market, as well as providing financial support.</p>
	<p pid="d.135W.5/3">The other element of the strategy is the delivery of excellent public services that improve the life chances ofchildren living in poverty and help break the cycle of deprivation. Our child poverty strategy is set out in Opportunity for All and in the Child Poverty Review, published alongside the 2004 Spending Review White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="d.135W.8/18">Measuring child poverty&quot;, published in December 2003, compares findings with our European Union counterparts. It showed that the UK had the highest child poverty rate in Europe in 1999 (29 per cent.) but, according to latest data for 2003, we are now closer to the EU average (23 per cent.). European comparisons are made using data from the European Household Panel Study, and are not comparable with figures using the Family Resources Survey. Data from 2003 remains the most up to date as this was the last year that data was produced for the UK using this dataset. UK comparisons across Europe will be measured using the European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EUSILC) from autumn 2005.</p>

	<p pid="d.137W.0/1">The exact level of in and out of work support that a lone parent will receive is dependent on their circumstances and income, including child support and housing tenure. These vary considerably among lone parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.0/2">Since 1997 the Government have made a number of improvements to the tax and benefit system to ensure that work pays. We have developed an effective strategy for helping more lone parents make the transition from benefits and into work which combines child care assistance, financial support for those entering work and provision of work focused advice and support.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.0/3">In 1998 we introduced the national minimum wage, which currently stands at &pound;5.05 per hour for those aged 22 and over. The child and working tax credits introduced in April 2003 will help tackle child poverty and make work pay for all families, including lone parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.0/4">A lone parent with two children, moving into work on the national minimum wage, with child care costs of &pound;80per week, will be financially better off by around &pound;56per week. This could be increased by any child support maintenance received, as this is disregarded in full for tax credit purposes.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.0/5">Generally, a lone parent who is not in work can access all relevant benefits&mdash; though what they qualify for will depend on individual circumstances. The large majority of lone parents on benefit claim income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit. They will also receive child benefit. Their individual circumstances may also allow them to claim certain premiums within their income support entitlement, such as the disabled child or carer premiums. Being in receipt of income support also entitles them to free school meals for their children and free prescriptions and eye tests.</p>

	<p pid="d.141W.8/2">In making decisions about provision of social care, blind and partially sighted people are treated the same as any other potential user of services. Care for all individuals is determined, based on assessment of need, local eligibility criteria and the local provision of services.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.8/3">Rehabilitation services for blind and partially sighted people are provided by local health and social care bodies. The Department has given the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, in collaboration with other employers, through Skills for Care, &pound;30,000 to redesign hybrid rehabilitation functions in work with visually impaired people. It is, however, the responsibility of local authorities and health trusts to ensure they have an adequate number of trained people to deliver rehabilitation services to the blind and partially sighted people in their area.</p>

	<p pid="d.148W.5/24">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/25">Patient counts:</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/26">Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier Hospital Episode Statistics identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/27">All diagnoses count of patients:</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/28">These figures represent a count of all patients where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/29">Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/30">The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/31">Secondary diagnoses:</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/32">As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&ndash;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.5/33">Primary care trust (PCI) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&ndash;03 boundaries, as a one- off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&ndash;97, 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.</p>

	<p pid="d.149W.8/1">The publication Ambulance and other patient transport services: Operation, use and performance standards&quot; provides guidance on the eligibility criteria for patient transport services (PTS) and is available in the Library. This document states that medical need for non-emergency patient transport must be determined by a doctor, dentist or midwife and will depend upon the medical condition of the individual patient, the availability of private or public transport and distance to be travelled. The principle which should apply is that each patient should be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time and in reasonable comfort, without detriment to their medical condition.</p>
	<p pid="d.149W.8/2">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services (which could include patient transport services) to such extent as they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. Therefore, it is for the local national health service to decide who provides patient transport services for eligible patients in their area. PCTs should apply the principles outlined in the aforementioned publication to consider each case on its merits or to develop local criteria for patient transport services use. The White Paper Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot; signals our intent to broaden eligibility to patients referred for treatment in out of hospital settings, and during 2006&ndash;07 we will update guidance on eligibility for PTS to reflect the changes outlined in the White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="d.154W.0/1">The new general medical services contract provides for practice patient lists to be either open or closed to new registrations. The Department does not therefore hold information of the number of practices who are claiming to have lists which are open but full. However, we do recognise that some practices may face capacity pressures and don't accept new registrations although they are not formally closed. The recent White Paper commits us to improving the closed list arrangements so that there is clarity for patients on whether a practice is open for new registrations. We intend to work with the NHS Employers and the British Medical Association to deliver that commitment.</p>

	<p pid="d.154W.3/1">The Department has not had discussions with any primary care trust (PCT) in the Greater Manchester strategic health authority area regarding dowry agreements with local authorities and has made no assessment of any PCT decision in respect of this matter. It is for local authorities and national health service providers to determine the best way to meet the needs of people with learning disabilities in their population.</p>
	<p pid="d.154W.3/2">The Department has supported more sustainable partnership funding arrangements through section 31 of the Health Act (1999) flexibilities, which created the provision for a strategic transfer of funding for the population as a whole. The NHS block transfers its funding in return for the local authority taking a lead commissioning role that includes covering people who formerly lived in a long stay hospital.</p>

	<p pid="d.161W.3/1">This Government introduced the Carers Grant in 1999 to support councils in providing breaks and services for carers in England, including those who support people with learning disabilities. The grant has increased each year and has provided an extra &pound;635 million over the past six years. We have confirmed that it will be worth &pound;185 million in 2006&ndash;07 and in 2007&ndash;08. This will mean that, by 2008, we will have invested over &pound;l billion in services and support for carers of all groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.3/2">In addition, we have listened to the considerable public support for carers throughout our extensive consultation process prior to the publication of the white paper Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot;. As a result, we propose to offer a new deal for carers to improve support for them through a range of measures. This will include ensuring that a short-term, home based respite support to all carers in crisis or emergency situations is established in each council's area.</p>

	<p pid="d.172W.5/2">Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are responsible for the financial management of the organisations within their area and for delivering overall financial balance across the SHA. Where a primary care trust (PCT) is overspending the SHA can agree to provide the organisation additional resources in the form of repayable planned support. The support should be agreed during the annual planning stage and should only be provided to overspending organisations on the basis that they deliver a plan to recover their financial position over an agreed period.</p>
	<p pid="d.172W.5/3">SHA have discretion in how they operate the system of planned support. The Department does not specify whether they should charge or pay interest to PCT. In addition, since the SHA can only provide additional resources to an overspending organisation where another organisation underspends, the system of planned support operates on the basis of local agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.172W.5/4">In 2006&ndash;07, the Department has instructed SHAs that there should be no more provision of planned support. This will increase the transparency of the system because all overspending will be recorded in the annual accounts of the organisation. The Department has explained the system changes to SHAs in guidance for 2006&ndash;07 financial planning.</p>

	<p pid="d.177W.5/1">A range of social, psychological and pharmacological interventions are available to support people living with Tourette's syndrome, their families and their carers. It is the responsibility of local healthand social care organisations to commission appropriate services based on local needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.5/2">The national service framework for long-term conditions (NSF) has been published to help drive up quality and reduce variations in the care provided by health and social care organisations. Through its quality requirements, the NSF addresses a key range of issues including the need for equitable access to a range of services; good quality information and support for patients and carers and the ability to see a specialist and get the right investigations and diagnosis as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.5/3">The Government recognise that one of the key determinants in delivering high quality and effective patient care is that health professionals have an appropriate level of skills and knowledge. Addressing the training needs of health professionals is, however, the responsibility of the appropriate regulatory bodies. They set standards for the pre-registration training of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, approve the education institutions that provide the training and determine the curricula.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.5/4">Post-registration training needs for national health service staff are decided against local national health service priorities, through appraisal processes and training needs analyses informed by local delivery plans and the needs of the service. Local authorities and health service providers decide how best to provide services to meet the needs of the individuals.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.5/5">We have no specific plans to raise public awareness of the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome. NHS Direct, NHS Direct on-line and NHS Direct interactive have been established to provide advice and information on health and self-care. Through these services, people have access to information on a range of conditions and illnesses, including Tourette's syndrome.</p>

	<p pid="d.178W.5/2">The first stage of this is a baseline assessment, the aim of which is to ensure there is an agreed understanding of the local financial problem and that actions are in hand to address this. This was funded by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.178W.5/3">Following the assessment, the local national health service will identify the actions needed to return the organisations to financial balance and what tailored support is needed to support local management. For the most challenged organisations, the first three months of a turnaround director will be funded by the Department. Otherwise, it is for the local NHS to decide on the funding streams.</p>
