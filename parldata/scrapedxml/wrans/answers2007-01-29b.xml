	<p pid="b.7W.0/1">DFID supports country-led national AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) control programmes in a number of high HIV prevalence countries. DFID also made significant contributions to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria which supports country programmes for AIDS and TB. The UK has committed &pound;359 million to the Fund for 2002-07, including &pound;100 million for 2006 and the same for 2007, subject to performance. We have also made a long-term commitment to UNITAID, the new international drug purchase facility, scaling up to &pound;40 million per year by 2010, subject to performance. These initiatives provide countries with access to increasing resources for scaling up HIV and TB interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.0/2">Most countries with HIV and TB co-epidemics already have national plans to address these epidemics in increasingly co-ordinated programmatic ways and many have also finalised universal access plans to dramatically scale up these responses. Scaling up access to antiretroviral therapy offers opportunities to better control TB and has been shown to decrease the incidence of TB by 70-80 per cent. in people already infected with HIV.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.0/3">DFID is contributing to strengthening national health systems to scale up the delivery of basic services to the poor that include TB and HIV prevention and treatment. An example of this is the Malawi Emergency Human Resources Programme that is making more health workers available to deal with increasing numbers of patients who are infected with both HIV and TB.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.0/4">DFID is also funding research working to identify better ways to deliver services tackling the co-epidemics. We are also supporting the work of WHO, for example the STOP TB programme, which is supporting countries to develop co-ordinated HIV and TB responses.</p>

We are aware of the potential for agriculture and are working closely with farmers and industry to develop markets and promote uptake.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.12/2">The production and use of biofuels is incentivised by a 20 pence per litre duty rate cut for biodiesel and bioethanol, which has been extended to 2008-09.

	<p pid="b.10W.2/1">Agricultural land taken out of production is termed set-aside. The European Union (EU) permits the growing of crops on set-aside for industrial uses and energy production. Between 560,000 and 800,000 hectares of land have been set-aside in the UK over the last 10 years. While this may in some cases represent some of the least productive land on farms, it is all capable of supporting arable production. In 2005, 14.5 per cent. of set-aside land was used for industrial crop production, the vast majority of which was for energy end uses. It is anticipated that this figure will grow significantly as the demand for transport biofuels increases.</p>

	<p pid="b.22W.5/1">All officers in the armed services are deemed to have a mobile commitment. However, continuity of education allowance (CEA) is only paid to a service person who is accompanied by their family at each location. Any service person claiming CEA must ensure that their family is, and continues to be, mobile and this is declared by the service person on each claim. In addition, the service person must be in possession of a valid 'mobility certificate', which is completed prior to an initial claim for the education allowance, when the child(ren) change school, at the beginning of each new posting, or if the certificate is more than three years old. This certificate states the service claimant is committed to their family moving with them when they are posted. If the family for any reason does not move with the service person, then their entitlement to claim CEA will be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="b.22W.5/2">There are a few exceptions to the accompanied service eligibility criteria. On some postings it is inappropriate for the service person to be accompanied by their family and these postings are classified as 'involuntarily separated', i.e. they are separated from their family and cannot serve accompanied. Examples of this are when the service parent is serving on an operational deployment, or on a designated unaccompanied assignment or when exceptional authority has been granted for the service claimant to serve unaccompanied but retain eligibility to CEA. Examples of the circumstances under which such authority may be given are whilst the service claimant is awaiting allocation of service families accommodation at their new duty station, or when they are waiting, for up to six months, for the completion of a house sale/purchase. In these circumstances, the service person would be eligible to continue to claim CEA.</p>
	<p pid="b.22W.5/3">Given the ongoing transition to joint personnel administration, figures are not yet available of the number of officer claimants from each service for the past five years. However, the total number of officer claimants for spring term 2005 was 3,587 and for spring term 2006 3,074, as reported in the HCDC report 'Educating Service Children' of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>. Detailed figures explaining the number of officer claimants from each service for the past five years are being determined.</p>

	<p pid="b.24W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has recorded energy usage since 1990-91. The most recent year for which figures detailing the volume of Departmental emissions are available is financial year 2004-05. I refer the hon. Member to the figures published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 652-53W.

	<p pid="b.24W.5/2">The Department does not offset its emissions derived from energy use in buildings and facilities on the defence estate. However, MOD does support the Carbon Trust's approach to reductions in emissions where offsetting is the final element of a plan to reduce an organisation's carbon footprint. For MOD, reduction of energy use and increased use of energy from renewable sources will take precedence over carbon offsetting.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.5/3">MOD has been collecting data on official air travel booked through the Head Office Travel Service, and has agreed to make a financial contribution to Government Carbon Offsetting Fund (GCOF) relative to the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the air travel for civilian staff and Service personnel in non-operational posts. The scheme started in April 2006. In 2005-06, MOD's estimated annual financial contribution to GCOF at &pound;151,658.67 based on a price of 10/tC. It is estimated that MOD will offset some 15,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. This will be revised using actual data from 2006-07 to establish the GCOF contribution required for this financial year.</p>

The revised manning requirement figures for the DMS have now been endorsed and a formal announcement will be made in the near future.</p>

The Treasury Solicitor's Department made one telephone call to the LSC in April 2005, following a stay in the legal proceedings which had been agreed between the parties pending a public funding decision for the Nuclear Test Veterans group action. This call was made with a view to ascertaining the likely timeframe for a public funding decision to assist in planning and progressing the proposed litigation. However, contact was not made with the LSC caseholder, no information was given about the funding position, and this initial contact was not followed up.</p>

Claims can be made at any time after service termination. At <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>, 179,000 war pensions were in payment.

	<p pid="b.39W.2/1">Indefinite detention of detainees in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, regardless of their nationality or place of former residence, is a matter of concern to us, on human rights grounds rather than for its effect on our relations with other states. As we have made clear, the detention facility should be closed. We therefore welcome President Bush's public statements expressing a wish to close Guantanamo Bay and the US Administration's efforts to reduce numbers at the camp. But we recognise the need for careful consideration on how numbers at the camp are reduced to ensure international security is maintained and the human rights of detainees respected.</p>

	<p pid="b.47W.5/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has written to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-26">26 January 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland five Parliamentary Questions: -</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/4" class="indent">(i) what the value is of the contract with National Car Parks (NCP) to manage parking enforcement throughout Northern Ireland;</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/5" class="indent">(ii) how the revenue generated by parking enforcement tickets under the new traffic attendant system will be used;</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/6" class="indent">(iii) how much revenue has been generated since the new traffic attendant system managed by NCP came into operation; and how much revenue was generated in the last comparable period under the previous parking enforcement system;</p>

	<p pid="b.47W.5/8" class="indent">(v) whether the contract with NCP to manage parking enforcement in Northern Ireland provides for performance bonuses for the (a) chief executive and (b) traffic wardens.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/9" class="indent">I have been asked to reply as the issues raised fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service. For ease of reference, I will reply in the order listed above.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/10" class="indentitalic"> (i) National Car Parks contract value.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/11" class="indent">As you may be aware our contract with NCP includes for the management of Roads Service's off-street charged car parks as well as the enforcement of on-street parking and waiting restrictions. If NCP provides the appropriate level of service, as measured against key performance indicators (KPIs) under the terms of the contract, a performance related payment, over and above the actual costs to NCP, will be made each month. I must stress that these KPIs do not relate to the number of tickets issued by Traffic Attendants. Under the terms of the contract the maximum annual amount payable to NCP will be &pound;8,848,698.38. This sum includes the maximum performance related payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/12" class="indentitalic"> (ii) How the revenue from parking charge notices will be used.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/13" class="indent">The revenue generated by the payment of penalty charge notices is used, along with income from car parking and other charges, to supplement the overall financing of Roads Service by Central Government. Based on current levels of tickets issued and payment rates, income from penalty charges will not cover the total cost of the NCP contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/14" class="indentitalic"> (iii) Value of revenue generated since the introduction of the new Traffic attendant system compared with the same period last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/15" class="indent">Since the introduction of the new Traffic Attendant system managed by NCP, &pound;614,700 has been paid so far to Roads Service as a result of Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) (both on-street and off-street) during the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-13">13 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-22">22 January 2007</phrase>. With regard to the second part of your question, we do not have the figures for the equivalent period last year as on-street parking was managed by the PSNI. However, I can give you an indication of the number of on-street PCNs being issued under the new system compared to parking tickets issued under the old system. Since the introduction of the new system some 25,551 on-street PCNs have been issued. This equates to an annual figure of approximately 133,000 PCNs compared to an annual average of 66,000 on-street parking tickets issued by PSNI.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/16" class="indentitalic"> (iv) The number of people employed by NCP to manage parking enforcement in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/17" class="indent">I have been advised that NCP currently employ 371 staff in Northern Ireland to manage parking enforcement and operate the contract with Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/18" class="indentitalic"> (v) Performance bonuses.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/19" class="indent">I can advise that the contract Roads Service has with NCP to manage parking enforcement in Northern Ireland does not provide for bonuses to any NCP staff members, including their Chief Executive or Traffic Attendants.</p>

	<p pid="b.49W.14/1">Migration of data between the old and new rate collection systems has caused some problems but the majority of these were due to the poor quality of data in the old system. While efforts were made to correct erroneous data prior to data migration, it was not possible to identify and correct all the issues. Most of these issues have now been resolved.</p>

	<p pid="b.50W.2/1">The new IT system is being introduced on a phased basis. Phase 1, the collection and billing system, went live in October 2006. Phase 3, the replacement of the existing owner-occupied housing benefit system, is due for completion during March 2007. An interface was required to update the new collection and billing system with information from the existing housing benefit system. The complexity of replicating and modifying the interface has been challenging. The agency is working with its suppliers to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>

The position the Department takes on the area of spending and legal basis is subject to parliamentary scrutiny of the House of Commons' European Scrutiny Committee and the House of Lords' Select Committee on the European Union. The UK makes its contributions to the EC budget as a whole and not to individual spending within it. When Council or Commission decisions have been adopted it is open to a member state to challenge the legal base through the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice under procedures laid down in Article 230 of the Treaty.</p>

Mandatory national RTT waiting time collection for admitted patients begins this month, and for non-admitted patients in April. Publication will begin as soon as the data is of sufficient quality. For admitted data this is likely to be in the spring and for non-admitted data in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.2/3">The national health service undertook a baseline data research exercise in summer 2006 involving an estimation methodology that looked at hospital attendance and admission records from earlier in the year. The results, which do not have the status of official or national statistics but are available on the 18-week website at <a href="http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk">www.18weeks.nhs.uk</a>, suggest that, nationally, in early 2006, the pathways of 35 per cent. of admitted and 70-80 per cent. of non-admitted patients met 18 weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.67W.0/1">None. In every part of the country, patients can expect a first outpatient appointment within 13 weeks of general practitioner (GP) referral, and admission to hospital within six months of a decision to admit them. This continues to be the case no matter what measures may have been implemented locally to achieve financial balance. By December 2008, patients will be able to expect to wait no longer than 18 weeks in total from GP referral right through to treatment taking in first out-patients, diagnostic tests and follow-ups and admission for a hospital operation if that is what they require.</p>

	<p pid="b.67W.4/1">The licensing authority assures parents, schools and others that providers of high-hazard adventure activities meet an adequate standard of safety for young people not in the charge of their parents. It does this by granting, refusing, revoking or varying a licence to provide those activities, after considering licence applications and obtaining reports from its inspectors; it also investigates complaints and publishes information about licence-holders. In this way the Government help young people to receive instruction or leadership in stimulating activities outdoors (climbing, caving, remote trekking and waterborne activities) without avoidable risks of death or disabling injury.</p>

	<p pid="b.69W.2/1">To date, six local authorities have signed contracts for their Building Schools for the Future (BSF) projects. The first of these was Bristol in June 2006, which marked the establishment of the first Local Education Partnership (LEP), a long-term public-private partnership which is the preferred model for delivering local BSF projects. Greenwich and Manchester signed contracts with their respective private sector partners in October and November 2006, followed by Lancashire, Bradford and Lambeth in December 2006. We expect several more contracts to be signed in the coming months. 18 local authority projects are currently in procurement; seven are now at preferred bidder stage. All but five of the wave 1-3 projects have had their strategies approved. We are just starting work with the 15 authorities in wave 4, which were announced in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/2">PricewaterhouseCoopers has no role in delivering the BSF programme. Following <i> Official Journal</i> of the European Union procurement, the Department has placed a contract with PricewaterhouseCoopers to evaluate the impact of the Building Schools for the Future programme on educational achievement. This is in line with Treasury &quot;Green Book&quot; requirements for major new programmes. This evaluation also aims to learn lessons from the early stages of the programme to inform its development.</p>

These 'raise the bar' in terms of expectations on schools. Schools are now judged on the basis of a four point scale as follows: (1) Outstanding, (2) Good, (3) Satisfactory and (4) Inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.6/2">The following tables set out the available data from 2000 to 2005/06. Due to changes in inspection criteria in 2005/06, it is not possible to directly read across from tables A-F to G. The number of schools inspected each year varies and this impacts on the number of pupils attending schools in each of the categories.</p>

They are also examining how installation costs might be partially offset by design freedoms, such as fewer fire doors, and what the impact of reduced insurance premiums could be. Other work is being done on developing a risk assessment tool for use with individual projects, and a cost benefit analysis of installing sprinklers in schools, sensitive to small variations in data.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/4">The studies will be completed by the end of January and we will make them public. Some of the work will also be included in the final version of Building Bulletin 100, which we expect to publish before the end of May.</p>

As such, the latest operational year of new claimants for which (a) and (c) are answerable is April 2004 to March 2005, and the latest operational year of claims reaching their first anniversary for which (b) and (d) are answerable is April 2003 to March 2004 (and thus relates to people making a new claim during April 2002 and March 2003).  2. The figures quoted in this response come from data in the National Benefits Database and the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS).  3. Figures in this response are based upon periods of employment measured from the WPLS, which is based on data from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The figures given can be taken as a minimum only for the following (not necessarily comprehensive) reasons: (i) Some records show that a person started or ended employment at some point in the year, but the exact date on when they started or left their job is unknown, and therefore we do not know if they were employed at the points in time specified in this query. (ii) If a person's earnings are sufficiently low that they fall below the lower income tax threshold and so are not required to pay PAYE income tax on their earnings then there is no requirement to inform HMRC of their employment (although some employers declare these jobs anyway). (iii) This data does not include the self-employed. (iv) Poor quality personal data may lead to missed matches with benefits data. (v) No &quot;HMRC sensitive and secure&quot; information is supplied by HMRC (for example, HMRC employees, members of the security services).</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.102W.8/1">The Government's aim is to maximise private investment in the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.8/2">Two bodies have been created by the Government and Key Olympic Stakeholders, the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), to oversee the construction of the Olympic Park and to organise the staging of the Games, including investigating public private partnerships and raising the &pound;2 billion in sponsorship this will require.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.8/3">LOCOG has been working closely with companies in six sectors (banking, insurance, oil and gas, automobiles, telecommunications and utilities) to explore partnerships at the tier one level. LOCOG remains on target to announce its first major sponsor by the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.8/4">With regards to initiating public private partnerships and private finance initiatives, the ODA will be looking into the possibility of securing these as part of individual procurements, subject to the overarching priority to deliver the Games on time. As a result, the ODA will seek private sector investment in utilities and other assets which have long-term investment potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.8/5">The Games will present many more opportunities for private funders to invest in a variety of projects stimulated by the creation of the Olympic Park in East London. For example, the John Lewis Partnership has already announced plans to invest &pound;50 million and create 800 jobs in the Stratford City retail project, adjacent to the Olympic Park. We are keen to encourage similar investments to accelerate the regeneration in this deprived part of London and in schemes throughout the country to ensure that the Games leave a lasting and sustainable legacy for the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.109W.0/1">No specific assessment has been made for or by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport of the actual impact of Olympic Lottery games on the sales of other National Lottery games. Sales performance and its analysis are matters for Camelot, the National Lottery operator and the independent regulator, the National Lottery Commission. Camelot is working to maximise sales of all Lottery products, including Olympic Lottery Games, and so minimise any impact that Olympic Lottery Games sales may have on income for the other good causes. The NLC and Camelot monitor sales closely and quarterly reports of returns to good causes, including the Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund, are published on the NLC's website&mdash;<a href="http://www.nationallotterycommission.gov.uk">www.nationallotterycommission.gov.uk</a>. The next such report is due to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January</phrase>.</p>

Approximately half of this funding is to boost grassroots participation in swimming.

	<p pid="b.110W.5/2">Swimming also has a significant role to play within the national strategy for PE, School Sport and Club Links, delivered jointly with the Department for Education and Skills. In April 2006 the top up swimming scheme was launched. It is investing &pound;5.5 million over two years to support pupils swim 25 metres before they finish primary school. A further &pound;742,000 is being invested in 2006-08 with the ASA through National School Sport programmes; Club Links and Step into Sport.</p>

	<p pid="b.116W.6/1">Hydrogen is an 'energy carrier' rather than a fuel source as, like electricity, it can only be produced using energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/2">Hydrogen can be used in:</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/3" class="indent">a fuel cell, where it produces zero emissions at the point of use</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/4" class="indent">normal combustion, (e.g. in an internal combustion engine)</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/5">In 2004, the Department of Trade and Industry, commissioned analysis from the energy consultants E4Tech, Element Energy, and Eoin Lees. This analysis indicates that for the UK, the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel offers significant opportunities for cost-competitive CO2 reduction by 2030. Six different types of transport energy chain have this potential and also offer increased energy security. None is readily available today and each would require significant changes to the energy system. However, they are sufficiently promising to be worth pursuing as energy options for the UK. This analysis was published on the Department's website and can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.116W.6/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, the Government responded to this analysis and published a &quot;A Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy Activity in the UK&quot; which included a funding package worth &pound;15 million over four years for a UK wide hydrogen and fuel cell demonstration programme. The first call for proposals for the demonstration scheme has now closed and I anticipate that a second call for proposals will operate in 12-18 months time. Further information is available on the scheme's website:</p>

	<p pid="b.116W.6/9">Currently, the Department for Trade and Industry supports industrial collaborative research and development for fuel cell and hydrogen technologies through the Technology programme. Bids specifically for hydrogen technologies have been invited since April 2005. The programme seeks to advance these technologies for both stationary power generation and transport applications, with a view to achieving the cost reductions and performance levels necessary for commercial deployment. This support currently amounts to approximately &pound;2-3 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/10">The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), including through the SUPERGEN initiative, support basic research in universities on both fuel cells and hydrogen. SUPERGEN supports the UK Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Consortium (UK SHEC) which has received funding of &pound;2.5 million. This programme is supporting projects on: hydrogen generation; hydrogen storage; and socio-economic implications for a hydrogen economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/11">EPSRC also supports the separate Fuel Cell SUPERGEN consortia. This is a four-year programme which began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>. This consortium is supported with funding of &pound;2.085 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/12">In addition to SUPERGEN, EPSRC has awarded &pound;1 million to investigate the potential role of formic acid as a chemical method for the storage of hydrogen. &pound;500,000 has been granted to three projects on fundamental science and engineering relevant to hydrogen technologies. EPSRC also contributes to projects through the DTI's Technology programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/13">The Government have also provided funding of over &pound;450,000 for the trial of three hydrogen-powered fuel cell buses in London as part of the EU CUTE (Clean Urban Transport in Europe) project. &pound;6.5 million of funding has been provided for the fuel cell and low carbon vehicle technology centre of excellence (CENEX) based in Loughborough.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.6/2">No animal rights extremist has been charged under the Terrorism Act 2000 or the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. However, should the activities of animal rights extremists, or any other individual or group, meet the required threshold of terrorism contained within the Acts, it is entirely possible that those Acts could be used. It is the remit of the police and Crown Prosecution Service to select the most appropriate charge in individual cases. To date, offences under other legislation including the relatively new economic damage offences in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 have been more appropriate for bringing charges, and there have been a number of convictions of leading animal rights extremists.</p>

The power to make intervention orders came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. A new national system for collecting data on ASBOs is scheduled for implementation from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>, and will incorporate new reporting requirements, e.g. intervention orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.5/2">Individual support orders (ISOs) can be issued to persons aged 10-17 in addition to an antisocial behaviour order at civil proceedings at the magistrates court. The number of ISOs issued in 2004 (from <phrase class="date" code="">1 May</phrase>), as reported to the Home Office by the Court Service, is seven. This is 2 per cent. of the number of ASBOs issued to 10-17 year olds at civil proceedings at the magistrates court during the same period. The equivalent figures for 2005 are 42 and 7 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.5/3">Concerted action is under way by the Home Office, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Youth Justice Board and practitioners to increase the take up of ISOs. Following meetings with practitioners around the country at the beginning of 2006 an action plan was devised. This included reinforcing information on ISOs on key practitioner websites such as the Together Actionline and the Youth Justice Board's, promoting ISOs at a series of practitioner events and conferences, including the Respect Academies that took place throughout last summer, success stories researched and published on the Together website and an article on ISOs published in the March 2006 edition of <i> The Magistrate</i> to reach all magistrates nationally. Longer term funding for the use of ISOs from 2006 was included in the &pound;45 million prevention fund to youth offending teams.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.5/4">We are about to embark on a three-month survey of the 60 Respect action areas, the outcome of which is intended to provide information about the use of ISOs and other interventions that young people may be receiving to help them address their antisocial behaviour.</p>

CROWCASS lists were issued to appropriate UK authorities and war crimes investigators at the time. The 1989 War Crimes Inquiry report also noted that the members of the 14th Waffen SS (Galizien) Division were later checked against the UNWCC lists before their civilianisation, although the report acknowledged that the UNWCC lists included few suspects identified from the territories controlled by the Soviet Union.</p>

These are to despatch 70 per cent. of charged postal applications within 20 working days and 90 per cent. within 70 working days. For non-charged postal applications, they aim to despatch 25 per cent. within 20 working days and 30 per cent. within 70 working days. Straightforward applications for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) are completed within this timescale, though more complex cases may take longer.

	<p pid="b.144W.5/1">No specific allegation of war crimes has been received against any former member of the 14th Waffen SS (Galizien) Division resident in the UK. Police inquiries in 2003 indicated that 1,450 ex-Galizien were still resident in the UK. The Metropolitan police visited a sample 13 former members in 2005 to ascertain any information about crimes against humanity but no such crimes were disclosed.</p>

	<p pid="b.144W.8/1">There have not been any recent bi-lateral discussions with the countries listed about alleged Nazi war criminals in the UK, but officials from the Home Office have participated in meetings of the European Network of Contact Points on genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, most recently in May 2006, to exchange information and best practice with our European partners. Police investigators and prosecutors may also seek assistance from authorities in other countries to identify and prosecute war criminals using established procedures for police and judicial co-operation.</p>
