	<p pid="f.1207W.3/17">Total investment through the Learning and Skills Council will increase from &pound;11.2 billion in 2007-08 to &pound;12.4 billion in 2010-11. Funding for adult participation will increase to &pound;3.6 billion by 2010-11, an increase of 17 per cent. compared with 2007-08.</p>

Taking into account both FE allocations and train to gain funding, 90 per cent. of all colleges will have the opportunity to increase their funding in 2007/08 compared with 2006/07, with 57 per cent. earning 5 per cent. or more (some of these colleges will be leading consortia).</p>
	<p pid="f.1207W.3/19">Our priority is to make sure that adult learners have access to a full range of courses including progression and first steps learning through the foundation learning tier, learning for its own intrinsic value (personal and community development learning) as well as courses which lead to full qualifications necessary for employment. That is why we are investing around &pound;1.5 billion per year on learning below level 2 over the next three years. The recently published &quot;Adult Learning and Skills: Investing in the First Steps&quot; sets the story of our investment in this area and our vision for adult learners who have not yet obtained basic skills.</p>

	<p pid="f.1211W.0/1">PSNI appreciates the impact on families when loved ones are reported missing, and is committed to tracing such persons. Training is given at student officer level, in detective training, and in critical incident training for senior officers.

	<p pid="f.1222W.0/20" class="indent">&pound;1 million funding for short-term operations and initiatives in the four cities chosen as a focus (Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham and London);</p>

	<p pid="f.1222W.0/26">2. The programme's scope is primarily the use of firearms to commit violent crime by young people as part of gang-related activity, specifically within the four cities. Knife and other violent crime will not be considered other than where it involves gang activities in the four areas. Gangs in this context should be interpreted as street gangs, not peer groups or organised crime networks.</p>
	<p pid="f.1222W.0/27">3. The programme will be delivered in partnership with colleagues in the Home Office Violent Crime Unit and a range of stakeholders.

	<p pid="f.1222W.0/30">6. Decisions on the direction of the programme will be taken by the Home Secretary, Permanent Secretary and sponsoring board member (in that order). Contributions from interested parties will be treated as advice/recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="f.1222W.0/31">7. The programme leader, DCC Jon Murphy, is responsible for the day-to-day delivery of the programme's objectives.</p>
	<p pid="f.1222W.0/32">8. The sponsoring board member, Moira Wallace, has overall responsibility for programme delivery.</p>
	<p pid="f.1222W.0/33">9. The violent crime unit, led by Simon King, has responsibility for ensuring that the programme team is aware of relevant ongoing activity on violent crime, and will work in close partnership with the programme team to ensure that the outcome of the programme's work is jointly owned. The violent crime unit remains responsible for the policy in this area.</p>
	<p pid="f.1222W.0/34">10. The programme leader, DCC Jon Murphy, and the head of violent crime unit, Simon King, will be jointly responsible for ensuring the integration of the team's work into the violent crime unit's ongoing work when the programme team is dissolved.</p>
	<p pid="f.1222W.0/35">11. The sponsoring board member is responsible for ensuring: that resources (including staff) are available for the programme team; that information is accessible; and that decisions are made when necessary.</p>
	<p pid="f.1222W.0/36">12. The Permanent Secretary has authorised the deployment of the priority support team (PST) to work on the programme. The PST's role should be jointly agreed by the programme leader and the head of the delivery unit.</p>

	<p pid="f.1233W.5/1">The renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) will create a demand for some 2.5 billion litres per annum of biofuel by 2010-11. This demand is likely to be met through a mixture of domestically produced and imported biofuels. The Government do not have a precise estimate of the likely split between the two. In theory, and provided a number of large UK biofuel production plants which are currently at the planning stage come on stream by 2010, UK farmers and producers could produce enough biofuel to meet this demand in full. Whether or not they do depends on a wide range of factors including the relative costs of UK-produced and imported biofuels.</p>
	<p pid="f.1233W.5/2">From day one of the RTFO in April 2008, transport fuel suppliers will be required to report on the sustainability of their biofuels in order to earn any certificates in respect of them. This will create an incentive for suppliers to source only those biofuels which deliver genuine environmental benefits.</p>

	<p pid="f.1235W.6/3">There have been various discussions between Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Transport, both at official and ministerial level. The Government are providing local authorities in England an extra &pound;212 million/&pound;217 million/&pound;223 million for the next three years. This extra funding is based on generous assumptions about the probable cost impact of the new concession, including visitor 'hot spots'. We are confident this funding will be sufficient in aggregate.</p>
	<p pid="f.1235W.6/4">The existing funding for concessionary fares is, and will continue to be, distributed by the Department for Communities and Local Government via the formula grant system. There was no significant support among local government to extract the existing funding for statutory concessions from the formula grant system.</p>
	<p pid="f.1235W.6/5">The extra funding for the national bus concession will be distributed by the Department for Transport via a special grant. The decision to use a special grant reflects both the views of local government and the challenges of deriving a formula distribution that matches the probable cost impact of the new concession, taking into account popular tourist resorts and large transport hubs. We anticipate transferring this additional funding into the formula grant process at the beginning of the next three-year settlement period (2011-12).</p>
	<p pid="f.1235W.6/6">The Department for Transport's consultation on the formula basis for the distribution of the special grant closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>. A provisional view on the distribution will be made in due course and will be finalised by a parliamentary debate in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="f.1236W.3/1">I been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="f.1236W.3/2">Council tax benefit (CTB) take-up is lowest among pensioners and they are therefore our priority. One phone call to the Pension Service can give customers access to four benefits&mdash;pension credit, state retirement pension, CTB and housing benefit (HB). A simple claim form for HB/CTB is completed for the customer. All they need to do is check it, sign it and send it back.</p>
	<p pid="f.1236W.3/3">We are taking other measures to promote the take-up of CTB. There are annual awareness campaigns. We have provided local authorities with best practice guidance that contains information about barriers to claiming, ways of overcoming them, and case study examples of good practice to improve take-up. We have supported the simple claim form arrangements with computer scans run by the Pension Service to discover people getting pension credit but not CTB and this information is passed to local authorities. We encourage local authorities to do take-up activity through our performance standards and have awarded &pound;2.2 million to 38 authorities to increase CTB take-up.</p>
	<p pid="f.1236W.3/4">In the longer term, we want to deliver CTB as accessibly, simply and securely as possible. We want to research the feasibility of using data held &quot;across Government&quot; to build profiles of people likely to be entitled. We also want to develop the concept of a &quot;single point of contact&quot; for pensioners, coupled with alignment of application processes that will provide greater efficiency and a better public service.</p>

	<p pid="f.1237W.5/1">The recent review of the fire safety aspects in Part B of the Building Regulations considered fire safety in all types of premises and the important role that sprinklers and other types of fire protection measures may have. A number of changes were made, following extensive research and full public consultation. These changes came into force in April this year and were supported by a Regulatory Impact Assessment setting out the costs and benefits of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="f.1237W.5/2">For a number of years, sprinklers have been asked for in a range of situations under the Building Regulations, such as the majority of tall (30 m+) buildings and buildings with large compartments (e.g. shops with a compartment over 2,000 m<sup>(2)</sup>). The amended Part B gives greater recognition to the role of sprinklers for life safety and the accompanying guidance has been expanded, where justified, to include their use in a wider range of situations. These include in tall (30 m+) blocks of flats, certain care homes and in large single-storey storage buildings.</p>
	<p pid="f.1237W.5/3">In addition, the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, which applies to both new and existing non-domestic buildings, requires that the responsible person for a premises carry out a risk assessment and take necessary fire precautions to ensure the safety of the occupants of the building. This could include the provision of sprinklers, where it is justified by the risk. It is also open for property owners and their insurers to consider the benefits of sprinklers for property protection and business continuity.</p>

	<p pid="f.1242W.2/1">As a result of the tragic events of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-02">2 November</phrase> at Atherstone on Stour in Warwickshire, three key investigations have been initiated. Firstly, the police are conducting an investigation in conjunction with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Secondly, the fire and rescue service are examining the origin, causes and spread of the fire. Thirdly, there is currently a fire and rescue service accident investigation into the implications of the fire. The chief fire and rescue adviser, Sir Ken Knight, is in close contact with the ongoing investigations and is keeping me informed at all times. In addition to these investigations, there will be a coroner's inquest which, as part of its investigation, will examine the evidence submitted by the investigation teams. However, until the exact details are known, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the investigations in progress.</p>

	<p pid="f.1247W.2/2">We expect all local authorities to have plans and procedures in place to tackle emergency repairs and homelessness, and indications are that these have worked well in the aftermath of the summer floods. Government officials and homelessness specialist advisors have been in contact with some of the affected areas, to offer support for local authorities as they help their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="f.1247W.2/3">At a national level, the Government are making sure that local authorities and other agencies are supported to help householders, business and communities get back to normal as far as possible without unnecessary delays. To date we have made available a comprehensive package of up to &pound;63 million to assist the affected regions, including up to &pound;20 million in flood recovery grant from Communities and Local Government to support the recovery work of local authorities, and particularly their work with those in greatest and most immediate need. Local authorities have the flexibility to decide how to best to use the grant based on their own local circumstances. In practice, this has covered a wide range of action, including support payments to flood- affected households, and provision of temporary caravans to allow people to remain within their communities while houses are repaired.</p>
	<p pid="f.1247W.2/4">Flood-affected local authorities have also been able apply to Communities and Local Government for help through the Bellwin scheme which provides financial assistance to local authorities dealing with emergencies. Exceptionally, the terms of the present schemes have been made more generous because of the circumstances of the recent floods. 50 local authorities have registered for assistance for the June scheme and 52 have registered for the July scheme. 20 local authorities have registered for both schemes. Authorities have six months to spend under this scheme and two have now submitted interim claims.</p>
	<p pid="f.1247W.2/5">The Government continue to work closely with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to establish how the insurance industry is dealing with policy holders who have been hit by the floods. The ABI has made clear the insurance industry's commitment to maintaining momentum over the coming months in dealing with outstanding claims. However, it will still take time for some properties to dry out before the necessary repairs can be carried out, and this means that some people will not be back in their homes until next year.</p>

	<p pid="f.1248W.0/4">These visits have been useful opportunities for Ministers to meet local authority staff and members who are leading recovery efforts, and visits to affected areas will continue.</p>

	<p pid="f.1250W.11/1">The forecast of additional rental income arising from rent restructuring continuing in each year to 2011-12 would require the projection of dwelling stock totals to that date, which the Department does not have. Even with these data local authorities are free to set their own rents and so, although they will be mindful of the guideline rent in the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system, we would be unable to forecast what rent levels might be.</p>
	<p pid="f.1250W.11/2">For housing associations, the Housing Corporation does have stock projections extending to 2012, but not in a format that would allow the calculation of additional rental income as asked.

This is a routine function of the Communications Division and it is not possible to disaggregate the precise time or cost involved.</p>

	<p pid="f.1258W.8/1">As the United Kingdom (UK) never signed the Convention, and since the time for signing the Convention is closed, the process now would be for accession rather than ratification.</p>
	<p pid="f.1258W.8/2">The UK has no immediate plans to accede to the 1997 United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. Only 16 countries have ratified the Convention, whereas 35 countries are required for the Convention to enter into force. The Department for International Development (DFID) is currently reviewing the international development benefits of accession, and as part of this is seeking views from foreign Governments, NGOs and academics.</p>
	<p pid="f.1258W.8/3">DFID is supporting transboundary water processes in the Middle East, and in Africa through the Nile Basin Initiative. These demonstrate the value of practical approaches to transboundary cooperation on water that yield significant benefits. In neither case is accession to the Convention considered necessary for our support of these processes.</p>

	<p pid="f.1266W.12/1">Conservation of brown crab stocks is achieved currently through a restrictive national shellfish licensing scheme which limits the number of vessels allowed to participate in the fishery, through EU and national minimum landing sizes (which vary from region to region) and through strict limits on the quantities of crab claws that may be landed. There are also a range of measures applied by different Sea Fisheries Committees such as permit schemes, a prohibition on the landing of egg-bearing female crabs, seasonal closures and the incorporation of escape gaps in crab pots to allow undersized crabs to escape.</p>
	<p pid="f.1266W.12/2">In response to industry concerns about increasing levels of effort in brown crab fisheries, DEFRA circulated a discussion paper on a range of potential management measures in late 2006. DEFRA is considering the way forward in the light of responses to the discussion paper, which revealed no consensus on possible additional measures but tended towards support for an EU or regional solution.</p>

	<p pid="f.1267W.2/1">Assessments of brown crab stocks are made by Government scientists at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. Stocks are managed at both national and Sea Fisheries Committee level. Stocks appear to be stable at the moment but most brown crab grounds available to fisheries are known and fully utilised. The stocks are assessed in six &quot;stock management units&quot; defined as sea areas in England and Wales. Major crab fisheries exist in the Central North Sea, Southern North Sea, and Western Channel, while smaller crab fisheries exist in the Eastern Channel, Celtic Sea, and Irish Sea. Most crab fisheries tend to be heavily exploited and it would be inadvisable for fishing effort to increase beyond current levels. Females predominate in landings but there is no evidence of reduced levels of recruitment.</p>

	<p pid="f.1270W.6/1">Provided that the science clearly justifies them, DEFRA supports the concept of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) closed to fishing, both for sustainable management of fish stocks and for ecological reasons relating to species and habitats. The usefulness of protected areas as a fisheries conservation measure has to be evaluated in each individual case taking into account factors such as the biology of the stocks, character of the fishery, and other fisheries management measures already in place. It is recognised that there may be displacement of fishing effort from protected areas and these effects must also be managed. DEFRA commissioned a number of reports in order to help clarify the potential role of MPAs when applied to fisheries management. These are available on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="f.1270W.6/2">DEFRA intends to develop criteria for the selection of Marine Protected areas and then use those criteria to contribute to the development of an integrated approach to their designation and management, including the examination of the potential for fisheries conservation.</p>

	<p pid="f.1275W.11/1">Conservation of lobster stocks is achieved currently through a restrictive national shellfish licensing scheme which limits the number of vessels allowed to participate in the fishery. There are also local Sea Fisheries Committee (SFC) permit schemes, an EU minimum landing size, a national prohibition on the landing of v-notched or mutilated lobsters. A range of measures are also applied through SFCs, such as higher local minimum landing sizes, a prohibition on the landing of egg bearing (berried) female lobsters, the release of hatchery-reared juvenile lobsters into the wild, and escape gaps to allow undersized lobsters a route out of lobster pots.</p>
	<p pid="f.1275W.11/2">In response to industry concern about conservation in the major lobster fisheries, DEFRA has consulted on an increase in the minimum landing size, and on the introduction of a maximum landing size. DEFRA is considering a way forward in the light of responses to the consultation which revealed divided views amongst stakeholders.</p>

The fisheries are predominantly inshore, and known grounds are fully utilised. Assessments show that, while catch rates are stable or increasing and recruitment has recently been good, the stocks are heavily exploited tending towards overfishing. Expansion of the fishery is not recommended, and further conservation measures may be necessary.</p>

	<p pid="f.1276W.8/1">Around 6,000 marine species from UK waters (not including overseas territories) were recently assessed under a scientifically-reviewed process to decide which species should be placed on the Biodiversity Action Plan list for the UK. Criterion 3 of this assessment was for those species with a marked decline; i.e. those which have declined by 50 per cent. or more over the past 25 years. The decline may be in relation to population abundance, range or number of occupied sites. Where insufficient data exist, shorter time series have been extrapolated. 16 species were selected using this criterion:</p>

	<p pid="f.1281W.6/1">The Government consider that where there is a need for wildlife management then the proper use of snares is one of a range of control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical.</p>
	<p pid="f.1281W.6/2">The Government are committed to working to improve the legal use of snares. In 2005 DEFRA published its 'Snares Action Plan' and the 'Code of Good Practice on the use of Snares in Fox and Rabbit Control in England'. The DEFRA Code of Good Practice details the legal obligations for people using snares in England and emphasises the importance of weighing the possible risks to the welfare of wildlife against the need to capture pest animals. People choosing to use snares should be aware not only of their responsibilities under the law but also of these guidelines for good practice.</p>

	<p pid="f.1284W.6/5" class="indent">Information on the number of cases with Maintenance Direct as their preferred method of collection is provided in the attached table. These cases have been initially assessed by the Child Support Agency and both parents have come to an agreement that maintenance payments will be made directly without the further involvement of the Agency. These cases are still recorded by the Agency, and if their arrangement is not successful they may return to the Agency to have money collected via the Agency's Collection Service.</p>
	<p pid="f.1284W.6/6" class="indent">In addition, some child maintenance applications may have been cancelled or withdrawn as a result of both parents coming to their own arrangements. The reason for a case being cancelled or withdrawn is not held on the Agency's management information, and therefore we cannot provide figures on the number of these cases which go on to make their own voluntary financial arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="f.1284W.6/7" class="indent">It is also possible for parents with care who are not receiving benefit to come to their own arrangement without informing the Agency, meaning they are not recorded as Maintenance Direct cases. The most recent estimate is that there are currently around 500,000 voluntary arrangements in place that are made without any involvement of the Child Support Agency.</p>

	<p pid="f.1288W.2/1">Jobseeker's allowance (JSA) regulations, which govern the payment of JSA, state that to receive JSA the jobseeker must be in Great Britain. Therefore when a jobseeker goes abroad on holiday JSA is not payable, nor credit of national insurance contributions awarded, for the period they are away.</p>
	<p pid="f.1288W.2/2">Holidays taken within Great Britain are allowed provided the jobseeker remains available and actively seeking employment for the duration of the holiday. There is however, a concession within the regulations which allows jobseekers to be treated as actively seeking employment for two weeks in a 12 month period. This needs to be agreed in advance with the Jobcentre before the holiday commences. There is no limit to the number of weeks a jobseeker can be away from home but usually if the holiday exceeds four weeks the Jobcentre would advise the jobseeker to make a claim in the area they are staying in.</p>

Many NINO applicants with a legitimate right to work choose to apply for a NINO before starting work&mdash;and are able to prove their right to do so using Home Office specified documentary evidence.

	<p pid="f.1293W.5/1">Over the last 12 years there has been significant progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). There has been a transition from conflict to stability; free elections held across the country on seven occasions; over 1 million returns of refugees and internally displaced persons; membership of the Partnership For Peace; and significant defence reforms. Nonetheless, important challenges remain, including in the areas highlighted in the hon. Member's question.</p>
	<p pid="f.1293W.5/2">BiH urgently needs to bring its policing into line with European and international standards. This is essential if the country is to establish and maintain the rule of law. The EU police mission refocused its priorities in early 2006 to concentrate on the process of police reform and building capacity to tackle organised crime. Agreement on police restructuring is a key condition for the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. The politicisation of the police reform issue has obstructed the work of the Directorate for Police Restructuring and thus far prevented agreement on a way forward. The UK remains closely involved in trying to facilitate cross party political agreement. Progress on judicial reform has been reasonable, but implementation of a National Justice Sector Reform Strategy remains a priority. Defence reform is progressing well.</p>
	<p pid="f.1293W.5/3">BiH continues to make mixed progress on human rights. There is still a need to resolve outstanding issues from the 1992-95 conflict and ensure the sustainable return of displaced persons. BiH's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia improved in 2007. The Republika Srpska authorities assisted in the arrest of Zdravko Tolimir (one of the six high-profile indictees who remained at large at the start of 2007, wanted for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity) in May 2007. BiH has established a State Commission for the Preservation of National monuments. The UK supported the building of a memorial room near the site of the Srebrenica massacre, which opened in July 2007. We hope this will serve as a moving memorial to the victims.</p>

	<p pid="f.1294W.5/1">The Government recognise the importance of protecting endangered species in the Overseas Territories and is working with the Overseas Territories to achieve this, through funding for programmes and projects and the provision of technical support.</p>
	<p pid="f.1294W.5/2">There are a number of Government funded programmes that contribute to the protection of endangered species in the Overseas Territories. Programmes include:</p>
	<p pid="f.1294W.5/3">The Overseas Territories Environment Programme (OTEP), a joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development funded programme, makes available approximately &pound;1 million a year to assist the Overseas Territories with the implementation of their Environment Charters. The Charters include a list of commitments agreed by the Government and individual Overseas Territory governments to support sustainable use of environmental resources in the Overseas Territories. Among these are the protection and restoration of key habitats and species and support for general environmental management including protection of endangered species. OTEP has funded a feasibility study on Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island on the eradication of rodents to safeguard the Albatross and the Gough Bunting. The results of the study are expected in March 2008. Funding has also been provided this year to produce a management plan for Steeple Jason Island in the Falkland Islands aimed at better management and protection of Albatross and Petrels from outside influences including visitors and non-native invasive plants and animals.</p>
	<p pid="f.1294W.5/4">The Darwin Initiative is a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) funded programme that contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of the world's biodiversity, including protection of endangered species. UK experts work with local communities and organisations to help countries rich in biodiversity but who, through lack of resources, are unable to meet their obligations under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. The Initiative has funded 13 projects totalling around &pound;1.5 million in the Overseas Territories since it was launched in 1992. Projects have included the Montserrat Centre Hills and the Cayman Island &quot;In Ivan's Wake&quot; projects to put in place measures and legislation to protect and safeguard their native flora and fauna and endangered species.</p>
	<p pid="f.1294W.5/5">DEFRA also pay an annual subscription of &pound;36,000 to the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatross and Petrels (ACAP) Secretariat. DEFRA has also agreed to co-fund, with OTEP and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the establishment of an ACAP Co-ordinator for the Falkland Islands and the South Atlantic Overseas Territories. The co-ordinator will be responsible for ensuring up to date information concerning Albatross and Petrel populations in the South Atlantic Overseas Territories is fed into the ACAP Secretariat for dissemination to other interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="f.1294W.5/6">The Flagship Species Fund, administered by Fauna and Flora International, an international conservation charity supported by DEFRA has made approximately &pound;100,000 a year available since 2002 to provide practical support for the conservation of endangered species and their habitats in developing countries, including in the Overseas Territories. The Flagship Species Fund provided &pound;21,800 to support a project to eradicate rodents on Eagle Island in the British Indian Ocean Territory to safeguard native birds and turtles. DEFRA has allocated &pound;75,000 to the Flagship Species Fund for 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="f.1295W.2/1">Our assessment reveals that respect for human rights falls far below international standards. Of particular concern to us are the high numbers of political prisoners, violation of civil, political and economic rights and continued government repression of dissidents. Further information on our views of the human rights situation can be found in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's annual human rights report. A copy of the most recent report can be found in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="f.1295W.2/2">Transparency International rated Cuba 10 out of 32 in the Americas in its 2007 corruption survey. The Cuban government is aware of the risks of corruption and take active measures to counter it. The Government supports this aim and indeed a Government representative attended an international anti-corruption conference in Havana in November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="f.1295W.2/3">Our assessment of Cuban government policy on homosexuality is positive overall. The Cuban National Center for Sex Education is a government funded body which advocates tolerance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues on the island and which has recently proposed legislation on some of these issues.</p>

	<p pid="f.1301W.9/1">I am deeply concerned by Iran's deteriorating human rights record. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, in a powerful demonstration of international concern, the UN General Assembly's Third Committee voted in favour of a resolution&mdash;co-sponsored by the EU&mdash;expressing deep concern at the human rights situation in Iran. We remain concerned about the treatment of all minority groups in Iran, including discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Homosexuality is illegal by law and the death penalty remains on the books for consenting same sex relations, but we are not aware of any executions for this in recent years. However, the situation for transgender individuals is more positive: Iran has the second highest number of sex-change operations in the world and government grants are available for operations and hormone therapy.</p>
	<p pid="f.1301W.9/2">Disappointingly, Iran has persistently refused to engage in a human rights dialogue with the EU and has failed to address international concerns about human rights in Iran. But we continue to work hard with international partners to urge Iran to fulfil its human rights commitments and to improve their human rights record.</p>

	<p pid="f.1308W.6/1">Over the last 10 years, the main part of the Department's total expenditure on health research has been devolved to and managed by national health service organisations. During this time, the Department has also funded research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality improvement and service development in the NHS. Total reported expenditure on asthma by research active NHS organisations and similar expenditure by the Department's national research programmes, is shown in the following table.</p>

The purpose of the event will be to present the programme as a whole to representatives and to seek their feedback. This is in addition to the continuing involvement of patient and public representatives in the working groups and the National Advisory Group meeting. We are also planning to increase the number of public and patient representatives at the next National Advisory Group meeting.</p>

	<p pid="f.1315W.0/1">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) receives reports from microbiology laboratories of cases of blood stream infections caused by pseudomonas in its voluntary reporting scheme. These bacteria can cause a range of infections from mild skin infections to urinary tract infections. They can also cause a variety of bloodstream infections, particularly in patients with serious burns and those who are severely immunosuppressed such as cancer and AIDS patients. Most infection cases are reported from intensive care, burns, spinal injuries or cancer units.</p>

	<p pid="f.1315W.0/16">The increased rate of reporting of cases of pseudomonas is comparable to the increase seen for all blood poisoning via the HPA's voluntary surveillance scheme. The increase is partly due to better reporting, surveillance and testing and may also reflect a changing hospital population, with more patients who are vulnerable to infection through conditions which compromise their immune systems being treated.</p>

Before these local public consultations begin, Post Office Ltd. seeks detailed input from Postwatch, local authorities and sub-postmasters in developing its proposals. I understand that Post Office Ltd. takes the view that the combination of the pre-consultation phase and the subsequent six week of local public consultation period enables sufficiently robust consultations to take place at a local area level.

The early stages of developing Post Office Ltd.'s area plan proposals post office closures and new outreach service involve detailed plan development discussions with Postwatch and the involvement of local authorities in advance of formal public consultation. When combined with the subsequent six weeks of public consultation, the Government believe that this enables sufficiently robust consultations to take place at a local area level. We are also mindful of the fact that the organisation representing sub-postmasters argued for a speedy local consultation to minimise uncertainty for sub-postmasters and customers.</p>

In taking a strategic overview of service provision in areas of over-provision, Post Office Ltd. will ensure that people will be able to find an alternative branch nearby and the vast majority will still be within walking distance of their nearest office. With the least used offices, the numbers of people affected, will, by the nature of the offices, be low. I understand from Post Office Ltd. that under the area plan proposals for Sussex, 99.6. per cent. of the population will either see no change to the branch they currently use or will be within one mile of an alternative branch.</p>

The early stages of developing Post Office Ltd.'s area plan proposals involve detailed plan development discussions with Postwatch and the involvement of local authorities in advance of formal public consultation. When combined with the subsequent six weeks of public consultation, the Government believe that this will enable sufficiently robust consultations to take place at a local area level. We are also mindful of the fact that the organisation representing sub-postmasters argued for a speedy local consultation to minimise uncertainty for sub-postmasters and customers.</p>

	<p pid="f.1341W.8/1">The Department's retirement age is 65, although staff can retire at any age between 60 and 65 subject to giving three months notice. As the Department's retirement age was increased from age 60 to 65 in 2002, staff who continued working beyond age 60 are only now reaching 65. Staff are notified eight months before they are 65 of their right to request to work after they are 65 and their line manager considers their request.</p>

	<p pid="f.1360W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="f.1360W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking how many 18 to 24 year olds were unemployed in (a) West Chelmsford constituency and (b) Chelmsford local authority area in each September from 2001 to 2007. (170300)</p>
	<p pid="f.1360W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles unemployment statistics from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions. These are annual surveys and the estimates derived from them cover twelve month periods, rather than a particular month.</p>
	<p pid="f.1360W.5/5" class="indent">However, from the annual LFS and the APS, there are only two periods in the last 6 years where the sample sizes are sufficient to provide an estimate of the number of unemployed 18 to 24 year olds resident in the West Chelmsford constituency or Chelmsford local authority. These data are from the Annual local area LFS for the 12 month period ending in February for 2003 and from the APS for the 12 month period ending in March for 2005 as shown in Table 1.</p>
	<p pid="f.1360W.5/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area, they are based on very small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="f.1360W.5/7" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). Table 2 shows the number of JSA claimants aged 18 to 24, resident in West Chelmsford constituency and Chelmsford local authority, claiming in September for 2001 to 2007. The numbers are also shown as the percentage of all persons aged 18-24 resident in the areas. Percentages for the West Chelmsford constituency cannot be shown, as the working age population estimates for parliamentary constituencies cannot be broken down into different age groups.</p>

	<p pid="f.1362W.5/1">The European Community first applied to become a member of the WCO in 2001 because it has competence for most international trade matters. The WCO's establishing convention does not currently provide for customs and economic unions to become members and will need to be modified. This will take some time, so interim membership arrangements have been put in place and came into effect for the EC on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="f.1362W.5/2">As a member of the WCO, the EC is entitled to participate in all WCO bodies which are open to general membership. On issues subject to Community competence (which covers the majority of the WCO's work), the EC will cast a number of votes equal to the number of EU member states present at the meeting. For matters falling under joint or national competence, member states will continue to speak at meetings and to vote: the EC will not act on behalf of member states on these matters. However, member states and the European Commission will try to coordinate an agreed position where appropriate in order to present a unified view at WCO meetings.</p>
