Pervasive corruption within government and the security forces undermines the legitimacy of the Government and corrodes consent. Nearly one-fifth of the Afghan population believe corruption is the country's biggest problem and Afghanistan ranks second to last on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index. President Karzai made a commitment to tackling corruption in his inauguration speech and again at the London Conference. We expect him to demonstrate this commitment by creating independent institutions that can prevent, detect and take action against corrupt practices in government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1308W.5/1">This year, Treasury has made available administration budget funds to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)'s Corporate Services programme from the modernisation fund in order to make working practices more efficient in future. In particular, money has been invested in two restructuring initiatives: in the UK, an early retirement scheme was run for the delegated grades; and overseas, posts have bid for funds to make efficiency gains in their local workforce engaged in corporate services activity. Funds were also used for the FCO Comprehensive Spending Review Value for Money programme. &#163;400,000 was also passed on to UKTI to be spent on their modernisation programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1311W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)'s role under the Government's Achieving Universal Access HIV strategy is primarily focused on advocacy and lobbying to support the strategy's aims. Our work is targeted towards those countries in which issues of gender inequality, stigma and discrimination are stopping people from taking up preventive services and testing, disclosing their status, and seeking treatment and care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.5/2">In Cameroon, we have been fighting institutionalised and societal stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS through a project called 'Rights of AIDS Sufferers', run in the North West region. It has encouraged employers and socio-cultural groups to adopt specific policies that protect the rights of HIV-infected workers. The work of the project was reported nationally on TV and in the print media.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.5/3">Our embassy in Moscow is supporting an Oxfam project aimed at improving access and quality of health care for poor and marginalized groups, including those suffering from HIV and AIDS. The project strengthens the role of a coalition of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in holding government accountable for access to and quality of health care. The two year project covers seven regions of Russia. Some of the interim outcomes include an increased awareness by citizens of their rights and the involvement of NGOs in helping to draft regional legislation on accessible health care, with the NGO focusing on the poor and vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.5/4">HIV is a global issue and the FCO also works multilaterally for global leadership and effective funding for HIV prevention, treatment and care, including in the countries listed. The UK works on the UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board to push for improved human rights for at-risk communities and vulnerable people. For example, in November, the UK worked successfully with the Eastern Europe Constituency and others to protect financial resources for a HIV/AIDS prevention programme in Russia, targeted at high risk groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.5/5">In addition to our multilateral work, our Posts have been active in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, although no specific activities have been undertaken under the Strategy in Cote d'Ivoire or Thailand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.5/6">Thailand has been recognised as a visionary leader in the AIDS response, and our embassy in Bangkok is currently reassessing what action it might take, under the strategy, to support the Thai Government's efforts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1318W.3/1">The Government provided a range of additional support to pensioners through the recent economic downturn and continues to provide support during the early stages of economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/2">In his pre-Budget report statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-24">24 November 2008</phrase> the Chancellor announced the intention to give every pensioner a one-off payment of &#163;60 on top of the regular &#163;10 Christmas bonus received in December 2008. This was paid as a one-off increase to the Christmas bonus for 2008 only and was paid to all qualifying recipients of the Christmas bonus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/3">The payment provided additional direct financial support to help vulnerable groups through the economic downturn. In total the additional &#163;60 payments cost around &#163;900 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/4">The Government made an additional payment alongside the winter fuel payment for winters 2008-09 and 2009-10 of &#163;50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &#163;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. This means the winter fuel payments have been &#163;250 and &#163;400 respectively which provides a significant contribution towards an older person's winter fuel bill. Cold weather payments for the winter of 2008-09 and 2009-10 have also been increased from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25.00 providing additional support to the most vulnerable. With the exception of those living in certain accommodation such as care homes, all pensioners on pension credit will qualify for a cold weather payment when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be 0&#176; C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the eligible customer's postcode.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/5">In April 2010, the Government have committed to increase the basic state pension by 2.5 per cent. This commitment, first given in 2001, was confirmed in the Chancellor's 2009 pre-Budget report, despite the negative growth for the September 2009 retail prices index, providing a real-terms boost to basic state pension. This means that in 2010-11, pensioners will have seen a long-term real increase of 12 per cent. in their basic state pension, which is over &#163;10 per week, since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/6">The Chancellor has also confirmed that from April 2010 the poorest pensioners will also benefit from an above indexation increase in the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit, an increase of &#163;2.60 a week for single people and &#163;3.95 for couples. This means that, from April 2010, no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;132.60 a week and no couple on less than &#163;202.40. That is a real terms increase of more than a third for the poorest pensioners since 1997. The 2 per cent. increase ensures that the vast majority of the poorest pensioners will be able to see the full benefit of the 2.5 per cent. increase in the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/7">In order to help those pensioners who receive income from savings and who may have been affected by lower interest rates, the Government have increased the threshold in pension credit (and housing and council tax benefit for those who have attained the qualifying age for pension credit) from &#163;6,000 to &#163;10,000 from November 2009, so that pensioners can have up to &#163;10,000 without it affecting their benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/8">This change will benefit around 500,000 pensioners and will mean around 88 per cent. of pension credit recipients will have all of their capital ignored in their pension credit assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/9">The Government also increased ISA limits up to &#163;10,200 for people aged 50 and over from <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-06">6 October 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/10">Since November 2008, the Government have maintained the standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest at 6.08 per cent. to provide support for homeowners on pension credit who receive help with their mortgage. In his pre-Budget report on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-09">9 December 2009</phrase>, the Chancellor announced that the rate of 6.08 per cent. would be maintained for a further six months, to provide continued support to these customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1318W.3/11">The Government also launched a tax back awareness campaign in autumn 2009 contacting all those in receipt of pension credit to encourage them to claim back tax they may have overpaid on their savings income and, where possible, register to receive interest on their savings tax-free in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1320W.8/1">As the biggest delivery Department in the UK, DWP makes a difference to millions of people every day, helping them to lead safer, fairer and more rewarding lives that are free from poverty. The policies that we have introduced since 1997 have aimed to give people more choice and control over their lives. Through our welfare reform programme, we are committed to providing personalised support to everyone who needs it so they have the opportunity to get into and remain in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/2" class="italic"> Support to find work</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since 1997, the number of people unemployed in Vauxhall has decreased by 27 per cent. to 5,067, and the number unemployed for more than one year has decreased by 71 per cent. to 810. Since 1997 to May 2009 the number of lone parents claiming income support in Vauxhall has decreased by 43 per cent. to 3,090.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/4">Our New Deal programmes have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Since their inception over 2.2 million people in the UK have found work with the support of the New Deal, and 7,510 have been helped in Vauxhall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/5" class="italic"> Support for children</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/6">We introduced a target to halve child poverty by 2010-11 on the way to eradicating it by 2020. Poverty is measured using a headline indicator of the proportion of children in households with an income below 60 per cent. of contemporary household median income before housing costs. This is in line with international best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/7">Statistics on the numbers of children living in poverty are not available at the constituency level, but the latest information for the inner London area shows that the proportion of children in poverty fell from 39 per cent. to 27 per cent. since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/8" class="italic"> Support for older people</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/9">Since 1997 our strategy has been to target extra help at the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/10">This year we will be spending over &#163;13 billion more on pensioners than if we had continued with the policies that were in place in 1997. Around half of that money will go to the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/11">In 1997 the poorest pensioners, who received income support, lived on &#163;69 a week (&#163;98 in today's prices). Today pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, means no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;130 a week, &#163;198.45 for couples. As of May 2009, 5,260 pensioners in Vauxhall are receiving pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/12">In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners living in relative poverty in the UK compared to 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs). Statistics on the numbers of pensioners living in relative poverty are not available at the constituency level, but the latest information for the inner London area shows that the proportion of pensioners in poverty has fallen from 42 per cent. to 29 per cent. since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/13">Pensioners in the UK also benefit from a range of additional support such as the winter fuel payment which this winter is worth &#163;250 for households aged between 60-79 and &#163;400 for households aged 80 or over. These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than &#163;60 million was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-this year we will be spending around &#163;2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In 2008-09, 11,950 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Vauxhall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/14">We have also taken steps to strengthen and protect the private pensions system to ensure people can continue to have confidence to save for their future through the establishment of the Pensions Protection Fund, the Financial Assistance Scheme and a more powerful and proactive pensions regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/15">The protection system ensures that, unlike in 1997, people aren't left without a pension even in the event that their employer becomes insolvent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/16">In total 423 people in the London area are receiving compensation from the Pension Protection Fund (data not available at constituency level).</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/17">We have also taken forward a radical package of pension reforms in the Pensions Acts of 2007 and 2008 which will deliver a fairer and more generous state pension and extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/18">The state pension reforms begin to come into effect from 2010 and will mean around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to qualify for a full basic state pension compared to half without reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/19" class="italic"> Support for disabled people and carers</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.8/20">Since 2001, we have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Vauxhall will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. Older and less well-off carers are receiving extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1322W.2/1">In October 2008, with the introduction of employment and support allowance, the work capability assessment replaced the personal capability assessment for all new claims. The new assessment was developed in consultation with representative groups and medical experts, to provide a more accurate assessment of an individual's functional capability in the context of a modern workplace, who concluded that the three point descriptors did not add up to an overall level of functional limitation at which it is unreasonable to expect a person to work. They reflect the sort of condition that any individual can expect to experience, without having any significant functional limitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1323W.3/2">Since November 2006, there has been an increase of nearly 140 per cent. in all UK battlefield helicopter flying hours. We will enhance our helicopter capability further, and will ensure that it continues to meet operational requirements. For example, we are converting eight Chinook Mk 3 aircraft to a support helicopter role and this will allow us to deliver more Chinooks to Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1346W.3/2">David Blakey CBE QPM DL, formerly Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Chief Constable of West Mercia, was commissioned by the Director General of NOMS, at the Justice Secretary's request, with undertaking a review of the effectiveness of HM Prison Service's measures for disrupting the supply of illicit drugs in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1346W.3/3">Mr. Blakey confirmed the five main routes for illicit drugs to get into prisons, and noted that the use of each route and the traffic flowing along it will alter from time to time and from place to place. He recognised the link between the availability of phones in prisons and the smuggling of illicit drugs. NOMS is determined to address the risks that mobile phones present to security and to the safety of the public. Our strategy is to: minimise the number of mobile phones entering prisons; find mobile phones that are smuggled into prisons; and disrupt mobile phones that we cannot find.</p>

	<p pid="a.1346W.6/1">Crowding levels are set and managed carefully by the National Offender Management Service. Prison crowding occurs when the number of prisoners in an accommodation unit exceeds the certified normal capacity (CNA) of that unit. A prison's &quot;certified normal accommodation&quot; (CNA) is therefore its agreed capacity when there is no crowding. A prison's &quot;operational capacity&quot; is the maximum number of prisoners it is allowed to hold over and above CNA taking into account control, security and the proper operation of regimes. In addition operational managers must ensure that each cell used for the confinement of prisoners has sufficient heating, lighting and ventilation and is of adequate size for the number of prisoners to be held in it. Operational capacity in prisons is set by Directors of Offender Management on behalf of the Secretary of State in both publicly managed and contracted establishments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1347W.2/2">These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made. This is more accurate than the number of orders, removing the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order.

The number of claims that lead to an order includes all claims in which the first order, whether outright or suspended, is made during the period.  5. The court, following a judicial hearing, may grant an order for possession immediately. This entitles the claimant to apply for a warrant to have the defendant evicted. However, even where a warrant for possession is issued, the parties can still negotiate a compromise to prevent eviction.  6. Includes outright and suspended orders, the latter being where the court grants the claimant possession but suspends the operation of the order. Provided the defendant complies with the terms of suspension, which usually require the defendant to pay the current mortgage or rent instalments plus some of the accrued arrears, the possession order cannot be enforced.  7.

	<p pid="a.1350W.5/1">EU rules for organic production (contained in Council Regulation 834/2007 and Commission Regulation 889/2008) require organic livestock to be fed entirely on organically produced feed. However, until <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>, they also permit 5 per cent. of the feed for organic pigs and poultry to be composed of conventionally produced materials when sufficient organic feed cannot be obtained.

DEFRA's Advisory Committee on Organic Standards is investigating the role that fishmeal can play, as a protein source for organic pig and poultry feed, when the requirement for these animals to be given 100 per cent. organic feed begins on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>.</p>

These include facilitating timely employee access to occupational health advice, medical or wellbeing interventions. Additionally, managers hold return-to-work interviews to discuss employees' reasons for absence, including any work-related issues connected with their absence.

We are also considering the case for introducing a minimum mandatory buying standard for central Government for food and catering, including for the procurement of seafood from sustainable sources.</p>

	<p pid="a.1354W.2/1">DEFRA does not currently fund any research aimed specifically at examining the damage caused by trawling on aquatic reefs and plants. Earlier research has however helped to establish the extent to which fishing practices such as trawling had on the wider benthic community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.2/2">This early work has enabled us to be better informed about how we might help protect sensitive habitats such as reefs. DEFRA is currently funding a research project in Lyme Bay to examine how the seabed recovers within a Marine Protected Area. No scallop dredging or bottom trawling is allowed and the project aims to monitor the effects of the MPA, including the recovery of benthic communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.2/3">Reefs are one of the habitats listed for which Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) are required to be designated under the EC habitats directive. Between 2004 and 2009 the Joint Nature Conservation Committee carried out a number of surveys in UK offshore waters to identify reef sites suitable for SAC designation. Details of these surveys can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1354W.2/5">To date 37 SACs with reef as a qualifying habitat have been designated, with further sites subject to consultation or further analysis of data. By the end of 2012 it is estimated that around 36 per cent. of the UK reef habitat will be protected by European designations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.2/6">You will be interested to note that Charting Progress 2, which is due to be published in July 2010, has examined both the state and impact from pressures such as fishing on different components of the marine ecosystem, within the marine environment, to provide an overall assessment of the UK's seas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1354W.5/1">Industrial fishing is the term applied to fishing activity where the catch is intended for processing into fish meal and oil rather than for human consumption. Industrial fishing uses smaller meshed nets than human consumption fisheries as they are targeting fish which are small even when fully grown and this will inevitably lead to the capture of small, often immature, individuals of other species.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.5/2">In European waters, industrial fishing is undertaken for blue whiting, Norway pout, sandeel and sprat. The Norway pout and sandeel fisheries are exclusively industrial and are conducted in the North sea and Skagerrak, while the blue whiting fishery is only partly industrial and considerably more geographically widespread.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.5/3">Fish stocks in EU waters are assessed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). There are linkages between sandeel fishing and other species through by-catch, although scientific advice indicates that by-catches of prime human consumption species within the sandeel fishery are relatively small compared to the fisheries for human consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.5/4">ICES annually calculates industrial by-catches; i.e. landings of non-target species, for whiting and haddock in the North sea. Landings of North sea whiting from the industrial fisheries were 1,230 tonnes and 1,020 tonnes in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Landings of North sea haddock from the industrial fisheries were 48 tonnes and 199 tonnes in 2007 and 2008, respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354W.5/5">ICES has yet to analyse the data for 2009 and hence results will not be available until later in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.1355W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.2/2"><i> (a)</i> My Department and the Scottish Executive have, in the past, commissioned research into industrial fishing. Although there are currently no specific projects being undertaken, the UK Government continue to support work on sandeels and their predators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.2/3">Most recently, a major study by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science which investigated the direct and indirect impacts of the sandeel fishery off the coast of eastern England was completed in March 2007. In addition, the Scottish Executive supported an EU-funded project: 'Interactions Between the Marine Environment, Predator Implications for Sustainable Sandeel Fisheries', which concluded before 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.2/4"><i> (b)</i> On the effect on the level of fish stocks of industrial fishing techniques, the UK, through the Scottish Government continues to support work on sandeels and their predators, through monitoring of the North east UK area closure. Local studies of cod, haddock and whiting predation on sandeels before and after the closure was introduced in 2000, found no evidence of an effect, although the reduction in fishing mortality did lead to an increase in the abundance of age one and older sandeels. The lack of a fishing effect probably had more to do with the difference in the age of sandeel taken by these predators and the fishery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.2/5">The cod, haddock and whiting in this study mostly fed on young sandeels of the year, whereas the fishery targeted age one and older sandeels. The local abundance of cod and haddock in the study-region reflected wider North sea wide trends, suggesting that local conditions were not determining abundance. Had there been significant numbers of large cod and haddock in the region, then competition between the sandeel fishery and these species may have been more important, since the size and age of sandeels taken is limited by predator size.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.2/6">The UK will continue to monitor industrial fisheries in EU waters.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356W.5/1">Government policy is to manage waste as far up the waste hierarchy as possible-with energy from waste ranking higher than landfill but below waste prevention, re-use, and recycling. The Government's view of incineration and similar technologies is that they form just one among several approaches, all of which are needed for sustainable and effective waste management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356W.5/2">It is recognised that there will always be some waste streams that cannot be re-used, recycled or composted and recovering energy from that waste, including by incineration, results in less greenhouse gas emissions compared to the alternative of landfill. Producing energy from this waste, which would otherwise have gone to landfill, not only contributes to reducing carbon emissions, but also counts towards our renewable energy targets by displacing fossil fuel power generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356W.5/3">The choice in technology needs to reflect local circumstances, with reference to the relevant waste strategies and plans, so that proposed waste incineration plants are of an appropriate type and scale and do not prejudice the achievement of local, regional or national waste management targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1357W.11/1">The European Court of Justice's recent ruling in the case of C-386/08 (Brita-Gmbh) concerned the procedures which a EU member state's customs authority should follow in a case where imported goods are shown as being of Israeli origin, and preferential customs tariff treatment is claimed under the EC-Israel Association Agreement, but where there is reason to suppose that the goods in question did in fact originate in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs).</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.11/2">This ruling will have no effect on DEFRA's policies on food imports originating in the OPTs, since the Court's ruling confirms the correctness of the procedures that are already operated in the UK by HM Revenue and Customs.

	<p pid="a.1366W.5/1">Our policies and legislation since 1997 have provided a new framework benefitting all local transport authorities. The framework gives greater certainty of funding, while encouraging more strategic transport planning with local consultation, and increasing local flexibility and discretion over resources. It has been accompanied by a significant increase in capital funding: support from the Department for transport investment in North East Lincolnshire, within which transport authority Great Grimsby falls, has more than doubled over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.5/2">Investment in North East Lincolnshire council's local transport plan has delivered a number of improvements to the quality, safety and accessibility of the local transport network. Between 2004 and 2008, bus patronage per head of population increased by 19 per cent. and the number of people killed or seriously injured on the local highway network decreased by 13 per cent. in the period 2001-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.5/3">In 2002, North East Lincolnshire council received a total of &#163;719,000 from the Department's Urban and Rural Bus Challenge funds to establish the Phone 'n' Ride community travel initiative. Phone 'n' Ride is a demand-responsive bus service for those members of the community who have difficulty accessing employment, education, healthcare and leisure services due to a lack of transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.5/4">In 2005, North East Lincolnshire council submitted a successful bid to the Department for 'Kickstart' revenue funding of improvements to the Grimsby and Cleethorpes bus network. The &#163;523,000 award facilitated the introduction of high-frequency services on routes 13 and 14, linking the area's main residential estates with Grimsby and Cleethorpes town centres. It was accompanied by an investment of almost &#163;2 million by Stagecoach in 23 new low-floor buses for the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.5/5">Following a successful bid by North East Lincolnshire council and First TransPennine Express, it was announced in April 2006 that Grimsby Town station would receive &#163;53,000 to improve disabled access and facilities. The improvements, funded as part of the Department's Access for All Strategy, include an enlarged waiting room, improved flooring and lighting, and a new ticket window.</p>

	<p pid="a.1377W.2/2">All foreign nationals subject to removal will be considered by National Offender Management Service under the early removals scheme (ERS), which allows for early removal up to a maximum of 270 days prior to the halfway point of the sentence, subject to the serving of a requisite period. Since 2008, the UKBA has removed approximately 11,000 foreign national prisoners. Of these, approximately a quarter were removed before the end of the sentence under the ERS and approximately 30 per cent. were removed under the facilitated returns scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/3">We do not publish a breakdown by nationality of the foreign national prisoners removed or deported from the UK. Information on total removals and voluntary departures from the UK by nationality is published quarterly. The latest can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/immiq309supp1.xls">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/immiq309 supp1.xls</a>#'TableF'!A1</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/5">Of those removed directly from prison under ERS since 2008, the average sentence length was between three and four years and approximately two-thirds were serving a sentence of less than four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/6">Of those removed from the UK under the FRS scheme since 2008, the average sentence length was between two and three years and approximately three-quarters were serving a sentence of less than four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/7">This is taken from provisional management information and subject to change. Data from before 2008 could be obtained only by referencing individual case files. This would be at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/8">In both 2008 and between quarters 1 and 3 of 2009 less than three-quarters removed under FRS claimed the reintegration package on return and of those that did, the average amount received was less than &#163;2,500 for 2008 and &#163;3,500 for quarters 1 to 3 of 2009. There is no financial package associated with ERS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/9">All foreign national prisoners are entered on the watch list when removed so checks can be made to prevent those who are barred and those who have no right from entering the UK. To provide information on foreign nationals who have been removed and gone on to re-offend would require the examination of individual records which would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

In these circumstances cases will be considered by four officers at various stages of the NRM process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.3/4">There will be instances where a case is assigned to a competent authority who becomes unavailable part way through consideration due to illness or a change in role. These circumstances are rare but where they occur they will result in the case being reallocated to another case owner.</p>

	<p pid="a.1379W.6/2">The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) for identifying victims of human trafficking includes a decision on whether a person is conclusively found to be a victim of trafficking. This is separate from the asylum system, which involves an assessment of whether someone has a well founded fear of persecution under the 1951 Geneva Convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.6/3">It will be under a particular set of circumstances where there has been an asylum application leading to an asylum interview as well as a conclusive grounds trafficking decision for the same individual.

	<p pid="a.1384W.5/1">Information on time spent on patrol and paperwork was collected between 2003-04 and 2007-08 as part of the frontline policing measure and is set out in the following table. Information was not collected on time spent on patrol in cars and on foot. To reduce paperwork burdens on police officers the collection of data about time spent by officers on police activities ceased after 2007-08 in response to the recommendations by Sir David Normington in his review of data burdens placed by the Government on the police service published in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/2">The figure for time spent on patrol does not include everything done by an officer engaged in frontline policing. It only measures the time an officer is engaged on no other activity but patrol, for example as soon as they respond to an incident they are counted against that activity and not patrol. It is therefore inappropriate to look at the patrol element in isolation from the rest of the frontline policing measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/3">Policing necessarily requires a degree of paperwork: to ensure accountability in the use of powers, prepare case files, and take witness statements. Non-incident paperwork includes handling complaints. All of these activities are part of providing a modern, effective and accountable police service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1386W.12/1">As a result of changes introduced since 2004, all families in London (as elsewhere in England) with three and four-year-olds are entitled to 12.5 hours of free early learning and child care per week, and this will rise to 15 hours per week from September 2010. Since September 2009, all local authorities in London have also received funding of 10 hours of free early learning and child care per week to their 15 per cent. most disadvantaged two-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386W.12/2">Parents in London can also receive support for child care costs through the tax credits system. In 2006, the threshold of costs that were available to parents was increased from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. In London the number of families benefiting increased by over 12,000 between 2004-05 and 2007-08 (the latest year for which figures are available).</p>
	<p pid="a.1386W.12/3">From 2005 to 2009, a joint initiative by the Government and the London Development Agency, the London Childcare Affordability Pilots 2005, offered parents more affordable and flexible child care places. At its peak the pilot provided over 6,000 subsidised flexible day care places.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386W.12/4">Since 2009 the Childcare Affordability Pilots have been trialling with London families two possible improvements to the support for child care costs that they receive through the child care element of working tax credit. The pilots are assessing the impact on child care take up of offering families 100 per cent. of their child care costs up to &#163;215 per week for one child rather than the usual &#163;140; and, for families with a disabled child, paying 80 per cent. of their child care costs up &#163;300 per week for one child. Both strands offer up to &#163;350 per week if parents have more than one child.</p>

In each of the last five quarters (July 2008 to September 2009), the abortion rate was lower than the corresponding quarter in the preceding year. As these decreases in the abortion rate coincide with the period in which the additional investment was available, we believe that the additional investment, and other measures we have taken, has made a contribution towards the decreases in the abortion rate.</p>

Many strategic health authorities and primary care trusts have developed their own policies on which treatments they will provide based one the safety and clinical and cost-effectiveness of a treatment as well as the availability of suitably qualified/regulated practitioners. When developing guidance for the management of health conditions, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) considers complementary therapies, where appropriate and sufficient evidence of effectiveness exists, alongside conventional treatments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1403W.1/2">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 confers a duty on NHS providers to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, including making information accessible to people with visual impairments. The NHS Constitution also commits the NHS to offer patients accessible information to enable them to participate fully in their health care decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.1/3">Under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 each NHS organisation is required to develop a Disability Equality Scheme, based on real engagement with local people, including those who are blind or partially sighted. They are required to implement the action plans set out in their schemes; and report annually on their progress, the results of their information gathering and how this information has been used.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.1/4">Listed Government Departments, including the Department, must publish a report setting out an overview of progress on disability equality as well as proposals for co-ordinated action between authorities in the sector to progress disability equality. The Department's first report, which was published in December 2008, acknowledges that patients who are blind or have severe visual impairments report significantly lower levels of satisfaction when making choices following a referral for hospital treatment. The introduction of data broken down by impairment in national GP access and choice surveys will allow NHS organisations in addressing such differences in satisfaction levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.1/5">To support service improvements, the Department has also co-produced &quot;Improving Access, Responding to Patients: a 'how to' guide for GP practices&quot; in 2009. This guide brings together good practice case studies with step-by-step guides and top tips, developed and disseminated by national stakeholders. It has been distributed to every GP practice, primary care trust and strategic health authority in England and a copy has already been placed in the Library.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-02-23.466"><i> Official Report</i>, 23 February 2010, column 466W</phrase> which gave estimates for the amount of biomass needed for new power stations. For existing heat and power installations, the Department's Digest of UK Energy Statistics shows that in 2008 3.23 million tonnes (oil equivalent) of biomass were used to generate electricity and 0.74 million tonnes (oil equivalent) of biomass were used to generate heat. Assuming an average energy value of 18 gigajoules per tonne of biomass, this gives a total of 7.5 million tonnes of biomass for electricity generation and 1.7 million tonnes of biomass for heat generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.3/3">Full records are not currently available for the country of origin of biomass used in the UK. Robust biomass supply chains are only now becoming established across the UK and biomass fuels are increasingly traded as a global commodity. The share of imports will depend on numerous factors, including progress with developing indigenous supply chains for waste wood, virgin material and energy crops. Heat-only installations are more likely to use UK sourced feedstocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.3/4">The European Commission's recently published recommendations for sustainability criteria for solid biomass include a recommendation to monitor the origin of feedstocks. DECC will make an announcement later this month, setting out what actions the Government can now take to introduce sustainability standards for biomass used for heat and electricity in the UK. We already require sustainability reporting under the renewables obligation. This requirement was introduced in April 2009 and the first reporting cycle is due later this year. The sustainability report will include data on the type and origin of biomass used for electricity generation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1405W.9/1">As part of the Draft Nuclear National Policy Statement (NPS) an appraisal of sustainability was carried out. The Main Appraisal of Sustainability Report<sup>(1)</sup> (Chapter 6) and Annex K<sup>(2)</sup> present the findings for the arrangements for managing radioactive and hazardous wastes arising from the Nuclear NPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/2">The main hazardous material that is expected to be stored at new nuclear power stations will be spent fuel. It is the operator's responsibility to provide storage facilities for the waste produced. Storage facilities will have to satisfy the requirements of the independent safety, security and environmental regulators. The quantity of spent fuel produced by a single new nuclear power station depends on a number of factors, including the capacity of the plant, its operational lifetime and various other operational considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/3">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) has estimated that an AP-1000 reactor operating for 60 years would give rise to an estimated 2,560 spent fuel assemblies, equivalent to 640 disposal canisters. And that a UK EPR reactor operating for 60 years would give rise to an estimated 3,600 spent fuel assemblies, equivalent to 900 disposal canisters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/4">It is possible that interim storage facilities for spent fuel could be required for around 160 years (estimated 60 years station operating life, 100 years cooling period prior to disposal). However, the estimate of up to 100 years cooling is based on a set of conservative assumptions and there are a number of factors that may shorten the actual storage period that is likely to be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/5">The actual cooling time required will depend in practice upon the level of burn-up achieved, designs of the disposal package, the disposal concept and design and its geological setting, which will all offer scope for optimisation and consequent shortening of the required storage time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/6">The activity and dose rate of spent fuel from new reactors are presented in the NDA's Disposability Assessment Reports for the AP-1000<sup>(4)</sup> and UK EPR<sup>(5)</sup> reactors. The NDA concluded in its assessments that the radionuclide characteristics of spent fuel from the AP-1000 and UK EPR reactors are consistent with those from Sizewell B Pressurised Water Reactor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/7">There will also be other hazardous materials produced. These will include intermediate level wastes (ILW), low level wastes (LLW) and non-radioactive hazardous wastes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/8">The volume of packaged ILW (both operational and decommissioning) produced by a UK EPR operating for 60 years is estimated to be in the range 2,097-3,65lm<sup>(3 )</sup>dependent upon the packaging system used. For an AP-1000 operating for 60 years, the volume of packaged ILW produced is estimated to be around 3,450m<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/9">The Government expects that ILW will be safely and securely stored on site as it is for current UK nuclear power stations. The ILW will be disposed of when a geological disposal facility is available to accept this waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/10">The NDA has assessed the activity and dose rate from ILW and reported that the principal radionuclides present in the wastes are similar to those present in the wastes arising from Sizewell B Pressurised Water Reactor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.9/11">Long-term storage on site of LLW and non-radioactive hazardous wastes is not expected to take place. Regulators discourage accumulation of waste at sites of origin if a disposal route is available. These wastes are expected to be disposed of promptly, after it has been generated, through a suitable disposal route.</p>

In addition to the ETF, in Budget 2009, we announced up to &#163;90 million for FEED studies in support of the first CCS demonstration competition, and a further &#163;45 million for microgeneration. Budget 2009 also announced &#163;155 million for low carbon technologies in 2009-10 and 2010-11.

The number of assessors contracted to the scheme has fluctuated over this period; it is not therefore possible to provide an accurate figure for the number of assessments each assessor has carried out over the period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408W.0/3">Eaga, the Warm Front scheme manager, is currently considering scheme activity for 2010-11. As part of this, eaga will consider the anticipated level of assessments to be carried out, which in turn will determine the number of assessors required for the year.</p>

We already require sustainability reporting under the Renewables Obligation. This requirement was introduced in April 2009 and the first reporting cycle is due later this year. The sustainability report will include the available data on the type and country of origin of the biomass used for electricity generation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1412W.2/1">Data for earnings are not available at the constituency level because of small sample sizes at these levels in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).</p>
	<p pid="a.1412W.2/2">Due to rounding in the conversion of payroll data into hourly wage rates and small sample sizes for 18 to 21-year-olds in ASHE, it is not possible at the regional level to infer the number of employees earning exactly at the National Minimum Wage (NMW) with sufficient certainty. However it is possible to estimate the number who were paid at or below the NMW.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412W.2/3">The most recent figure from BIS analysis of the 2009 ASHE indicates the number of jobholders aged 18 to 21 who were paid at or below the NMW in April 2009 in Scotland was 11,000. The number of jobholders aged 22 and over who were paid at or below the NMW in Scotland was 51,000.</p>
