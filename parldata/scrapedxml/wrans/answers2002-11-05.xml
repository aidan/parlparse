	<p pid=".155W.6/2">The rules for procuring focus group research are the same as for procuring other types of service. In the Cabinet Office, commissions estimated to cost #10,000 or more are normally subject to formal competitive tendering. Commissions estimated to cost less than #10,000 are normally awarded following receipt of competitive quotations.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.6/3">The GCDA does not commission focus group research. However the COI does, not on its own behalf but on behalf of its government clients. In such cases COI asks three of its roster of suppliers (appointed competitively under EC procurement rules) to submit proposals and costs; the supplier providing the best value for money proposal is appointed. On occasion, the client requires urgent research and COI appoints the roster supplier that it considers to be the appropriate agency for the work.</p>

	<p pid=".157W.5/1">We are taking active and immediate steps to tackle this difficult problem. The Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 contains measures to require all number plates suppliers in England and Wales to register with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). This requirement will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> and will ensure that in future number plates are only sold by registered suppliers to a purchaser who can show proof of entitlement to that registration mark and proof of their own identity. Records will be kept of all sales for inspection by police or local authority trading standards officers.</p>

A prototype container was produced in spring 2002 for the Minimodal scheme, with trials taking place during the summer. The first trials of the Exel scheme were completed in July-August 2001 with the second trials completed in spring this year.

Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry meets with the chairmen of regional development agencies regularly and consults them on matters of interest to them and businesses in their regions.

Organisations consulted&mdash;and invited to progress meetings (the West Midlands as in other regions) include the CBI, engineering, Employers Federation, RDA, Business Links, Cambers of Commerce, Learning and Skills Councils, local authorities, universities, local enterprise agencies, trade associations, research and technology organisations and other business support bodies.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.8/1">Unsolicited direct marketing by telephone has been subject to regulation in the UK since 1999, and there are also consumer protections if individuals enter into contracts during this kind of call.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.8/2">The current regulations are the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 19995 which provide that individual subscribers who do not wish to receive this type of call can register with a central list&mdash;the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). Direct marketers are obliged to check that they do not call numbers on the TPS list when making unsolicited calls. Direct marketers are also obliged to take account of any requests not to call again that they receive direct from individual subscribers. Further details are available on the DTI website at the following URL: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/cii/regulatory/telecomms/telecommsergulations/ectelecommsdataprotection.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/cii/regulatory/telecomms/telecommsergulations/ec telecomms data protection.shtml</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.8/4">Organisations that market by telephone to individuals must also comply with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 that came into force in October 2000. These regulations require those making unsolicited direct marketing calls to identify clearly the company they represent and the commercial purpose of the call at the beginning of the conversation. They also stipulate that the consumer has the right to receive clear information in advance of any decision to purchase, subsequent written acknowledgement of this information., and a seven-day cooling off period for most contracts agreed at a distance.

Direct assistance to Cote d'lvoire is limited to financial contributions that we make to the West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA) in Bouake and a Small Grants Scheme, administered by the British ambassador in Abidjan. Beneficiaries of the scheme are mainly Ivorian NGO's.</p>

	<p pid=".177W.5/1">Recorded crime statistics do not normally identify the location of offences, or the occupation of victims. The one recorded crime which can be identified as retail crime is theft from a shop, and figures for each police force area for the last three years are given in the table. The figures may have been affected in comparison to the previous year as a result of changes to recording practices. Some police forces implemented the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in advance of its national implementation on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. This had the estimated effect of uplifting total recorded crime figures by 5 per cent. this year.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.5/2">Figures on the location of firearms robberies indicate that there were 1,323 robberies in shops in the 2000&ndash;01 financial year. This includes offences where air weapons, imitation weapons and unidentified firearms were used.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.5/3">The Home Office, together with the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), will shortly be undertaking a major cross-Government survey of crime that affects retail and manufacturing premises across England and Wales. More than 3,000 premises will be surveyed in each of these sectors. The survey will collect detailed information on the circumstances of crime against business, levels of concern about crime, the overall social and economic impact of crime on businesses and levels of satisfaction with police response and advice on crime.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.6/1">The OECD report gives a positive overall picture of UK pupils' engagement with school, with above-average scores against a series of measures. Noise and disorder were perceived as problems by 3 percentage points fewer pupils in the UK than the average across other OECD countries, boredom with school by 6 percentage points more.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.6/2">These figures relate to the year 2000. We believe good teaching and a good curriculum are the best ways to engage and motivate pupils. We have introduced a wide range of strategies to improve teaching and learning, including our widely- acclaimed Literacy and Numeracy Strategies. Since September 2001 we have been implementing our new strategy to improve the attainment of 14 year olds (the Key Stage 3 Strategy). There have already been major improvements: OFSTED now rate nearly 70 per cent. of lessons as good compared with 40 per cent. five years ago. We are also making it a top priority to tackle problems of bad behaviour, including a 50 million.</p>

	<p pid=".188W.2/2">The general consensus among practitioners in England is that the teaching of English as an additional language (EAL) is most effective where it is firmly embedded in classroom practice across all national curriculum subject areas. This ensures that pupils have the opportunity to learn English in a meaningful subject specific context. That approach is reflected in the guidance issued by the Department on teaching EAL as part of the national strategies on literacy, numeracy and Key Stage 3. Many schools use the resources provided through the Department's #154 million Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG) programme to provide additional tailored support for bilingual learners.</p>

	<p pid=".194W.2/1">Since the launch of digital terrestrial television it has been possible to offer only an audio service for BBC Parliament. In its bid to the Independent Television Commission for the former ITV digital multiplex B, and in its subsequent application for a digital programme service licence, the BBC proposed to enhance this service by offering BBC Parliament in video on quarter screen. This arrangement allows the BBC to offer explanatory text simultaneously on screen in addition to the video service and to provide more services on the digital terrestrial platform. With the launch of Freeview this service will now be widely available.</p>

	<p pid=".195W.9/2">The information currently available suggests that, throughout the period, around 5,000 staff have been employed by the Department and its agencies in work to investigate suspicions of fraud. However, taking account of changes in data collection measures over time and the integration of investigators more fully with front-line staff, it is clear to me we need to improve the validity and reliability of year-on-year comparisons, and I have asked the Department to undertake further work on this.

This is an electronic system that uses barcode scanning to alert a Post Office clerk that the order book presented to them has been reported lost, stolen or recalled. The order book is then impounded by the Post Office clerk. A reward would not normally be payable for order books impounded through the use of the OBCS. National rollout of the OBCS began in March 2000 and more than 99 per cent. of Post Offices were using the system by December 2001.</p>

This means that those people who want to open an account should be able to do so, including those in rural areas who might not previously have had access to banking facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.2/4">Our information campaign will take customers through the changes, including getting their money from their account at the Post Office. Customers will be supplied with information, which clearly sets out their Xaccount options&quot; and enables them to decide which account is right for them. The changes in how benefits are paid will be phased in over a two-year period. Customers do not need to take any action until they receive a letter about the change. Until then they can keep their order book or giro.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.2/5">Although we will start to contact some pensioners in January to prepare for the change, no-one will need to change their method of payment until April at the earliest.</p>

	<p pid=".200W.11/18">2. The figures are the sum of those live schemes that have reported they are winding up and those schemes accepted by the PSR as winding up. The latter are schemes where the principal employer has gone into liquidation and they were the sole trustees. The figures do not include schemes that may not have reported to the PSR.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.11/19">3. The PSR system holds information on the most recent change in scheme status, so schemes which were frozen or closed in earlier years may figure in the wind up figures for a later year. Trustees are required to report changes within 12 months so there is likely to be a lag before the data reflects what is happening currently.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.11/20">4. Before 1997 figures for starting the wind up of schemes were not categorised:they were subsumed within figures for live scheme. The category of schemes in the process of wind up was introduced gradually. The category for schemes notifying that they were winding up was introduced before the category for schemes accepted by the PSR as winding up. Where an actual date was unavailable the current date was used.</p>

	<p pid=".209W.2/2">However, in addition the Government have received around 55,000 letters as the result of various campaigns relating to the Formula Grant Review. None of these campaigns was solely based around Somerset, but since the county is a member of the F40 group of authorities who campaign on education funding a number of those letters do relate to that council. We do not record the details of the senders of campaign letters as a matter of course. For this reason, and since very many of them are multiple copies of the same letter sent by the same people to different Ministers, a more detailed answer could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".209W.2/3">We are currently taking decisions on the new system to replace SSAs. As we do so we are carefully considering the full range of evidence, pressures and points that have been put to us. We will announce the new system for distributing Formula Grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which we expect to be around the start of December. Once the Government have allocated their grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make. However, we have already guaranteed that we will use grant Xfloors&quot; to ensure that no authority will face a cut in grant next year on a like for like basis, and we hope to do better than that when we announce the actual floors and ceilings scheme as part of the provisional settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".211W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/2">The report by Dr. Neil Cherry on XTogether Against Masts&quot; is concerned with an assessment of possible health effects that might arise from exposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation from mobile phone base stations (masts). It was to address such concerns that in 1999 the Government asked the chairman of the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to set up an Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP). The group was chaired by Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE and reported to Government in May 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/3">A particular issue for the group was the exposures that might be received by members of the public from local base stations and the potential for effects on health. This is the issue addressed by Dr. Cherry. The conclusions in the IEGMP report were that:</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/4" class="indent">The balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/5">Measurements undertaken by the NRPB and the Radiocommunications Agency have confirmed that public exposures are very much lower than the international guidelines. Network operators have undertaken to ensure that all base stations will be designed and sited, so that members of the public will not be exposed in excess of the recommended basic restriction.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/6">The group were aware, however, that if people are unduly concerned about potential exposures then that in itself may affect their well-being. A number of recommendations of the group were, therefore, designed to provide more information to people about local base stations.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/7">The group also made recommendations for further research work. These proposals for research were principally directed as providing more information on exposures from mobile phones but also have relevance to exposures from base stations. It additionally recommended that there should be a further review of relevant research in three years time, or earlier if circumstances demand it.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/8">The Government welcome the report as an authoritative review of the scientific information available. It also accepted the recommendations and these have been taken forward by Government and by other bodies. A research programme funded by Government and industry on a 50:50 basis is taking forward the research recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/9">In coming to its conclusions, the IEGMP undertook an extensive review of the relevant scientific literature and heard evidence from 28 witnesses during the course of its work. It also organised five open meetings to hear the views of the public. Many of the references cited by Dr. Cherry were reviewed by the expert group. Professor G. J. Hyland, then of the University of Warwick, whose work is referred to by Dr. Cherry gave evidence to the group. The IEGMP also drew upon evidence provided by the NRPB and other organisations on exposures to RF from base stations.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.8/10">The further review of research findings is being carried out by NRPB's independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation. It is expected that this will be completed in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.8/1">The Government have received around 55,000 letters from the public relating to the Formula Grant Review, the great majority being as the result of various campaigns that have been organised. One of these campaigns was based in Cheshire, and we estimate that around 200 responses were received as part of that.

	<p pid=".216W.2/1">There are no plans to amend planning legislation in respect of building new homes in flood plains or for existing buildings in areas prone to flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.2/2">The Government issued comprehensive strengthened guidance on the operation of the planning system in regard to flood risk in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 25 XDevelopment and flood risk&quot; in July 2001. We said then that we would review this guidance in the light of experience of its implementation and effectiveness and the developing scientific knowledge on climate change three years after publication. In the meantime we are continuing to monitor how it is being applied through the Environment Agency's high-level target 12. The report for 2001&ndash;02 was recently published on the DEFRA website. It indicates that PPG 25 is already beginning to have an effect and that less than 0.5 per cent. of all new homes were subject to sustained objections on flood risk grounds. In the remaining cases, local planning authorities had considered the matter carefully before allowing development to proceed.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.2/3">To complement the new, stronger planning guidance, DTLR published XPreparing for floods&quot; in February 2002. This contains interim guidance for improving the flood resistance of domestic and small business properties. It provides practical advice for existing property owners whose properties are at risk of flooding and for all those involved with construction of new properties or renovation of existing buildings in areas of flood risk. The Environment Agency, together with the Construction Industry Research and Information Association, has also produced guidance on temporary measures to protect against flooding (such as flood boards) and on what to do after a flood.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.2/4">In addition, we are working with the Environment Agency, local government, the water industry and others to produce an agreed guidance framework for the development of sustainable drainage systems. Such systems, which are encouraged in PPG 25, aim to control water as near its source as possible and thus reduce the downstream risk of flooding. They will help to reduce the potential impact on existing properties of flooding due to uncontrolled run-off from newly developed areas.</p>

The UK received #2,720million from the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy in its 2000&ndash;01 budget year. These figures include payments of market support, which may not have gone directly to farmers, as traders are also eligible.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.8/1">Negotiations on the EU biofuels targets Directive are still taking place and are being led by the Department for Transport. It is anticipated that the outcome of the discussions will be a requirement for member states to set indicative targets for the use of biofuels as a transport fuel by July 2005. The Government recognise that liquid biofuels and non-food crops in general have potential for UK agriculture and regular discussions are held with farmers and industry representatives on a wide range of non-food crops issues. The Government-Industry Forum on Non-Food Uses of Crops, which includes representatives from the farming sector, was set up in 2001 to review market opportunities for non-food crops and make recommendations to Government on policy affecting their use. The Forum is looking at several non-food crop applications, including biodiesel and bioethanol.</p>

	<p pid=".226W.5/3">The number of TB incidents reported depends on the number of tests carried out and the nature of the testing regime as well as the underlying prevalence of the disease. Testing resources over the 12 month period October 2001 to September 2002 were concentrated on herds with overdue tests following the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. These would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Those currently tested also contain a higher than usual proportion of high risk herds than were being tested prior to the FMD outbreak. As a consequence it is very difficult to assess whether there has been a greater increase in bovine TB than anticipated and it will remain difficult to interpret the numbers of incidents reported until the backlog of tests following the FMD outbreak has been cleared.</p>

It includes research into the nature of the disease in cattle; what factors in the environment increase the risk to cattle; the spread of the disease between cattle, and between cattle and wildlife; and the role of the badger and other wildlife in disease transmission. Research is still on-going. It is too early to draw conclusions at this stage.</p>

We therefore advise caution when comparing the 1998 results with previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.0/2">One of the key tasks of Defra is to work with all concerned to develop an economically viable, sustainable, diverse and dynamic farming industry. Providing such an economic framework is the best way of encouraging young people to enter farming. My Department is preparing a response to the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food; including its recommendations on entry into farming, and on ensuring new entrants have the right skills. An announcement will be made in due course.</p>

Non-local authority programmes, such as the Government's Warm Front programme and gas and electricity suppliers' Energy Efficiency Commitment, will deliver the majority of the improvements needed to meet these non-statutory targets. The full cost will therefore not fall to local authorities. Any new obligations the Government placed on authorities would, of course, be funded in full.</p>

These include that the dwelling is to be structurally stable, free from damp and serious disrepair; have adequate provisions for lighting, heating, ventilation and supply of water; have adequate facilities for the preparation and cooking of food; have suitably located toilet, bathing and washing facilities and an effective drainage system.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.12/4">In addition section 352 (1A) of the Housing Act 1985 sets out further standards which may be applied in relation to a house in multiple occupation by a local housing authority in its determination of whether the property is fit for the number of persons or households occupying it. These standards include that the property has satisfactory facilities for preparing and cooking food; an adequate number of toilet, bathing and washing facilities and an adequate means of escape from fire and other fire precautions.</p>

	<p pid=".239W.2/2">The Nitrates Directive requires the identification of polluted waters using the following criteria: <i>(a)</i> surface and groundwaters which contain or could contain, if preventative action is not taken, nitrate concentrations greater than 50 mg/l; <i>(b)</i> surface waters which are or could become, if preventative action is not taken, eutrophic.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.2/3">The Nitrates Directive then requires all known land draining into these waters, from which agriculture could contribute to the pollution, to be designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs). Around 55 per cent. of England has been designated as NVZs on the basis that it drains into these waters.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.2/4">The Environment Agency (EA) are adopting a risk based approach to the enforcement of action programme measures which farmers located in the NVZs will be required to apply from <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-19">19 December 2002</phrase>. The EA will prioritise farms that have the greatest potential for nitrate loss rather than visiting all farms, and will aim to work with farmers to help achieve compliance over a period of time.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.2/5">There is no requirement for farmers to fill in any new forms to comply with this legislation. Farmers in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones are expected to keep records of their application of manures and fertilisers. However, there is complete flexibility for farmers to do this in whatever way is most convenient for them, including using existing field records.</p>

My right honourable Friend the Foreign Secretary did so while in Iran on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-09">9 October</phrase>. We supported the recent EU decision to establish a formal dialogue on human rights with Iran with the hope that this will bring about improvements in Iran's respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

A risk assessment was made at the licensing stage of this export, including careful examination of information about the proposed end-use and end-user of the goods. We continue to believe that the export of less than half an ounce of beryllium to the University of Science and Technology in Tehran is not of concern with respect to use in weapons of mass destruction and that the end-use stated in the original export licence application was legitimate. In these circumstances we have considered end-use monitoring not to be necessary for this export.</p>

Both are extremely active and are doing much to bring the relationship forward. Education and drugs co-operation are key elements of that relationship.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.0/2">Much of the UK's work in Uzbekistan is devoted to pressing for improvements in the human rights situation. Bilaterally, and through the EU and the OSCE, we have urged Uzbekistan to take greater steps towards democratisation and respect for human rights. We recognise that there have been some small steps to address the human rights situation, including an invitation to the UN Special Rapporteur for Torture. But Uzbekistan needs to do much more. In particular, we would like to see reform of the criminal justice system, and wider recognition of independent human rights groups, religious groups and political parties. We stand ready to help Uzbekistan make these improvements, in line with its international obligations and commitments.</p>

	<p pid=".254W.6/1">Relations between the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe are poorer than at any time since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. The ZANU (PF) regime has undermined the democratic principles on which an independent Zimbabwe was founded. It has manipulated the democratic process to retain power, as clearly seen during the presidential election in March and in elections since. It has used violence, intimidation and the withholding of food aid to cow the opposition and gain political advantage. It has seriously undermined the independence of the judiciary and subverted the rule of law. It has systematically attacked Zimbabwe's free and independent media. Its record on human rights abuses is appalling. Its economic and land policies are major contributors to the current humanitarian crisis. Relations between the UK and Zimbabwe will not improve until a government in Harare makes a genuine attempt to address these concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".257W.0/1">There are no plans to submit blood and blood components to the Medicines Control Agency for licensing. We do not believe that doing so would confer any additional public health benefit. The Medicines Control Agency already ensures that the United Kingdom blood services meet European good manufacturing practice standards. In addition, the new European Blood Directive will, when adopted, require the accreditation of all blood establishments to ensure common standards of safety and quality in blood and blood components across all Members States. We have no plans to refer the use of all plasma products to NICE for evaluation. Safety issues relating to plasma products fall within the remit of the United Kingdom expert advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood and tissues for transplantation (MSBT). MSBT seeks specialist advice where necessary or includes the relevant specialists among its members.</p>

	<p pid=".257W.3/1">The Government's advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood and tissues for transplantation (MSBT) is continuing to consider the relative efficacy and risks of the different types of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) available. United Kingdom FFP is already a very safe product. To minimise the risk from viruses, it is made only from previously tested blood donors. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high risk donors and then further testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. FFP produced by the national blood service (NBS), using UK donors, has also been leucodepleted to remove white cells, which evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vOD. Over 300,000 units of FFP are issued annually and it is only given in life-threatening situations to prevent or stop haemorrhage associated with abnormal blood clotting. MSBT has recommended importing single unit FFP from the United States. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-15">15 August 2002</phrase> the Government announced that imported FFP will be used for new-born babies and young children born after <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase>, as an added precaution against the theoretical risk of vCJD transmission. On the advice of MSBT, US sourced FFP will be virally inactivated using methylene blue (MB) treatment. MB has been administered in medical practice since 1900, and in much larger doses (many thousand-fold) than the NBS will be using. NBS will be removing more than 90 per cent, of MB before the FFP is issued to National Health Service hospitals. MB is a registered medical device under the Medical Devices Directive and has a European safety (CE) marking.</p>

	<p pid=".258W.0/1">The parallel developments at Hammersmith Hospital and the Paddington Basin will see the creation of two specialist centres for heart surgery in north west London in modern facilities to replace the existing centres. The two centres will provide benefits of greater service concentration, including integration with a wider range of services, and a strengthened teaching and research capacity. Whilst the developments are underway investment is being made to improve existing services. This includes creating more surgical capacity where possible and replacing worn out equipment, including operating theatres and catheter laboratories to ensure that services continue to improve in line with patient and Government expectations.</p>

	<p pid=".261W.8/2">A lookback programme conducted by the national blood service from 1995 identified 669 people who contracted the hepatitis C virus from blood transfusions before screening for thevirus was introduced in September 1991. However, it has been impossible to trace the majority of those likely to have been infected. Work has been undertaken to estimate the numbers involved and we expect the results to be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".264W.2/3">In both cases it is difficult to make direct comparisons between 1997&ndash;98 expenditure and 2002&ndash;03 forecast out-turn expenditure because of the various organisational changes which have taken place in the intervening years.</p>

However, these figures need to be interpreted with caution because different countries calculate the figures in different ways. If comparing United Kingdom data with other countries, we consistently appear near the bottom for doctors per 1,000 head of population, but this is mainly because we count only national health service doctors, whereas most other countries figures include all registered doctors, therefore counting, for example, private sector doctors and doctors who are not actually working.</p>

The Health Protection Agency will be responsible for monitoring the specialist services across the National Health Service laboratories transferring from the Public Health Laboratory Service, as well as their own laboratories. NHS trusts will be responsible for the routine microbiology services in their own trusts. They will be subject to the same performance monitoring as well by primary care trusts. External accreditation programmes will also remain in place. In time, the laboratories will form part of local pathology managed clinical networks.

United Kingdom FFP is already a very safe product. To minimise the risk from viruses, it is made only from previously tested blood donors. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high risk donors and then further testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. FFP produced by the NBS, using UK donors, has also been leucodepleted to remove white cells, which evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vdD. A commercially produced, pooled solvent detergent treated FFP is licensed in the UK and available to the National Health Service.</p>

	<p pid=".279W.2/1">From August 2004, junior doctors will come within the remit of the European Working Time Directive. The key aspect is that junior doctors must have 11 hours rest in every 24 hours.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/2">It will not be possible for the National Health Service to achieve European Working Time Directive compliance by applying a single Xone size fits all&quot; model across the whole country. Instead, compliance will be achieved with a portfolio of action at local and national level.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/3">Individual NHS trusts will need to look critically at working patterns and whether it is necessary for doctors to be resident. Where the intensity of calls requires resident cover, it will generally be necessary to move to new patterns of working such as shifts or partial shifts.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/4">The Department will be issuing guidance on implementation this Autumn and is working with stakeholders including the medical Royal Colleges, British Medical Association, NHS Confederation and the service to ensure that effective solutions are developed.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/5">The Department is therefore funding a programme of pilot projects based in NHS trusts to develop and test innovative solutions to European Working Time Directive implementation. We are funding about 20 pilot studies in individual NHS trusts and groups of NHS trusts on innovative ways of delivering services while complying with the requirements of the post-2004 Working Time Directive legislation. The individual pilots will cover areas such as night teams, health care practitioners, nurse practitioners and whole systems service redesign.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/6">Full details of the pilot programme will be announced shortly and will be available on the Department's website <a href="http://www.doh.qov.uk/workinqtime/">www.doh.qov.uk/workinqtime/</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.2/1">A national survey of national health service child care provision, undertaken early in 2001, found that 114 NHS trusts provided nursery facilities for their staff. Since April 2001, a further 117 schemes for new or extensions to existing nurseries have had capital funding agreed as part of the NHS child care strategy. As a criterion of funding these nurseries should, wherever possible, provide places for the use of all health care workers, including those at other NHS organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.2/2">Further capital funding will be made available in 2003&ndash;04 to meet the NHS plan target of 150 new nursery schemes by March 2004. All new build hospitals must also include a nursery in their plans.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.5/1">The National Audit Office report, XTackling Obesity in England, published February 2001&quot;, estimated that in 1998 overweight and obesity contributed to 18 million sick days. The Government are committed to tackling the rising trend in obesity. The National Health Service priorities and planning framework for 2003&ndash;2006 includes targets on reducing coronary heart disease (CHD). One of these targets requires practice-based registers and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking; it also covers the majority of patients at high risk of CHD, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30. The Department is working with a range of partners at national, regional and local levels, on programmes to improve diet and increase physical activity levels. Action to improve diet includes a Five-a-day programme, including initiatives with the food industry, including manufacturers and caterers, improving the overall balance of diet&mdash;working with the Food Standards Agency&mdash;and a food in schools and healthy schools programme. Plans were recently announced to transform physical education and school sport and club links over the next three years. There is investment to develop local exercise action pilots, led by primary care trusts, and the new opportunities fund is supporting the delivery of a physical education and sports programme.</p>

Each entry has details of project name, funding organisation, contact name and details and information on the services the project offers and if the project has been evaluated.
