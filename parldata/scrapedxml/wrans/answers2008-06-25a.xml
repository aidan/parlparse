	<p pid="a.298W.3/1">Manchester Airports Ltd., the owner of Bournemouth International Airport, has recently been granted planning permission to redevelop the existing terminal in order to cater for the predicted increase in passenger throughput from 917,000 passengers per annum in 2005-06 to 4.5 million by 2030. The approval was conditional upon them undertaking improvements to junctions on the existing network in the immediate vicinity of the airport and funding better public transport links to Bournemouth.

	<p pid="a.300W.6/2">On roads, there are currently two local major road schemes that are currently under construction within the Leeds Metropolitan district. These schemes are being taken forward by Leeds city council, as local highway authority, with the Department providing funding towards the scheme costs. Both are expected to be completed and opened to traffic later this year. Details are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.6/3">East Leeds Link Road&mdash;this scheme is 2.4 miles in length and will connect the Inner Ring Road Stages 6 and 7, at South Accommodation Road, with the M1 at Junction 45.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.6/4">Leeds Inner Ring Road Stage 7&mdash;this scheme is a 0.8 mile dual-carriageway extension largely on a viaduct from the recently completed Inner Ring Road Stage 6 to the Hunslet Distributor Road.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.6/5">The Highways Agency is responsible for trunk roads and motorways. There are currently no Highways Agency roads within the Leeds West constituency. However, the Agency is currently examining the options for capacity and traffic management improvements on the M62 Junction 25-28 and M1 Junction 39-42, of which junctions 27-28 of the M62 and junctions 41-42 falls within the Leeds Metropolitan district area.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.6/6">The M62 Junction 27-28 is approximately 3.29 miles and the M1 Junction 41-42 is 1.52 miles in length. It is not possible to quote lengths of additional lane planned to be constructed, because options are still being examined and no specific scheme proposal has yet been approved.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.6/7">In addition, there could be other schemes that are either underway or planned which will be funded by private developers with the two locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.6/8">We expect to seek updated advice from regions on their transport priorities later in the summer as part of the second round of the regional funding allocations process. This will provide the opportunity for Leeds city council to inform the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Transport Board of any future proposals for local major road and public transport schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.302W.2/2">The significance of plastic foam insulation as waste is expected to increase in the longer term as more buildings containing these panels are redeveloped.

	<p pid="a.302W.8/1">The Pesticides Safety Directorate recently prepared a report assessing the impact on crop protection in the UK of hazard-based approval criteria for active substances and provisions for comparative assessment and substitution of products, which are contained in the Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. The report assesses the potential impact of the Commission's proposals and of amendments adopted in the first reading report of the Parliament. It concludes that the Commission's proposals could remove up to 15 per cent. of the active substances assessed, while the Parliament's proposed amendments could ultimately remove up to 85 per cent. of those substances.</p>

The Government are, however, concerned that the proposals for hazard cut-off criteria could remove some active substances which are very important for agriculture and horticulture without securing any meaningful benefit in terms of consumer safety. The Government therefore abstained from voting when the presidency's compromise text was put to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council for political agreement in June.</p>

	<p pid="a.314W.0/2">EU Directives currently impose a maximum limit of 12 minutes of advertising per hour on television. This is also subject to an EU maximum average of nine minutes per hour. Within this European framework, the rules set by Ofcom impose further limits on public service channels which are subject to an overall maximum average of seven minutes per hour, and a specific average of eight minutes per hour between 6pm and 11pm. These restrictions are set out in Ofcom's rules on the amount and distribution of advertising. The limits do not include the amount of time that channels may use for promoting their programmes. Nor do they include 'teleshopping windows', which involve direct offers to viewers to purchase goods and services, for example by placing an order by telephone or e-mail. Ofcom requires broadcasters to comply with these rules, and receives independently-sourced data on many channels, including the public service channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.0/3">Under the new Audio Visual Media Services Directive, the European framework for advertising regulation has been revised and Ofcom recently consulted on whether to make changes to the UK rules. Ofcom aim to announce its decision later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.328W.0/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is currently managing a competitive tender process for the successor product to the Post Office Card Account and an announcement is expected later in the year. A number of bids are being considered, including one submitted by Post Office Ltd. In advance of the procurement decision being announced, it would not be appropriate for the Government to speculate on the consequences of any individual bidder failing to secure the contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.0/2">The Government remains committed to allowing people to access their pension and benefit in cash at the post office if they choose to do so, and there are around 25 accounts which make that possible still generating income for Post Office Ltd. and sub-postmasters.</p>

	<p pid="a.330W.6/1">Data on acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) are not collected by the Home Office as they are voluntary agreements and therefore not suitable for central data collection. However, surveys carried out by the Home Office of the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) indicated that over 280 ABCs have been made in Lincolnshire since October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.6/2">Information on the number of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) issued is not collected centrally at parliamentary constituency area level. The number of ASBOs issued in the Lincolnshire Criminal Justice System (CJS) area from January 2002 to December 2006 (latest available) is shown in the following table. CJS areas are coterminous with police force areas.</p>

The estimated number of individuals represented on the NDNAD is lower than the number of subject profiles as some profiles are replicates. The subject profile replication rate is currently calculated as 13.3 per cent. The estimated number of individuals aged under 16 is, therefore, 127,767.</p>

We do recognise that people do not necessarily want lap-dancing establishments in their neighbourhoods and we want to ensure local authorities have the powers to reflect the views of local people when considering applications.

	<p pid="a.336W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.3/2">Under Section 16 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended), police officers may, if authorised to do so by a chief police officer, take excluded pupils who are in a public place during normal school hours and children who they believe are out of school without lawful authority to a designated place established by the local authority or to the school. This power is often used during a &quot;School Attendance and Exclusions Sweep&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.3/3">This Department and the Home Department have issued joint guidance to local authorities and police services on the use of the power to remove pupils from public places and the organisation of exercises using it called &quot;School Attendance and Exclusions Sweeps: Effective Practice and Advice&quot; which explains the law and gives examples of practice that is in use.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.3/4">Under Section 444A of the Education Act 1996 (as amended) police officers may issue fixed penalty notices to parents who fail to secure their child's regular attendance, if they have been authorised to do so by the local code of practice on the use of penalty notices.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.3/5">Police community support officers may also use the powers to remove pupils from a public place and to issue fixed penalty notices, if they have been designated to do so under the Police Reform Act 2002 by the .chief officer of the force concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.3/6">The Department has not collected data on the number of &quot;school attendance and exclusions sweeps&quot; conducted by local authorities since autumn 2006, when we ceased co-ordinating national sweeps-allowing authorities to run sweeps according to local need. I have put the data we collected as part of the rationally co-ordinated exercises in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.336W.3/7">Analyses of national data show that there is a correlation between absence from school and pupils' levels of achievement, with average performance of pupils in schools with lower levels of absence better than pupils in schools with higher levels of absence. Data for 2006-07 showed that in secondary schools with an average of 12 days absence per pupil 36 per cent. of pupils or more obtained five of more GCSEs at grade A* to C including English and maths compared with 91 per cent. of pupils in secondary schools with an average of less than six days absence per pupil In primary schools with an average of more than 12 days absence per pupil 52 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved level 4 or above in English and mathematics compared with 84 per cent. of pupils in schools where the average absence was less than six days per pupil.</p>

	<p pid="a.345W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.2/2">Prior to drawing up the policy, DEFRA and the Energy Saving Trust commissioned a series of research projects, including in situ measurement of the heat loss through insulated cavities, to measure and understand the effectiveness of cavity wall insulation. Measurements were taken in a variety of geographical locations. The work was summarised in a report by Glasgow Caledonian University and published in 2006 on the DEFRA website. The report on the final stage of the in situ monitoring project is to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.2/3">Our final estimate of the annual carbon savings from insulating the cavity of a three bedroom semi-detached house is 634 kgC02 per year. The financial savings, based on BERR fuel prices for the domestic sector in June 2007, are estimated at &pound;78 per year (after deducting increased comfort). Given that the cost of insulation to the householder (i.e. after the energy suppliers' subsidy) is estimated to be around &pound;200, cavity wall insulation remains a highly cost effective measure. In terms of carbon savings, it is the single most important measure in CERT.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.2/4">The Explanatory Memorandum for CERT estimates that there are around 1.2 million homes in Great Britain for which the cavities are technically unfillable, or difficult to fill at present.</p>

We do recognise that people do not necessarily want lap-dancing establishments in their neighbourhoods and we want to ensure local authorities have the powers to reflect the views of local people when considering applications. We will therefore consider whether or not lap-dancing clubs should fall under the category of Sex Encounter Establishments under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 and legislate if this is necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.5/3">More generally where it is agreed that the proposals to reconfigure services include any significant change to the way services are provided, local trusts have a duty to consult with the public and the relevant overview and scrutiny committee (OSC). Following the consultation period, the national health service organisations will have to make a decision on the best way forward. Local OSCs have the power to review and scrutinise health services from the perspective of their local populations, and can refer proposals to the Secretary of State if they believe the plans are not in the interests of the health service. Ultimately, however, the configuration of healthcare services in a particular area is a decision that needs to be taken at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="a.355W.5/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many (a) males and (b) females were born with amniotic band syndrome in each of the last 10 years. (212444)</p>
	<p pid="a.355W.5/5" class="indent">The table attached provides the number of (a) male and (b) female live and still births notified to the National Congenital Anomaly System for England and Wales (NCAS) with a mention of amniotic bands or clinically similar terms, for 2000 to 2006 (the latest year available). Figures are not available prior to 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.355W.5/6" class="indent">The number of notifications received by NCAS is likely to be less than the actual number of infants born with an anomaly. NHS Trusts provide these notifications to NCAS on a voluntary basis, either on forms sent to the Office for National Statistics or via local congenital anomaly registers. The recording of congenital anomalies is more complete in those areas where a register operates, because the register can obtain additional information locally. Consequently, the figures for congenital anomalies are presented separately for areas where a register operated and for areas without a register in a particular year. While a few of these local congenital anomaly registers were already established in 2000, others were set up as late as 2003. In 2006, registers covered 43 per cent of births in England and all births in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.363W.9/1">The overall expenditure by the national health service on tier 4 personality disorder services in 2005-06, which is the most recent data available, was approximately &pound;9.6 million. Information is not available on expenditure by the independent sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/2">In 2006-07, &pound;8.45 million went into primary care trust (PCT) baselines in respect of tier 4 personality disorder services and those funds were fully spent on the services involved through service level agreements with commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/3">From 2007-08 (when baseline allocations were &pound;9.14 million), many PCTs have elected to commission services for people with severe personality disorders on a cost-per-case basis (i.e. individual placements). There is therefore no information on the actual level of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/4">Over the 2005-08 period, tier 5 NHS medium secure and community forensic services received &pound;25.31 million. During this period, capital spending was &pound;23.56 million. This revenue was devolved to local PCT and specialised commissioners for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/5">Following commitments in the 1997 election manifesto, the Government have implemented a range of initiatives to improve services to those with a personality disorder. Two distinct but linked programmes have resulted from new investment; Managing Dangerous Offenders with a severe Personality Disorder and Personality Disorder - No Longer a Diagnosis of Exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/6">These offer new interventions for the spectrum of patients in the population who pose a risk of harm either to themselves or to others as a result of their personality disorder. The effectiveness of our initiatives to improving services for the often hidden and excluded members of every local community will be significantly improved by the growing number of new and often innovative services for those with a personality disorder. The programmes also demonstrate a commitment to greater coherence and collaborative working between both Government agencies and public and independent services in the field.</p>

We are matching this advocacy with practical help. The UK has been very active and influential in promoting human rights training and adherence in the Colombian armed forces and police. Further work in this area, funded by the UK Conflict Prevention Pool, will include helping the Colombian Government to eradicate extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses and, equally importantly, to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.369W.5/1">The UK's policy towards the Ethiopia-Eritrea border dispute is based on three principles: to avoid any return to war; for the border to be demarcated; and for the Parties to normalise their relations. Ethiopia and Eritrea should agree a way forward to allow demarcation to proceed and for a normalisation process to begin, as set out in the Algiers Agreements of June 2000 and December 2000, signed by Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.5/2">We have set out this policy to both Ethiopia and Eritrea, including in November 2007 when my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin and when my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Baroness Vadera, and our ambassador in Addis Ababa met Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. My noble Friend the Minister for Africa, Lord Malloch-Brown, also conveyed these points to Eritrean Foreign Minister Osman Saleh in November 2007 and to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles in January in Addis Ababa. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials continually reiterate these messages to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean ambassadors to London and to their interlocutors in the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea in Addis Ababa and Asmara respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.5/3">We will continue to pursue the aforementioned policy with our international partners, including through the UN Security Council (UNSC). In this regard, we fully support UNSC Resolution 1798, adopted unanimously on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-30">30 January</phrase> and the UNSC's Presidential Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-30">30 April</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.372W.2/1">Dr Mohammad El Baradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May</phrase> that Iran had failed to suspend enrichment-related activities, had made no progress on the transparency measures the UN Security Council (UNSC) and IAEA have long called for and had failed to answer the IAEA's questions relating to studies with a possible military dimension. Dr El Baradei said that these studies were a &quot;matter of serious concern&quot;. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-08">8 April</phrase>, Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced that Iran would increase the number of centrifuges from 3,000 to 6,000. Dr El Baradei has criticised this development. The Government agree with him that it is essential that Iran suspends its enrichment-related activities in accordance with its obligations to the UNSC. Unless Iran does so, the international community will have no confidence that Iran's nuclear programme is of an entirely civilian nature. We have called on Iran to provide answers to the IAEA's questions immediately. There is no justification for further delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.372W.5/1">Iran's nuclear programme, which continues in breach of four UN Security Council Resolutions, threatens the stability of the region. By continuing with an enrichment programme for which we can see no apparent civilian purpose and in the face of clear international concern, Iran is doing little to address the serious lack of confidence in its assertions that its intentions are exclusively peaceful&mdash;a fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency continues to say it cannot verify. We have a close and ongoing dialogue with our regional allies on the issue and will be working with them in the coming months to increase the pressure on Iran to comply with its international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is committed to the achievement of the millennium development goals, including goal 8 and the new target 1.B, focusing on full and productive employment and decent work for all. DFID assistance programmes recognise that in southern and central Asia, youth unemployment is approximately twice that of adult unemployment<sup>(1)</sup>, requiring specific measures to stimulate growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.2/2">In the short term, DFID supports a number of programmes that provide employment and income generation opportunities. These focus on the poorest, youth, women and disadvantaged groups&mdash;helping them take the first steps out of poverty. In Afghanistan, DFID has provided &pound;18 million for the National Emergency Employment Programme, creating 5.8 million labour-days of employment. In India, DFID finances five major programmes that support rural employment with a total budget of &pound;152.5 million. For example the Madhya Pradesh Rural Livelihoods Project (phase 1 &pound;16.6 million, 2004-07; phase 2 &pound;45 million 2007-12) works with the Government's National Rural Employment Generation Scheme (NREGS) and has already helped 66,400 households in tribal areas. In Nepal, DFID's Rural Access Programme has created almost seven million labour days for over 100,000 people, through labour intensive rural infrastructure development and an additional &pound;27.5 million has just been approved for follow on programmes that, with other donors, will provide an additional 22.3 million days of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.2/3">DFID is also involved in a number of programmes that more directly promote employment. For example in the Kyrgyz Republic, we are supporting the National Village Investment Programme, which has created over 5,000 jobs. In Nepal we have supported a UN programme that has helped 25,000 entrepreneurs from poor and excluded groups. This has increased the participants' incomes threefold, lifting them out of poverty. In Bangladesh, we also provide &pound;11.8 million to the Katalyst Programme, which supports the private sector to develop small to medium enterprises, aiming to create around 730,000 jobs by 2013.</p>

DFID has not made a direct assessment of the potential of concentrating solar power technology to assist the fulfilment of the MDGs in the middle east and north Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/2">DFID provides core funds to key multilateral institutions including the European Commission, World Bank, International Finance Corporation and the European Investment Bank. These multilaterals are best placed to assist the region given their extensive experience and expertise in renewable energy, and the large financial resources they can provide directly and lever from others. For example, the World Bank has conducted an assessment of the World Bank/global environment facility strategy for the market development of concentrating solar thermal power, and is currently supporting solar thermal projects in Morocco and Egypt. The European Commission's Neighbourhood Investment Facility (NIF) is currently conducting a feasibility study for a concentrated solar power plant in Tunisia.</p>

The introduction of ICD-10 in 2001 had a significant effect on mortality rates for some diseases, causing a discontinuity in mortality trends for these causes of death. However ONS practice is not to adjust the historical numbers of deaths shown in PQ answers. More information on this issue can be found at www.statistics.gov.uk/icd10mortality. For female breast cancer the introduction of ICD-10 caused an increase of 2.7 per cent. in the number of deaths. An article specifically examining the changes for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics Quarterly 23*.

	<p pid="a.395W.2/4" class="indent">Table 1 shows the average net weekly equivalised household income for Yorkshire and Humberside, both before and after housing costs, at 2004-05 prices, since 2000-01, 2002-03. These figures are based on the Department for Work and Pensions' Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series which is produced using the Family Resources Survey. It is not possible to present results from the HBAI series below the level of Government Office Regions. While HBAI more commonly presents median incomes, mean incomes are also shown here in order to be more comparable with the mean incomes shown for Leeds West Constituency and Leeds Metropolitan District.</p>

These are based on experimental small area statistics published by the ONS (see background notes). Figures for other years are unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/6" class="indent">Equivalised household incomes are used as a proxy for living standards. Incomes are equivalised to account for household size and composition, and the members of each household are assumed to benefit equally from the household's income. Average household incomes are calculated by assigning the household income to all members of the household, and averaging among individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/7" class="indent">It should be borne in mind that the Government Office Region statistics and the small area statistics are based on different methodologies. It is not possible to separate out methodological differences from real differences. Small differences or changes over time should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error.</p>

	<p pid="a.408W.6/1">Citizenship education, which has been compulsory in secondary schools since 2002, makes an important contribution to developing young people's political literacy. It enables them to improve their understanding and develop skills of democratic participation while helping them to appreciate that they have a stake in society. Through Citizenship Education, young people are taught about democratic institutions, processes and the importance of voting. We are keen to encourage active learning so that young people start early to experience democracy in action. We continue to monitor young people's attitudes to participation in the democratic process through UK-based research such as the National Foundation for Education Research (NFER)'s longitudinal study reports and international research such as the International Review of Curriculum and Assessment Frameworks Archive (INCA) report which looks at how citizenship education affects participation in 14 different countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.5/2">A further table showing school amalgamations has also been placed in the Library. It is not possible to accurately state the number of amalgamations by year since 1997 as records did not always record the reason for opening/closure.

	<p pid="a.415W.0/5">The Department has not collected data on the number of &quot;school attendance and exclusions sweeps&quot; conducted by local authorities since autumn 2006, when we ceased co-ordinating national sweeps-allowing authorities to run sweeps according to local need. I have put the data we collected as part of the rationally co-ordinated exercises in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.0/6">Analyses of national data show that there is a correlation between absence from school and pupils' levels of achievement, with average performance of pupils in schools with lower levels of absence better than pupils in schools with higher levels of absence. Data for 2006-07 showed that in secondary schools with an average of 12 days absence per pupil 36 per cent. of pupils or more obtained five of more GCSEs at grade A* to C including English and maths compared with 91 per cent. of pupils in secondary schools with an average of less than six days absence per pupil In primary schools with an average of more than 12 days absence per pupil 52 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved level 4 or above in English and mathematics compared with 84 per cent. of pupils in schools where the average absence was less than six days per pupil.</p>

	<p pid="a.419W.0/1">Schools have the primary duty of care for their students and must ensure that health and safety risk assessments are carried out for work experience placements. Assessments are frequently carried out on schools' behalf by education business partnership organisations. Employers are responsible for the health and safety of everyone on their premises. 95 per cent. of young people participate in work experience, amounting to over half a million placements each year within which the track record of health and safety is excellent reflecting the care that schools and employers take to keep young people safe and to maximise the benefits of work experience.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-25a.211552.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-25a.419W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" speakername="Beverley Hughes" colnum="419W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080625/text/80625w0032.htm#0806262002394">
	<p pid="a.419W.3/1">The Youth Justice Board and local multi-agency youth offending teams were established in 1998 under the Crime and Disorder Act. A key role of the Youth Justice Board is to monitor the performance of, and standards for, the youth justice system. Its work is a key driver for the improvements the system has seen since the reforms introduced in 1998, and its ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of the system continues to influence policy on tackling youth crime and bringing about further improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/2">Youth offending teams were described by the Audit Commission in Youth Justice 2004 as</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;a good example of a flexible, multi-disciplinary approach to service delivery from which other public sector partnerships could learn&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/4">In general, the new youth justice arrangements were described by the Audit Commission as</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/5" class="indent">&quot;a significant improvement and a good model for delivering public services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/6">The Audit Commission also identified that following the reforms to the youth justice system young offenders are more likely to receive an intervention, young offenders are dealt with more quickly, young offenders are more likely to make amends for their wrong-doing, and magistrates are very satisfied with the service they receive from Youth offending teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/7">Notable examples of improvements to the youth justice system are:</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/8">Figures for 2005-06 and 2006-07 show that the number of first time entrants to the criminal justice system has reduced from 97,329 in 2005-06 to 93,730 in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/9">Self-reported youth offending levels are relatively stable, with about 25 per cent. of young people admitting to offending in the previous year although only a minority of this is serious and/or persistent.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.3/10">The national statistics published in May 2008 showed a reduction of 17.4 per cent. in the frequency rate of re-offending between 2000 and 2005. The results also show that the percentage of offenders who re-offended over a one year period fell from 40.2 per cent. in 2000 to 38.4 per cent. in 2005.</p>
