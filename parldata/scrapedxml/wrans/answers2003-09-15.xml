	<p pid=".494W.2/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is working to improve the service that victims and witnesses of crime receive. This includes working with the Home Office and other criminal justice system agencies in developing the Government's recently published national strategy to deliver improved services to victims and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.2/2">The CPS has fully implemented the direct communication with victims initiative, whereby prosecutors provide reasons to victims for decisions to drop or substantially alter charges. A meeting to provide a further explanation should also be offered in cases involving death, child abuse, sexual offences, racial offences or offences with a homophobic element.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.2/3">In relation to vulnerable or intimidated witnesses, the CPS is continuing to work closely with the Home Office and others to implement measures recommended in the report Speaking up for Justice, given statutory force by the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. In July 2002, video recorded statements became admissible as evidence in chief in crown court proceedings for children under 17 and for vulnerable adults. In the crown court, the provision to give evidence by way of TV link is also available to children, vulnerable adults and intimidated witnesses. The CPS undertook a comprehensive training programme to ensure that staff were fully aware of the issues raised by the new measures. By March 2003, over 1000 CPS staff had been trained.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.2/4">In relation to general victim and witness care, the CPS is working with ACPO and the Office for Public Service Reform on piloting a Victim and Witness Care Project that builds on the developing working relationship between the police and the CPS. Five pilot Areas (Gwent, North Wales, West Midlands, Essex and South Yorkshire) were established in July 2003. The pilot will run until March 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.2/5">In all pilot Areas, police officers will undertake a needs assessment for all victims and witnesses. If criminal proceedings are commenced, dedicated witness care staff will manage delivery of information and support to witnesses throughout the life of a case.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.2/6">The CPS has also been conducting a public consultation on whether prosecutors should be permitted to conduct pre-trial interviews with prosecution witnesses in order to assess their reliability. The consultation period ended on 2 <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase> and the report is due to be placed before the Attorney-General in the autumn of 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".496W.5/1">Pending the implementation of the charging scheme in the Criminal Justice Bill, the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are establishing non-statutory arrangements (based on those which were piloted in 2002) which involve their working together more closely pre-charge. One element is the provision of early CPS advice through a duty prosecutor routinely stationed at busy police stations or charging centres. These arrangements, which in some Areas are still at the planning stage, should be in operation in all Areas by the end of the year. Prior to the charging pilot, advices sought by the police from most forces were usually limited to a few cases involving substantial legal difficulty. Frequently, advice was sought after charge when many of the issues were already decided and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) intervention would often involve a reversal of previous police decisions. In the charging pilot last year over 6,100 advices were sought by the police during the period of CPS attendance.</p>

	<p pid=".500W.0/1">During the period of the trial opening (2000 and 2001) of the summer line of route, tickets were on sale in Westminster Hall. Following the Houses' decision to put the arrangement on a permanent footing, and pending the outcome of discussions with Westminster City Council as the local planning authority and with English Heritage, a temporary facility on Abingdon Green was used as a ticket office in 2002. The cost was &pound;53,500, of which the House of Commons share was &pound;32,100.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.0/2">The permanent ticket office used this year for the first time has an estimated cost of &pound;155,000 (the House of Commons share is &pound;93,000). It will be dismantled and put into store during the winter and with due maintenance it is expected to be used each summer for at least 10 years. The annual cost will therefore be &pound;15,500, of which the House of Commons' share will be &pound;9,300.</p>

	<p pid=".504W.6/1">Overbooking is an accepted practice among full-service scheduled airlines. On any particular flight there is likely to be a proportion of passengers, mainly from those holding flexible tickets, who do not check in. On the basis of statistical evidence from previous flights, airlines estimate the probable number of no-shows and overbook accordingly. On the great majority of flights no passengers are denied boarding, and by reducing the number of empty seats overbooking keeps fares lower than they would otherwise be. This practice is widely accepted by passenger organisations and by regulators as being in the best interests of consumers generally.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.6/2">In the comparatively small proportion of cases where denied boarding occurs, existing Community legislation requires Community air carriers to provide prescribed minimum levels of financial compensation, in addition to offering passengers a choice between re-routing and reimbursement. In December 2001 the European Commission presented a proposal for a regulation to increase levels of compensation to passengers denied boarding, as well as to require the provision of assistance to travellers affected by cancellations for commercial reasons or delays. Political agreement on this proposal was reached at Transport Council in December 2002, and it is currently subject to conciliation procedures involving the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>

The constraints imposed by each factor vary in relation to each option. For instance, wake vortices are less of a problem where there is greater distance between two runways (i.e. the wide spaced two runway option). In the close parallel option, their potential effects can restrict operations to the dependent segregated mode (resulting in reduced movement capacity).</p>

The information therefore remains valid.</p>

	<p pid=".509W.8/1">Within the 12 mile limit of UK waters, transfers comply with draft legislation and include contingency planning for oil spills, mainly through the mechanism of Ship's Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (SOPEPS). Where cargoes being transferred are of a particularly persistent nature, appropriate oil recovery, collection and containment measures are also required in the form of a recovery vessel on stand-by throughout the operations.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.8/2">Beyond the 12 mile limit, but within the UK's Pollution Control Zone, which can stretch up to 200 miles off shore, pollution resulting from ship to ship transfers would be treated in the same way as marine pollution from any other source.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.8/3">Any Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) response would follow the National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations and would be tailored to the circumstances of the incident.</p>

In such circumstances an estimated dose was entered onto an individual's dose record by entering doses from direct reading dosimeters worn by the individual. On the rare occasions when no dosimeter information was available, a calculation was made based upon time of exposure and radiation dose rates in areas where the individual worked. Since these details were entered onto individual records and there was no requirement to record the number of such events centrally, the numbers could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

While the Ministry of Defence has not therefore allocated Defence funds to demining operators for the cleaning of UK unexploded ordnance, we have provided personnel to help the process.

	<p pid=".527W.2/1">The Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the Mayor of London, as published in the response to the Select committee, makes clear that &quot;the Government and Mayor's expectation I that special funding streams to meet Olympic costs should be closed, having provided the necessary amounts, by 2013&ndash;14, except that where the Greater London Authority has borrowed to meet capital costs of the Olympics it may be necessary to extend the period during which the Olympic precept is levied to reflect the requirements of the prudential framework for capital finance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".527W.2/2">Within that Memorandum, London is required to contribute up to &pound;550 million towards the cost of the staging of the Games, with provision for a further &pound;75 million if needed. The Mayor has said that he will raise this from the London Council Tax from an additional &pound;20 a year charge, or 38p a week, on Council Tax for a band D property, likely to begin in 2006&ndash;07 if the bid is successful. On the current tax base it is estimated that this would arise the required &pound;550 million in ten years and a further &pound;75 million within another two years if necessary. However, the Mayor has also advised that during the period from 2006&ndash;07 the tax base will increase and so that time period may reduce. In addition, the funding package for the Games allows a &pound;1.2 billion contingency over and above Arup's estimates of required public subsidy for staging the Olympics. The time period for collection of Council Tax would also reduce if all contingencies were not required, and it is the Mayor's expectation that special funding streams should have closed, having provided the necessary amount by 2013&ndash;14. In the unlikely event that the full funding package is required, and the GLA has to borrow to meet capital costs of staging the Olympics then the period of special funding may extend beyond that dated as allowed for in the Memorandum.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.2/3">My statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-15">15 May</phrase> on the length of the time that the special London council tax precept would run presented the Government's assessment of a possible worst-case scenario. The Memorandum of Understanding, as I have explained, makes provision for such an eventuality. However, current expectations are that this will not be the se and that special funding streams should be capable of being closed by 2013&ndash;14. The Mayor has also advised that current expectations are that in the unlikely event that the full London contribution were required this could be raised in less than 12 years.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.2/1">The criteria set for switchover are that: everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form must be able to receive them on digital systems; switching to digital is an affordable option for the vast majority of people; and as a target indicator of affordability, 95 per cent. of consumers must have access to digital equipment. The objective of the Digital Television Action Plan Project is to ensure these criteria are met so that we can, if we choose, take the decision to proceed to full switchover by ordering the switching off by 2010 of analogue terrestrial transmissions.</p>

	<p pid=".530W.2/2">Responsibility for what is broadcast on television rests with the broadcasters and the organisations which regulate broadcasting&mdash;the Governors of the BBC, the Independent Television Commission and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority. They are independent of the Government and responsible for safeguarding the public interest in broadcasting. In carrying out their responsibilities, these authorities have a duty to ensure that programmes contain nothing which offends against good taste and decency or is likely to be offensive to public feeling. They also maintain guidelines for programme-makers on the standards which should be observed. This guidance includes advice on the use of language and timing of programmes and recommends when warning announcements about programmes should be made. In addition, the Broadcasting Standards Commission acts as a forum for public concern.</p>
	<p pid=".530W.2/3">The Communications Act 2003 establishes a new regulatory framework for broadcasting and the communications industries, including the creation of a single regulatory body for the communications industries, the Office of Communications, which will have similar responsibilities for broadcast content. Viewers who are offended by television programmes should complain to the relevant broadcaster and, in the case of serious breaches of the regulatory codes, to the regulator.</p>

	<p pid=".531W.2/1">All parts of the country should have access to Lottery funds. Many areas suffering wider social and economic deprivation need extra support to develop and put in good applications which are more likely to be successful. The fairshare initiative, bringing together funding from the New Opportunities Fund and Community Fund, specifically seeks to target areas of the UK which were most deprived, and which have not received their 'fair share' of Lottery funding. In addition, the Lottery Funding Decision Document, published in July, contains a number of proposals to make it easier for people to apply for Lottery funding, particularly those in disadvantaged communities. These include the creation of a new distributor, which will focus on improving the quality of life in communities by tackling disadvantage and social exclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".533W.3/1">European Community law sets out the import conditions which must be met by all meat imported into the community from third countries. These conditions do not permit meat to be imported from areas where veterinary controls cannot guarantee that the meat poses negligible disease risk to human or animal health. Defra veterinary experts and the Food Standards Agency are fully engaged in negotiations to develop Community import conditions. Should the disease situation in an exporting country change, for example if a new outbreak of disease is notified, the European Commission will introduce safeguard measures to control imports so that there is no increased risk of disease as a result. Pending these changes to community rules, in such a situation individual member states are permitted to introduce unilateral provisions to control imports. The Government take such unilateral action whenever the situation demands it.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.3/2">Community import rules require all meat imported from third countries to enter the community via specified Border Inspection Posts where it is subject to veterinary examination to ensure the import conditions are being observed. The system of veterinary examination is operated by local authorities and is monitored by Defra and the European Commission to ensure effective controls are in place.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.3/3">The Government have produced an Annual Review of Controls on Imports of Animal Products April 2002&ndash;March 2003 which concentrates on the action against illegal imports. This has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid=".533W.6/1">Parts of four Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty lie within 15 miles of Gatwick airport. The Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty concerned are the Kent Downs, Sussex Downs, High Weald and Surrey Hills. We have worked closely with the Department for Transport to ensure that the noise impact of the proposed new airport developments is given full consideration. Taking the 57dB contour as the onset of significant community annoyance, the options for a single close parallel or wide parallel runway are likely to have a minimal impact on the surrounding Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The option of building two additional runways at Gatwick would have a greater impact on the Surrey Hills and High Weald Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>

	<p pid=".537W.2/1">The Animal By-Products Regulations 2003 permit hunt kennels to continue collecting fallen stock; however they will be required to upgrade to knackers' yard standards if they wish to collect fallen stock for the purposes of feeding to hounds. The effect of a ban on hunting would depend on decisions made by those who currently offer a service and on choices made by farmers leading to takeup of the national scheme. Most hunts already make a charge and there is no reason why such a service should not continue as a business opportunity when hunting wild mammals with dogs is banned.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.5/2">EU import duties on fresh fruit and vegetables are set for a range of products on an ad valorem basis. For some products, an additional or minimum sum based on an amount per kilo is payable. The relevant duty rate is applied to the customs value which is normally based on the price actually paid or payable for the goods. However, for certain products, simplified rules are in place which allow a standard unit value to be used as the customs value; these are updated fortnightly. The simplified procedure values in force from <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-29">29 August</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".543W.0/2">Cypermethrin is included as an active ingredient in 12 products currently authorised for use as veterinary medicines, including a number of sheep dips. All of these products have been fully assessed against a number of statutory criteria designed to assure their safety, quality and efficacy for this use.</p>
	<p pid=".543W.0/3">However my officials are currently investigating reports that suggest that a number of farmers may be purchasing an arable form of cypermethrin for use illegally to dip sheep. Although these investigations are at an early stage we have identified a number of sheep farmers in the Ceredigion region of South Wales who do not grow arable crops but who recently have purchased arable cypermethrin products.</p>
	<p pid=".543W.0/4">The arable product has been assessed for use as a pesticide, not as a sheep dip. It is not possible accurately to quantify the risks to the environment, animal health or human health from the illegal use of arable cypermethrin products as sheep dips as more information is required on how the product has actually been used. We are trying to collect this information and will carry out a risk assessment as soon as we are able. However, from the limited information currently available, our main concern relates to the potential environmental damage that might be caused by the inappropriate use, and disposal, of such products.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.2/1">Controlling varroa is still the single most important challenge to UK beekeeping today. The pest is now endemic across much of the UK. Defra (and MAFF before it) has been funding a range of measures applied by the National Bee Unit under the Department's bee health programme, and R&amp;D to better equip beekeepers to manage varroa infestations in their colonies ever since it was first detected in Devon in 1992. These measures include the provision of a free diagnostic and inspection service as well as training and education to enable beekeepers to become self-reliant in controlling the mite through improved bee husbandry.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/2">The Department has not yet commissioned any R&amp;D on resistant mites, although current research investigating biological control methods for varroa is extremely relevant given the presence in England and Wales of varroa mites resistant to Apistan and Bayvarol, until recently the only two varroacides authorised for use in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/3">As has been demonstrated on the Continent, the varroa mite will develop resistance to most chemicals applied to control it; the spread of resistance is therefore inevitable. However, with foresight, the National Bee Unit began implementing a surveillance programme monitoring apiaries for signs of resistance in early 2000. As a result, the UK has been one of only a few countries that has been able to detect resistance before it has become fully established, thus enabling us to take action to help beekeepers treat affected colonies at an early stage. Although resistance is more widespread this year, the recent introduction on the UK market of a new treatment for varroa is welcome. Unlike Apistan and Bayvarol, the new product, Apiguard, is not based on a pyrethroid active ingredient and beekeepers will be able to use this, along with other controls, in particular Integrated Pest Management, which we are strongly advocating, to combat pyrethroid resistant mites.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.0/1">We have studied various and somewhat contradictory assessments that have been made by others considering the effect of music piracy on the internet on music sales and the cost of legally purchased music. These suggest that reliable evaluation of the relationship would be difficult. Moreover, my understanding is that much illegal file sharing on the internet is illegal private copying rather than piracy which further adds to the difficulty of an evaluation.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.0/2">Although UK copyright law already provides strong protection for those who own rights in music, our implementation in the UK of the EU Copyright Directive will clarify these rights and introduce criminal offences for internet music piracy, that is wilful illegal transmission of music on the internet when conducted at least on a commercial scale. The increasing availability of legitimate music tracks on the internet should also assist in encouraging those engaged in illegal private copying to desist and the clarification of the law resulting from the Copyright Directive should enable the music industry to trade online with even greater confidence.</p>

	<p pid=".547W.2/1">No. Assessment of safety of UK nuclear installations is for the operators licensed by the safety regulator, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Since all the UK nuclear stations that were operating during the heatwave depend on sea water, not river water for their cooling, the rise in the temperature of the cooling water remained well within the limits allowed by the various plant safety cases. HSE maintained regulatory vigilance during this period and was satisfied that safety case limits were not threatened by the hot weather.</p>

	<p pid=".552W.3/1">In making decisions about public funds we have to prioritise so that funding is targeted where it will make the most difference. Over 7 million adults in the workforce in England do not possess level 2 or equivalent qualifications. These individuals are more likely to lack the foundation of skills they need for employability, and are less likely to get a secure, well paid job. In contrast, the higher wages paid to people with qualifications above level 2 offer a greater incentive for both individuals and employers to invest in learning. The entitlement to free tuition for individuals studying for a first full level 2 qualification, to which the right hon. Gentleman refers, will enable individuals to achieve a level of educational attainment that will provide them with a with a platform of skills for employability, enable them to improve their position in the labour market and increase their chances of undertaking further learning.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.3/2">This focus on using public funds to help people reach level 2 should be seen within a wider strategy which encourages up-skilling and re-skilling at all levels. To that end, the Government will provide increased support for individuals developing their skills and qualifications at level 3 in priority sectors and to meet specific regional skills needs. We believe that this is the fairest way to manage participation in further education, and make productivity gains with public investment.</p>

This involves co-ordinating programmes to develop the financial sector, and to mainstream microfinance into the formal banking system.

These programmes improve the policy and regulatory environment for small enterprise development, and support the expansion of private banks and non-governmental organisations that provide microfinance services.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.0/1">The Afghanistan Transitional Administration has asked donors to concentrate on a few key areas of the reconstruction effort where they can have most impact. In response to this the UK is concentrating on building the capacity of the Afghan Government, humanitarian aid and programmes to support the development of income generation.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.0/2">We also fund Afghanistan's reconstruction effort through multi-lateral channels. The UK is the fourth largest donor to UNICEF and provided &pound;44 million overall funding in 2002. We provide 19 per cent. of the European Union's &pound;282 million package of reconstruction support for Afghanistan for 2003&ndash;04, of which &pound;17.5 million is programmed for the health sector to help reduce infant and maternal mortality by providing a basic health care package. We are also contributing towards the World bank's Afghanistan Health Sector Emergency Reconstruction and Development Project, which aims to help expand delivery of basic health services and work to ensure equitable access, particularly for women and children.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.0/3">Since April 2002 the European Commission has worked with the United States to rebuild 72 hospitals, clinics and women's health care centres, revise the national curriculum for midwives and vaccinate 4.3 million children against measles. Over 2003 and 2004, the EC will channel support through the Government to deliver health services to 3 million people and help to reduce the unacceptably high levels of child and maternal mortality.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.0/4">UNICEF has supported Emergency Obstetric Care services in 20 districts and refurbished Malalai hospital, the largest maternity hospital in Kabul with 15,000 deliveries every year. UNICEF plans to launch other facilities in Kandahar, Herat and Jalalabad to build up the maternal health infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.0/5">Although health is not a key area of our bilateral support, we have funded consultants to the MoH to assist with policy and planning. One of these consultants played a major role in developing the country's interim health strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.3/1">At the end of 2002 an estimated 850 square kilometres of land in Afghanistan were still contaminated with anti-personnel and anti-tank landmines, as well as bombs dropped from aircraft and other explosive devices, such as mortars, which fail to detonate on impact but are still capable of exploding when they are touched or moved. As many as 300 people per month were injured or killed by landmines and unexploded ordnance last year.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.3/2">The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) is responsible for co-ordinating 15 non-governmental organisations on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan for the clearing of mines and unexploded ordnance. We have provided &pound;5.3 million funding to UNMAS over the last three years for their clearance operations in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.3/3">Since 1989, 754 square kilometres of minefields and former battle areas have been cleared or declared safe. In addition, the programme has overseen services that taught more than 2.4 million people how to identify and avoid mines and unexploded ordnance. In 2002 alone, the programme cleared mines and unexploded ordnance from about 111 square kilometres of land.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.3/4">The Mine Action Programme for Afghanistan recently announced Afghanistan could be free from the threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance by 2012 if clearance operations continue at current levels and if international donor support is sustained.</p>

	<p pid=".556W.2/1">The Commission is analysing a number of options for reform of the EU sugar regime although, to date, no formal proposals have been made. DFID has already undertaken its own analysis on the impact on developing countries of the four families of reform options suggested by the Commission earlier this year. In addition, DFID has commissioned a study to explore the potential need for adjustment assistance for ACP countries with preferential access to the EU sugar market that may lose out from a reform of this regime. This analysis includes both least developed and non-least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This study will be presented to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/2">As agreed at the Luxembourg Council (June 2003), the Commission is expected to release a second round CAP reform proposal covering olive oil, tobacco and cotton in autumn 2003. The reforms will be based on the approach and objectives of the June 2003 CAP reform. On receipt of these reform proposals, DFID will consider the issue of assessing their implications for developing countries. There have not been any recent changes to the EU oil seeds regime nor are there expected to be.</p>

Reliable information on the time taken to process applications is not yet available.

	<p pid=".559W.2/1">The Government have no plans to ratify ILO Convention 163 for the reasons given in the 1989 White Paper (Cm 658), and notes that only 12 member states of the ILO have so far ratified. There is no procedure for ratifying an ILO recommendation. The United Kingdom is addressing the issue of seafarers' welfare by participating actively in ILO discussions aimed at consolidating the existing body of ILO maritime instruments within a new single instrument.</p>
	<p pid=".559W.2/2">A total of 65 ILO conventions, including all of the 'core' ILO conventions, which cover freedom of association and the right to organise and collective bargaining; the elimination of forced and child labour; and the ending of discrimination in employment, are in force in the UK. We also observe in principle many of the requirements of unratified conventions. The ILO has recognised the need to keep its instruments under review and recently withdrew or shelved 27 out of date conventions, while next year's conference will consider the withdrawal of 16 out of date recommendations. The ILO has also recognised the importance of a coherent approach to labour standards including through the proposed new consolidated maritime instrument and the general discussion at this year's International Labour Conference which for the first time was based on an integrated approach, taking account of all existing ILO instruments in the area of occupational safety and health.</p>
	<p pid=".559W.2/3">The table shows the ILO conventions which the United Kingdom has not ratified or has ratified and subsequently denounced. In recent years a number of conventions have been denounced automatically due to ratification of new, more up-to-date conventions which subsume the requirements of earlier instruments. We will continue to review unratified conventions.</p>

In addition, around 1.8 million people in receipt of the Minimum Income Guarantee have been told that they will be transferred automatically to Pension Credit ready for payments to be made from October 2003. By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted. These direct mail arrangements are being supported by a national TV and press advertising campaign, which began on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-03">3 September</phrase>. The Pension Service is also working with partner organisations at national and local level to encourage take-up of the new entitlement. The Pension Credit freephone application line, which became operational on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-07">7 April</phrase>, enables our trained staff to help pensioners through the application form and complete it for them over the telephone.

Northern Ireland incidence of positive cases of BSE for the period May 2002 to April 2003 is 112 positive cases per million adult cattle aged over 24 months.

	<p pid=".567W.8/2">At the Annual General Meeting of the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) in Paris on 18&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-23">23 May</phrase>, the EU proposed and the OIE accepted that, taking into consideration the active BSE monitoring programmes in place, and their efficiency at detecting BSE cases, the definition of &quot;moderate risk status&quot; should be doubled to 200 cases per million adult cattle aged over 24 months .</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/3">The current BSE incidence rate in the UK is above the 200 cases per million requirement but on current trends should drop below the 200 cases threshold by the end of the year. Taking Northern Ireland alone, we are already below the 200 threshold.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/4">While the development at OIE is welcome, before the UK or any region can be classified as having moderate risk status, this needs to be recognised in EU legislation. This may not necessarily be straightforward.</p>

	<p pid=".574W.2/1">Invest NI has focused significant resources in these areas in its overall drive to support existing companies to become more innovative and competitive and to encourage the formation of new, entrepreneurial, business starts. Support for existing hi-tech and telecommunications companies during 2002&ndash;03 resulted in companies bringing forward business proposals representing a total investment of almost &pound;109 million, against which Invest NI offered &pound;14.3 million in support. In addition, the Agency assisted the formation of 74 new, potentially high growth companies in these sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/2">In driving forward this work, Invest NI uses a broad range of measures designed to help all companies, both existing and new starts, increase their capability. These include fostering greater innovation, increasing levels of R&amp;D, developing external trade and utilising a variety of other business improvement tools.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/3">During its first year of operation, Invest NI played a key role in establishing the Northern Ireland Science Park and it also provided &pound;26 million to assist the establishment of 17 centres of research excellence, the majority of which are focused on high technology sectors. In addition, Invest NI has drawn up a series of Sector Strategies aimed at maximizing the economic development potential for a range of industrial sectors including hi-tech and telecoms.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/4">This work provides an important demonstration of Invest NI's commitment to engage with companies, higher and further education establishments, centres of research excellence, science parks and other research organisations in developing hi-tech start-up businesses. In addition Invest NI is working closely with the education sector and others to encourage entrepreneurship in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.0/1">Under NI legislation, the horse is not classified as an agricultural animal. This mirrors the position in the other parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.0/2">The Report &quot;Vision for the future of the agri-food industry&quot; included a number of recommendations relating to the equine sector. One of these was that the redesignation of the horse as an agricultural animal should be pursued in the longer term. In the Vision Action Plan which I published in November 2002, I highlighted that there were wider issues to consider and that these would be discussed with the industry in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.0/3">I have recently established an Equine Stakeholder Group, one of whose early tasks will be to advise on a comprehensive study of the equine industry in Northern Ireland. This will run in tandem with a similar study in Great Britain. The designation of the horse will be an aspect of both studies.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.0/4">The overall rating system in Northern Ireland is currently subject to a major policy review. A Policy paper on existing and potential non-domestic reliefs and exemptions will be published in late autumn. That paper will include consideration of the need for the introduction of any exemption or relief for the equine industry.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.3/1">A target has been set, by the Department, in &quot;Priorities for Action 2003&ndash;04&quot;, that all HSS Boards should have strategies to address locality equity issues prepared by March 2004 and work is ongoing on this. I understand that the Eastern Health and Social Services Board intend to publish their latest assessment of the locality equity position within their area in the autumn. It is their policy, endorsed by the Department, to ensure that existing services are maintained and to address equity issues by levelling up resources through skewing new money to populations that are currently receiving less than their target share. For example the population of the Down Lisburn area gained by some &pound;1.5 million through such a skewing strategy in 2003&ndash;04. It should be noted that equity assessments are based on the needs of a population living in an area and not on the funding of any specific Trust.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.3/2">Locality equity is a priority for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety but it must be balanced by the need to ensure that existing service provision is not destabilised. This results in change being phased in over a period, usually some 3&ndash;4 years.</p>

	<p pid=".576W.0/1">The Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) launched the Essential Skills for Living Strategy and Action Plan in October 2002. The strategy aims to support 25,000 adults to improve their literacy and numeracy skills by 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.0/2">The Department has established an Essential Skills Committee comprising key stakeholders from Government Departments, business and industry, the further education sector and the voluntary and community sector to take the strategy forward. It has developed also a framework of qualifications through the universities for all levels of essential skills tutors. During 2002&ndash;03, Queens University successfully delivered the Certificate in Management and Teaching of Literacy to 70 tutors and a further 66 have enrolled for the course in 2003&ndash;04. The Department launched a major promotional campaign in May 2003, with the aim of engaging a wide range of learners to improve their essential skills.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.0/3">Plans are in place to liaise with the Northern Ireland Departments to ensure essential skills is taken into account in the design and delivery of their policies and programmes. The Department of Finance and Personnel, for example, is developing a strategy and action plan for the delivery of essential skills throughout the Northern Ireland civil service. The Northern Ireland Prison Service has worked with DEL to enhance essential skills provision for prisoners and the Social Security Agency has been actively involved in considering new approaches to encourage benefit claimants to improve their essential skills. Pilot exercises using financial incentives and new essential skills screening tools are planned for January 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".576W.3/1">As a response to the December 2002 EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council decision, and the NI fishing community's reaction to it, I set up in January a Taskforce for South Down which is made up of officials from relevant NI Government departments, local councils and representatives of both the fish producers and processors to consider the wider socio-economic effects of the Council decisions and to identify whether there were more steps Government might take to address particular difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.3/2">To help inform its work, the Taskforce undertook a consultation exercise with public meetings in Kilkeel, Ardglass and Portavogie. In addition Taskforce representatives have met with the Tri-Council Fisheries Working Group and with the NI Fisheries Harbour Authority. The Taskforce has also received 15 written submissions. A survey of producers and processors is also being undertaken to obtain information and views from the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.3/3">The Taskforce will be assessing all the information collected and views received with a view to publishing its findings in the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.3/4">Finally, the Taskforce will also be following closely the work of the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit established by the Prime Minister to look at the medium to long-term issues facing the UK sea fishing industry. I am a member pf the Steering Group for this exercise.

	<p pid=".583W.0/3">We absolutely reject its offensive statements, as have the vast majority of Muslims living in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.0/4">However, we have a long-standing and important tradition of free speech in this country people have a right to air their views, however unpalatable they may be to others. But we also have tough legislative powers to catch those who cross the line from legitimate debate and comment, into inciting violence, or who commit offences motivated by racial or religious hatred. We tightened these powers in the Anti-Terrorism and Security Acts (2001). Police can and do use these powers.Every word and every statement that representatives of AI-Muhajiroun make is closely monitored by the appropriate authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.5/2" class="italic">Over the last two years, the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet has run and evaluated two successful national awareness campaigns. The campaigns sought to raise awareness of Internet safety measures, via cinema, television and radio advertising, national newspapers, online advertising on teen websites and chatrooms, and sponsorship activity. The core messages that were conveyed were that: children/young people should not give out their address, email, mobile or other contact details, that they should never attend a face-to-face meeting unaccompanied by an adult, and that people may lie about their identity. The task force also issued a 'Keeping your child safe on the Internet' leaflet and 200,000 copies of the leaflet were distributed via doctors surgeries and as an insert in the Department for Education and Skills magazine <i>Parents</i> + Schools</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/3">The Home Office also runs two websites, thinkuknow.co.uk and wiseuptothenet.co.uk. The former is aimed at children and young people and the latter is aimed at parents. The Department for Education and Skills, Superhighway website and guidance, includes advice on all aspects of Internet safety such as walled gardens, firewalls, user contacts and net smart rules. Their revised guidance also includes advice on e-mails for students, filtering systems, school websites and chatrooms.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.2/1">Since 1999, the UK Passport Service (UKPS) has put in place a number of measures which have all contributed to speeding up the process of renewing a passport.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.2/2">The UKPS has increased capacity by 30 per cent. through increased staffing, and the opening of a seventh passport office in Durham in March 2000. It opened its new London office in June 2000 which provides much improved service to its customers. TheUKPS has extended the working hours of its public counters which open longer on weekdays, and on Saturdays, and introduced a guaranteed one-day and one-week services, available by appointment, for those customers who need an urgent renewal service. The UKPS Service Standard has been set to process 99.5 per cent. of all correctly completed passport applications within 10 days and this is being consistently achieved throughout this year. To encourage renewal customers to apply early at less busy times, the UKPS has introduced a facility whereby customers can be credited on their new passport with the unexpired validity of their old passport, up to a maximum of nine months.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.2/3">The UKPS has also improved the guidance to customers wishing to renew their passport. Page 1 of the information guide, which accompanies the passport application form, has a separate and clearly highlighted statement on what sections of the form to complete for renewals, and other relevant advice, to make completion of the form and its accurate submission easier. Finally, the UKPS has established a Call Centre, which handles passport inquiries 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and has enhanced its website (<a href="http://www.passport.gov.uk">www.passport.gov.uk</a>) to enable, among other things, e-mail inquiries, and online renewal application form completion. These measures all help customers to complete their applications accurately and to use the correct application channel to meet their needs.</p>

	<p pid=".588W.2/1">The Government's restorative justice strategy, issued on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-22">22 July 2003</phrase>, sets out proposals to extend the use of restorative justice, including mediation and reparation to victims and the community.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/2">The Government aims to maximise the use of restorative justice in the Criminal Justice System, where we know it works well, to meet victims' needs and to reduce re-offending, and in society at large to resolve disputes and build strong, active communities. The strategy will also encourage more high quality, visible reparation by offenders to the community. The key link between restorative justice and reparation is that both are ways the offender can take responsibility for the harm they have caused and put it right. Both are ways that the Criminal Justice System can bring visible benefits to victims and other ordinary citizens, and be seen to be responsive to their needs. In practice, restorative justice can often lead to the offender making reparation to their victim, or to the wider community.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/3">The launch of this strategy (which can be found on the Home Office website) marks the start of a 12-week consultation process. Officials have been working closely with criminal justice practitioners and the voluntary sector to develop the restorative justice strategy. Comments on the consultation paper are welcome.</p>

It is, of course, for local authorities to decide how best to provide support and services for children in need in its area, including accommodation for children who are the victims of trafficking. There is no current specific earmarked funding for services of this nature. Instead, Government funding is allocated to councils with social services responsibilities on the basis of the needs of their populations. It is, therefore, for councils, working in partnership with relevant local stakeholders, to determine their spending priorities on the basis of local needs. A National Asylum Support Service grant reimburses local authorities for the extra costs incurred for the care of unaccompanied asylum seeking children.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.5/2">West Sussex recognise that a body of expertise has been built up in the safe house over the last two years. They plan to close the safe house and use this expertise in the form of training and support packages for carers of young people assessed as being at risk of being trafficked. Currently, the safe house caters only for 17 and 18-year-old girls. There are also concerns that its location has become widely known, thus undermining the security of the service provided. West Sussex feel that by closing the safe house they will be able to offer a service to all children at risk from traffickers, including boys and under-16s and address the security concerns that have arisen.</p>

	<p pid=".590W.2/1">We continue to monitor the situation in Chechnya and in the Caucasus. We have noted the steps the Russian Government is taking to establish a political process in Chechnya and welcomed the constitutional referendum held in March 2003. We continue to believe that the success of the political process will be dependent on the thorough and consistent implementation of the political and civil rights set out in the new constitution. While recognising the serious threat posed by terrorism in the region, we remain concerned about the security and human rights situation in Chechnya and the surrounding republics. We also note with concern the bombings in recent months throughout the North Caucasus.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.2/2">Conflicts in and between the countries of the Southern Caucasus pose challenges for regional security and stability and the prospects for regional co-operation. As a member of the Group of Friends of the UN Secretary General on Georgia, the UK is participating in the process to find a political settlement to the Abkhazia dispute. On Nagorno Karabakh our policy is to support any solution acceptable to both parties, and capable of delivering a lasting political settlement. We support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group in this regard. Her Majesty's Government's Special Representative for the Caucasus region. Sir Brian Fall, is actively addressing these problems and will work closely with his newly-appointed EU colleague.</p>

	<p pid=".595W.5/7">This requirement applies to all visitors to the High Commission and is not aimed specifically at a particular nationality. However, since the collapse of the central authority in Somalia in 1991, there has been no reliable body authorised to issue marriage or birth certificates, passports or any other form of identification. Therefore, these restrictions affect the majority of Somali nationals who wish to apply at our Visa Section in Nairobi for entry clearance to the UK.</p>

The Visa Section in Addis Ababa is able to accept applications from all Somali nationals, even those without documents. Applications can be made in person or through an agent.

	<p pid=".597W.8/1">The provision to introduce a statutory corporation tax relief for employee share acquisition announced in the November 2002 Pre-Budget Report was brought into effect by Schedule 23 of Finance Act 2003. The estimate of exchequer costs to provide the statutory relief is in the Final Regulatory Impact Assessment published on the <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-10">10 April 2003</phrase> and remain unchanged, growing to around &pound;95 million by 2007&ndash;08. The purpose of the statutory relief is to encourage and enable companies to set-up or expand employee share schemes by removing the need for complex arrangements solely to obtain a CT deduction. It levels the playing field between the use of cash and equity as remuneration and provides a modern, simple and fair system. It gives certainty to companies in terms of timing and amount of relief, reduces administration and compliance costs.</p>

	<p pid=".599W.3/4" class="indent">The Labour Force Survey (LFS) gives estimates of part-time and temporary employment rates, but not the numbers of people, for Parliamentary Constituencies. The latest available estimate, for the twelve month period ending February 2002, is that 24.9 per cent of the employed population resident in Crosby were working part-time. The LFS sample size is too small to give reliable estimates of temporary employment for Crosby.</p>

This research concluded that both schemes have met their objectives of encouraging more investment by individuals in smaller, high risk trading companies, which in turn has increased their potential to grow and become successful. The research did not measure the benefits of the holding period change specifically, but found that, of those existing investors that were aware of any changes made to the schemes, up to half would be more likely to invest through the schemes in future as a result.</p>

	<p pid=".600W.0/1">Estimates of the exchequer cost of tax and national insurance relief on options granted under Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) were published in Budget 2000 for 2000&ndash;01 to 2002&ndash;03 (Table A.13). The additional costs of subsequent changes to the EMI rules were published in Budget 2001 (Table A.13) and the pre-Budget report 2001 (Table B4). These estimates are of the taxable salary sacrificed in lieu of EMI option grants and no further estimates have been made on this basis.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.0/2">Each year, estimates of the tax and national insurance relief cost of gains made by employees upon exercise of their EMI options are published in Inland Revenue Statistics on the Revenue's website at <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/empshareschemes/menu.htm">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/emp share schemes/menu.htm</a>. Only a very small number of employees exercised their options in the early years of EMI, so the estimated costs were negligible for 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02. These costs will rise as the scheme matures.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.0/3">As stated in the Full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), published in March 2000, a full review of the success of EMI will take place during 2005. In the meantime, the Inland Revenue continues to monitor the administration, take-up, and exchequer costs of the initiative. To date, around 4,000 companies have granted EMI options to around 60,000 employees.</p>

	<p pid=".605W.7/1">The UK government have been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief issues, and continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.7/2">Of the 38 countries that stand to benefit from enhanced HIPC debt relief, there are now 27&mdash;23 from Africa and 4 from Latin America&mdash;that already benefit from debt relief, which will amount in total to over $70 billion. This is a significant step towards achieving the $100 billion commitment made at the Cologne summit in 1999, and will reduce their debts to below the average for developing countries. For these 27 countries, the UK is providing 100 per cent. relief on their debts. Furthermore, the Chancellor has announced that any payments from countries yet to reach Decision Point would be held in trust for the day they can be returned to fund poverty reduction. Since 1999, the total UK commitment to multilateral institutions such as the World bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support the HIPC initiative has been $474 million.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.7/3">At their recent Summit in Evian, G8 governments reaffirmed their commitment to the HIPC initiative. They recognised the need to encourage and assist eligible countries in taking the steps necessary to complete the HIPC process. They urged the IMF and World bank to intensify their efforts to secure full participation of all creditors in the initiative, and reaffirmed their objective of ensuring debt sustainability for countries reaching completion point. Following on from discussions at Evian, the Chancellor will be working with other G7 Finance Ministers to agree the methodology for calculating the amount of &quot;topping-up&quot; debt relief available to countries. The UK has been pushing for a change in the rules of HIPC to exclude additional voluntary bilateral debt relief from the calculation of topping-up at Completion Point and the Chancellor will be working with other G8 Finance Ministers to review mechanisms to encourage good governance and the methodology for calculating the amount of topping-up debt relief available to countries&mdash;a measure that could provide an estimated $1 billion extra debt relief to HIPCs. In addition, the Treasury and the Department for International Development is seeking international support to establish the International Finance Facility, which could raise $50 billion annually to fund the Millennium Development Goals. This money could be disbursed in the form of concessional loans and grants, including debt relief.</p>

The only exceptions are public law Children Act cases and hearings before the Mental Health Review Tribunal, for which funding is available on a non-means, non-merits basis. A cost-benefit test is an important part of this assessment. The Code imposes different types of cost-benefit test according to the nature of the case.

Authorities have a statutory power to delay payment if they are under financial pressure but in these cases this must not be beyond 12 months from the date of grant application.</p>

This includes target times for the complete delivery process including needs assessment, processing of the application and the completion of building works. These target times will depend on the complexity of, and priority attached to, individual cases but the guidance suggests that the maximum target time for the entire process should in any event be no more than 260 working days and only 80 working days in high priority cases.</p>

In all the Government will be providing around &pound;5 billion for investment in affordable housing by 2005&ndash;06. Decisions on the allocation of these funds will be based on recommendations from the regional housing boards based on priorities identified in regional housing strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".612W.0/1">Planning policy guidance note 23 &quot;Planning and pollution control&quot;, which was published in 1994 clearly states that the arrangements for sewage disposal are capable of being a material consideration in planning applications and appeals. It advises that local planning authorities may need to refuse planning permission where they are not satisfied about the adequacy of sewerage infrastructure or they may be able to impose conditions to ensure that suitable arrangements are in place. Examples of the types of conditions are given in Department of the Environment Circular 11/95 &quot;The use of conditions in planning permissions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.0/2">The consideration given to sewage disposal when determining planning applications will depend on the circumstances. Local authority planning officers are only responsible for enforcing planning conditions that have been imposed. In many circumstances there will be no need to impose planning conditions related to sewerage arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.0/3">However, Part H of the Building Regulations 2000 requires the provision of an adequate system of drainage to carry foul water from appliances within the building to a prioritised list of alternative foul water outfalls (public or private sewer, septic tank or a cesspool). Enforcement of the Building Regulations 2000 is by local authority building control departments or approved inspectors. Where a connection is to be made to a public sewer, under the Water Industry Act 1991, there is a duty to notify the sewerage undertaker and provision for the undertaker to inspect the connection.</p>

Since 1997, our strategy for tackling poverty has been to target our help on the poorest pensioners through the minimum income guarantee, the new pension credit and winter fuel payments. The poorest third of pensioners households will have gained over &pound;1,600 a year in real terms.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/2">The Social Exclusion Unit is taking forward a programme of work looking at impacts and trends in social exclusion. This will develop a clearer understanding of how Government policies work together to tackle social exclusion for particular groups, including older people. The programme of work includes a review of the evidence about the impact of policies on social exclusion among older people</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/3">The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit aims to ensure that older people benefit from regeneration initiatives. The work of Local Strategic Partnerships should be informed by the views of all local groups, including older people. We are making &pound;36 million available through the Community Empowerment Fund to make sure that under-represented groups are better able to have their voices heard at the local level.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/4">Fear of crime can itself be a cause of social exclusion, particularly among some older people. Neighbourhood Warden Schemes are showing early signs of reducing crime and the fear of crime across some of the most deprived neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises that it needs to know more about those older people who live within the most deprived areas. Following the recent consultation on updating the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, we will be creating an index of income deprivation among older people.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/6">The &quot;Supporting People&quot; programme offers vulnerable members of the community, including older people, the opportunity to improve their quality of life through greater independence, which can help to combat social exclusion. Through this programme we are promoting high quality, strategically planned housing-related support services that will enable older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.8/1">Cancer of the oesophagus affects around 6,000 people a year in England and Wales, the majority of whom are aged 40 or over. Common symptoms of the cancer are heartburn and difficulty in swallowing. Most people also lose weight and about half have anaemia, which causes severe tiredness.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.8/2">Cancer of the oesophagus or gullet develops as a result of cell changes in the lining of the oesophagus. There are two main types of cancer of the oesophagus: squamous carcinoma, which is more common at the upper end of the gullet; and adenocarcinoma, which is more common at the lower end, particularly around the junction between the gullet and the stomach. There has been a recent increase in the proportion of tumours arising close to the junction of stomach and gullet, but the reasons for this are not yet known.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.8/3">We know that cancer patients need to be diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible. This is a very stressful and anxious time for them and they want a diagnosis of their condition as quickly as possible. The Government launched the NHS Cancer Plan on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-27">27 September 2000</phrase>. This sets out the first ever comprehensive strategy to tackle the disease. It is a major programme of action linking prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and research.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.8/4">The Cancer Plan sets out new waiting time targets for cancer treatment. A two-week out-patient waiting time standard was introduced for all urgently referred suspected cancer patients in December 2000 and the most recent figures show that over 98 per cent. of all urgent referrals were seen with two weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.8/5">By 2005, all cancer patients will wait a maximum of one month from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum of two months from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment. The Government's ultimate goal is that no patient should wait longer than one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment, except for a good clinical reason or through personal choice. It is planned to achieve this by 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.8/6">However, past decades of under investment mean this goal is not yet within reach. We are making significant extra investment&mdash;an extra &pound;570 million a year by 2003&ndash;04&mdash;the biggest ever single cash investment in cancer equipment, additional doctors and nurses working in new ways and modernisation through the Cancer Services Collaborative, which aims to cut out delays in the patient journey.</p>

	<p pid=".625W.5/2">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently developing a guideline on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary and secondary care. It is due to publish the guideline in 2004. In January 2003 the Respiratory Alliance published their guidance, &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot;, which aims to help primary care trusts (PCTs) to commission and deliver high quality allergy and respiratory care.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.5/3">In line with our policy of &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, it is up to PCTs, in conjunction with strategic health authorities (SHAs) to take this work forward. I have been advised by the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire SHA that in Gloucestershire patients with COPD have access to support within the primary care setting and also secondary care services within the wider hospital respiratory team. The local PCTs in Gloucestershire are jointly funding a project post to look at ways in which delivery of the current service can be improved, and to consider the development of future initiatives including COPD rehabilitation.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.2/1">The most comprehensive source of information is the National Sentinel Stroke Audit, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians. The audit was commissioned by the national health service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at <a href="http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit01-02.pdf">http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit 01&ndash;02.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.2/2">The 2002 audit shows that 73 per cent. of trusts that participated had a stroke unit, compared to 56 per cent. three years earlier. The audit shows that 80 per cent. of trusts that participated have a consultant physician with specialist knowledge of stroke who is formally recognised as having principal responsibility for stroke services. While it is recognised that some services need to increase their capacity, the audit notes that very significant improvements have already been made.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.2/3">Our major vehicle for further improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework (NSF), which sets specific milestones for improvement by 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts, specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, &quot;Improvement, Expansion and Reform&quot;, which sets for the NHS a priorities and planning framework for 2003&ndash;06, makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.2/4">We monitor progress against the key milestones in the NSF. From the information gathered so far, we know that 83 per cent. of the hospitals which have replied now have plans to have a specialist stroke service in place by April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.5/1">Due mainly to the introduction of fluoride toothpaste and the fluoridation of water in some areas of the country, there has, over the last 20 years, been a major improvement in oral health. Nearly 60 per cent. of 5-years-olds now have no experience of tooth decay. However, significant variations remain which, in areas where drinking water is not fluoridated, are strongly associated with economic and social deprivation. The Government are committed to reducing these inequalities and have made provision in the Water Bill, currently before Parliament, to give communities with high levels of tooth decay a real option of having their water fluoridated. We have also established the &quot;Brushing for Life&quot; scheme in areas of poor dental health, whereby families with young children receive free fluoridated toothpaste, toothbrushes and advice on oral hygiene when attending child health developmental checks at aged eight months and 18 months and three years.</p>
