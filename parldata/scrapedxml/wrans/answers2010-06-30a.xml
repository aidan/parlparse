Passports that have been recorded as lost or stolen that are subsequently recovered by the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) are normally destroyed, not clipped. The loss of a passport was reported by an individual with exactly the same name and date of birth as the holder of passport No 704503426. Therefore, the passport was recorded as lost in error.

However, consolidation of the court estate both in terms of function as well as location could mean that some court users will make fewer trips to court, e.g. CPS officers and solicitors may have to travel to fewer courts, and so lessening the overall impact. Fewer courts may also reduce the need for duty solicitors, decreasing costs incurred by the Legal Services Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.551W.6/1">Prisoners who are sentenced to six months normally serve three months in prison. Adult prisoners sentenced to less than 12 months are not subject to supervision by the probation service on release from custody. However, they are 'at risk' of return to custody by the courts, to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence, if they commit an imprisonable offence before the expiry date of the original sentence. Young offenders (those under the age of 22 released from a term of detention in a YOI) are subject to a minimum of three months supervision. Juveniles prisoners sentenced to a detention and training order are supervised as part of the conditions of these sentences. These arrangements for release at the half-way point of sentence were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.6/2">The actual amount of time served in prison, following sentence, will depend on a number of factors, including time spent as a remand prisoner or credit for time spent on tagged bail if directed by the court, any added days and release on either home detention curfew or end of custody licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.6/3">For those prisoners discharged in 2004 to 2008 having been sentenced to six months, the amount of time served including remand is shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.9/1">The Department for Transport has not made a general estimate of the economic effect of a tonne of freight being taken by rail instead of by road because in the majority of cases industry choose the most efficient mode, thereby balancing the amount the carriage of the freight is worth with the cost of moving it by particular modes.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.9/2">Where the Department intervenes in mode-choice, grants are given in order to account for impacts that do not necessarily figure in industry decision making. One of these impacts is road congestion and its associated economic impact, which can be reduced by taking freight by rail instead of by road. The costs of congestion vary by where on the road network a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) travels and detailed estimates of these costs for articulated HGVs were published in April 2009. Tables 4 and 7 in the report 'Mode Shift Benefit Values: Technical Report' show estimates for different types of road and in different areas. The analysis found that on average the cost of congestion is 52p per mile for an articulated HGV. The document is available on the internet at the following address:</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.6/1">It is not possible to calculate accurately the numbers affected by the pay freeze in April 2011 due to factors such as promotion, recruitment, retirement etc. However, it is estimated that about three quarters or some 140,000 service personnel are on salaries above &#163;21,000 and so would be subject to the public sector pay freeze next year. Most service personnel whether in receipt of a pay rise or not, will continue to receive annual increments on the anniversary of their seniority in rank and so will still get an increase in pay at some point. In addition, those personnel deployed on operations will continue to benefit from a range of additional allowances, for example the operational allowance, which was recently doubled, as well as the wider operational welfare package.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.6/2">It is not possible to predict with any accuracy the proportion of particular Brigades that will be affected by the pay freeze in April 2011. If a similar pay freeze had come into effect in April 2010 we estimate between 70-75%of the 16 Air Assault Brigade would have been affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.556W.9/1">There are two main reasons for the changes that have been made to timetable for the delivery of the Astute class submarines. First, delays to boat one have been caused by technical issues, which are not uncommon on first of class vessels. These have been exacerbated by the need to re-establish the UK's nuclear submarine design, build, testing and commissioning capability following a ten year gap since the delivery of the last submarine and 17 years since the last first of class, HMS VANGUARD. The second reason was a conscious decision of the previous Government to slow down the production of boats two to seven in response to in-year budgetary pressures.</p>

	<p pid="a.560W.8/1">DEFRA-funded expenditure on bovine tuberculosis in England was &#163;63 million in 2009-10. We are currently looking at options to introduce a carefully-managed and science-led policy of badger control in areas with high and persistent levels of bovine TB, and it is not yet possible to provide cost estimates. More generally, it is difficult to forecast TB expenditure accurately because compensation and testing, which account for the largest proportion of annual expenditure on TB, are linked to market values for cattle and to disease levels.</p>

Heads of Mission overseas are allocated a car for their official use. They have first call on the vehicle for official purposes but they are made available for other official business as required. The security situation in some countries may occasionally necessitate the use of dedicated vehicles for staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.5/2">FCO Services, an executive agency of the FCO operating independently as a trading fund, operates a small pool of vehicles and security cleared drivers used mainly for transportation of diplomatic bags and other classified material. Certain senior officials (including the Permanent Under-Secretary) are able to draw on this pool for official and operationally necessary travel, on a pay-per-use basis with bookings made in advance. Use of the FCO Services car pool is subject to operational need and governed by strict internal guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.5/3">FCO staff travel by the most efficient means of transport, bearing in mind the operational requirement and the need to secure value for money for the public purse. Public transport is used whenever possible and staff avoid using taxis on official business unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.5/4">Staff should not normally use a taxi at public expense between home and office-nor between airports and central London-except for journeys during the hours when public transport is not running. If it is absolutely necessary for staff to work after 9 pm or before 7 am, they may consider taking a taxi from their destination station to their home address or vice versa.</p>

	<p pid="a.589W.2/3">A close and effective link between pay and performance is a key element of the pay arrangements for the civil service. For the senior civil service (SCS), for whom pay is managed by the Cabinet Office and which is based on recommendations by the Senior Salaries Review Body, performance incentives are paid primarily as non-consolidated performance payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.2/4">Non-consolidated, variable, performance related payments help drive continuing high performance as they must be re-earned each year. Performance is measured through the annual appraisal process which is designed specifically to help staff develop their potential and make the fullest contribution towards the achievement of FCO objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.589W.8/1">It is a condition of their employment that members of the Diplomatic Service (DS) must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. Members of the Diplomatic Service pay UK tax wherever they work and are entitled to have their children educated at public expense. Most parents prefer to take their children with them on posting, but in some countries we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.8/2">Children's education should not be disadvantaged by the fact that their parents are in the Diplomatic Service. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps staff meet their potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK where staff choose this, or are obliged to do so given local conditions in the country to which they are posted. We expect children who accompany their parents on postings overseas to use free state schooling if it is available locally and suitable. If suitable English-language schooling is not available free of charge locally, but is available at fee-charging schools, we refund fees to enable children to receive the education they would be entitled to in the UK. This provision applies to all our diverse DS staff posted overseas, including junior support staff and single parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.8/3">Over the last five years the Department has paid for between 1,500 and 2,000 children of British diplomats to receive the education to which they are entitled, either in the UK or at local schools overseas. Expenditure in the UK has decreased in real terms as fewer families now choose boarding school but costs of schools overseas have increased as sterling has weakened. The costs are as follows:-</p>
