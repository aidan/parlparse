	<p pid="c.782W.2/1">There are already established processes and protocols to identify and manage any risks or threats to sports betting integrity in Great Britain. Our present assessment, based on the experience of previous Olympic events, is that there is a relatively low risk of a major sports betting integrity issue occurring at the London 2012 games. The impact of any such incident could be significant so we do need to ensure that the UK is well prepared to respond to any concerns that arise. Officials from the department are already working with the Gambling Commission, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic games, licensed betting operators and the police to ensure effective preparations are made in advance of the 2012 games. I will be attending the IOC's meeting on betting integrity on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-15">15 June</phrase> having attended an initial meeting on this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.792W.9/1">The Government agrees with the conclusions of Sir Michael Lyons that the Local Authority Business Growth Incentive scheme was complex, unpredictable and not transparent. Instead, the Local Government Resource Review is considering proposals to allow local authorities to keep at least a proportion of their business rates. Such an approach could help set free many local councils from dependency on central Government funding and provide incentives, through the business rates system, for them to promote economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.9/2">The Local Authority Business Growth Incentive scheme ran for three years (2005-06 -2007-08), and then there was a break for a year, before it was established for a further two year period (2009-10 &#8211; 2010-11), although the second year payments were cancelled. In between the two schemes, the previous administration ran two consultations (October 2007 and August 2008) on how it might be reformed.</p>

This estimate is a three year average based on data from the Survey of English Housing (2007-08) and the English Housing Survey (2008-09 and 2009-10).

It offers free and impartial financial information and advice to members of the public nationally online, by telephone, and face-to-face.</p>
	<p pid="c.801W.9/2">Its services cover the full spectrum of financial issues and include help and advice at key life stages, for example, for those starting work or facing redundancy.

Business Link is the support service in England which provides businesses with impartial information and advice, including on finances, to start and develop their business. It is available online and by telephone. The devolved Administrations have equivalent support services to Business Link, which in some cases, also includes additional face to face support. Under the aegis of the British Bankers' Association Business Finance Taskforce, the major UK banks have also committed to creating a website for businesses in which they can get impartial information about how to secure finance and the best options for their business. They are also developing a business mentoring scheme which will be rolled out in phases across the country this year.</p>

UNRWA has also attracted additional contributions from the Islamic Development Bank and an increased commitment from Saudi Arabia, although it continues to seek further support from regional donors for its education and food funds.

The UK is UNRWA's second largest bilateral donor and is considered a model donor for providing long term support through our five year &#163;110 million funding agreement.

	<p pid="c.810W.6/1">Delivering on our energy and climate change commitments is vital if the UK is to transform the way that we generate and use energy, and drive ambitious action on climate change, in the UK and abroad. DECC's business plan sets out our core functions and strategic priorities, the steps we are taking to achieve them and the indicators which will show whether or not they are having the desired impact. Progress against the plan is regularly monitored internally and is set out in the structural reform plan monthly updates and the forthcoming quarterly data summary, to be published on our website.</p>
	<p pid="c.810W.6/2">In delivering these high level plans, DECC works through a range of different delivery mechanisms and partners. DECC is constantly seeking to ensure that these mechanisms are effective and deliver best value for money and has recently conducted a review of the Department's delivery landscape and a review of the energy regulatory framework. Both of these can be found on the DECC website. The DECC Delivery Unit also plays an important role in tracking progress on delivery commitments and working with teams to test policies for their 'deliverability' from conception through to implementation.</p>

	<p pid="c.814W.2/1">The Nuclear Installations Act 1965 imposes third party liabilities on nuclear operators, and also requires operators to cover these liabilities &#8220;by insurance or by some other means&#8221;. &#8216;There is no legal responsibility on the Government to act as an insurer for the operators' nuclear third party liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.2/2">In the recent consultation on implementing changes to the Paris convention on third party nuclear liability and the Brussels supplementary convention, the Government set out its proposals for significantly increasing the scale and scope of operators' third party liabilities. Although it appears that commercial insurance will be available to cover most of the new liabilities, there is doubt about whether such insurance (or other commercial cover) will be able to cover all of the liabilities. In the circumstances,. the Government also set out its proposal to make provision to enable it to provide cover in return for a charge where cover is not available on the commercial market. The alternative would be not to impose on the operator the liabilities for which commercial cover is not available and for these liabilities to remain with the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.2/3">The responsibility of Government following a nuclear accident will vary depending on the nature and scale of the accident. The position with third party liability costs is that under the current Conventions operators' liability is capped. The costs above this would have to be met from public funds up to the limit set under the Convention, above this Government and Parliament would have discretion to meet further claims.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.2/4">The costs of a nuclear accident are not just limited to third party liability. In the event that the accident led to the permanent closure of the site, then the operator of a nuclear power station is responsible for ensuring that the site is decommissioned and remediated in accordance with relevant legal and licensing requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.2/5">For the existing Magnox stations this responsibility sits with the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency and therefore the Government. With regard to the existing AGR stations and the PWR at Sizewell B, which are operated by British Energy, part of EDF Energy, decommissioning and clean up costs will be met by the Nuclear Liabilities Fund. The Government announced at the time of British Energy's restructuring in 2009 that it would fund qualifying liabilities to the extent that they exceed all the assets of the Fund. With regard to any new nuclear power stations it is the Government's policy that operators must have arrangements in place to meet the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste management and disposal costs. The Energy Act 2008 requires prospective operators of any new nuclear power stations to have a Funded Decommissioning programme, approved by the Secretary of State, in place before construction begins and to comply with this programme thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="c.815W.0/1">The UK is a signatory to the Paris convention on nuclear third party liability and the Brussels supplementary convention. Under the conventions third party liability for operators is capped and in the UK, under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, is currently &#163;140 million. If compensation claims exceed &#163;140 million, the Government would be obliged to top-up the total amount available for compensation to 300 million Special Drawing Rights (about &#163;300 million) (although it would be able to claim back contributions from the other countries that are party to the Brussels convention) . Above this, Government and Parliament have statutory discretion to pay compensation to meet outstanding claims. In a recent consultation the Government proposed increasing the operator liability level from &#163;140 million to &#8364;1200 million, which is &#8364;500 million more than the minimum required by the Paris convention. If compensation claims exceed &#8364;1200 million, a further &#8364;300 million must be made available by the Government although, as now, it will be able to claim back contributions from the other countries that are party to the Brussels convention. Above &#8364;1500 million Government and Parliament have statutory discretion to meet any third party claims.</p>

	<p pid="c.822W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is responsible for welfare and employment issues and we have developed a coherent strategy to address poverty and to support the most vulnerable, helping people break the cycle of benefit dependency. A crucial part of this is to ensure that people are not written off to a lifetime on benefits because they have a health condition or disability. Many people with health conditions are able to sustain and progress in employment. The Department therefore needs to ensure that people currently receiving incapacity benefits are supported in preparing for a return to work where some form of employment is a possibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.822W.5/2">The reassessment of old-style incapacity benefits claimants is a key part of our agenda to create and deliver a 21<sup>(st)</sup> century welfare system by ensuring that those people who can work are given the correct support to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.822W.5/3">Through the groundbreaking Work Programme we are giving those in the private and voluntary sector the freedom to design tailor-made back to work support built around the needs of the individual. The referral process is designed to give harder to help groups on benefits access to the programme at the appropriate stage in their claim. Once on the programme, advisers will devise tailored back to work plans for each claimant, taking in to account their circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.822W.5/4">In addition, we are currently taking through Parliament the Welfare Reform Bill which makes widespread reforms to the welfare system. An underlying principle of our reforms is to provide a more joined-up service, which is easier and more transparent for claimants to navigate their way through in order to receive personal financial support. Most notably, Universal Credit will provide a new single system of means-tested support for working-age people in and out of work. Support for housing costs, children and child care costs will be integrated in the new benefit. It will also provide additions for disabled people and carers.</p>

	<p pid="c.824W.5/1">There were 50,100 appeals heard against the Fit for Work decision for new employment and support allowance (ESA) claims made up to the end of February 2010, where the primary condition was classed as Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Of the appeals heard over this period 28,900 (58%) were upheld in favour of DWP.</p>
	<p pid="c.824W.5/2">The data presented above comes from benefit claims data held by the Department for Work and Pensions, functional assessment data from Atos Healthcare and appeals data from the Tribunals Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.824W.5/3">Data on appeals heard are published for new ESA claims starting between October 2008, when ESA was introduced, and up to the. end of February 2010 (the latest month where there are sufficient volumes of appeals heard). Appeals are only included in the figures where the person claiming has been found Fit for Work, they have subsequently appealed against the Department's decision and the appeal has been heard by the Tribunals Service. Figures are only available for appeals that have been completed and not those that are currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="c.824W.5/4">Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted to the Tribunals Service and heard, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard. As a result these figures should continue to be treated as emerging findings and not final at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="c.836W.2/1">An impact assessment for part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 was published in December 2008 and summarised the full costs and benefits of implementing the coroners provisions in the Act, including those relating to appeals. This estimated overall set up costs of &#163;10.9 million and running costs of &#163;6.6 million per annum. I placed a further, more detailed, breakdown of those figures in the Library of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-20">20 May</phrase>. This estimated that approximately &#163;2.2 million of the running costs would be needed to fund appeals to the chief coroner. No further analysis has been conducted.</p>

	<p pid="c.844W.0/1">Under a determinate sentence of 12 months or more imposed under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (for offences committed after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>) the legislation requires that prisoners must be released automatically at the half way point with the rest of the sentence served on licence in the community and subject to recall to prison. If recalled to prison, the offender may serve some or all of the rest of his sentence in custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/2">For some, lower risk offenders serving sentences of less than four years, release may be granted at the discretion of the prison governor earlier than the half-way point on Home Detention Curfew (HDC), where the offender is subject to an electronically monitored curfew (or &quot;tagging&quot;). All registered sex offenders and violent offenders serving extended sentences are excluded from HDC, and prisoners who are eligible to be considered must pass an individual risk assessment before HDC may be granted.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/3">Offenders convicted of serious violent or sexual offences committed before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase> and subject to a sentence of four years or more remain subject to the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Under such a determinate sentence the offender may be released between the half way and two-thirds point of the sentence by the Parole Board, with release automatic at the two thirds point. Once released, the offender is on licence and subject to recall to prison up to the three quarters point of the sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/4">Adults serving a determinate sentence of less than 12 months serve half the sentence in custody and are then 'at risk' for the remainder of their sentence, which means that if they commit a further offence during this period they may have to serve the outstanding part of the sentence. However, offenders aged 18 to 21 who are subject to a sentence of Detention in a Young Offender Institution (DYOI) of less than 12 months are subject to a minimum period of three months supervision following release from custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/5">Offenders may be detained in custody beyond the automatic release date if they are subject to added days imposed under disciplinary proceedings for behaviour in prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/6">Under an indeterminate sentence, the offender must serve in full the minimum term imposed by the court before being considered for release by the Parole Board. If and when the offender is released he or she is subject to licence conditions and recall to prison. If the offender is serving a sentence of imprisonment for public protection the licence period is a minimum often years. The licence period under a life sentence lasts for the whole of the offender's natural life.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/7">Young people sentenced to detention and training orders serve the first half of their sentence in custody and the second half in the community. Early release allows those young people who meet the criteria to be released from custody either one or two months earlier than their mid point date, depending on the length of their sentence. The early release scheme is available to young people serving a DTO, of between eight and 24 months in length. On release, it is a mandatory requirement for the young person to be electronically monitored for the period when they would otherwise have been in custody; until the midpoint. There is a presumption that all young people will be released early unless they are serving a sentence for specific sexual or violent offences, or their behaviour and/or progress against their training plan is unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/8">Young people aged 10-17 convicted of certain serious offences serve the first half of their sentence in custody up and the second part in the community, subject to supervision requirements. Young people serving terms of between three months and four years may be eligible for earlier release under a home detention curfew, which operates in a similar way to the adult scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/9">The first table shows the number of prisoners released from determinate sentences for <i>(a)</i> rape, <i>(b)</i> other sexual offences, and <i>(c)</i>violence against the person offences, by detailed sentence length band in each year from 2001-10 (except 2009 where the data is not available to this level of detail). From the data held centrally, it is not possible to separately identify those offenders convicted of sexual offences against children; they are included with other sexual offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/10">The second table shows the number of prisoners released from prison and subject to supervision in the community for <i>(a) </i>rape, <i>(b)</i> other sexual offences, and <i>(c)</i> violence against the person offences in each year from 2001-10 (except 2009 where the data is not available to this level of detail). Again sexual offences against children will be included in the other sexual offences group.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/11">The third table shows the proportion of time served by offenders discharged from determinate sentences for <i>(a)</i> rape, <i>(b)</i> other sexual offences, and <i>(c)</i> violence against the person offences in each year from 2001-10 (except 2009 where the data is not available to this level of detail). All those serving two-thirds or more of their sentence have been grouped together because their time served will include time on recall.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/12">The fourth table shows the number of offenders recalled to custody in 2009 and 2010 who had originally been convicted of <i>(a)</i> rape, <i>(b)</i> other sexual offences, and<i> (c) </i>violence against the person offences. The equivalent data for earlier years is not held centrally. The number of recalls in a given year should not be compared with the number of discharges in that year, because offenders will not necessarily be released and recalled in the same year.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/13">Accessible electronic data on offences are incomplete for recalls before 2009. Offence data are contained within individual prisoner files. However, a manual trawl of each prisoner's record for each year would substantially exceed cost limits.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/14">Figures in all tables are all those aged 15 and over.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/15">These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems which, as with any large scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.</p>

	<p pid="c.851W.6/1">Penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) are available to the police to deal quickly and effectively with low-level, antisocial and nuisance offending, including minor instances of retail theft. The scheme allows the police to spend more time on frontline duties and provides an alternative to prosecution in appropriate cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.851W.6/2">Before PNDs were introduced, many low-level instances of retail theft went unpunished or received just a verbal warning. PNDs ensure that retail theft is given the priority that it deserves in terms of punishing offenders immediately and protecting consumers and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.851W.6/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-07">7 December 2010</phrase> we published the Green Paper, &#8220;Breaking the Cycle: Effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders&#8221;. This included a proposal to create a clearer national framework for the use of out-of-court disposals, of which the PND scheme is a part. The consultation period finished on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-04">4 March</phrase> and we are considering the comments received. We will publish a formal Government response shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.859W.3/1">The final report of Professor Munro's review of child protection reflects months of careful work and extensive consultation. Her recommendations are wide-ranging. It is important that we consider carefully, with professionals themselves, how best to respond in order to bring about the sustainable, long-term reform needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.859W.3/2">I have therefore established an implementation working group with key individuals from the social work profession, local government, health, police, justice, education and the voluntary sector. This group met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-25">25 May</phrase> and will work with us to develop a response to Professor Munro's report by the summer, informed by their collective expertise and by the experience from the local authorities which are trialling more flexible approaches.</p>
	<p pid="c.859W.3/3">In developing our response, we will consider the costs of options for implementation as well as the benefits to be secured through, for example, reductions in unnecessary bureaucracy and regulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.859W.3/4">The Government have already announced that the Children's Workforce Development Council has been remitted to spend a minimum of &#163;43.9 million on the Social Work Improvement Fund in this financial year. This is an increase on the &#163;23 million distributed through the Social Work Improvement Fund in 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="c.870W.2/2">The Department for Education does not collect data on this issue. It is for local authorities to determine whether a pupil should have home tuition and, if so, the number of hours that is appropriate for that pupil. Department for Education guidance sets out that pupils who cannot attend school because of ill-health should receive a minimum of five hours home tuition each week but that they should be offered as many hours as they can cope with, up to full-time education.</p>
	<p pid="c.870W.2/3">We have taken measures to commence section 3A of the Children, Schools and Families Act 2010 from September 2011. This section re-defined the section 19 duty, to the effect that the education should be full-time for all pupils in alternative provision, unless there are reasons which relate to the physical or mental health of the child which would mean that this would not be in the child's best interests. Until now, only permanently excluded pupils have had an entitlement to full-time provision.</p>

	<p pid="c.870W.8/1">Whether the governors of a maintained school have the power to increase its intake will depend on the category of the school concerned.

The PAN forms part of the admission arrangements for the school and, as such, must be consulted on with their local community. Admission authorities of maintained schools must set admission numbers with regard to the capacity assessment for the school. Once an admission number has been set by the admission authority, maintained schools should not admit children above the PAN without the agreement of the local authority.</p>

The existing contract was intended to support the completion of assessments of the children at seven years old. The Department has decided not to continue the study beyond this survey of children at seven years of age, as it was designed to look at the impact of the former Sure Start Local Programmes.

	<p pid="c.873W.2/13">In previous years information on the deployment of teachers was collected via the Secondary Schools Curriculum and Staffing Survey (SSCSS), an occasional survey most recently run in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2007. However, due to low sample sizes and variations in the methodology used to collect information in each of the SSCSS surveys, the numbers of teachers between years are not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.2/14">The number of teachers that schools employ in future years will, as now, be a matter for them to decide, according to local needs and subject to statutory requirements on class sizes where appropriate. For funding purposes, the Department has produced overall estimates of teaching posts in state schools and academies in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.2/15">The Government does not produce estimates of the future numbers of teaching posts in particular subjects. Estimates of the proportion of teachers working in secondary schools who will be qualified in different subjects are however produced as part of the Department for Education's teacher supply and demand modelling process.</p>
	<p pid="c.873W.2/16">Estimates for the future number of specialist music teachers in state funded secondary schools indicate that there will be a decrease of around 100 by 2011/12. A similar decrease is expected in the number of specialist art teachers. This is in line with a decreasing requirement for secondary teachers as a result of the ongoing decline in secondary pupil numbers.</p>

	<p pid="c.875W.5/1">Subject to the passage of the Health and Care Bill, the Department's functions will change as a result of the modernisation process. We will be reviewing the Department's Operating Model to determine which functions the Department should continue to fulfil, and which should be moved to other organisations. It is therefore likely that some functions will be transferred to other organisations and the Department will take on some new ones. The exact timing and nature of these changes will not be confirmed until decisions have been taken about the precise role and structures of all the organisations in the new system.</p>

	<p pid="c.875W.8/1">We have no current plans to develop an indicator for diabetic macular oedema. In developing &#8220;The NHS Outcomes Framework 2011-12&#8221;, we selected outcomes and indicators with a view to creating a balanced set of national outcome goals, which reflect the breadth of treatment activity for which the national health service is responsible. It is therefore not possible to include outcome indicators for all specific diseases and long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.8/2">Although there is not a specific outcome indicator for diabetic macular oedema in the NHS Outcomes Framework, we would expect progress to be captured under Domain 2: Enhancing the quality of life for people with long-term conditions. This domain of the framework seeks to capture those outcomes that an individual with any long-term condition would consider important. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Quality Standard for Diabetes in adults will help to improve outcomes for people with diabetic macular oedema.</p>

	<p pid="c.877W.0/1">Patient transport and healthcare travel cost support from the national health service is available to all eligible NHS patients and is not a specific allowance for war pensioners or Armed Forces Compensation Scheme recipients. The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) has a scheme to reimburse hospital travelling expenses to war pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.0/2">NHS non-urgent transport is provided via Patient Transport Services (PTS) that are maintained by NHS Commissioners (primary care trusts). These are generally booked by relevant secondary or community services medical professionals. Eligibility for non-urgent transport is based upon clinical need and is available free to all NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.0/3">The Healthcare Travel Cost Scheme (HTCS) is designed to help with travel costs and arrangements for all NHS patients on low incomes. The HTCS is for those who do not medically require PTS but require help in meeting the cost of travel to and from NHS medical care. The HTCS is means tested for low-income earners, with those on a range of low-income benefits automatically entitled. This scheme is constituted under the National Health Service (Travelling Expenses and Remission of Charges) Regulations 1988 as amended.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.0/4">The HTCS will reimburse all or some of the travel costs depending on eligibility. If the patient is entitled to qualifying benefits or allowances they will get back the full travel costs by using the cheapest form of public transport available, including any concessions or promotions. If the patient uses a private car, a claim for petrol and car parking charges where unavoidable, can be made at the mileage rate specified under the local HTCS. Rates are determined locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.0/5">The HTCS will apply for war pensioners receiving treatment for conditions other than those for which they receive a war pension. It does not apply in cases where war pensioners obtain treatment for conditions caused by service for which they are in receipt of a war pension. In those cases, expenses may be met by the SPVA who will apply their eligibility criteria to individual cases. The SPVA align their travel allowances with those of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The HMRC have not changed these allowances since 2007 and therefore the SPVA allowances have also remained constant.</p>

	<p pid="c.880W.2/1">Following the publication of the Organ Donation Taskforce report in 2008, the Department convened an Organ Donation Commissioning Research Group to explore where there remained gaps in knowledge in relation to organ donation. The Group concluded that there would be benefits in commissioning further research into factors that influence a bereaved family's decision regarding organ donation.</p>
	<p pid="c.880W.2/2">The Department has worked in partnership with the national health service and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to fund studies into these issues. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.880W.2/3">the Donation, Transplantation and Ethnic Minorities (DonaTE) programme. This work is being undertaken by Kings College London and funded through a NIHR Programme Grant for four years from October 2009 (&#163;863,000). The programme aims to increase the rates of donation among South Asian and African-Caribbean ethnic minorities, through researching attitudes and barriers to organ donation within these communities. This will then help to inform the development of a training programme which will increase health care professionals' confidence and competence in conducting consent conditions with ethnic minority families; and</p>
	<p pid="c.880W.2/4">the Family Attitudes Towards Donation programme. This work is being undertaken by the University of Wolverhampton and aims to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence a family's decision regarding organ donation from a United Kingdom population perspective. The Department has provided &#163;182,000 to support this work, which we anticipate will be completed by spring 2013. The findings will further help inform training for healthcare professionals in approaching families and the organ donation service design.</p>

	<p pid="c.883W.2/2">No estimate has been made of the numbers of residents and members of staff of Southern Cross care homes who might be affected if the company could not meet its financial obligations.</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/3">This is a sensitive issue, which is currently the subject of commercial negotiations. It would not be appropriate or helpful to speculate on what might happen. We consider this issue should be fully capable of resolution by the private sector and look to Southern Cross, its landlords and those with a stake in the business to put in place a plan to ensure the company is placed on a sound footing.</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/4">We are ensuring, through our discussions with Southern Cross, landlords and the banks, that everyone involved understands their collective responsibility towards the residents.</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/5">Nevertheless, all parties involved are ready to take decisive action if the current plans do not create a viable platform for the future. In England, we have been working closely with the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure arrangements are in place in the event of any need.</p>
