	<p pid="b.1270W.3/1">Since the announcement of the extension to mid-sized companies in Budget 2006, the Government announced further changes to the small and medium-sized (SME) Research and Development (R and D) tax credit and the Vaccines Research Relief (VRR) in Budget 2007, which were added to the notification of the change of the aids. The European Commission (EC) has also introduced a new framework for Research, Development and Innovation (R and D and I) State aids.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.3/2">So that the previous changes meet the requirements of the EC's new R and D and I framework, and hence gain State aid approval, Budget 2008 announced changes to the eligibility criteria for claiming the SME R and D tax credit and VRR.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.3/3">Legislation included in Finance Act 2007 made provision for the doubling of the SME size criteria from a date not earlier than <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. Estimates at that time suggested that around 100 to 200 companies would benefit at a cost of around &pound;40 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.3/4">As a result of ongoing discussions and the Budget 2008 changes, the Government hope to receive approval of the changes announced in Budget 2006 and 2007 shortly. Once approval is received, the Government will make an announcement about the date from which these three changes will take effect.</p>

	<p pid="b.1278W.2/2">Refusing to surrender alcohol in a designated public place and not obeying an instruction to stop drinking both come within the terms of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 S.12(2)(a), (2), and (4). On this basis, the number of persons proceeded against at magistrates courts, found guilty at all courts and given a level 2 fine (maximum given is &pound;500) for the offence of 'failure to comply with a requirement by a constable re: the consumption of alcohol in a designated public place' in England and Wales for the years 2004 to 2006 (latest available) can be viewed in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="b.1278W.2/3">The prosecution statistics and PND offence of 'failure to comply with a requirement by a constable re: the consumption of alcohol in a designated public place', section 12 of the CJPA 2001, includes the offences of failure to surrender alcohol to a constable (section 12(2) of the CJPA) and failure to comply with an instruction not to consume alcohol in a designated public place (section 12(4). The figures in both PQs are therefore the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.1278W.2/4">In addition, under the Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) Scheme, fixed penalty notices of &pound;50 may be issued by the police for the offence of consumption of alcohol in a designated public place. The number of PNDs issued for the offence in England and Wales was 485 in 2004, 712 in 2005, and 1,061 in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1304W.3/1">For the purposes of this answer, the Prime Minister's Office is part of the Cabinet Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1304W.3/2">Cabinet Office policy requires officials to use the most cost effective class of air travel appropriate to the business need which takes account of the level of work that needs to be done during the flight and the importance of minimising fatigue. Standard class should normally be used but where the circumstances are justified, including longer flights, officials may travel in a higher class. Seats may be up-graded to a higher class where this does not involve additional cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1304W.3/3">As part of a series of initiatives to reduce expenditure on travel, the policy is currently being reviewed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1307W.5/2"><i> </i>Costs incurred on refurbishments and improvements to No. 10 Downing street will be available only when the Department's resource accounts are fully audited and laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307W.5/3">The Government are legally required to maintain the Downing Street complex to standards appropriate to its Grade 1/2 listed status in consultation with English Heritage. In addition to providing office accommodation the building also fulfils an important representational role. No significant refurbishment works have been undertaken at the Downing street complex since the large scale rebuilding works that took place between 1960 and 1963. As a result much of the infrastructure now needs to be renewed or upgraded. It has therefore been recommended that essential improvements are undertaken through ongoing annual maintenance works.</p>

In addition all SFA (excluding that in Germany) is also assessed by Standard for Condition (SfC), which results in the categorisation of the housing stock taking account of a number of factors including standards of health and safety, sanitary, energy and efficiency. There are standards within four SfCs and GfCs, 1 being the highest and 4 the lowest respectively.</p>

This includes the delivery of some further 30,000 new or improved SLA bed-spaces to G1fC standard by 2013 and the upgrading of a minimum of 600 SFA properties to S1fC this year, 600 next year and 800 in each year thereafter.</p>

I understand that the Department of Facilities is re-examining the issue with the intention of providing further advice to the Administration Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.10/2">When the Administration Committee considered the provision of drinking water in 2007 the estimated annual cost of providing tap water in Committee and meeting rooms was between &pound;7,000 and &pound;6,000 depending on how the service was delivered. Part of the re-examination being carried out by the Department of Facilities focuses on how this cost can be reduced. The projected approximate cost of providing bottled water in Committee Rooms in 2007-08 is &pound;10,000. Costs for 2008-09 should be broadly similar if there is no change to the current practice. Water is not routinely provided for other meetings except when ordered and paid for as part of a catering service. Data on separate purchases is not held in a consolidated form.</p>

Although this clinical trial data is available to the MHRA and central to the licensing process, the law does not require it to be more widely available. However the Government support the principle of open access to information about health research and strongly encourage voluntary registration of trials on public registers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/2">It is equally important that any information from clinical trials that take place should be disclosed to the MHRA, regardless of where the clinical trials were conducted or how the medicine is currently licensed, if that information could have a bearing on safety.</p>

The Government are now taking action to change the law to make companies' obligations clear and comprehensive.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317W.2/1">The aim of the hepatitis C FaCe It awareness campaign has been to increase hepatitis C diagnosis so that those infected can be referred for specialist care and treatment. There are two national outcome indicators, drawn from epidemiological surveillance by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), intended to track this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.2/2">The first indicator is the total number of laboratory confirmed hepatitis C infection reports. There has been a significant increase in hepatitis C diagnoses in England reported to the HPA through national surveillance from around 5,600 in 2003 (the year before the campaign began) to around 8,346 in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.2/3">The second indicator is the proportion of injecting drug users attending treatment and support agencies, who are aware of their hepatitis C infection. The proportion who are aware of their hepatitis C infection has increased from 42 per cent. in 2003 to 54 per cent. in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.2/4">Research into awareness among general practitioners and practice nurses in 2005 and the public in 2006 indicates that awareness of hepatitis C has increased since the campaign began. For example, the proportion of the public saying they know nothing at all about hepatitis C has almost halved to 23 per cent. in 2006 compared to 42 per cent. in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.2/5">Other indicators of the impact of the campaign are that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.2/6" class="indent">visits to the campaign website (<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/hepatitisc">www.nhs.uk/Livewell/hepatitisc</a>) have increased from 67,558 (in 2005-06) to 349,711 (in 2007-08); and</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.2/7" class="indent">calls to the Hepatitis C Information Line (0800 451451) have increased from 4,410 calls (in 2005-06) to 11,529 (in 2007-08).</p>

It set out the options for reducing the incidence of multiple births following in vitro fertilisation. Following the consultation the authority concluded that a three year strategy was needed to enable the multiple birth rate to fall. They have called on the relevant professional bodies to lead on developing guidance on the best way to achieve this change. We have welcomed that work, which will be taken into account by the expert group which we are establishing to consider the barriers to the implementation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence fertility guideline and assess how to help primary care trust commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="b.1321W.0/1">There is no numeric target for delayed transfers of care, but we expect the national health service and its partners to keep delays at a minimal level. The new performance framework for local authorities and local authority partnerships includes an indicator for delayed transfers of care for all adult patients in all settings (acute, non-acute and mental health), which localities may incorporate in their local area agreement from April 2008 if appropriate to local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321W.0/2">Except where local multi-agency partnership working is the agreed way of helping patients to leave hospital as quickly as it is both safe and appropriate for them to do so, a council may be liable to pay &pound;100 (&pound;120 in London and the south-east) for each day that a patient in an acute bed has a delayed transfer of care because the council has not been able to put a suitable package of community care in place in time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321W.0/3">Specific guidance on hospital discharge includes the toolkits 'Achieving timely simple discharge from hospital: A toolkit for the multi-disciplinary team' (August 2004) and 'Discharge from hospital: pathway, process and practice' (January 2003).

Strategic health authorities are responsible for monitoring PCTs to ensure they are effective and efficient.</p>

Due to variations in the retrieval and confirmation of isolates submitted to Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory of the Health Protection Agency in 2005, the data on resistance prevalence are statistically weighted. This is done to avoid resistance estimates being under representative of sites that have a low retrieval rate and over representative of sites that have a high retrieval rate. Consequently, estimates for previous years have been recalculated in this way and so values presented here may differ slightly from to the unweighted estimates that have appeared in previous GRASP reports.<br/> 4.

	<p pid="b.1355W.2/1">The only decisions governors make are in respect of home detention curfew (HDC) and End of Custody Licence (ECL).</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/2">Prisoners may only be released on HDC subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a risk assessment. Prisoners who are assessed as presenting a high risk to the public or a victim, who have a high risk of reoffending during the curfew period or who are likely to be unable to comply with the curfew condition will not be granted HDC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/3">Psychiatric reports may be included in the assessment of risk, where appropriate. Legal representations are unlikely to be included in the risk assessment unless they present evidence that affects the assessment of risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/4">A streamlined, presumptive HDC scheme exists for prisoners serving less than 12 months. Under the scheme eligible prisoners serving sentences of between three months and under 12 months are released on HDC unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. This streamlined scheme is applicable only to low risk, less serious offenders. Drug dealers and violent offenders are not eligible for Presumptive HDC and are subject to the standard risk assessment process. Psychiatric reports would not routinely be examined where a prisoner is eligible to be considered for Presumptive HDC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/5">Details of the sentence(s) currently being served by the prisoner are set out on the warrant of imprisonment which, in the case of sentences imposed by a Crown court, are supplemented by the court record sheet. Details of the current sentences are provided to the governor as part of the HDC case papers. Comments made by the sentencer at the time of sentencing are not normally provided to the prison unless the prisoner's release is subject to a decision by the Parole Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/6">Under ECL, prisoners serving between four weeks and four years are released under temporary licence for the final 18 days of their sentence subject to meeting strict eligibility criteria and providing a release address. There is no individual assessment of risk; however the most serious violent offenders and registered sex offenders are excluded from the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1359W.2/1">The information requested is not collected centrally. In April 2006, responsibility for commissioning health services in publicly run prisons in England fully devolved to national health service primary care trusts. The aim of the Gvernment is to ensure prisoners have access to the same quality and range of health care services as the general public receives from the NHS. Treatment of prisoners with diabetes is therefore provided in line with the National Service Framework on diabetes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1376W.6/1">The Housing and Regeneration Bill sets out the powers of the new social housing regulator&mdash;Oftenant&mdash;in relation to registered providers of social housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1376W.6/2">Under the Bill the Secretary of State's powers to direct the regulator will be limited to the regulator's role in setting standards in relation to social housing. (At present the Secretary of State can direct the Housing Corporation in relation to any of its functions including, for example, enforcement action.) It is our intention that Ministers should only use these powers to give strategic direction on key issues of direct interest to government&mdash;including levels of rent, the physical quality of accommodation, and landlords' engagement with tenants. I am planning to table amendments to the Bill which make these intentions clearer. The Bill as amended will not, therefore, allow the Secretary of State to impose standards in other areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1376W.6/3">In addition, the regulator's powers to set standards, and to take enforcement action against providers who fail to meet standards, are bound by the regulator's fundamental objectives. In particular Objective 10 requires the regulator to</p>

	<p pid="b.1376W.6/5">The classification of bodies as public or private sector is a matter for the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS have previously judged registered social landlords to be private non-financial corporations, taking into account the existing regulatory framework. HM Treasury advise that the additional regulatory measures being introduced though the Housing and Regeneration Bill are not relevant to the sector classification of registered social landlords. They will therefore have no effect on the status of housing associations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1377W.2/2">The Environment Agency is responsible for the maintenance of the majority of flood defences in England. The Agency plans and carries out an annual programme of maintenance which is geared to allowing assets to perform as designed and is focused on those assets that contribute most to reduction in flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377W.2/3">The Environment Agency has classified which assets and activities contribute most to flood risk reduction, particularly around the number of properties protected, and use this to target investment. It takes into account the current actual condition of assets through a programme of visual inspection and channel condition and also known seasonal changes such as reed and other vegetation growth. The Agency uses this information to establish the required work and its relative priority. Funding is allocated on this basis, thereby ensuring the best possible condition of assets is provided with the funding available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377W.2/4">Where planning applications are submitted for new homes in areas of flood risk these must be considered in line with policy set out in Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS35) on development and flood risk, published in December 2006. PPS25 seeks to direct development away from areas of highest risk and ensure that all developments are safe and do not increased flood risk elsewhere.</p>

The Department is confident that a third runway and the other proposed operational changes could function while meeting safety requirements. This issue was considered in the consultations in the run-up to the 2003 Future of Air Transport White Paper. Any proposal taken forward by the airport operator would have to meet Civil Aviation Authority and international safety requirements and it would be for the airport operator to demonstrate this during the planning process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1388W.5/1">Projections of future reductions in aircraft noise are informed by a number of factors including trends in fleet replacement, the certificated noise performance of aircraft coming into service, aviation industry goals for future noise reductions and assumptions about future generations of aircraft. The Heathrow work has been informed in this area by expert advice from the Civil Aviation Authority and QinetiQ and the approach is described in the CAA Report 0705 &quot;Revised Future Aircraft Noise Exposure Estimates for Heathrow Airport&quot; published alongside the recent Heathrow consultation document. This also sets out the aircraft types expected to be operating at Heathrow in future years including, for example, replacements for the Boeing 767 and Airbus A300/310 andA340.</p>

It also said that scope for making greater use of the two existing runways should be explored, subject to the same environmental limits. The recent consultation presented the outcome of our assessment of these options and invited views. We are now reviewing all the consultation responses and will make our final policy decisions later this year based on the full range of evidence including from those most directly affected.</p>

Evidence indicates that each container was correctly located on four spigots. The spigots do not have any form of manually operated twist lock as fitted to some other types of rail wagons and road container carriers; instead they have a &quot;mushroom&quot; shaped head designed to provide vertical retention. However, in both incidents, preliminary findings indicate the spigots did not function as intended.

The attached table shows debt owed by non-resident parents which has been classified as collectable from 1994-95 to 2006-07. It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time as the estimate of the proportion of collectable debt is based on an annual debt analysis exercise that has been gradually refined year on year as the Agency improves its debt collection and enforcement activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1396W.2/1">Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and, as such, there are many possible measures of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396W.2/2">While income alone does not provide a wide enough measure of poverty, it is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. The Government have succeeded in arresting and reversing the rising trend of child poverty with 600,000 children lifted out of relative low income since 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396W.2/3">A further 300,000 children will be lifted out of relative poverty as a result of last year's Budget and comprehensive spending review. And measures announced in Budget 2008 will lift up to 250,000 additional children out of relative poverty from 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396W.2/4">The Government believe that work is the most sustainable route out of poverty. The Government are supporting families to escape poverty by increasing employment and raising incomes for those who can work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396W.2/5">In the second Quarter of 2007, there were more than 1 million lone parents in work&mdash;335,000 more than in 1997. The lone parent employment rate was 57.2 per cent. up 12.5 percentage points since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396W.2/6">Since 1997, the Government have radically reformed the system of financial support for families. As a result of the Government's reforms to the tax and benefit system, from April 2010, households with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be, on average, &pound;4,500 a year better off in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396W.2/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-12">12 March 2008</phrase>, the Government reaffirmed their commitment to halving child poverty by 2010 and eliminating it by 2020 with the publication of &quot;Ending child poverty: everybody's business&quot;.

	<p pid="b.1397W.2/1">Renaming council tax benefit to reflect its true nature as a tax rebate might help encourage more people to make a claim for it. But we want to consider this as part of our wider consideration of how the benefit might be better delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1397W.2/2">We have no current plans to change the upper savings limit for eligibility to council tax benefit. But we keep it under review as we do for the other income-related benefits. Any changes would have to be considered alongside other priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1397W.2/3">My officials, with their counterparts in the Department for Communities and Local Government and Her Majesty's Treasury, have held numerous discussions about making council tax benefit more accessible and improving take-up by all those entitled to council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1397W.2/4">Improving take-up among pensioners is our top priority, and people claiming pension credit on the telephone can already access council tax benefit (and housing benefit) during the same phone call. From October 2008, this process will take place without the need for a claim form. The Pension Service will automatically pass the council tax benefit information to the local authority to assess entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1399W.3/1">Housing benefit customers in the SK13 area may be affected by the review of localities when their annual referral to the rent officer is made. This process occurs gradually over the course of a year, depending on when the customer made their original claim for housing benefit. Only those customers who have been in receipt of housing benefit for a continuous period of 52 weeks or more, and who made a claim prior to the introduction of the new locality, will be affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1399W.3/2">The Department for Work and Pensions estimates that (providing there is no change in a customer's circumstances), in the post area of SK13, around 1 per cent. of customers would experience an increase in their benefit entitlement, around 81 per cent. a reduced entitlement and around 18 per cent. would experience no change as a result of the new locality. However, the actual impact is dependent on whether customers break their claim, move into work or move onto the local housing allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1399W.3/3">As of October 2007 (latest available data), 189 customers in Glossop were on housing benefit and claiming income support. It is not possible to assess the impact of the locality review on this specific group as this information is not held at this level of detail.</p>

Additionally, criminal records checks were carried out where employees were appointed to sensitive posts.</p>

These checks revealed that seven candidates had a criminal record.

	<p pid="b.1408W.3/1">The Department aims to provide academies with funding for running costs that is equivalent to other state-funded schools in similar circumstances in their local authority. Achieving equivalence requires the Department to make certain adjustments, for example, to reflect a phased intake of pupils, or VAT status. In addition, academies are funded to buy services that local authorities would normally provide to other schools free of charge, such as education welfare services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.3/2">The National Audit Office's report, &quot;The Academies Programme&quot; (HC 254 Session 2006-07, <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-23">23 February 2007</phrase>), examined the Department's formula for calculating ongoing funding and found that it should achieve the intended equivalence. The following table showing the average per pupil funding of academies and maintained community secondary schools in local authorities with academies supports this conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="b.1414W.5/10">The general rise in secondary standards may be attributed to improvements in teaching and learning, better school leadership, targeted intervention to tackle school failure, better use of pupil performance data and the ambitious targets schools and local authorities have set for their pupils. Challenge and support through the National Secondary Strategy has also had a substantial recent impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.1414W.5/11">As part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget for 2008, the Government have now committed a new &pound;200 million package, over the next three years, for a National Challenge to raise standards in secondary schools, with particular focus on those schools where less than 30 per cent. of pupils achieve five or more good GCSEs including English and mathematics. The National Challenge programme will provide intensive support for the most vulnerable secondary schools, and will empower many head teachers of strong schools to help turn around other schools that are unable to raise low attainment. The programme will help create new trusts and federations based on successful schools; and, in areas of greatest need, drive forward a faster expansion of the academies programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1414W.5/12">The National Challenge is a strategy for all schools to learn from each other and will therefore help all secondary pupils to progress to the best of their abilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1415W.2/1">I have arranged for a copy of Sir Jim Rose's letter to be placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Jim Rose, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-13">13 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/3" class="indent">When the Independent Review of the Teaching of Early Reading was published the Secretary of State at the time asked me to report on how well the recommendations were being implemented. This letter is my response. It is based on a series of visits to schools, discussions with local authorities and attendance at Primary National Strategy training events.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/4" class="indent">It is an obvious truth that if world class reading standards are to be achieved then world class teaching must be provided. The indications are that good progress has been made in raising the quality of teaching for beginner readers such that the leading edge work in our schools is excellent by any standard. It is also clear that schools are responding very positively to the first recommendation of the Review: to strengthen children's speaking and listening skills as important in their own right, and as a basis for reading and writing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/5" class="indent">Following acceptance of the review recommendations the National Curriculum has been amended and the Primary Literacy Framework has been renewed so that high quality phonic work is the prime approach to teaching reading. A Communication, Language and Literacy Development (CLLD) programme has been developed to improve the teaching of phonics, and a free phonics teaching resource, 'Letters and Sounds', has been produced. In addition, the new Early Years Foundation Stage will reflect the Review's recommendations. I have kept closely in touch with these developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/6" class="indent">Overall, the message is positive, and schools are reporting that many children are making faster progress in learning how to read and to spell than was previously the case. As a broad estimate, at least three-quarters of our primary schools are implementing phonic work as recommended by the review. However, as might be expected, there is considerable variation in the quality of teaching and children's progress as schools come to terms with implementing the recommendations from different starting points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/7" class="indent">High quality, systematic teaching of decoding and encoding skills, ie phonic work, is a key factor in securing children's progress in reading and writing. Notable features of success which underpin such teaching include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/8" class="indent">Opportunities for professional development and consistency of message&mdash;all those responsible for the briefing and training to settings and schools were themselves trained and fully conversant with the Review's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/9" class="indent">Linking principles to practice&mdash;the &quot;simple view of reading&quot; is the rationale recommended by the Review which enabled the training to make clear why it is important to teach high quality phonic work and how to teach it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/10" class="indent">Coaching and feedback&mdash;teachers reported the value of observing their own class being taught word recognition skills expertly by a National Strategies consultant. They also valued opportunities for feedback on the quality of their own teaching, and for coaching on points which called for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/11" class="indent">Robust leadership&mdash;as ever, the best teaching was where head teachers were fully committed and pressed relentlessly for a consistent, school wide approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/12" class="indent">Lead teachers&mdash;having teachers who, irrespective of their job titles, took a strong lead, were knowledgeable in the teaching of reading, to whom others could turn for advice and support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/13" class="indent">Teaching assistants&mdash;who had received thorough training and were able to support teachers, and help children with their reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/14" class="indent">Teachers as ambassadors&mdash;in implementing the recommendations on the teaching of reading teachers drew considerable professional satisfaction from their success and especially that of the children. They were willing advocates of the approach to a wider audience.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/15" class="indent">Although much excellent progress in the teaching of early reading and writing is evident, I do not believe we have yet reached the point where such teaching is the norm for all children. For example, not all settings and schools are yet self-sustaining in teaching phonic knowledge and skills essential for reading and making sure that children apply these skills to comprehend what they read. This strongly suggests that in-service support for serving teachers, practitioners and teaching assistants should continue to focus on phonics in the context of a broad and language rich curriculum. It would also be prudent to keep the various forms of initial teacher training under review to ensure that trainee teachers are well prepared to teach reading effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.2/16" class="indent">These issues are being addressed through the CLLD programme and other initiatives. I hope to comment further on the standards and quality of teaching reading in the review of the primary curriculum which you have asked me to undertake.</p>

	<p pid="b.1416W.2/5" class="indent">As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-07">7 March 2008</phrase>, there are 17208 primary schools, including middle-deemed primary schools. Of these, 16928 have had at least one inspection with an overall effectiveness grade. For 13254 of these, the latest inspection was carried out under the current inspection framework, in use since September 2005, and for the remaining 3674 the latest inspection was carried out under the previous inspection framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.2/6" class="indent">Of the 13254 inspected under the current framework, which uses a four point scale, 4651 were judged to be satisfactory. Of the 3674 inspected under the previous framework, which used a seven point scale, 1108 were judged to be satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.2/7" class="indent">It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from a seven- to a four-point scale. Some schools judged good under the previous inspection framework would now be judged satisfactory. Ofsted's criteria for making inspection judgements about schools are clearly set out in our inspection guidance. Inspectors do not make reference to, or comparisons with, the previous inspection framework.</p>

	<p pid="b.1422W.5/1">The new secondary curriculum and the 14 to 19 diplomas share the same core aims and care has been taken to ensure that approaches to teaching and learning are directly aligned. In both cases, there is an emphasis on learner choice and on locally-designed curricula that will meet the needs of students and their community. The GCSE criteria have also been revised recently to be consistent with the secondary curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.5/2">There will be a phased build up of the diplomas, with 14 diplomas being taught at all three levels from September 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.5/3">By 2011, a full suite of 17 diplomas at all three levels will be available. From 2013 there will be a national entitlement to the first 14 diplomas which will place a duty on local authorities and the LSC to ensure young people have access to a diploma. We are considering how the entitlement should be extended to the three new diplomas announced in October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.5/4">We do not expect any single institution to offer all diplomas. Rather, diplomas will be taught by consortiums of schools, colleges, and work-based learning providers, working in partnership with the local authority and employers. Schools and colleges are free to offer the GCSEs and A-levels they think are appropriate for their students, but at key stage 4 must offer the national curriculum programmes of study for English, mathematics; ICT, physical education and citizenship. They must also offer pupils a course of study in science that covers the programme of study and leads to at least two science GCSEs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.5/5">They must also teach religious education; sex education; careers education; and work-related learning and they must ensure that all pupils are able to follow a course of study within each of four entitlement areas: the arts, design and technology, humanities and modern foreign languages. There are no plans to change this position, but we have committed to reviewing the future of GCSEs and A-levels in 2013 in the light of experience of diplomas.</p>

There are currently 83 academies open. 60 academies are in consortia that have submitted applications for delivery of the second wave of diplomas from September 2009&mdash;14 of which are already in consortia for the first wave of diplomas. This means that a total of 64 academies are in consortia that have been approved or are currently under consideration. In addition, one city technology college that is converting to academy status is in a proposed consortium for diplomas to be delivered from 2009. Successful consortia for the delivery of diplomas will be announced in the near future.</p>

Of these 22 schools, 12 are in consortia approved through the Gateway process to deliver the first diplomas in September 2008. This equates to 54 per cent. of this group. A further seven of the 22 schools are in consortia which have applied to deliver the second line of diplomas from September 2009 and are awaiting decisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1426W.5/1">Diplomas have been designed by employers in collaboration with representatives from universities, schools and colleges to be attractive and engaging for learners. Through this extensive consultation, we have ensured that the diploma has a clear structure which comprises three key elements&mdash;principal learning, generic learning and additional and specialist learning. Principal learning will give students a strong grounding in the skills and knowledge relevant to the sector or subject of their choice. Generic learning will ensure young people develop the basic literacy, numeracy and ICT skills, and skills such as the ability to communicate clearly and to work well in teams which employers want and provide better research, independent study and critical thinking skills that the universities have told us they want. The only variable aspect of the diploma will be additional and specialist learning, which allows students to personalise their programme of study, adding breadth or depth from a range of different qualifications, including A-Levels and GCSEs. As with all major reforms, we recognise it will take time to become familiar with the new diploma offer and that is why we are introducing them in a phased and planned build up, working closely with local consortiums to ensure that schools and colleges are well prepared to teach the diplomas.</p>

Accordingly, it does not maintain central records on how much capital has been allocated to sports facilities or playing fields.</p>
