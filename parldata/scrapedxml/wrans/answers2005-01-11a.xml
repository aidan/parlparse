	<p pid="a.377W.9/1">Since 1990 the Ministry of Defence has placed in the Library of the House copies of the annual dosimetry statistics for workers who receive exposures from radiation sources and radioactive materials used by the Ministry of Defence and its contractors. These annual dosimetry statistics include all personnel monitored by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Radiological Protection Services (DRPS) Approved Dosimetry Service.</p>

The doses reported in the DRPS statistics are very low when compared with the regulatory dose limits. The annual dose limit for workers aged 18 and over is 20 mSv. The average dose in 2003 for all personnel monitored by the DRPS Approved Dosimetry Service was 0.35 mSv and the maximum dose to any individual in 2003 was below 5 mSv. The DRPS report includes dosimetry information based on all DRPS customers and this includes an element of commercial work for organisations such as NHS trusts and HM Customs and Excise.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.9/3">The Ministry of Defence provides radiation dosimetry information to the National Radiological Protection Board for inclusion in the National Registry of Radiation Workers (NRRW). The NRRW is used to support independent epidemiological analysis of workers exposed to radiation during the course of their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.9/4">The Ministry of Defence is bound by Regulation 8 of the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999 that places a duty on employers, in relation to any work with ionising radiation that they undertake, to take all necessary steps to restrict, so far as is reasonably practicable, the extent to which their employees and other persons are exposed to ionising radiation. Compliance with this duty is enforced by the Health and Safety Executive and HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate together with the Ministry of Defence's internal Regulators.</p>

	<p pid="a.382W.3/1">The Department for Transport's advice on the use of cats eyes is set out in section 6 of Chapter 5 of the Traffic Signs Manual. A new edition was published last year. Because they remain effective in wet weather and particularly in areas prone to fog, when reflectorised road markings perform less well, they are recommended on all high-speed roads. Their use is compulsory with double white line systems, when the normal spacing is closed up to 4.5 metres, because it is essential for safety reasons that drivers recognise the lines in all weather conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.383W.5/2">The Government provides a number of incentives to encourage the purchase and use of clean, low carbon vehicles, including hybrid vehicles. The Vehicle Excise Duty regime, for example, rewards the purchase of the most fuel-efficient vehicles, with additional discounts for hybrid vehicles. The company car tax system introduced in April 2002 provides very large incentives to encourage the purchase of clean, fuel-efficient cars, with hybrid vehicles enjoying a significant additional discount.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.5/3">The Government also funds two grant programmes, run by the Energy Saving Trust, which are designed to encourage the development and market uptake of more environmentally friendly (lower CO <sub>2</sub> and/or air pollutant-emitting) vehicles and vehicle technologies, including hybrids. The New Vehicle Technology Fund provides grants for projects to develop demonstration vehicles for new technologies which reduce the CO <sub>2</sub> emissions and/or air pollutant emissions such as NOx and particulates. During 2004&ndash;05 18 projects have been funded, of which 11 involve hybrid technology. The grant allocation for the New Vehicle Technology Fund in 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;4.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.5/4">The Powershift grant programme is also funded by Government, to provide grants to individuals and undertakings to purchase vehicles which are proven to have reduced CO <sub>2</sub> and/or air pollutant emissions, in order to encourage their uptake. So far during 2004&ndash;05, grants have been awarded towards the purchase of 1,053 hybrid cars, which represents 42 per cent. of the total number of vehicles funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.5/5">As we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-21">21 December 2004</phrase>, following our recent consultation exercise, we intend to revise the grant programmes so as to incentivise the cleanest cars regardless of the technology or fuel type, while ensuring that grant levels are also consistent with European rules on state aid.

	<p pid="a.387W.0/1">The powers in Part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) allow the Government to make regulations requiring all new land based public transport vehicles&mdash;trains, buses and coaches, and taxis&mdash;to be accessible to disabled people, including those who need to remain in wheelchairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.0/2">The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR) came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1998-12-31">31 December 1998</phrase>, and have applied to all new rail vehicles coming into service in England, Scotland and Wales after that date. Northern Ireland has its own separate regulations. The RVAR, which were the first regulations to be made under Part 5 of the DDA, considerably improve access for disabled passengers to new rail vehicles. The Regulations were drawn up in close consultation with the Government's statutory advisers on transport issues as they affect disabled people, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC).</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.0/3">The regulations cover wheelchair accessibility and accommodation, including the design of on-board accessible toilets for those trains in which toilet facilities are provided. They also specify the size and location of handrails and handholds, and control devices as well as covering the provision of audible warnings and other equipment. In addition, a requirement for both visual and audible passenger information assists passengers with sensory impairments to use rail services with confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.0/4">Over 3,800 new fully accessible rail vehicles are now in service&mdash;which represents almost one third of the national heavy rail fleet. A further 700 vehicles will be entering service over the next 12 months. In addition, many older trains, while not meeting full RVAR standards already had wheelchair accommodation and other features to assist disabled passengers prior to 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.0/5">The Department does not record which vehicles are in use by which train operator, as they are frequently swapped between operators, according to operational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.0/6">The Government are proposing to take powers in the Disability Discrimination Bill to enable it to set an end date by which time all rail vehicles must comply with the RVAR. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State announced in November that the Government's preferred end-date is 2020. We also intend to require access improvements to those features which are included in refurbishment plans for older rail vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.0/7">Using figures from the Strategic Rail Authority, we estimate, that fewer than 2200 non-compliant vehicles would still be in service by 2020. The decision as to whether to refurbish older trains to RVAR standards or replace them with new, RVAR compliant trains by then is a matter for the rolling stock leasing companies and train operators. The Government will be publishing for consultation a Regulatory Impact Assessment to accompany draft regulations, during the passage of the Bill through Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.388W.0/1">The following list is based on the latest statistical data on wheelchair accessible taxis, compiled by the Department for Transport and based on returns provided by local licensing authorities in England and Wales, as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>. This showed that the authorities listed did not license accessible vehicles as taxis at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.0/2">We recognise that the current generation of accessible taxis do not meet the needs of all disabled people although they do provide a good level of access for many wheelchair users. The Department for Transport is therefore currently looking into the ergonomic requirements of taxi design that would enable as many disabled people as possible to use taxis.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.0/3">The results of that research will form the basis of the technical specifications to support the Government's proposals to introduce Taxi Accessibility Regulations under part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA). The proposals, which were announced in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-26">26 October 2003</phrase>, would see the phasing in of regulations in specified licensing areas from 2010 (for all new vehicles), with full compliance by 2020. The 2010 date has been proposed to accommodate a full public consultation process, to give sufficient time for vehicle manufacturers and converters to produce new models that meet the regulations, and to give the trade sufficient time to adapt to the change. In the period before regulations are introduced, local licensing authorities remain free to introduce their own accessibility policies and we encourage them to do so in consultation with disabled people locally.</p>

	<p pid="a.389W.2/1">The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations require new buses over 22 passengers first used on or after <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-31">31 December 2000</phrase> to be accessible to wheelchair users. The requirements include the availability of a boarding aid (generally a ramp). An operator who does not comply with these regulations is guilty of an offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.2/2">Buses are subject to annual roadworthiness inspections, spot checks and roadside inspections to ensure their safety and accessibility. Information on the reliability of individual components such as ramps is not collected separately but we are aware of a number of complaints from disabled people about poor reliability of power operated ramps.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.2/3">The majority of power operated ramps are fitted to buses in London, and Transport for London has carried out detailed monitoring of the reliability of ramps fitted to these buses and has discussed performance with the operators concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.389W.5/1">We know from our evaluation of various small-scale yellow and other dedicated school bus schemes that well-designed schemes have the potential to reduce car dependency for journeys to school and the traffic congestion that results from this. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that schemes do not reduce levels of walking or cycling or undermine the viability of important commercial bus services.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.5/2">We therefore want to encourage individual local authorities to consider school bus schemes as part of broader local transport planning and to decide whether or not they would be appropriate to their area. We will give capital bids for such schemes careful consideration, taking account of value for money, regional priorities and affordability. We approved &pound;18.7 million funding for a yellow bus scheme serving 100 schools in West Yorkshire as part of the local transport settlement for 2004&ndash;05. Funding for this project is to be released in three phases&mdash;the second and third phases of funding are to be released subject to the first phase meeting its objectives with respect to modal switch from car.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.5/3">In addition, the School Transport Bill will enable a small number of local authorities to develop innovative proposals to reduce car dependency on the school run. We expect pilot authorities to use the new legislation to support arrangements that offer a range of good quality, cost effective arrangements to the family car on the home to school journey which may include yellow or other dedicated school bus schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.393W.3/1">The Government of Angola and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been engaged in talks for over a year about a staff monitored programme (SMP). Under an SMP, Angola would reach broad agreement on its macroeconomic policy approach, but without any linked IMF lending programme. An SMP is normally used by countries to demonstrate their track record of sound macroeconomic management in order to assist in achieving an international financial and investment standing. A key issue for Angola will be to ensure that all its revenues are captured in their budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.393W.3/2">It is not yet clear that the political will exists in Angola to come to terms with the IMF. In the recent past, two programmes failed shortly after they had been agreed. The IMF is keen to avoid this happening again. A further IMF mission to discuss the Angola SMP will probably take place in January.</p>
	<p pid="a.393W.3/3">UK officials have no direct involvement in the IMF missions although we are strongly encouraging the Government of Angola to do all it can to respond to the IMF's requests, and reach agreement on a programme. DFID has funded some work on oil revenue transparency in coordination with the World Bank which the IMF have found useful in their discussions on the fiscal position. Furthermore, DFID has advised the Government of Angola that DFID is willing to provide technical assistance to ensure the successful implementation of an IMF programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.397W.2/2">The Government of India (GoI) recognises that gender discrimination limits the prospects for development progress in India. It has a well-articulated policy and clearly mandated institutional structures, including the current tenth plan, for addressing gender discrimination. India has also played a lead role in ratifying gender-related UN conventions and international covenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.397W.2/3">However, a falling ratio of girls to boys, in rich and poor states, and among better off and poorer households, reflects continuing discrimination against women and girls. Violence against women and girls persists. The GoI recognises this in its reporting under the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The GoI has included several Bills related to improving the status of women in its forthcoming parliamentary session.</p>
	<p pid="a.397W.2/4">Over the last two years, the Department for International Development (DFID) has engaged closely with the GoI on the design of the large national Sarva Shikshya Abhyan (Education-for-All) and reproductive and child health programmes, developing their focus on the most vulnerable and hard to reach people in India, especially those who suffer multiple discrimination and social exclusion, particularly girls and women among marginalised groups. Approaches to improving outcomes for women and girls are explicitly included in the agreed designs. The GoI measures success in these programmes against progress towards gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.397W.2/5">DFID also engages with Governments in its focus states on issues of discrimination and ensuring that women participate in design and monitoring of programmes. This state level work includes focused programmes that empower and address the practical needs and priorities of women and other marginalised groups, such as through micro-credit, development of gender policies, awareness raising and livelihood improvements, e.g. through the Andhra Pradesh Rural Livelihoods and the Western Orissa Rural Livelihoods programmes. In 2003, DFID supported analysis of the Orissa budget from a gender perspective; key sectors, including the Orissa state health strategy and water and sanitation reforms, now seek to take account of the particular needs of women and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.397W.2/6">DFID worked with the United Nations Development Programme in India to include gender analysis in their support for state Human Development Reports. Discussions of access to justice and support for police reforms have both paid particular attention to the needs of women. In all programmes with the GoI that DFID supports, we seek to have monitoring and evaluation data disaggregated by gender in order to inform policy decisions. DFID also supports civil society to work with government to reduce gender discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="a.398W.8/1">The Government of Iraq has said that it is committed over the medium term, to enhancing the effectiveness of social safety nets in Iraq by moving from a food ration system, which handed out virtually free food to the entire population of Iraq, to a cash distribution system targeted at the poor and unemployed. The aim will be to help domestic agriculture, encourage private trade and remove price distortions, at the same time as ensuring that families in need are properly safeguarded. The details have yet to be determined, and are expected to be followed up by the Iraqi Transitional Government after the forthcoming elections. We support the reform in principle. DFID staff and advisers will continue to maintain contact with the Iraqi authorities, and with interested international organisations including the IMF, the World Bank and the World Food Programme, to ensure that the interests of poor and vulnerable families in Iraq are protected. A well-managed reform process should not have any adverse impact on levels of crime in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.403W.0/1">In February 2004 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published research commissioned from Arups on &quot;Investigating the Increasing Volume of Planning Appeals in England&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.0/2">This work and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's own assessments lead us to conclude that rising numbers of planning applications taken together with some increase in refusal rates have been the main statistical factors behind the increase in the number of planning appeals. There is a strong perception that the reduction in the period for submitting an appeal from six months to three months has led to applicants submitting appeals without first making any attempt to negotiate an amended application with the local planning authority and that this has also contributed to the rise in appeal numbers. I announced on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> that it was our intention to extend the period for submitting planning appeals from three to six months, which would have the effect of reversing the change which was introduced in September 2003. The orders giving effect to that change were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-22">22 December 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.408W.2/1">A full description of the methodology used is provided in MORI's report Survey of Live Music Staged in England &amp; Wales in 2003&ndash;04, which is available on the DCMS website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/2" class="indent">&lt;<a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/global/research/research_by_dcms/live_music_exec_summary.htm">http://www.culture.gov.uk/global/research/research_by_dcms/live_music_exec_summary.htm</a>.&gt;</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/3">I am arranging for copies of the report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/4">For the sample, categories of venues were selected that did not appear to be reliant upon live music provision for their existence. MORI arrived at their estimate of 1.7 million live music events by calculating the average number of events being staged at each venue type in the sample, and then multiplying this figure by the total estimated number of venues in each category within England and Wales. Venues sampled were asked how many live events they had staged in the past 12 months, and were offered a series of ranges to choose from (e.g. 8&ndash;10,11&ndash;20, 21&ndash;31, 32&ndash;40, 40+). To calculate an average, MORI sensibly took the mid point for each range on the assumption that, on a normal distribution, they would expect roughly an equal proportion to fall above and below this.</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/5">For respondents who said that their venue had staged 40+ live events over the past 12 months, MORI assumed an average of 60 live events each year&mdash;a realistic, if perhaps slightly conservative, estimate given that the number of such events each year could range between 41 and 150 (given three live music nights a week). In the unlikely scenario that all venues in the 41+ category only staged 41 live events in the past year, MORI calculated that the estimated number of live music events would be 1.3 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.418W.2/1">Most clergy are office holders rather than employees, so discrimination against them in the course of their work did not generally fall within the scope of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, Race Relations Act 1976 or Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as originally drafted.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.2/2">In 2003, office holders were brought within the scope of the Race Relations Act, while in 2004, new provisions brought office holders within the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act.

It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.453W.5/2">Information type of SEN was collected for the first time in January 2004, for pupils on roll in 2003/04, but the latest available exclusions figures relate to 2002/03. Permanent exclusions data for 2003/04 are expected to be available in May or June 2005 and it should then be possible to link individual pupil records to the existing data on the type of SEN. If this work is carried out successfully then publication of summary information will be considered for later in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.460W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/2">Since 2001 the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable, to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, whilst older and less well-off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.39 million; in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East, the proportion in employment has risen to 68.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/4">Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.1 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 2,890 in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/5">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures for 2002&ndash;03 show that there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 2,200 families in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/6">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/7">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. Around 5,000 pensioners in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;37.31 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/8">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over, to help with their fuel bills. The additional 80+ Annual Payment gives an extra &pound;100 to eligible households where there is someone aged 80 or over. Last winter there were 13,740 households in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East which received the winter fuel payment and, of those, 2,885 households received the additional Annual Payment. We expect numbers to be similar for this winter (2004&ndash;05).</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/9">Additionally for this year eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the One-off 70+ Payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It will be paid with the winter fuel payment and last winter there were 7,970 households in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East with someone aged 70 or over which received a winter fuel payment. We expect a similar number to receive the One-off 70+ Payment this winter (2004&ndash;05).</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/10">Some 17,800 pensioners in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland benefited from the above inflation increase in the rate of basic state pension from April 2003. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 7,000 in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East, may also qualify for free TV licences.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/11">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/12">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 29 per cent. of adults and 6 per cent. of children in the North East are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/13">Information on the numbers of customers in the North East who are in receipt of disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) is in the following table. This information is not available at constituency level.</p>

	<p pid="a.462W.2/1">I represented the UK for the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-07">7 December 2004</phrase>, accompanied by my hon. friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations, Consumers and Postal Services (Mr. Sutcliffe).</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/2">The Council reached political agreement on a draft directive protecting workers from the risks of exposure to optical radiation. I maintained the UK parliamentary scrutiny reserve on this item.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/3">On working time, there was no agreement. Although there was majority support for the Dutch Presidency proposed solution to SIMAP/Jaeger, a blocking minority supported by the Commission opposed the Presidency compromise. However, the Council debate provided a useful way forward for further discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/4">The Council endorsed the Employment Committee's Opinion on the Annual Commission Report on migration and integration without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/5">The Council endorsed the EMCO and SPC opinion on the Kok report, and completed a table round on the Social Policy Agenda in the context of the Lisbon Strategy. The Commissioner emphasised that the EU must respond to the challenges of globalisation, ageing, increasing diversity and the shift to a knowledge-based society. All delegations agreed that Lisbon was the right strategy to tackle this, and did not need to be revisited. The SPA must in turn support Lisbon, increasing the quantity and quality of jobs, balancing flexibility and security, and building social inclusion. For the UK, I intervened to argue that employment was always the best social policy and, furthermore, that employment growth was the key to sustaining the European Social Model. I emphasised that economic and social policy were therefore mutually dependent rather than being in conflict with each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/6">The Council agreed a general approach to the recast on the Directives covering on Equal Treatment between men and women without discussion. There was no discussion on this point.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/7">The Council agreed a general approach to extending funding for the two equality programmes&mdash;the Community framework strategy on gender equality and the Community Action Programme&mdash;to 2006, without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/8">The Council adopted the Council Conclusions on sexual harassment at the workplace without discussion.</p>

	<p pid="a.465W.6/1">Compliance with the ruling on the implementation of Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste will largely be achieved in England through new hazardous waste regulations which are planned to come fully into force in July 2005. Defra completed a consultation on the new regime in October 2004. The consultation paper is available on the following website: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/wastereg-haz/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/wastereg-haz/index.htm</a>.</p>

Comprehensive guidance for businesses on the new regulations is proposed to be published three months before the new regime comes into force. Full compliance with the ruling will be complete once revised exemptions from waste management licensing requirements for establishments involved in the recovery and reuse of hazardous wastes are consulted on and implemented later in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.467W.5/14">Since the ban on hazardous liquid disposal by landfill came into force typical treatments for hazardous liquid wastes will have included physico-chemical treatment and biological treatment processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.5/15">These use techniques such as precipitation, coagulation and filtration with subsequent dewatering of sludges and disposal of treated non-hazardous liquids to sewer with appropriate discharge consents. Some high temperature incineration and or use as a fuel may also have been employed where the waste either was of a sufficiently high calorific value or could not otherwise be treated. No figures are currently available that indicate the amounts sent to each method. The total amount of hazardous liquid waste sent for treatment recorded for 2003 was 1,964,911 tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.2/2">However, where waste is received at exempt sites, the provisions of the Duty of Care (DoC) apply in respect of the transfer of waste to the registrant. The DoC requires records of waste transfers to be kept by both parties so there is an audit trail for the waste, including the amount of waste transferred.</p>

	<p pid="a.476W.8/1">Deaths of children in custody are rare. When they do occur we have carefully formulated arrangements for finding out the facts and drawing lessons from them. The Youth Justice Board conducts its own serious incident review, and this feeds into a wider inquiry conducted by the local Area Child Protection Committee. Where a young person was detained in a Young Offender Institution , the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman conducts an investigation. We propose to legislate at the next available opportunity to place the Ombudsman on a statutory footing, equipping him with statutory powers of investigation and extending his remit to investigate deaths to secure training centres. Any death in a local authority Secure Children's Home is investigated by the Commission for Social Care Inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.8/2">In addition, Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights requires a public investigation. This is normally met by an inquest. In two important Article 2 cases this year, the House of Lords has specified how inquests can meet the procedural requirements of Article 2.</p>

	<p pid="a.479W.2/2">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) Violence against Women Initiative (VAWI) was an evidence based programme which aimed to find out which approaches and strategies were effective in supporting victims and tackling violence against women. In July 2000 27 domestic violence projects and seven rape and sexual assault projects were independently evaluated. The domestic violence projects were all multi-agency partnerships and many of the partner organisations involved in delivering interventions were voluntary groups such as Women's Aid, The projects worked in a variety of contexts and, while most provided some type of advocacy and support, the aims of the projects differed. The findings from the evaluations have been collated, and a series of research reports and concise practitioner guides have already been published. The research findings from those projects which specifically provided advocacy and support to victims are planned to be published, along with two concise practitioner guides, early in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.2/3">The evidence of the CRP VAWI&mdash;and recent evaluations of specialist domestic violence courts which make clear that advocacy services are a key part in their success&mdash;show the important role advocacy services have to play in supporting victims of domestic violence. Local partnerships responsible for crime and disorder are currently Identifying the need for domestic violence services in their local communities. Once identified, the appropriate organisation to meet that need is selected by local commissioning groups and their effectiveness monitored against criteria set out in their service level agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.481W.2/1">Within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, sentences in individual cases are a matter for the courts alone, taking into account all the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The Government believes that prison sentences should be reserved for those who are either serious, dangerous or seriously persistent offenders. Equally, offenders cannot expect to go unpunished if they fail to pay a fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.481W.2/2">The court may issue a warrant of commitment: if the offender has failed to pay a fine and the court has, since the conviction, enquired into the defaulter's means in his presence on at least one occasion; in the case of an offence punishable with imprisonment, the defaulter appears to the court to have sufficient means to pay the sum forthwith; or the court is satisfied that the default is due to the defaulter's wilful refusal or culpable neglect and the court has considered or tried all other means of enforcing payment of the sum and it appears to the court that they are inappropriate or unsuccessful.</p>
	<p pid="a.481W.2/3">The Courts Act 2004 introduced a number of measures short of imprisonment that could be imposed on offenders in order to enforce fine payment. These include vehicle clamping, credit blacklisting and work for the community. These measures are currently being piloted.</p>

	<p pid="a.482W.9/1">The Identity Cards Bill which received its second reading in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase> contains no such provisions. Clause 18 of the Bill prohibits any organisation from requiring the production of an identity card as the sole means of proving identity in advance of it being compulsory to register with the scheme. Even after compulsion, there is no means within the Bill to provide powers to private sector organisations to demand the production of an identity card.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.9/2">In the event that a fraudulent card is found to be in use, the Identity Cards Bill creates new offences relating to possession of a false identity document. This provides that a person in possession of a false identity card with the intention of using it, may be guilty of an offence and liable to a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.5/2" class="indent">Increasing data-sharing with public and private sector organisations;</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.5/5" class="indent">Improving the security of the passport book, through the introduction of biometric chip enabled passports from autumn 2005;</p>

Whether the mother then keeps the child with her in prison is partly a matter for her choice and partly a matter for social services. The Prison Service provides places on mother and baby units and those mothers who wish to keep their child with them and are considered suitable may do so up to about the age of 18 months depending on what is in the best interests of the child. At <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-13">13 December 2004</phrase> there were 51 mothers in those units and their children's ages ranged from a few weeks to 16 months.</p>

The installation of sprinklers in immigration removal centres will be considered by the Immigration and Nationality Department on a case-by-case basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.495W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.495W.9/2">The powers in both the Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT) and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCS) are subject to review processes. Section 126 of the Terrorism Act 2000 requires the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament on the working of the Terrorism Act at least once every 12 months. This report is produced by the independent reviewer, currently Lord Carlile, and considers whether the Act has been used fairly and properly during the reporting period, taking into account the need to ensure that there are effective powers to deal with terrorism and adequate safeguards for the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.9/3">Lord Carlile additionally produces separate reports on the Northern Ireland specific powers within the Terrorism Act and the part 4 detention provisions of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, in order to inform the annual renewal debates for those parts of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.9/4">In his most recent review of the Terrorism Act, published in April 2004, Lord Carlile concluded that overall the powers in the Act are necessary, that the provisions are functioning satisfactorily and that it continues to be fit for purpose. His latest report on part 7 of TACT, published in January 2004, recommended that the powers be renewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.9/5">In his report on the operation of part 4 of the ATCS Act, published in February 2004, Lord Carlile concluded that the Secretary of State had certified persons as international terrorists only in appropriate cases and that he had exercised independent judgment in each case. He recommended that continuing scrutiny be given to possible alternatives to detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.9/6">Additionally, the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act provided for a secondary review, of the Act as a whole, under section 122, to be conducted by a committee of Privy Councillors. This committee, chaired by Lord Newton, reported in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.9/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase> the Home Secretary published a response to the recommendations made within the Privy Counsellor Review in a discussion paper entitled &quot;Counter Terrorism Powers: Reconciling Security and Liberty in an Open Society&quot;. Issues concerning the effectiveness of the ATCS Act raised by Lord Newton's committee were also debated in both the House of Commons, on the day of the above publication and the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-04">4 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.9/8">As part of the discussion paper the Government launched a consultation process inviting contributions on the way forward on counter-terrorism measures over the longer term. The responses to that consultation exercise, together with the implications of the recent House of Lords judgment on the current ATCS Act part 4 powers, are currently under consideration and the Government have announced that they intend to bring forward their proposals early next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.496W.2/1">The United Kingdom was involved in the drafting process of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent and Punish Trafficking in Persons and was one of the first countries to sign the protocol. We are committed to its ratification.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.2/2">The principal legislative requirement of the protocol is the criminalisation of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour and the removal of organs. We have introduced legislation to criminalise these forms of trafficking. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 includes offences covering trafficking into, within and out of the United Kingdom, for the purposes of sexual exploitation. Offences covering trafficking for other forms of exploitation, including trafficking for the purposes of forced labour and removal of organs, are included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.2/3">We consider that, taken together with existing United Kingdom law, these offences mean that we fully comply with our legislative obligations under the protocol. However, ratification of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, is a pre-requisite to ratification of the protocol. We have identified a need for primary legislation to comply with the requirements of the Convention on the forfeiture of the instrumentalities of crime. Provision for this is included in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, which is currently before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.5/2">The assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually undertaken by child psychiatrists, often with the help and contribution of other members of multidisciplinary child mental health services. However, it is becoming increasingly common for paediatricians to diagnose and manage ADHD. Even with the children diagnosed as having hyperkinetic disorder(the more severe and specific end of the spectrum(a treatment programme should not rely on medication alone. It is recommended that interventions that focus on the behaviour of the child, family interactions, classroom problems and learning difficulties should be offered. A comprehensive assessment involving more than one professional perspective will highlight the various problems that need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.5/3">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has given advice on the use methylphenidate (more commonly known as Ritalin) in the treatment of ADHD. NICE recommended that methylphenidate should only be used as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for children with a diagnosis of severe ADHD.</p>

The reforms are supported by additional recurring funding of &pound;250 million in 2005&ndash;06&mdash;an increase of 19.3 per cent. compared to spending in 2003&ndash;04. We have also allocated &pound;59 million in the current financial year to enable hard-pressed PCTs to improve access to NHS dentistry by, for example, funding improvements to practice premises in return for a commitment to register more NHS patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.509W.5/1">Under the present item for service remuneration system a dentist may claim a fee for examining a patient at a minimum interval of six months. With the introduction of the new contractual arrangements, founded upon the delegation of the commissioning of national health service dentistry to primary care trusts, dentists will have wider discretion over recall intervals based on their clinical judgement. However, regulations of which we will be laying before Parliament will require NHS dentists to provide services in accordance with guidance issued by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, who were commissioned by the National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care October 2004 to undertake the dental study.</p>

	<p pid="a.517W.5/1">There is currently no evidence that introducing screening for the early detection of ovarian cancer would save lives. At the moment, there is no screening test reliable enough to be used in women with no symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.5/2">Currently the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) trial is investigating whether screening using CA125 blood test or ultrasound detection will detect ovarian cancer in its early stage. Unlike cervical cancer there is no recognised pre-cancerous abnormalities of the ovary that can be detected and treated. 200,000 women are involved in this study and it will report around 2010. This study is also looking at the implications of introducing ovarian cancer screening into the national health service, what anxieties and fears being screened may raise and what complications might arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.5/3">There is also the nearly completed research, commissioned by the Department, on identifying significant diagnostic factors for ovarian cancer in primary care. This research aims to determine approximately the degree of risk represented by different symptoms and combinations of symptoms, to determine cancer detection rates resulting from different referral strategies and ascertain which factors may contribute to delays in referral or diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.5/4">In 1999, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published &quot;Improving Outcomes Guidance for Gynaecological Cancers&quot; outlining how the NHS treats patients with gynaecological cancer, including ovarian cancer. One of the major outcomes of this guidance was the introduction of specialist teams to treat gynaecological cancers and these have been in place since the guidance was published.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.5/5">Patients urgently referred by a general practitioner with suspected cancer should be seen within two weeks. Latest figures show that 99.5 per cent. of suspected gynaecological cancer referrals were seen within the two-week period.</p>

Any improvements made since 2004 will be reflected in the 2005 assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.518W.2/2">Since the launch of the clean hospitals programme, &pound;68 million has been allocated to the NHS to assist in raising standards.

NHS Estates also provides an advice and support service for any hospitals assessed as less than acceptable to assist them in addressing the shortfalls identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.519W.8/1">A savings disregard is applied to all people supported by local authorities in residential care where income exceeds &pound;79.60. The full disregard is applied to all people supported by the local authority whose weekly income exceeds &pound;87.35 even if their weekly income is so great they would not normally qualify for savings credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.8/2">The cost of raising the maximum savings disregard for older supported care home residents to &pound;15.51 per week cannot be calculated precisely, as there are no recent data available on the distribution of income of these residents. A best estimate is that the annual cost is likely to be in the range &pound;70 million to &pound;85 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.520W.2/1">The &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper set out the Government's strategy for achieving long-term improvements in the health and diet of the population. The school fruit and vegetable scheme has a key role to play in instilling good eating habits in young people and is contributing towards the obesity public service agreement to:</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;halt the year-on-year rise in obesity among children under 11 by 2010, in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.2/3">The Department commissioned a National Opinion Poll survey of the school fruit and vegetable scheme, then known as the national school fruit scheme, which was published in October 2003. Nearly half of all parents questioned in that survey thought that the scheme had made them more aware of the importance of fruit for a healthy diet and over a quarter of children and their families reportedly ate more fruit at home as a direct result of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.2/4">The Big Lottery Fund has commissioned a full evaluation of the impact of the school fruit and vegetable scheme on children's diet and a full report is expected in early 2005. The evaluation uses a dietary assessment tool that has been specially developed for the Department for use with four to six year old children.</p>
