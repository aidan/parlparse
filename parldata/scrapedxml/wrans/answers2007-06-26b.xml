	<p pid="b.610W.6/18" class="indent">Community health services medical.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.6/19">There has been an increase in the number of consultants in public health working in the national health service of 85 (10 per cent.) between 1997 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.6/20">Over the same period the number of other public health staff numbers has decreased by 1,805 (57 per cent.). This is in part due to changes in the way the data is collected and coded. For example, health visitors, district nurses, general practitioners and other professionals, who are not formally coded as public health staff, perform public health tasks. There has been growth in many of these groups. There is also variation from trust to trust in which exact roles are classed as public health. In addition, the definition of the public health specialty has been more closely defined in recent years resulting in the exclusion of groups of staff such as health visitors and school nurses who some trusts and PCTs previously included as public health staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.6/21">A public health workforce collection was conducted on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February 2007</phrase> which asked NHS to return information on their public health staff in post on that date. The Information Centre is currently analysing this data with a view to publication in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.613W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.3/2">This year, the Ministry of Justice has committed &pound;3 million to fund independent domestic violence advisers: trained specialists whose goal is to ensure the safety and recovery of victims of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.3/3">The Home Office has allocated &pound;2 million to fund the local delivery of support services for victims of domestic violence and their children, and just under &pound;2 million has been made available to local areas for the development of multi-agency risk assessment conferences, which aim to ensure the safety of identified high risk victims, and help them recover from their experiences without fear of repeat victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.3/4">Safe housing is integral to victims' recovery, and Support People funding is available to provide housing-related support for victims of domestic violence. In 2005-06, over &pound;59 million was made available through this funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.3/5">The Government also part funds a matrix of helplines which provide support and information to victims of domestic violence, to enable them to access assistance and support to help them recover from domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.3/6">In addition to this, health services have been making significant progress in the early identification of, and intervention with, victims of domestic violence victims&mdash;for example, rolling out making routine inquiries of all pregnant women, and taking forward work on collecting violent crime data (including domestic violence data) through electronic patient records.</p>

	<p pid="b.627W.2/2">Domestic violence is a cross-Government priority led by the Inter-Ministerial Group for Domestic Violence. The group comprises of Ministers from nine Government Departments and the three devolved administrations.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/3">The budgets outlined as follows contribute towards the delivery of the National Delivery Plan for Domestic Violence which focuses on a range of key work objectives from early intervention and prevention through to developing a coordinated community response to tackling domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/4">Communities and Local Government provide a part of the funding that assists victims of domestic violence to escape abusive situations,</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/5" class="indent">For 2003-06 a total of &pound;32.1 million capital was invested in refuge provision in England (&pound;15.7 million through the Housing Corporation and &pound;16.4 million from the Homelessness Strategy and Support Directorate in Communities and Local Government). 511 units of accommodation were refurbished or newly built.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/6" class="indent">In 2005-06, &pound;59 million of Supporting People funding was used to provide housing related support to women at risk of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/7" class="indent">We continued to fund UKRefugesonline (&pound;100,000 2007-08), a UK wide database of domestic violence services delivered in partnership by Women's Aid and Refuge which supports the national 24 hour free phone domestic violence helpline.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/8" class="indent">In addition my Department has allocated &pound;47.2 million to local authorities to help them tackle and prevent homelessness in their area for 2007-08. They may choose to use a proportion of this money to fund Sanctuary Schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/9">Government provides other funding to help support victims of domestic violence. In 2006-07 the Home Office allocated &pound;6 million to tackle domestic violence:</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/10" class="indent">&pound;3 million to support and improve local delivery on domestic violence for victims of domestic violence and their children</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/11" class="indent">&pound;1 million to expand the Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/12" class="indent">&pound;1 million for Independent Domestic Violence Advisors</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/13" class="indent">&pound;1 million to continue to fund national domestic violence services, for example the matrix of help lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.2/14">In 2007-08 Ministry of Justice/Her Majesty's Court Service provided a further &pound;3 million for the expansion of the network of Independent Domestic Violence Advisers that support the Specialist Domestic Violence Courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.631W.3/1">Building Regulations set minimum standards for energy efficiency. Changes we have already made to Building Regulations mean that the energy efficiency of new houses has improved by 70 per cent. compared to pre-1990 levels. We have also consulted on proposals to further strengthen Building Regulations over the next decade such that all new homes will be required to be zero carbon in terms of their net emissions over the course of a year from 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.631W.3/2">Homes built with Government funding are taking the lead here. All new Government funding for homes built by registered landlords and other developers, for example through the Housing Corporation, will now make it a condition that they achieve a 3-star rating in the Code for Sustainable Homes&mdash;25 per cent. better than current building regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.631W.3/3">We expect that changes to the building regulations, the Code for Sustainable Homes, the carbon challenge and the stamp duty relief for new zero carbon homes will all encourage the development of highly energy efficient and zero carbon homes. We do not have targets of the type referred to but we will be monitoring progress carefully.</p>

	<p pid="b.631W.9/2"><i> </i>Officials from the European Commission informed us orally and wrote to the United Kingdom in November 2006 indicating an intention to advise the Commission to hold back the reimbursement of expenditure by the Government on the ERDF 2000-06 programmes in England. In particular, the European Commission wanted us to carry out more physical on-site checking of projects to ensure compliance with particular EU budget criteria. Formal notification was received on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-11">11 April 2007</phrase>. Action to increase the level of on-site checks began June last year in addition strengthened management of the processes involved. A robust action plan has been in place for some time and we have made significant progress which has meant that four of the nine regions were not included in the Commission's formal decision. Further work is under way with the Commission to meet their requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.636W.0/1">Local housing authorities must allocate housing accommodation in accordance with part 6 of the Housing Act 1996. Among other things, this requires authorities to publish a scheme for determining their priorities, and defining the procedures to be followed, in allocating housing. The scheme must be framed so that reasonable preference for an allocation is given to certain groups of applicant, but it is for individual authorities to decide on the priorities to be given to people within these groups. The reasonable preference groups are based on housing need and include people who need to move on medical or welfare grounds (including grounds relating to a disability) and people owed a homelessness duty. The scheme may also be framed so that additional preference is given to people within the reasonable preference categories who have urgent housing need. The Department has issued statutory guidance to local housing authorities on how they should discharge their functions under part 6. This gives examples of people with urgent housing needs to whom housing authorities should consider giving additional preference including those owed a homelessness duty as a result of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.0/2">Under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the 1996 Act), local housing authorities must secure that suitable accommodation is available for housing applicants who are eligible for assistance, homeless through no fault of their own and who fall within a priority need group. Accommodation must be secured until a settled home becomes available. The priority need groups include people whose household includes a dependant child or a pregnant woman and, in 2002, the Government extended the priority need groups to include, among others, people who are vulnerable as a result of leaving their home because of violence or threats of violence likely to be carried out. Jointly with the Secretaries of State for Education and Skills and for Health, the Secretary of State has issued statutory guidance to local authorities which they must have regard to when exercising their homelessness functions. The guidance reminds authorities that, under the legislation, a person is homeless if it is not reasonable for them to continue to live in their home and itwould not be reasonable for someone to continue to live in their home if that was likely to lead to violence against them or against a member of their family. The guidance also encourages authorities to offer people who have experienced domestic violence a range of accommodation and support options, includingthe option of remaining in their home withadditional security measures provided under a sanctuary scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.0/3">The Government have signed and ratified the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. It has also recently signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. This will build on our strategy to combat human trafficking by providing minimum standards of protection and victim support, whilst also providing a framework for enhanced provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.0/4">Details on how implementation will be taken forward are currently being developed. These will involve close co-operation with non-governmental organisations, law enforcement agencies and other Government Departments. Progress will be monitored by the Inter-Ministerial Group on Human Trafficking of which Communities and Local Government's Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, is a member.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.0/5">The London-based POPPY Project, run through &quot;Eaves Housing for Women&quot;, was launched in 2003 and provides a highly regarded combination of safe accommodation and support for victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, which meets Council of Europe Convention requirements. Additionally, as a result of Operation Pentameter there are now a number of independently funded organisations (Salvation Army, CHASTE, the Medaille Trust), who also provide accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.0/6">The Government are currently considering a pilot scheme to test the level and type of support required for victims of forced labour trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.0/7">The UK Human Trafficking Centre was launched <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-03">3 October 2006</phrase>, the first of its kind in Europe. This is becoming a centre of excellence for dealing with human trafficking and will promote the expansion of victim support services. The Government also published the UK Action Plan on Tackling Human Trafficking on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-23">23 March</phrase>. This aims to strike the right balance between protection and assistance for all victims of trafficking, and prevention and enforcement activity to crack down on criminals.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.0/8">Through its recently published Gender Equality Scheme, the Department has also initiated a number of actions aimed at supporting those women who are victims of domestic violence or who have been trafficked. These include co-ordinating and joining up Government actions on violence against women, and monitoring the impact of changes in local government funding on locally delivered support for vulnerable women. Communities England will also ensure that gender issues are taken into account in exercising functions delivering local strategies for regeneration, housing growth and affordable housing.</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.2/1">Capital funding for local authority housing is provided through the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy system in the form of supported capital expenditure (SCE) and the major repairs allowance (MRA). SCE is the level of borrowing for capital purposes that is supported by the Government through the HRA subsidy. This value is based on the Regional Housing Boards' allocations. MRA represents the estimated long-term average amount of capital spending required to maintain a local authorities housing stock in current condition. The capital funding includes an element for regeneration but that is combined with the decent homes programme in the private sector. There is also an element of non-HRA funding for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.2/2">Revenue funding for local authority housing is provided in the form of HRA Subsidy and Formula Grant. HRA subsidy refers to the entitlement local authorities receive from Government to support their housing programs. 2005-06 is the latest year for which audited figure are available. Housing is one of the services supported by formula grant. Formula grant, which comprises Revenue Support Grant, redistributed business rates and principal formula Police Grant, where appropriate, is an unhypothecated block grant i.e. authorities are free to spend the money on any service. For this reason, and because of the method of calculation, particularly floor damping, it is not possible to say how much grant has been provided for a particular service. Tables displaying the 2005-06HRA subsidy and 2005-06 capital funding for each local authority have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.2/3">For regeneration purposes, there is no local authority wise breakdown available. The information is compiled on a program-specific basis. Departmental funding for regeneration projects in 2005-06 are tabled as follows.</p>

The latter homes will contribute towards our target of providing 30,000 social rented homes in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.640W.2/5">Of the Housing Corporation budget of &pound;3.9 billion for 2006-08 it is estimated that &pound;2.8 billion will be spent on providing social rented homes. Future investment will be subject to the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 on which we have already stated that we intend to make the provision of social rented homes a priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.642W.0/2"><i> </i>The Government offer housing assistance to key workers under the Key Worker Living (KWL) scheme in areas experiencing severe recruitment and retention difficulties. Key Worker Living funding is divided between Open Market HomeBuy (equity loans to purchase properties on the open market) and new build products such as New Build HomeBuy (shared ownership of newly built homes) and intermediate rent (newly built homes where the rent is set at a level between that charged by social and private landlords).</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.0/3">Since April 2006 we no longer fund specific key worker only new build schemes. Instead key workers access our New Build HomeBuy and intermediate rent programmes as a priority group alongside other priorities such as social tenants. Any key worker specific schemes yet to complete will have been funded under old shared ownership programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.0/4">Since the launch of Key Worker Living the Housing Corporation has been collecting data on when the construction of a scheme has been completed and when the final unit has been occupied. The purpose of this data is to actively manage the portfolio of new build properties and take action to prevent long term empty units&mdash;and as such allows us to give a breakdown of the current position on empty properties only. As at the end of May 2007 there are no empty Key Worker Living properties designated for key workers only in the Wycombe constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.649W.6/1">The Planning Inspectorate has a dedicated procurement unit and all consultancy contracts are handled within that unit. In the drive to deliver value for money close attention is paid to standard best practice procurement procedures; from clear specification through to effective contract management. Extensive use is also made of the framework contracts managed by the Office of Government Commerce to deliver both price and process savings.</p>

	<p pid="b.653W.2/2"><i> </i>Statutory responsibility in ensuring public safety from threats stemming from land instability lies with local authorities. Local authorities in England are eligible to apply to the Land Stabilisation Programme via English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency, for assistance with funding for land stabilisation problems arising from abandoned non-coal mines. English Partnerships manages the Land Stabilisation programme on behalf of the Department. The focus of funding through the Land Stabilisation Programme is principally on removal of blight or enabling investment to regenerate areas where abandoned underground non-coal mine workings are present and where there is a threat to life and/or property. Extensive guidance on the assistance available and how to apply for assistance with funding can be found on the English Partnerships website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.653W.2/4">Responsibility for dealing with stabilisation works and in complying with any regulations or legislation governing public health and safety lies at all times with Local authorities, this includes compliance with planning requirements environmental protection and management of consultants/contractors. English Partnerships' expertise in best value and best practice is available to all project partners and covers a wide range of subjects such as construction methods and standards, management techniques, sustainable remediation and regeneration of blighted land. Where project costs are not eligible for assistance from EP via the Land Stabilisation programme, EP will nevertheless assist with advice.</p>

The influence of the central Government outside Kabul is gradually increasing, particularly in the north and west. Local governance structures are slowly being built up, although this is more challenging in some areas than others. One of the key aims of the international-led provincial reconstruction teams, throughout the country, is to support the development of local government and to help the Government of Afghanistan extend its reach.</p>

	<p pid="b.670W.2/2">A phase I and phase II LQA survey for the Royal Navy Motor Transport Depot site at Hilsea, concluded there were no unacceptable risks to public health or the environment and action was not required under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Low levels of contamination were identified but no remediation measures by this Department were deemed necessary.</p>

The other distributors are also concerned to ensure that support for small scale and voluntary sector projects remains available.</p>

	<p pid="b.673W.9/1">The work of Oxfam and other aid agencies in addressing the humanitarian needs of the 130,000 people in Gereida was exceptional. Their withdrawal is highly regrettable but under the circumstances, they could not place their staff at such a continued risk. Since the evacuation of the other agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), as the only agency left, decided to cover the gaps, providing water, sanitation, food, health care, shelter and other household items to the camp and host population of Gereida. As a result of this huge expansion in services, ICRC increased their appeal by &pound;13 million to &pound;44 million. In response, DFID increased its support to ICRC proportionately by &pound;1 million to &pound;4 million for 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.9/2">The events in Gereida underline the fragility of the humanitarian situation in Darfur. It is only through the admirable work of aid agencies, that the four million people dependent on aid in the region have had access to vital assistance and services. The deterioration of the security situation and attacks on humanitarian workers, however, are having a severe impact on getting help to those in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.9/3">I utterly condemn the continuing violence targeting civilians and humanitarian workers in Darfur and have called on all sides to cease the violence immediately; renew the ceasefire, reinvigorate the political process and support the rapid deployment of the AU/ UN peacekeeping force for Darfur.</p>

The increase in administration costs over 3 years from April '06 is as a result of the extra &pound;120 million costs associated with the Operational Improvement Plan.<br/> 2. We are unable to provide figures for 1993-94, as audited accounts were not published for that year and as such the information is not available.<br/> 3. Information from 1994-95 to 2005-06 is sourced from the Child Support Agency's published Annual Report and Accounts, and differ slightly from the published QSS which uses monthly figures, not subjected to yea-end adjustment.<br/> 4. In 2005-06, following national Audit Office advice, the Agency's accounting boundaries were changed to include Child Support Reform Programme costs in the Agency's annual accounts. The 2005-06 accounts and the 2004-05 comparatives were changed accordingly. In line with this policy the table below includes Child Support Reform costs from 1999-00.<br/> 5. The 2006-07 net administration costs and maintenance collections may be subject to change and will be confirmed when the audited accounts are published in July 2007.<br/> 6. The 2007-08 estimate for maintenance collections is consistent with the published Agency target to collect or arrange &pound;970 million of maintenance outcomes. The residual &pound;310 million in maintenance will be delivered via private arrangements outside of the Agency's collection service.<br/> 7. Total maintenance collected and arranged from 1994 to 2003 does not include maintenance direct.<br/> 8. Maintenance Direct figures are sourced from Table 19.5 of the Quarterly Statistical Supplement. Maintenance Direct information is only available from April 2003 onwards.<br/> 9. The amount of maintenance received is that collected via the CSA collection service. This includes<br/> both clerical and system payments.<br/> 10. Monthly amounts of maintenance collected will not sum to the financial year figures published in the<br/> Annual Accounts as they do not include end year adjustments.<br/> 11. The value of Maintenance Direct arrangements in place shows the value of the assessments that the Agency has made i.e. the recommended amount to be paid to the Parent With Care by the non-resident parent. This value is an estimate because it is not possible to calculate, for every day of the year, the value of Maintenance Direct arrangements in place at that point in time. However, it is possible to calculate the value of weekly Maintenance Direct arrangements in place at the end of each month and derive a full monthly estimate from that.<br/> 12. Money relating to Maintenance Direct arrangements is not collected directly by the Agency. As such, the arrangement in place is the best estimate of the money being paid by the Non-Resident Parent.<br/> 13. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;0.1 million.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.688W.5/5" class="indent">The 1991 Child Support Act, (Section 29) gives the Agency a discretionary power in the collection of child support maintenance, although the Agency does not have the power to write off debt owed by non-resident parents. In cases where the Agency decides not to recover debt the Agency must show that this decision is reasonable (rather than inappropriate or unfair) taking into account the circumstances of each case.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.5/6" class="indent">The Agency has issued guidance, for cases where there are exceptional circumstances and where the Agency would consider not collecting debt. The circumstances are not proscribed but do include, for example, terminal illness or death of a non-resident parent, parent with care or qualifying child, cases where the non-resident parent is in prison, hospital or residential care or where the parentage of the qualifying child is under dispute.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.5/7" class="indent">Unless there is a good reason not to do so, every effort will be made to ensure the non-resident parent fulfills their duty to pay child maintenance.</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.3/1">The Government's view is that delays in relation to the adoption of a child, whether or not the child is also the subject of care proceedings, is likely to be damaging and prejudicial to his/her welfare, to the extent that it may contribute to disruption. This is the case whether it arises from delays in processes that are the responsibility of local authorities, such as the operation of adoption panels, or those that arise in the family courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.705W.2/1">As a result of the recent Education and Skills Select Committee enquiry into bullying, and subsequent report, and an independent evaluation of the Department's work with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), the Department is in the process of assessing its overall strategy of work to identify upcoming priorities and will shortly be competitively tendering for elements of work to be carried out in the next financial year. One of these elements will be research into bullying. This will look at what strategies are most effective in tackling bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.2/2">The Department currently commissions Goldsmiths College London, through the ABA, to provide research aligned with policy needs. In the last financial year, the projects undertaken on behalf of the Department included reviews of disability and bullying and on bullying in the community. Research projects this year will look at how schools can best support young people displaying bullying behaviours; young people at risk of anti-social behaviour; and bullying of looked-after children. The Department has also undertaken research with young people on the subject of cyberbullying to inform and develop key, relevant messages for our planned digital information campaign.</p>

	<p pid="b.705W.5/1">The Department currently has no plans to collect statistical data from schools or conduct a formal audit on how schools respond to bullying. As stated in the Department's recent response to the Education and Skills Select Committee report on bullying, there are logistical difficulties involved in asking schools to record incidents of bullying and their responses to incidents. In particular, there are issues around consistency of definition and how bullying might be reported if it continues over a significant period of time. There is also a question of how we might interpret an increase in reported incidents, which might occur as the result of an improved anti-bullying policy and new focus on openness. These complications could lead to more bureaucracy and greater workload for schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.5/2">The Department will continue to recommend in its revised anti-bullying guidance that schools record incidents of bullying and report the statistics to their local authority. The guidance will further advise that the LA should analyse the information gathered from schools to identify any issues of particular concern. This will enable the authority to be better informed in the development of appropriate strategies to tackle bullying across its area. The data will also enable LAs to support and challenge schools in their duties to promote the welfare of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.5/3">In addition, the forthcoming &quot;Tellus 2&quot; survey should give us more comprehensive data on young people's experiences of bullying in schools. It will be an annual survey (starting this year), covering all LAs. Data will be considered by Ofsted in their annual performance assessment (APA) of each LA's services, and could lead to Ofsted looking more closely at anti-bullying practices in a particular authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.5/4">We are currently looking at how we might use data derived from the survey to inform future policy development. We are also working with the National Strategies to undertake some localised auditing of how schools deal with bullying. The National Strategies are identifying secondary schools with weak or ineffective anti-bullying policies and practice. Regional advisers and local authority consultants will provide support and challenge to these schools, working with them to embed good practice, as well as development of appropriate intervention strategies at both staff and pupil level. Progress on this work will be monitored and reported to the Department on a regular basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.710W.6/1">It is inaccurate to say the police cannot take fingerprints or DNA from individuals on control orders. Section 1 (3) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act allows for the imposition of any obligations that the Secretary of State or the court considers necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by that individual in terrorism-related activity. The Government could therefore make the provision of fingerprints or DNA an obligation under a control order, if it was considered necessary and proportionate to do so. Moreover, powers to take fingerprints are governed by other legislation, such as PACE. If, for example, an individual committed an offence while subject to a control order, fingerprints and DNA could be taken in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="b.710W.6/2">The proposal for the forthcoming Counter-Terrorism Bill is to provide equivalent powers after a control order is served as currently apply when arrests are made under the Terrorism Act 2000 or the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. This will provide the same police powers to retain, store and use the DMA and fingerprints of individuals on control orders and will mean that the procedures and safeguards that generally apply, also apply in control order cases.</p>

Examples include demonstrating the ability and willingness to take on new and additional work or consistently exceeding key objectives that have been set. Special bonuses will be awarded for exceptional, specific work such as delivering key tasks in particularly challenging and demanding circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.718W.9/1">Officials in my Department have discussed the Off-Road Vehicles (Registration) Bill, with colleagues in ACPO as well as other Government Departments. In particular, Home Office discussions have focused on any potential impact to the police following implementation if enacted in its current form.</p>
	<p pid="b.718W.9/2">It is difficult to say with great certainty what impact such a Bill would have in practice, as an assessment of non-compliance has not been made. However initial estimates would suggest that additional burdens on the police would be inevitable and costly. ACPO have estimated that at a minimum for ad-hoc enforcement which does not include costs to the Crown Prosecution Service or HMCS, could be in the region of &pound;50 million over three years, based on investigating approximately 300,000 vehicles a year. This does not include the costs of mounting an enforcement operation, but is based on the time it would take an officer to deal with the offence, such as dealing with the offender, arranging recovery of the vehicle and supervising the event. It also includes any necessary paperwork and officer time to prepare for court if that is applicable.</p>
	<p pid="b.718W.9/3">Without a full and proper assessment of a registration scheme and its likely impact on the police and given that there is a range of existing legislation available to the police to deal with this nuisance which is effective and being used, the Home Office strongly opposes the introduction of this particular Private Members' Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.725W.0/2">Data are available for 1997 calendar year and from 1998-99 in financial years. This followed a revision to the counting rules for recorded crime and the expanded coverage which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase>. The figures were also affected by the revised detections guidance issued in April 1999 which formalised detection procedures, placing a greater emphasis on the evidential basis on which detections can be claimed. They were also affected by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002, which required the police to record a crime unless there was</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;no credible evidence to the contrary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.0/4">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 in May 2004 also altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences, in particular, indecent exposure is now classified as a sexual offence. All these changes mean that detection rates are not comparable over this time period.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.0/5">The existing statistical evidence suggests that both the changes to detections guidance and the introduction of NCRS had a marked impact in reducing detection rates for sexual offences since 1997. The Home Office is currently researching in detail recent changes in detection rates in rape cases in England and Wales, including variation between forces. This is expected to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.0/6">New performance management arrangements have been introduced for the police and CPS on the investigation and prosecution of rape. The Home Office and Association of Chief Police Officers are also providing operational support to police forces on the implementation of recommendations from Without Consent, the rape inspection published in January 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.0/1">It is not possible to estimate the number of drivers falsely accused of motoring offences because of the fraudulent cloning of number plates; the number of drivers falsely accused of motoring offences due to inaccuracies in automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) databases or the number of motoring offences that the police have been unable to pursue due to inaccuracies in the ANPR database as these figures are not collected centrally. ANPR is used as the starting point to investigate offences and is not in itself used to press charges or comment on prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="b.733W.2/1">All data gathered by the police using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) is covered by existing legislation. Home Office officials have been working closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to ensure that information collected by ANPR technologies and retained by the police is cognisant of the relevant data protection legislation. The ACPO guidance is designed to ensure that the principles detailed in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 are followed by all police forces.</p>
