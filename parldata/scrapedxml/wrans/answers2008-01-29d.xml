	<p pid="d.184W.0/1">The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. There are no UK-based civilians (UKBCs) employed overseas at Ministry of Defence establishments in receipt of pay below the UK minimum wage. MOD does employ locally engaged civilians (LECs) overseas. The majority of civilian personnel employed overseas by MOD are LECs and not civil servants. LECs are recruited locally, and may be nationals of the host country, expatriates or accompanying dependants of MOD personnel (UKBCs or service personnel). LECs are employed on terms and conditions analogous with local employment law and market forces, and not those of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="d.193W.2/1">The evaluation evidence from the Local Housing Allowance Pathfinders showed clearly that money advice services provided by local authorities were working well. With help from local authorities, and partners such as welfare organisations, credit unions and banks themselves, around 96 per cent. of customers in Pathfinder areas now have a bank or building society account.</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.2/2">The evaluation evidence also shows that around a quarter of customers in Pathfinder areas said that they opened the account so that they could receive payment of the housing allowance. We are sharing the lessons learnt through the Pathfinders during national rollout to help those without access to a bank account to open one.</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.2/3">We are also encouraging local authorities to ensure that payment facilities are available for the small proportion of customers who cannot open a bank account.</p>

	<p pid="d.196W.0/2"><i> </i>Funding for concessionary travel is part of a block within Revenue Support Grant (RSG), so it is not possible to disaggregate information for the allocation of it to individual Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs) in 2005, 2006 and 2007. For the extra cost of the all-England bus concession from April 2008 an additional &pound;212 million will be paid directly to TCAs in England by special grant, rising to &pound;217 million in 2009-10 and &pound;223 million in 2010-11. In the provisional distribution of the grant in 2008-09 Taunton Deane borough council would receive &pound;0.388 million through the special grant. This is in addition to their existing concessionary fares funding through RSG and represents an increase of 33 per cent. on the amount they spent on concessionary fares in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="d.199W.7/1" qnum="177339">To ask the Secretary of State for Transport on what basis the allocation of &pound;212 million for the National Concessionary Fares Scheme extension from 2008-09 was calculated; what the funding allocation for all transport authorities in the south-east except London is for that year; and if she will make a statement.</p>

	<p pid="d.199W.8/1">The &pound;212 million funding allocation for 2008-09 is based on generous assumptions about increasing take-up of passes (85 per cent. in aggregate across England), extra journeys (10 per cent. or &pound;100 million), and average fare (&pound;1.34). It also includes a significant contingency to take account of the difficulty of allocating funding on a formula basis and uncertainty around the precise pattern of new journeys.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.8/2">This new funding is being made available to cover only the additional costs of the new concession. Additional concessions will still have to be funded at an authority's discretion.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.8/3">We consulted on four possible distributions of the grant. These options used data likely to reflect the main drivers of cost of the new concession (e.g. retail floor space, visitor numbers, bus patronage) in different combinations. Our proposed distribution is based on the most popular option. Travel concession authorities in the south-east will receive &pound;25.14 million in total&mdash;an increase of 34 per cent. against what was spent in the region on concessionary travel in 2006-07. A list of the relevant local authorities and the proposed funding for each is as follows:</p>

It would be unusual for an individual process to continue for as long as 10 years. The implication is that, in a significant number of cases, the administrator or insolvency practitioner may not have notified Companies House that a process is complete. Companies House is considering, in discussion with the Insolvency Service, what further steps it could take to clarify how many companies fall into this category. At present, it is not possible to say what the true figure is.</p>

	<p pid="d.207W.5/1">The analysis of the potential contribution of nuclear power to reducing carbon emissions in annex A of the White Paper on Nuclear Power covers emissions arising at the point of generation. The issue of the full life cycle emissions from different electricity generation technologies is covered in the answer to question two from the consultation on nuclear power and is summarised in paragraphs 2.10 to 2.25 of the White Paper. The estimated full life cycle emissions from a nuclear power station (7-22gCO2/kWh) are equivalent to between 2 per cent. and 6 per cent. of those of a gas-fired station for every unit of electricity generated. These include all emissions from uranium processing, through construction and decommissioning to the management of radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid="d.207W.5/2">The cost-benefit analysis of nuclear power published with the 2007 Energy White Paper included the full costs of nuclear, including those for waste and decommissioning.</p>

	<p pid="d.208W.10/2">No assessment has been made of the effect that the implementation of the Respect Agenda has had in West Chelmsford. However, the Local Government User Satisfaction Survey 2006-07 showed that between 2003 and 2006 the number of people perceiving antisocial behaviour as a very or fairly big problem in Chelmsford fell from 35 per cent. to 15 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.10/3">Through the Respect programme, we introduced new approaches nationally to tackle the root causes of antisocial behaviour. Key commitments in the Government's Respect action plan have now been met and mainstreamed locally.</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.10/4">We are committed to building on the excellent progress made across the country, working with local authorities and the police to tackle the problems on the ground but also to deal with the root causes through early intervention and prevention.</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.10/5">Three independent reports on the Government's strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour show that it is working: The Home Affairs Select Committee Report, the National Audit Office report (2006) and Public Accounts Committee Report (2007). Public perceptions of antisocial behaviour being a problem locally are down as shown in the British Crime Survey and the Local Government User Satisfaction Survey 2006-07.</p>

The Criminal Justice Act 1988 prohibits the manufacture, sale and hire of 17 weapons specified in the Criminal Justice Act (Offensive Weapons) Order 1988 including butterfly knives. The Government consulted in March 2007 on adding samurai swords and other offensive weapons to the Order, and has announced its intention to proceed with a ban on the sale of samurai swords, subject to exemptions for collectors and reputable martial arts groups, by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.211W.5/2">While the Government do not currently have plans to license the sale of knives we have, as part of our commitment to tackling knife crime, made it an offence to sell a knife to a person aged under 18 in the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, which is an increase from the previous age of 16. The Knives Act 1997 also makes it an offence to market knives as suitable for combat, or in ways likely to stimulate or encourage violent behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="d.216W.5/1">There is no specific offence of illegally clamping a vehicle on private land or fraudulently issuing a penalty ticket for parking on private land. The Private Security Industry Act 2001 provides for the regulation of vehicle immobilisers carrying out licensable activities and for a range of offences which include using an unlicensed wheel-clamper. The most common offence prosecuted under the Act is &quot;conduct prohibited without a licence&quot;. This would include carrying out, without a licence, not only wheel-clamping and related activities but also the other types of activity which are licensable under the 2001 Act, such as manned guarding and door supervision. Numbers of prosecutions and convictions for 2004 to 2006 for these offences and for the offence of carrying out conduct prohibited without a licence are shown in the following table. The data for the second and third categories do not break down further the licensable activities to which the prosecutions are related.</p>

	<p pid="d.218W.6/1">Credible elections in 2008 that can sustain democracy in the longer term are essential for Bangladesh. The UK is playing its part and offering practical support. Through the Department for International Development (DFID), the UK has contributed &pound;10 million to the voter registration programme in Bangladesh and we have seen encouraging progress to date. A further &pound;1.1 million from DFID is being spent, through the Asia Foundation, on the promotion of accountability, issues-based campaigning and non-violence. This is in addition to our funding of a country-wide scheme to motivate vulnerable groups to register to vote.</p>

Revocation or modification can only be made before a planning permission is implemented. Such intervention is justified only in exceptional circumstances and the Secretary of State will generally use this power only if the original decision is judged to be grossly wrong.</p>
	<p pid="d.229W.5/3">It is clearly better to ensure that up to date and relevant Government planning policy is available for local planning authorities to take into account, when planning for development and deciding planning applications. Planning Policy Statement 25 &quot;Development and Flood Risk&quot;, published in December 2006, provides such planning policy.</p>

	<p pid="d.230W.14/1">I assume that for &quot;housing and capital receipts&quot; the hon. Member means &quot;local authorities' housing capital receipts&quot;. The substantial changes since 1997 to the regulations relating to these are in the following table. Any reader of the table will wish to be aware that under the &quot;set-aside&quot; regime, which ran until <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, with-debt local authorities were required to set aside a proportion of the capital receipt generated by the disposal of a Housing Revenue Account (HRA) asset, for repayment of housing debt. For right to buy that proportion was 75 per cent. For stock-transfer receipts the set-aside was also 75 per cent., unless the value of the housing debt exceeded 75 per cent., in which case the amount to be set aside was raised until it met the value of the debt. For other, non-dwelling sales, the proportion of set-aside was 50 per cent. The local authority was free to use the remaining 25 per cent./50 per cent. respectively for any capital purpose they chose.</p>
	<p pid="d.230W.14/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, all local authorities were required to pay the Secretary of State the same amounts through the process of pooling which formerly would have been set aside. The exception is stock-transfer receipts which are not subject to pooling. Instead, the equivalent amounts of debt are assumed for the purposes of calculating housing subsidy to have been paid off by the authority.</p>

	<p pid="d.231W.5/1">The Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in such areas. Flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. We have strengthened the system significantly&mdash;new planning rules introduced last year (PPS25) make clear that councils should not give the go ahead to new housing in areas where the Environment Agency advise against it. The new rules are already beginning to have an impact and it is vital that councils continue to work with the Environment Agency to ensure that new homes are safe from flooding and property sustainable for the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.5/2">The total land area of England is approximately 13 million hectares. Around 10 per cent. of this is in an area of high flood risk, much of it within London and other existing urban areas. Of this high flood risk area, only around 2,500 hectares (0.2 per cent.) changed to residential use between 1997 and 2004 (the latest year for which information is available).</p>

In the first two years of the EU ETS (2005 and 2006) the power sector was allocated 136.9 million tonnes, compared with emissions of 174.04 million tonnes in 2003. In 2006 the power sector emitted 45.9 million tonnes above its allocation, leading to a requirement for UK energy companies to buy allowances from other installations, thereby ensuring that total emissions remained within the EU cap.</p>

Since the development of the ED packaging regulations, the European standard for compostable and biodegradable packaging&mdash;EN 13432&mdash;has been adopted in the UK. BS EN 13427:2000 provides a framework within which this and four other standards (BS EN 13429, BS EN 13430, BS EN 13431, and BS EN 13432) may be used together to support a claim that packaging is in compliance with the essential requirements for it to be placed on the market, as required by the Directive</p>
	<p pid="d.242W.5/3">These standards ensure that a product is biodegradable, compostable, and safe. In order to gain certification to BS EN13432, the final product must be fully tested and approved. Only if it is certified under BS EN13432, is it acceptable for recovery through biological treatment under the UK packaging recovery note scheme.</p>

	<p pid="d.243W.2/1">My Department has no plans to commission specific research on the destination of non-bottle shaped and bottle-shaped plastic packaging originating from the household waste stream. Various data are already collected by this Department and HM Treasury on the handling and destination of plastic packaging.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.2/2">Based on 2006 figures, the UK recovered 457 kilotonnes of plastic; comprising 22 per cent. of all plastic packaging entering the waste stream, which amounts to approximately 2.12 million tonnes. 166 kilotonnes of the plastic recovered is reprocessed in the UK and 291 kilotonnes is exported.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.2/3">It is estimated that non-bottle mixed plastic packaging arising from the domestic waste stream is around one million tonnes per year. In 2006, around 132,000 tonnes of plastic bottles were collected and recycled from UK households.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.2/4">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is undertaking trials with a number of technologies with the aim of understanding the best ways to handle mixed plastics from an environmental, economical and technological perspective. The programme is investigating three main areas: collection, reprocessing, and end markets. Different recycling and recovery options are being considered as part of this work, including reprocessing mixed plastics into new plastics, incineration, chemical treatment and even turning them into diesel. WRAP'S focus on mixed plastics follows on from the successful uptake of plastic bottle recycling.</p>

	<p pid="d.243W.5/1">According to studies carried out by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) on the plastic processing capacity/supply relationship, the indication is that the UK, along with most of Europe, in fact has excess capacity to process plastic waste. The exception to this is for plastic bottles, and to some extent waste electrical and electronic equipment plastics, where growth in collection has supported a substantial growth in reprocessing capacity.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.5/2">However, this is a complex area, and much of the existing capacity is too old, too small or targeting the wrong end products. Many plants are therefore investing in new capacity or updating and consolidating existing plants, some with support from WRAP. WRAP has a number of projects designed to maximise the amount and quality of recyclate, including plastic, used in UK manufacturing operations.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.5/3">WRAP'S focus on mixed plastics follows on from the successful uptake of plastic bottle recycling. Plastic bottle recycling has significantly increased in recent years, with around 132,000 tonnes of plastic bottles collected and recycled from UK households in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="d.254W.2/1">The PE and school sport public service agreement set out in the comprehensive spending review 2004 is for 85 per cent. of 5 to 6-year-olds to be participating in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport by September 2008. The 2006/07 school sport survey found that 86 per cent. of 5 to 16-year-olds were doing the two hours. Around 900,000 5 to 16-year-olds are currently not doing the two hours, but we expect this number to reduce significantly by September 2008.</p>

	<p pid="d.254W.5/2">The information is not available in the form requested. Sure Start Children's Centres that provide integrated early learning and full day care (early years provision) are required to employ a graduate with qualified teacher status. This will include all centres serving the most disadvantaged communities and centres in less disadvantaged communities where full early years learning and care is provided on site to meet local demand. Local authorities confirm the teacher is in post when they seek designation for a Sure Start Children's Centre. There may also be graduates working as managers or in other professional capacities in centres. The proportion of centres with graduates will therefore vary from authority to authority depending on a variety of local factors.</p>

The current geography curriculum for 11 to 14-year-olds requires pupils to be taught about resource planning and management issues, for example developing alternative energy sources. From September 2008, &quot;environmental interaction and sustainable development&quot; will be one of the key concepts in the new geography curriculum for 11 to 14-year-olds with a requirement to study climate change.</p>

These will make it clear that all young people should experience the world beyond the classroom as an essential part of their learning and personal development whatever their age or circumstances, and provide schools with the tools they need to make these opportunities available. We are also standardising quality and safety accreditation schemes so that schools can be confident in using external venues. This work includes revising our existing guidance &quot;The Health and Safety of Pupils on Educational Visits&quot; and we will expect local authorities to adopt these straightforward procedures when the guidance becomes available later this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.256W.3/2">The Department for Children, Schools and Families has not had any recent discussions with local authority children's services on their use of emergency protection orders (EPOs). We strengthened guidance on the use of EPOs in revised guidance to local authorities, &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot;, issued in 2006. This guidance makes clear that emergency action normally takes place following an inter-agency strategy discussion and that, where a single agency has to act immediately to protect a child, a strategy discussion should take place as soon as possible. It also explains that legal advice should normally be obtained before initiating legal action, in particular when an EPO is to be sought. Through the Children and Young Persons Bill, we are amending the legislative provision for EPOs to remove an anomaly identified by the courts in equivalent legislation in Northern Ireland.</p>

Level 4 is the level expected to be reached by pupils at the end of key stage 2 (i.e. about age 11), and level 5 is that expected by pupils at the end of key stage 3 (at age 14).

	<p pid="d.280W.2/1">The Education Act 2002 introduced from September 2004 an entitlement for all pupils to a programme of work related learning at Key Stage 4 (14 to 16-year-olds). Work related learning may be provided in a number of ways, including through work experience. It is Government policy that young people should participate in work experience at Key Stage 4. 95 per cent. of young people do so and there is good evidence that the vast majority of them and the employers that provide the places enjoy and value their experience. A minimum of 10 days work-experience will be a requirement of Diplomas.</p>

Family support services will be tailored to respond to needs in the local area and we encourage children's centres to ensure that parents or other family members experiencing domestic violence have access to appropriate support. Other family support services, such as structured parenting programmes, may contribute to prevention of domestic abuse. A focussed study 'Sure Start Local Programmes and Domestic Abuse' carried out as part of the National Evaluation of Sure Start, published in July 2007, found that Sure Start Local Programmes had developed a good awareness of issues of domestic violence and use their responsibility to address the needs of children at risk to develop innovative and effective methods of informing and supporting their communities around the dangers of domestic abuse.

	<p pid="d.283W.5/2">Information on the workforce in Sure Start local programmes (SSLPs) and Sure Start children's centres over the last five years is not available. However the 2006 Childcare and Early Years Provider Survey estimated that there were approximately 10,500 staff working in full day care provision in children's centres, of which 9,370 were paid staff and 1,150 were unpaid staff. The average number of paid staff per setting was 14. 9 per cent. of paid staff working in full day care provision in children's centres held a level 6 qualification as their highest level qualification, 62 per cent. held a level 3 qualification and 12 per cent. held a level 1 or level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="d.283W.5/3">Sure Start children's centres, and before them SSLPs, were set up to offer a range of integrated services for young children and families, delivered by statutory, private and voluntary and independent sector agencies working together. SSLPs had flexibility to decide, following consultation with local families, which activities to provide around a core of health, family support, play and learning, and outreach and home visiting services to meet local priorities and needs. Staffing levels therefore varied considerably. Sure Start children's centres offer a minimum level of service including outreach services to families at risk of social exclusion; health and family support services, help with employment and training, advice and information for parents, and some centre based activities for children and families. Centres serving the most disadvantaged communities provide more intensive support and must additionally provide integrated early learning and full day care for children under five. Any centre offering integrated early education and full day care must employ a graduate with qualified teacher status. Over the longer term we expect all centre managers will follow the National Professional Qualification for Integrated Centre Leadership, all staff working through children's centres will be qualified to level 2, level 3 if they are working directly with children and that volunteers will be trained or mentored by qualified staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.285W.0/1">In July 1998, the then Department for Education and Employment commissioned a review of the literature on the educational achievements of deaf children and young people. While the report suggested that deaf and hearing impaired learners do lag behind their hearing peers in their achievements in mathematics and reading it also found that the presence of additional child difficulties, language used in the home and socio-economic status, appear to be more stable predictors of exam success than the degree of hearing loss. The report also found that in many studies, degree of hearing loss itself does not correlate with educational achievement. In those studies where there is a relationship between the two, the correlation may well be attributable to other, latent factors. However, the Government are committed to narrowing the attainment gap between deaf children and their peers. We are currently working with the National Deaf Children's Society and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People to improve the availability of data in order to establish an accurate picture of this attainment gap and take steps to reduce it.</p>
	<p pid="d.285W.0/2">Regarding guidance the Department gives to local authorities on the placement of deaf and hearing-impaired children, the SEN code of practice provides practical advice to all local authorities, maintained schools, early education settings and others on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children's special educational needs. All these parties are required to have regard to the code.</p>

	<p pid="d.286W.5/2">The conclusions of the March 2007 European Council are consistent with the considerable work we are doing domestically to help young people with their transition from school to working life and prepare them to succeed in work and to make a productive contribution to society.</p>
	<p pid="d.286W.5/3">Some of the key measures we are taking forward domestically are: a new set of employer-designed diplomas, providing a platform to acquire all the skills needed for successful employment, the Personal, Social and Health Education framework giving teachers a coherent structure within which to develop children's social and moral development and integrated information, advice and guidance and access to personal development opportunities for all 13 to 19-year-olds to help remove barriers to learning and progression and ensure that young people make a smooth transition to adulthood and working life.</p>

Stamp duty land tax on the premium is based on the amount of premium paid. Details of stamp duty land tax rates and thresholds can be found at:</p>

Many disposals provide for the delivery of this; for example, through financial compensation and unpaid work in the community. Conditional cautions are a relatively new way of doing this&mdash;5,300 have been issued since April 2005. About four in five include some form of reparation from compensation and apologies to repairing criminal damage. The compliance rate is about 6 per cent. It is up to the courts and prosecutors, as appropriate, to determine the most suitable disposal in each particular case.</p>

	<p pid="d.294W.6/1">The Government want to work towards making community justice the way in which local justice is provided in all our courts. Therefore, we have set up 13 community justice courts across England and Wales, one of which is in Birmingham, with a view to test the concept fully. The problem solving approach to tackling the causes of offending has shown promise in boosting community confidence in the Criminal Justice System and reducing re-offending.</p>

In the same period the court has issued 3,163 orders although many of these will have been for applications on legacy cases and received prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.298W.8/1">In its work to analyse the different options available going forward, the Strategic Review requested to consider the affordability of the NOMIS Programme, actively considered and assessed the implications of not rolling out C-NOMIS to probation areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.298W.8/2">Work is under way on the newly revised and deliverable NOMIS Programme announced after the completion of the review, to asses the way forward for probation case management systems, and where necessary, replace those that are most at risk. In addition, to improve the sharing of information between prisons and probation, and to further support the successful implementation of the Offender Management Model and public protection, work has started on both the OASys project to improve the current separate risk assessment systems and to re-develop them as a single national system, and the Data Share project to allow access to core case information between prison and probation areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.298W.8/3">I expect the programme to meet the objectives that were set following the Strategic Review to:</p>
	<p pid="d.298W.8/4" class="indent">Enable improved business continuity by replacing ailing legacy case management and offender assessment applications in public prisons and probation;</p>
	<p pid="d.298W.8/5" class="indent">Enable more efficient and effective operational management of offenders;</p>

	<p pid="d.305W.5/1">Taxis are not routinely used for transporting prisoners to and from court or for inter-prison transfers. However, they are used for a variety of individual and short-notice journeys for prisoners, subject to risk assessment, where prison or other transport is not available and where it is cost-effective to do so. This can include journeys for medical treatment where an ambulance is not appropriate, urgent transfers between prisons, and travel to work or community placements where there is no suitable public transport. Taxi fares are normally paid through an account and the costs of journeys undertaken by prisoners cannot be identified separately from official journeys undertaken by staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.305W.8/1">The aim of Dedicated Search Teams is to reduce the risk posed by prisoners held in high security prisons.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/2">Dedicated Search Teams were a recommendation made by Sir John Woodcock following the escape of six prisoners from the Special Secure Unit at Whitemoor prison in September 1994, which the then Home Secretary accepted in full. Recommendation 9 stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;The Lakes/Hadfield proposal for dedicated and specially equipped search teams in prisons holding Category A inmates should be mandatory. Such teams should have available to them on a regular basis dogs trained to identify firearms, explosives and drugs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/4">All Directorate of High Security establishments are funded for Dedicated Search Teams consisting of 2 x Senior Officers and 12 x Officers.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/5">The aim of Dedicated Search Teams is ultimately to reduce the risk posed by prisoners held in Directorate of High Security Estate establishments. These prisoners, many of whom are Category A, would represent a significant risk to the public should they escape.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/6">All staff joining Dedicated Search Teams attend a one week course at PSC Newbold Revel where they receive intensive search training. The search training was developed to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/7" class="indent">The Prison Service was equipped to manage the threat of firearms and explosives entering establishments</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/8" class="indent">Establishments were able to search items held in possession by prisoners by specialist search teams who would provide a higher level of assurance to prison management that possessions did not conceal illicit items, particularly firearms and explosives</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/9" class="indent">Establishments were able to conduct offensive searches in response to intelligence suggesting escape planning, etc.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/10" class="indent">Establishments were able to plan and execute full lock down searches in response to intelligence suggesting escape planning, etc.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.8/11">Dedicated Search Teams are also used to bolster security at Crown courts where Category A prisoners are appearing by conducting pre trial 'search and seal exercises'.</p>

A modernised pay and grading structure supported by a national job evaluation scheme was introduced in 2005. Local boards have the ability to negotiate some lesser terms and conditions such as essential car user allowance. These are a matter for the local employer in this case the Northumbria Probation Board through consultation and negotiation with their employees.</p>

	<p pid="d.313W.3/23" class="indent">(i) There is no discernable trend to the self-inflicted deaths at Whitemoor, though all four such deaths in 2007 were Category A Life Sentenced prisoner who are a traditionally high risk group.</p>
	<p pid="d.313W.3/24" class="indent">(ii) Since 2004 the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been conducting investigations into all deaths in prison custody. All such deaths are also subject to a coroners inquest. The investigations into the four most recent self-inflicted deaths at Whitemoor are incomplete. Whitemoor, like much of the prison estate, contains a population with a high proportion of very vulnerable individuals, many of whom have experienced negative life events that we know increase the likelihood of them harming themselves. Issues that increase risk include drug/alcohol abuse, family background and relationship problems, social disadvantage or isolation, previous sexual or physical abuse, and mental health problems. Between July 2006 and July 2007 the proportion of prisoners at Whitemoor with a life/indeterminate sentence rose from 58 per cent. to 64 per cent. but this change appears insufficient to explain the recent self-inflicted deaths. At the request of the governor, the Prison Service's Directorate of High Security Prisons has established a group to review the five self-inflicted deaths which occurred at Whitemoor prison between November 2006 and December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.313W.3/25">Every death in prison affects families, staff and other prisoners deeply. Ministers and the Prison Service are completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents. The updated Prison Service suicide prevention strategy was published in October 2007 with implementation due to be completed in every prison, including Whitemoor, by end-April 2008. Building on several years of learning from the experience of prisoners, staff, investigators, inspectors and others, it incorporates developments such as improved cross-agency information flows, the provision of safer cells, increasing prisoner peer support, and the introduction of ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork) the care-planning system for prisoners at-risk of suicide or self-harm, introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07.</p>
	<p pid="d.313W.3/26">At Whitemoor itself a Head of Decency to oversee the whole safer prisons strategy has been appointed, local safer custody policies have been re-visited, communication of prisoner safety information across the establishment improved, and there is an action plan which ensures that all actions identified following any death are implemented.</p>

	<p pid="d.315W.3/21">There has been no individual assessment of the contribution each part of the prison plays in the detection of unauthorised items coming into or found within the prison, since in many cases it is the cooperation of all staff that permits the discovery of illicit material. It is not Prison Service policy to comment on the specific measures each establishment is taking to prevent contraband from coming into the establishment.

	<p pid="d.318W.0/1">Economic growth in Bangladesh has been positive since 1976, increasing from 2.2 per cent. in the turbulent 1970s to 5.7 per cent. between 2000 and 2006. This is a major achievement for a country frequently suffering from natural and political shocks. However, the rising prices of commodities are a real concern for the people and government of Bangladesh. Government spending is high on subsidies for fuel, fertiliser, utilities and basic foods to ensure people can still purchase these products. However, this puts further pressure on Bangladesh's fiscal deficit. The dramatically rising rice prices are having a negative impact on the living standards of the poor in particular. These price rises are not only due to international price increases, but have also been exacerbated by other factors such as rising overall inflation, and reduced domestic agricultural production due to the floods in August and the cyclone in November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.318W.0/2">The UK Government are monitoring the situation closely. During my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's visit to Bangladesh in December, he personally met with the Bangladesh Finance Adviser where he discussed the issue of rising prices and the immense challenge this is for Bangladesh. While our development programme is providing some assistance to counteract the impact of rising food prices through our ongoing programmes and some additional short-term measures in response to cyclone SIDR, it remains the government of Bangladesh's responsibility to tackle this challenge, beginning with the issue of rising inflation.</p>

At the Heiligendamm G8 summit of 2007, in the context of scaling up efforts to contribute towards the goal of universal access to comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010 for all, and to developing and strengthening health systems, G8 Heads agreed to provide at least a projected US $60 billion over the coming years, and invited other donors to contribute. The G8 also made substantial commitments in the areas of preventing mother to child transmission, paediatric treatments for AIDS and in the areas of maternal and child health care and voluntary family planning.</p>
	<p pid="d.320W.2/4">Our analysis of data compiled by UNAIDS indicates that G8 countries committed around US $7.5 billion on AIDS over the last two years, 2005 and 2006. This represents 76 per cent. of global commitments to AIDS during the period.</p>

	<p pid="d.333W.0/1">Mobile telephones, base stations and wireless installations in this country are expected to comply with the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The ICNIRP guidelines are incorporated into the European Recommendation on limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields (EC/519/1999) adopted by European member states.</p>
	<p pid="d.333W.0/2">Measurements by Ofcom (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>) have consistently shown base station compliance with the guidelines. Exposure from mobile telephone handsets is available on the manufacturer's website at <a href="http://www.mmfai.org/public/">www.mmfai.org/public/</a>. The Health Protection Agency's Radiation Protection Division (HPA-RPD) is undertaking a systematic programme of research into wireless local area networks (WLANs) and their use. In a recent announcement the HPA has said that WiFi and WLAN signals are very low power and the results so far show exposures are well within ICNIRP guidelines, which are available at:</p>
	<p pid="d.333W.0/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2007/071012_wifi.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2007/071012_wifi.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="d.333W.0/4">The HPA-RPD periodically reviews the scientific research into the potential health effects from electromagnetic fields. Its comprehensive 2004 review recommended the adoption of the ICNIRP guidelines in this country, but also acknowledged the need for further research (<a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/publications/">www.hpa.org.uk/publications/</a>). A 2007 assessment on behalf of the European Commission also endorsed the ICNIRP public exposure guidelines, but similarly noted the paucity of scientific data in some areas:</p>
	<p pid="d.333W.0/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/comm">www.ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/comm</a></p>
	<p pid="d.333W.0/6">The independently managed Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme has supported a number of studies into the possible health effects of radio signals from mobile telephone technology. The studies of base stations were carried out in carefully controlled conditions as living close to base stations is not a reliable measure of overall exposure to radio signals. None of the research published in the 'MTHR 2007' report demonstrates that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones or base stations. These studies and recommendations for further research are described on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>

This includes working with them to secure services that are needed locally, for example complementary or alternative therapies as a component of patient choice. However, any decisions on the provision of services are the responsibility of local national health service health care organisations, taking account of evidence on the safety and efficacy of the relevant treatments and the availability of suitably trained practitioners.</p>

	<p pid="d.342W.5/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that since 1999, the year from which a central record of licence committee decisions has been maintained, it has refused one application for a research licence.</p>
	<p pid="d.342W.5/2">In 2004 the Newcastle Fertility Centre at LIFE applied for a licence to use embryos to study mitochondrial DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) disorders. This application was considered by the HFEA's Research Licence Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-15">15 July 2004</phrase>. The Committee refused to grant a licence on the grounds that the proposed research activities were prohibited under paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 2 to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Representations against this decision by the centre were heard by the Research Licence Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-24">24 November 2004</phrase>. The Committee decided to uphold its original decision and refused to grant a research licence. An appeal by the centre against this decision was heard by a HFEA Appeal Panel on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>. After hearing arguments from both sides and obtaining independent scientific and legal advice, the Appeal Committee was satisfied that none of the activities in the proposed research involved altering the genetic structure of any cell while it formed part of an embryo. The Appeal Panel decided to grant a research licence authorising the use of human embryos to study the prevention of mitochondrial DNA disorders.</p>
	<p pid="d.342W.5/3">The numbers of applications refused by the HFEA's Research Licence Committee is limited because the HFEA works closely with research teams on the development of the project, prior to a licence application being submitted, to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and the HFEA's code of practice. In this way, applications for projects that would not be considered suitable for licensing tend not to be submitted.</p>
	<p pid="d.342W.5/4">Where a project would, in principle, be suitable to be licensed but insufficient information has been submitted to the Licence Committee, or the Committee is of the view that an aspect of the project needs to be reconsidered, it is usual practice for the Committee not to reject the application but to ask the applicant to submit further information or undertake changes to the specifications of the project, for reconsideration at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="d.345W.5/1">The National User Forum on Mental Health, announced in 2000, was to be run by service users appointed within the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE). The national clinical director for Mental Health, Louis Appleby, held initial meetings with user groups which established their preference to be a part of integrated mental health reform, and laid out a programme of work linking in to other NIMHE initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="d.345W.5/2">The NIMHE has been working for some time to strengthen its involvement of service users and carers in its work. NIMHE commissioned a report from Health and Social Care Advisory Service to review service user and carer involvement in NIMHE. The resultant 'Making a Real Difference' (MARD) report (April 2005) made 20 recommendations to take forward service user and carer involvement in NIMHE. The main focus of the MARD Programme was in strengthening NIMHE's own service user and carer involvement, ensuring good levels of involvement at national level, in its national programmes and regional work.</p>
	<p pid="d.345W.5/3">User groups have been involved in many individual elements of mental health policy, including legislation and, currently, the development of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.345W.5/4">As we consider what is to replace the national service framework for mental health from 2009, we shall include service users in discussions and the resultant consensus.</p>

Any prescription-only medicines used in any treatment will be covered by the Medicines Act 1968. Most dermal fillers used in the United Kingdom are regulated as medical devices under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002.</p>
