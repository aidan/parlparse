Having carefully considered everything Mr. Kiley had to say, the Government have concluded that the best course is to proceed with plans for the modernisation of the underground, to create a 21st century tube which will be publicly run and privately built. I will today be asking London Underground to move quickly to progress negotiations, subject to the requirements to ensure safety, so that work can start as soon as possible. In doing this, and as a result of the discussions with Bob Kiley, London Underground plan to make a number of changes to deliver better public sector control, particularly in the area of safety.</p>

	<p pid=".232W.2/1">The Highways Agency has a strategy for improving the A5. I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Mr. David Tredinnick, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-05">5 July 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/3" class="indent">The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your recent question about proposals for improving the A5 between the M69 and A47 Longshoot Junction.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/4" class="indent">A strategy for improvements to this section of the A5 was developed following the publication of the Inspector's Report on the Public Inquiry into the Hinckley and Bosworth Local Plan. This strategy indicated the need for improvements to the road as a result of development proposals identified in the Plan and preliminary consultation, undertaken in June 1999, identified a number of possible improvement schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/5" class="indent">The enclosed leaflet sets out the broad programme although there have been a number of changes since it was published in March. Work is likely to start in the Autumn on two developer-funded schemes, the provision of roundabouts at Nutts Lane and Sketchley Lane, and we hope to start work this financial year on improving signing at Hinckley Railway Bridge and on the traffic signs at Stretton House Bends. Other developer funded schemes, including Dodwells roundabout and proposals at Wolvey Road and the M69 junction, are less advanced and will be dependent in part on the developers' timescales.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/6" class="indent">More recently, work has started on the preparation of the Route Management Strategy for the trunk road corridor between the M1 and the A38 in the Midlands, including this length of the A5. This was mentioned in Gwyn Drake's letter to you of 19th January. This will look at the corridor as a whole and will recommend a range of highway improvements for inclusion in future works programmes. It will also review some of the improvements identified in the preliminary consultation, such as the pedestrian and cycle path on the north side of the A5 between the M69 and the Longshoot junction, and enhancements including &quot;no waiting&quot; restrictions, a 40 mph speed limit and street lighting. Public consultation is expected to start early in 2002, with the final strategy being published June.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/7" class="indent">The result will be a Route Management Plan, which will include a ten-year strategy and a three-year action plan.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/8" class="indent">I trust that this answers your question but if you wish to discuss any aspect further, the Highways Agency Route Manager for this length of A5 is David Nock. He can be contacted at our offices at Broadway, Broad Street, Birmingham, B15 1BL, or by telephone on 0121 678 8362.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.2/1">Draft Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) is drawn up by the Regional Planning Body for each region and includes proposed rates of housing provision. Once the RPG has been confirmed by the Secretary of State following public examination, the presumption is that the rates of housing provision are carried through into structure plans or Unitary Development Plans. The housing provision for each region is no longer set as an inflexible long-term target for housebuilding based on a 'predict and provide' methodology but is expressed as an annual rate of provision for additional dwellings which is subject to regular monitoring and review. The level of housing provision is monitored by the regional planning body with the expectation that it will be reviewed every five years, or sooner if necessary.</p>

This work will be supported by a further &pound;325 million in 2002&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.6/6">Local authorities were able to compete for grant under Rounds 2 and 3 of the Invest to Save Budget. This is a Treasury/Cabinet Office initiative, designed to develop projects which bring together two or more public services in an innovative and more efficient fashion. In Round 3, 46 out of 100 successful projects were led by local authorities, involving some &pound;22.4 million funding from a total ISB Round 3 pot of &pound;60 million. Both e-government and IS projects will provide a valuable source of best practice for local government.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.6/7">Through the beacon council scheme, councils can improve by learning from those who already provide excellent services. 39 councils, given beacon status in the second round of the scheme, are currently offering opportunities to develop services across 11 themes. Earlier this week&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2001-07-04">4 July 2001</phrase>&mdash;we published an application brochure inviting further applications in the third round of the scheme. Evaluation studies are showing that the beacon scheme is making a positive contribution to the development of good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.6/8">The Department has embarked on a major programme to develop best practice in partnership working with public, private and voluntary sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.6/9">Jointly with the Local Government Association, we commissioned a Review of Local Government Procurement under Sir Ian Byatt. We have now received this report. It is an important contribution to the debate on the modernisation of local government and the provision of high quality services to local people. This report will stimulate the development of best practice in procurement.</p>

Link 16 is not currently planned to be fitted to Tornado GR4 or Harrier GR7 aircraft as we have higher operational priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".249W.9/1">The Prison Service is keen to work with outside contractors to provide increased and better quality employment opportunities for prisoners, where local circumstances permit. However, the primary aim of regimes for prisoners is to address their offending behaviour and improve their employability so as to reduce the risk that they will re-offend on release. It is important that regimes provide a mix of offending behaviour, drugs treatment and educational programmes and resettlement activities as well as work and vocational training.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.9/2">The private sector was originally introduced into prison management because of the possible benefits of cost and speed of delivery but also the prospect of improvements in the quality of prison conditions. Where a prison is under private sector management, the contract requires employment and other purposeful activity to be provided and specifies the level of provision.</p>

	<p pid=".250W.11/1">Statistics on immigration and asylum are based on administrative sources and their quality is benefiting from the improvements and developments that have been made to the administrative systems over the past year. Further improvements in quality and scope are expected. The data produced monthly shortly after the end of the reference period are subject to quality improvement and revision prior to publication in biennial and annual statistical publications to take account of the delayed reporting of data and data cleansing work.</p>
	<p pid=".250W.11/2">Immigration and asylum statistics are published in a Command Paper and a number of regular statistical bulletins covering general immigration, asylum, and citizenship. All these publications form part of the National Statistics and as such are produced to professional standards set out in a Code of Practice. The formal assessment of data quality is incorporated in the cycle of reviews under the National Statistics Work Programme.</p>

	<p pid=".251W.9/1">The Human Rights Act 1998 has undoubtedly affected all aspects of the work undertaken by the Crown Prosecution Service.

Follow-up training is still being undertaken. The quality and intensity of the training has meant that cases giving rise to human rights issues have been dealt with in a professional and effective manner. CPS areas have reported that prosecutors are using convention arguments with greater confidence than ever before.</p>
	<p pid=".251W.9/3">The Human Rights Act has meant that the courts are considering many new arguments. A number of cases raising human rights points have already been decided by the appeal courts. Fast tracking of cases has enabled cases that have an impact on the criminal justice system as a whole to be heard quickly by the appeal courts. This has assisted in ensuring that blockages in the criminal justice system have not developed.</p>

We are working closely with EU and UN partners to follow up implementation of the report on UN Peace Operations drawn up by the Panel chaired by Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi in 2000. In particular, we are pressing for improved early warning mechanisms within the UN system, better analysis of where problems might arise and more effective rapid deployment mechanisms. We are also working with UN Security Council partners to improve the decision-making processes leading to the deployment of UN peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.5/4">The Government have established two cross- departmental conflict prevention pooled funds to help maximise our contribution to conflict prevention and peacekeeping work. The pools&mdash;one for sub-Saharan Africa and one for the rest of the world&mdash;are jointly managed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence. Their purpose is to produce a joint strategy to facilitate collective decision making on where and how to focus our conflict prevention efforts, enabling Government to identify ways in which these Departments, by working more closely together, can make more a effective contribution.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.5/5">We are also putting mechanisms in place to improve the effectiveness of our national contributions to peacekeeping. These involve a rapid deployment capability for civilian police and on-call arrangements for military personnel.</p>

	<p pid=".260W.2/1">The Declaration of Commitment adopted by 189 delegations at the 26th Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly sets out a global consensus on future actions necessary to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Declaration commits member states to a series of national targets and strategies to achieve them in the areas of leadership; prevention; care, support and treatment; HIV/AIDS and human rights; reducing vulnerability; children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS; alleviating social and economic impact; research and development; HIV/AIDS in conflict and disaster affected regions; resources and follow-up. The Declaration does not clearly identify those individuals and groups at highest risk of infection because of blocking action by a group of states. Uganda and Thailand have demonstrated that an open and honest approach to tackling the epidemic can lead to a reduction in the rate of transmission of the disease. Other countries must follow their example.</p>

	<p pid=".261W.3/1">Only five countries&mdash;Uganda, Burkino Faso, Tanzania, Mauritania and Bolivia have developed full poverty reduction strategy papers. More than 20 low income countries, have produced interim PRSPs and a further 15 could be presented by the end of 2001. PRSPs contain goals and targets for poverty reduction over 3&ndash;10 years. One positive early indication is the strong degree of local ownership that has emerged in the course of developing many of the PRSPs.</p>

	<p pid=".262W.8/2">Progress is being made against all targets although current trends are not enough to achieve all of them in every region of the world. The income poverty target looks as if it will be met, thanks notably to progress in the large countries of Asia, but some countries are moving less fast. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has stagnated for most of the past decade though some African Governments have made significant progress in reducing poverty. Intense efforts will be needed if Sub-Saharan Africa is to reach the targets.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.8/3">Much has been achieved, but much remains to be done&mdash;1.2 billion people still exist in extreme poverty, 113 million children are currently out of school and over half a million women still die in pregnancy and childbirth each year.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.8/4">Increased international effort is needed, building on what has already been achieved and on the overwhelming consensus reached at the 2000 Millennium summit last September. This summit reaffirmed the commitment of the international community to achieving the goals as a first step towards eradicating global poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.8/5">The challenge over the next few years will be to turn this commitment into solid and sustained action. National Governments must take the lead. Industrialised countries must work for a stronger commitment in global institutions and agreements to the systematic reduction of poverty. Development assistance needs to increase and be deployed more effectively on building national capacity to meet the IDTs. Globalisation must be managed if its effects are to benefit the poorest people in the poorest countries. DFID's approach to this is set out in our White Paper published last December, a copy of which is also in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.8/6">DFID is widely seen as playing a leading role in the drive towards the international development targets. The long-term fall in UK development assistance has been reversed and this Government are committed to increasing the oda/GNP ratio from its year 2000 level of 0.31 per cent. to 0.34 per cent. by 2003&ndash;04. Our manifesto committed the Government to further substantial increases during this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".264W.12/1">The fixed term directive is due to be implemented by <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-10">10 July 2001</phrase>, but provides that member states may take up to an extra year to implement if they encounter special difficulties. The public consultation on the implementation of this directive in the UK closed on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-31">31 May</phrase> and the responses have shown that there are particular difficulties with the implementation of the directive in this country. In particular, the relative lack of existing legal provisions on fixed term contracts in the UK has made it difficult to establish how they are used. We shall therefore be taking extra time to implement the fixed term directive and have notified the European Commission accordingly. Before deciding to take extra time to implement the Directive, we consulted with employer and employee representative bodies, including the CBI and TUC. I am aware that several other member states have indicated they will also be taking extra time to implement the directive.</p>

Earlier this year, a new Government fund, with a funding allocation for the current financial year, was announced to help with the costs of relocating and refurbishing rural post offices. Universal banking services is a Post Office based approach which will ensure that those benefit and pension recipients who wish to continue to collect their benefits in cash, in full, across a post office counter, will be able to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".273W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-03">3 January 2001</phrase> we published a consultation paper and draft guidance on fairer charging policies for non- residential social services. The draft guidance proposed that charges should not reduce service users' incomes below &quot;basic levels&quot; of Income Support, as defined in the draft guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.5/3">The Department's consultation paper noted that, while some users would pay lesser charges or cease to pay charges as a result of the draft guidance, better off users might reasonably be expected to pay higher charges. The experience of the local council operating the good practice example of charging policy described in the consultation paper suggests that there is scope for councils to maintain charge income in this way.</p>

	<p pid=".274W.3/2">The Department is working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in support of the Rural Stress Action Plan (RSAP) which offers support to help alleviate stress in rural areas. Through the RSAP, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already made available &pound;500,000 to support farmers as part of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's action plan for farming. The second RSAP is focused on the need to respond to the problems facing rural people as a consequence of the foot and mouth disease outbreaks which commenced in February 2001. The Department has also provided the rural stress information service and MIND with funding through the section 64 General Scheme under the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 for projects developing support networks and access to information, care and support for people in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.3/3">In addition, local primary care services will be able to provide appropriate support to children and families suffering any adverse psychological problems resulting from measures taken on farms to eradicate foot and mouth disease. The Department for Education and Skills has also issued information on the implications of foot and mouth for schools, in order to help minimise the impact on pupils' schooling. This includes guidance on making arrangements for attendance recording, educational trips games fixtures and national tests. The Department for Education and Skills also worked closely with the GCSE/ A-level awarding bodies to allow special considerations to apply where students' participation in exams or completing coursework was affected.</p>

	<p pid=".276W.11/2">All cloven-hoofed animals, including deer, are susceptible to foot and mouth disease. Wild deer tend to show mild or unapparent disease, resembling the disease in sheep, although some species (eg roe deer and muntjak deer in the UK) may be severely affected.</p>
	<p pid=".276W.11/3">Deer can be carriers of the foot and mouth virus, and could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However, the Department's current veterinary risk assessment indicates that the risk of wild deer playing any significant part in the spread of foot and mouth disease is very low. There are therefore no plans at this stage to control wild deer populations, although as more information becomes available about the epidemiology of the disease in areas where there are wild deer, the risk assessment will be updated.</p>
	<p pid=".276W.11/4">As of <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-02">2 July</phrase> more than 60 samples have been submitted to the Institute of Animal Health for testing from various parts of England and Scotland. All have tested negative for evidence of the foot and mouth virus, antigens or antibodies.</p>

	<p pid=".276W.14/2">The Government would be prepared to authorise a programme of vaccination based on the advice of the Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Veterinary Officer. At an earlier stage of the outbreak, their advice was to vaccinate cattle in Cumbria and Devon provided the campaign had the substantial support of farmers, consumers, veterinarians, and the food trade. That level of support was simply not there and, as the number of new cases fell, the signs were that it would not be achieved. Vaccination remains an option, however, and is kept under continuous review.</p>

Seven farms are considered to have been infected as a result of windborne spread over several kilometres. This low number is thought to be because only 10 pig herds have become infected during the epidemic.</p>
	<p pid=".277W.5/2">Short distance aerosol spread cannot be distinguished from other causes of local spread within 3 km of infected premises, which accounts for 81 per cent. of cases. In these cases there are often a number of possible means of spread such as using common facilities, contaminated roadways and movement of people and farm vehicles. In addition, however, 83 cases have been specifically associated with lorry movements or movements of people.</p>

	<p pid=".278W.0/1">It is correct that a laboratory test which is negative or inconclusive at 48 hours may give a positive result at 96 hours. This is because some samples may contain a very small amount of virus and it can take a second passage of 48 hours in inoculated cell cultures for the virus to be amplified to a level where it will give a clear result. Each cell passage takes 48 hours&mdash;ie 96 hours in total.</p>

	<p pid=".279W.2/1">The data provided by the local authorities which administer the rate relief scheme do not distinguish between different classes of business, so the question cannot be answered in precisely the terms of the question. The background is that local authorities have powers to grant rate relief to businesses suffering financial hardship. Normally, the Government meet 75 per cent. of the cost of this and authorities the remaining 25 per cent., but in order to alleviate the problems of foot and mouth disease, central Government agreed to pay 95 per cent. of the cost: to 151 rural authorities; for the three months April&mdash;June; and for the properties with a rateable value (RV) of &pound;12,000 or less.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/2">The Local Government Association has provided us with the results of the most recent survey, which showed that 46 worst affected local authorities, have received 4,832 applications for rate relief. 41 authorities have so far approved 1,589 cases; in many cases local authorities are still considering applications. Many are also deferring ratepayers' payments. In conjunction with colleagues in other Government Departments, I shall be monitoring the take-up of this scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.8/1">Nuclear power plays a role in helping the UK to meet our climate change targets. The Government believe that existing nuclear power stations should continue to contribute to the electricity supply and to the reduction of emissions, as long as they can do so to the high safety and environmental standards that are currently observed.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.8/2">Nuclear output is however expected to decline from around 2005 onwards, as the older stations begin to close. Electricity generation is therefore likely to become more carbon-intensive unless other low or zero carbon energy sources can be developed. There are currently no proposals for new nuclear power stations in the UK, largely due to nuclear's inability to compete on cost grounds with other types of generation. Issues related to waste disposal and public acceptability would also need to be resolved before industry put forward any proposals for approval. The Government will shortly be publishing a consultation document on radioactive waste policy. Internationally, the industry is addressing disposal issues through its research and development programmes into current and future technology, recognising that they need to be addressed effectively if nuclear power is to remain an option in the future.</p>

The hon. Member may wish to know that since this date the state veterinary service has changed several times. The Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), which previously formed part of the state veterinary service, became the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) in April 1990. The CVL figures are incorporated in this return for the years <phrase class="date" code="1980-01-01">1 January 1980</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="1990-01-01">1 January 1990</phrase>. From 1990 the figures do not include the CVL. The Veterinary Investigation Service became part of the VLA on <phrase class="date" code="1995-10-01">1 October 1995</phrase> and is not included in these figures from that date. In 2000, there were 99 veterinarians employed by VLA. Much of the information presented here previously appeared on <phrase class="date" code="1997-02-27">27 February 1997</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/1997-02-27.323"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 323&ndash;24W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.8/2">Of the 286 full-time equivalent veterinarians employed by the state veterinary service, 220 are employed as field veterinary officers. The work of these officers is supplemented by about 100 Temporary Veterinary Inspectors (TVIs) from the private sector in normal times.</p>

Union learning representatives, who communicate with employees, employers and training providers to promote learning in the workplace, have made an important contribution to improving workplace communications. The Government are currently consulting on giving statutory backing to union learning representatives to give them formal recognition and to build up their numbers through the union learning fund.</p>

	<p pid=".293W.8/1">A range of measures is in place to encourage suitable people into teaching. Improved funding for schools and increased starting salaries have helped to bring about an extra 12,600 teachers in maintained schools in England between January 1998 and January 2001. But greater expectations and extra resources in the system have created more teaching posts and vacancies still exist. Training bursaries worth &pound;6,000 have been introduced to attract more graduates into teaching, with new style golden hellos of &pound;4,000 for those who go on to teach in shortage subjects. London weighting allowances have been lifted by 30 per cent and recruitment and retention allowances of up to &pound;5,085 are now available to schools. We will also attract experienced teachers back to the profession and welcome back bonuses of between &pound;2,000 and &pound;4,000 are planned. These measures are set against a backdrop of increasing funding for schools, which has risen by &pound;540 per pupil since 1997, and more resources for increasing the numbers of teaching assistants and improving working conditions generally. Grants have been made available to schools, through local education authorities to ensure that all school staff have better working conditions and ready access to the equipment they need to work effectively. The Government have invested more than &pound;5 billion in school buildings since 1997, and &pound;7,8 billion in England over the next three years is the biggest schools capital spending programme in decades.</p>

But we cannot guarantee that every parent will secure a place for their child in their favourite school. Where they do not, they have a right of appeal. During 1999&ndash;2000, the latest year for which figures are available, 34 per cent. of all appeals were decided in parents' favour. Parents can ask for their child to stay on a waiting list for their favourite school, although the school is not obliged to keep one.</p>

As part of that wider review we have set up two working groups, with local government and schools partners, to develop proposals for a new LEA and school funding system.

	<p pid=".310W.2/4" class="indent">Most of the 70,000 Census field staff were paid for the work carried out by them under the terms of their contractual agreements with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in full and on time. However, there have been problems with making final payments which have lead to delays in settling claims for payments and other outstanding expenses.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.2/5" class="indent">In the light of these difficulties ONS has written to Census District Managers explaining the situation, and individually to the field staff concerned, to apologise for the delay and to ensure that they are aware they can contact ONS directly. Arrangements to complete these payments as a matter of urgency are now in hand. ONS has made interim final payments to those affected and has introduced special pay runs to minimise any further delays in making payments. Extra staff have been drafted in to the payroll operation to make sure the remainder of the claims are processed as quickly as possible. All staff will be paid the amounts due to them.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.2/2">'A New Commitment to Neighbourhood Renewal National Strategy Action Plan' was launched by the Prime Minister in January 2001. It sets out the Government's vision to narrow the gap between deprived areas and the rest of England, so that within 10&ndash;20 years no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live. Our aim is to deliver economic prosperity, safe communities, high quality schools, decent housing, and better health to the poorest parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/3">This approach will focus main Government programmes explicitly on deprived areas and will require all sectors to work in partnership. The strategy is being spearheaded by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, a cross-cutting unit based in DTLR and staffed by officials from across Whitehall and the public sector, with secondees from the private and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/4">In respect of European Programmes, we are looking to the Regional Development Agencies. They have the main responsibility for regional economic development, and are key members of partnerships which deliver both domestic and European Funds to the programme areas. We are keeping the RDA role under review as the European programmes develop.</p>
