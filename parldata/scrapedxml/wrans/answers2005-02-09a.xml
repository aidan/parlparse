Researchers isolated <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (the prime causative agent for TB in cattle) in a number of mammalian species, some for first time e.g. muntjac deer. Infection was also found in foxes, stoats, polecats, common shrews, yellow-necked mice, wood mice, field voles, grey squirrels, roe deer, red deer and fallow deer. While isolations from deer are a concern, it is not clear what, if any, contribution any of the species examined in the study make to the problem of TB in cattle.</p>

	<p pid="a.1496W.8/1">In the East Offaly study the evidence of cattle infection was measured by reactor animals per 1,000 tests, whereas the main method in the Four Area Study was the odds of new herd restrictions. There was a marked decline over time in the badger removal areas compared to the reference areas in both studies. By the nature of both studies, however, it is difficult to ascribe this reduction definitely to badger removal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1499W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1499W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> In the North West region support for the development of farmers markets is being taken forward by the North West Fantastic Food Partnership. This partnership is made up of a group of organisations from across the region whose role is to assist food producers to develop their business and market their products. The partnership is pursuing a five-year project (from November 2002 to March 2007) covering a range of activities including support for farmers markets. Funding for these activities (totalling some &pound;5.3 million) comes from the North West Regional Development Agency, Defra's Rural Enterprise Scheme and from the Merseyside Objective One programme. Specific initiatives relating to farmers' markets include the improvement of existing farmers' markets, the creation of new markets and the promotion of the markets to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499W.2/3"><i>(b)</i> More generally, the Government welcome the establishment of farmers markets. They offer an excellent outlet for farmers to sell their produce direct to consumers and the Department is keen to encourage their development. That is why we have made provision under the England Rural Development Programme for grants to projects promoting farmers markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499W.2/4">Defra officials met representatives from the National Farmers Retail and Markets Association (FARMA) last July to explore how Defra could work with FARMA on the common goals of reconnecting farmers to their markets and helping them to add value. The meeting included a discussion on FARMA's priorities and how these might be supported under various grant schemes&mdash;in particular the Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES) and the Agriculture Development Scheme (ADS). Farmers markets at both regional and national level have received funding under those schemes in the past. The meeting also covered how FARMA could raise its profile with the regional development agencies (RDAs). As a result, representatives from FARMA gave a presentation to Defra's Regional Food Cross-Cutting Group, which includes representatives from the RDAs, the Countryside Agency and the Food Standards Agency, in September 2004.</p>

Copies of the authorisations are placed on the Environment Agency's public registers and are sent to local authorities so that they may be made available for public access. The authorisations generally do not specify the associated quantities of material (in terms of the volume or weight of the waste), and records of those quantities are not collated centrally. Details of releases of radioactivity from authorised premises in England and Wales, including sites where radioactive waste may be incinerated, are published in the Pollution Inventory section of the Environment Agency's website, <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk">www.environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

CoRWM has been asked to deliver its recommendations by July 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1502W.2/4">CoRWM and Nirex are separate and distinct bodies. Nirex will contribute to the CoRWM review as part of its work.

	<p pid="a.1510W.7/1">The Government have discussed with the United States Administration the background to the EU's deliberations on the embargo on arms exports to China.</p>
	<p pid="a.1510W.7/2">We have emphasised that any decision to lift the embargo would be made only in the context of a continuing commitment by member states strictly to control the export of defence-related items to China. This is consistent with the view of the European Council meeting in December 2004 that the result of any decision to lift the embargo should not be an increase in arms exports to China in either quantitative or qualitative terms.</p>

	<p pid="a.1513W.11/2">The United States 800th Military Police brigade has subordinate elements consisting of some 25 units, none of them currently based in the British area of responsibility. Until early 2004, a unit from 800th Brigade was based at Camp Bucca, which is a US camp within MND(SE). It would have been necessary for members of British units regularly to liaise with the US units based at Camp Bucca. It is not possible after this time to give a list of the British regiments, dates and locations in each case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1517W.6/1">Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOS) were introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Police Reform Act 2002 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 extended the legislation to allow additional agencies to apply for ASBOs and introduced two new types of ASBO: orders on conviction and interim orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1517W.6/2">The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 put in place a range of measures to tackle antisocial behaviour and gave local agencies the tools they need to tackle antisocial behaviour on the ground. Key measures in the Act include:</p>

However, a one-off snapshot survey of the uptake of antisocial behaviour powers was carried out in September 2004 and published in October 2004 in the Together&quot; One- Year On report. This survey of antisocial behaviour co-ordinators in Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships provided an estimate of use of powers over a 12-month period. The results of the survey, based on responses from 239 antisocial behaviour co-ordinators, found that:</p>

A National Offender Manager and 10 Regional Offender Managers are now in place.

A redesign of NOMS headquarters, to reflect these changes, will be in place by <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>.</p>

The Bill will also implement key Carter proposals to rebalance sentencing by making provision for a 'day fines' scheme, reinforcing rigorous and effective community punishments and by targeting resources on the most serious, dangerous and persistent offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1524W.0/2">We do not hold data on the information requested. We hold data on the average cost to the applicant authority of obtaining an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO). The Campbell Review, published in 2002, provides the latest data on the cost of obtaining an ASBO. It quoted an average cost of &pound;4,800 for an ASBO but this figure was based on a small sample of orders in the early period of their introduction and was skewed by one abnormally complicated and unrepresentative expensive application. Practitioners advise that applications usually cost much less than this and that costs decrease with experience of using the orders. New research, due to be published shortly, shows that costs have reduced significantly since the Campbell Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524W.0/3">Injunctions are civil orders taken out by landlords or local authorities. We do not hold information on the average cost of an injunction or eviction.</p>

	<p pid="a.1530W.5/1">Supportive parents are vitally important in achieving and maintaining good behaviour in schools. We want parents to be prepared to support the behaviour policy in their child's school, and to take responsibility for their child's behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/2">A Pastoral Support Programme is an option schools may use to help pupils to improve their behaviour. Parents of disruptive pupils are involved in the setting up and operation of individual Pastoral Support Programmes for those pupils. The teacher responsible for arranging the programme will discuss with the parents and an LEA representative the causes of concern and what is required of the pupil to put the situation right. Parents should be informed regularly about their child's progress. In some cases, a managed move to another school may be appropriate and parental agreement would be required for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/3">When a pupil is reintegrated back into school following a fixed period exclusion, the parents will normally be invited to a reintegration meeting; this provides an opportunity to discuss how best the pupil can return to school and any behavioural problems can be addressed. Where a pupil has been permanently excluded, LEAs should involve parents at an early stage in making arrangements for continuing the child's education and in discussions about alternative school places. LEAs may, through a parenting contract, offer additional help to parents in this situation such as a resource room or parenting skills training.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/4">For some parents, managing their children's behaviour is not easy, and there is help available to help parents do this more effectively. We are encouraging schools and local authorities to engage more with parents, especially at an early stage, in guiding them towards these sources of help when their children persistently misbehave in school, using the parenting contracts that we have introduced as a framework for such agreements. Where parents are unwilling to engage then it is right that we take action to ensure that they do&mdash;through parenting orders administered by the courts.</p>

These figures are detailed in Table 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534W.2/2">The survey highlights that 5 per cent. of London respondents were classified at Entry Level 1, 2 per cent. at Entry Level 2 and 12 per cent. at Entry Level 3 for literacy (Entry level 3 or below compares to below GCSE grade G). The Entry Level 3 or below figure for England as a whole is 16 per cent. or 5.2 million people. A further 34 per cent. of respondents were at Level 1 (considered equivalent to GCSE grades D-G).</p>
	<p pid="a.1534W.2/3">The survey maps skill levels to the National Standards for Adult Literacy and Numeracy. A copy of the survey report is on the DfES website: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk">www.dfes.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="a.1548W.2/17">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has two principal all staff in-house magazines: News&amp;Views&quot; and Connect&quot;. They each have a circulation of 16,000. There are also magazines produced for Consular and FCO Services staff which have a circulation of over 1,000 and where budgets are held centrally. These figures are included in the totals. There are other in-house magazines at Posts and in Directorates, but these figures could not be produced without incurring disproportionate cost as budgets are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1548W.2/18">The rise in spending between 2000 and 2001 is due to News&amp;Views&quot; magazine ceasing to be produced solely in-house and being contracted out to a professional corporate communications agency, and to the introduction of a quarterly policy-focused publication for managers: Connect&quot;. Figures for 2003&ndash;04 include the contracting out of the editorial function on News&amp;Views&quot;. This has now been brought back in-house and the two magazines are being combined so costs for 2004&ndash;05 will fall.</p>

	<p pid="a.1557W.0/1">The UK was heavily involved in the Prodi Commission's work to modernise the Institutions of the EU, including the negotiations that culminated in reform of the EC Staff Regulations. The policy reform introduced a new careers structure, rules governing the field of professional and ethical standards, and modernised rules regarding external mobility, middle management conditions and salaries and pensions structures. The UK will continue to participate in Working Groups looking at institutional issues such as these during the Barroso Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1559W.0/1">Benefit recipients may, at their request, have benefits paid into a Credit Union account. This is a change of approach by the Department, which until recently advised benefit recipients against payment of benefits direct into any Credit Union.

	<p pid="a.1559W.0/2">The agreement covers all Credit Unions in England, Scotland and Wales reflecting that all such unions are regulated by the Financial Services Authority and can hold money on behalf of others.</p>

Since that document was published the Bill, which is currently before the House of Lords, has been revised to take account of the pre-legislative scrutiny process. In line with our timetable for implementing the Bill's provisions that would generally require the support of a Code of Practice, the intention is that the extension of the DDA to cover qualifications bodies offering general qualifications, which is a provision added since scrutiny, would come into force in December 2006.</p>

Local authorities provide quarterly statistical returns to the Department. These statistics show that new claims were processed, on average 12 days quicker in 2003&ndash;04 than in 2001&ndash;02. The second quarter of 2004&ndash;05 shows further improvements, with the average number of days to process new claims reducing from 50 days to 47 when compared to the same quarter of 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid="a.1564W.2/1">Our intention is to replace incapacity benefits for new claimants to ensure people with health conditions and disabilities are helped to prepare for a return to the labour market wherever feasible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564W.2/2">As part of this new regime claimants of the rehabilitation support allowance will be required to participate in work-focused interviews and take steps to prepare for a return to work. Fulfilling both these requirements would mean claimants receiving a level of benefit payment higher than the current long-term rate of contributory incapacity benefit. People on the disability and sickness allowance would also receive a level of benefit payment higher than the current long-term rate but this will not be dependent on them taking steps to prepare for a return to work.</p>

The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years. FES figures are single calendar years from 1979&ndash;87, two combined calendar years from 1998&ndash;89 to 1992&ndash;93 and two financial years combined from 1993&ndash;94 to 1995&ndash;96.

	<p pid="a.1569W.2/1">Payments to beneficiaries of the Thalidomide Trust are treated in the same way as other personal injury payments for income-related benefits, including income support. Capital that is placed in trust for an individual can be disregarded. Income from an individual's trust can also be disregarded as long as the income is used for items other than food, ordinary clothing or footwear, household fuel, rent or rates, certain housing costs or water charges other than day-to-day living expenses.

	<p pid="a.1592W.2/1">The Treasury's estimate that about &euro;185 million, or 0.2 per cent. of the EC budget in 2003, was spent fraudulently, is derived from previous assessments by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of the likely percentage of fraud within irregularities reported by member states. In response to pressure from the UK and other member states, OLAF's Intelligence Directorate is now beginning to work on a more accurate analysis of how much of the irregularities reported is actual fraud. We welcome and encourage this work, as we believe it is unacceptable that OLAF cannot publish an accurate figure for the amount of fraud against the Community budget. We also need this figure to assess the impact and effectiveness of anti-fraud measures taken to date, and to consider what additional measures should be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1598W.2/15">Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598W.2/16">This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &pound;2,500, disregarding the first &pound;2,500 of any risk. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598W.2/17">As a result of the Government's reforms, almost half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children.</p>

	<p pid="a.1604W.7/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department's aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities of the citizen, and to modernise the law and constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604W.7/2">Currently, the Department has six strategic objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has seven Public Service Agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604W.7/3">Examples of the activity in 2004 to deliver these objectives include work with partners to make sure criminal trials are more efficient with the numbers of ineffective Crown Court trials falling from 24 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 to 16 per cent. in September 2004. The rate has reduced from 31 per cent. to 25 per cent. for the same period in the magistrates' courts. The Department has also been involved in work to help people resolve their disputes in the most effective way, including pilots to test the effectiveness of court-based mediation. During 2004 there was a reduction from almost 49 per cent. to 41 per cent. in those cases that had eventually to be resolved by a hearing. Another area where pilots were used successfully was for all postal voting in four regions of England at the combined European and local elections in June 2004. Voter turnout doubled in the pilot regions compared with 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604W.7/4">The range of the Department's policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to all of that activity is not collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost. However, statistical information about the Department's activities can be found at: <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm</a> as well as at <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk">www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604W.7/5">An example of the information available on those sites is data on persistent young offenders. The average number of days from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced between August and October 2004 was 59 days in the Lancashire criminal justice area, which covers the constituency of Burnley. This compares with 124 days in the Lancashire criminal justice area in the 1997 calendar year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1605W.5/2">The downward trend in sitting hours in the county court since 2001 reflects the increased use of judicial case management. Greater access to alternative dispute resolution continues to have an effect on the number of cases that reach a settlement, which in turn has impacted on the level of court sitting hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605W.5/3">The number of sitting hours in the Crown court has gone up, as the sitting plan has been increased year on year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1605W.5/4">The historical sitting hours for magistrates courts show a gradual increase in the number of hours sat for criminal proceedings, although overall hours are subject to seasonal variation. Civil and other court user hours have remained relatively stable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1607W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">pursuant to the reply, <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-27">27 January 2005</phrase>, Official Report, c.459W</p>
	<p pid="a.1607W.2/2">The Government published 'Parental Separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities, Next Steps' on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase>, which sets out plans to implement a range of measures to help separating parents in dispute about future parenting arrangements, reach agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1607W.2/3">The Government's plans include improvements in the information available to parents and greater use of methods such as the Collaborative Law Model, Mediation, In-Court Conciliation and the Family Resolutions Pilot Project. The Government intends strongly to promote these methods as better ways to reach agreement than through contested court hearings. All publicly funded clients will have to show that they have considered mediation. Lawyers undertaking collaborative law work in the proposed pilot will be publicly funded, if their clients are eligible. Those same lawyers would not be funded by legal aid for any subsequent litigation if an out of court settlement is not reached under the Collaborative Law Scheme and the case proceeded to court. New lawyers would need to be instructed for the court proceedings and they would be funded separately, subject to their clients' eligibility. In addition, the Government, Senior Judiciary and Rules Committee plan to review court rules and practice directions so that the strongest possible encouragement is given to parties to participate in forms of dispute resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1607W.2/4">We do not plan to make these schemes compulsory in every case, as an essential part of the process is that people come to them voluntarily and are therefore willing to participate. Further, in some cases, including those where domestic violence has been an issue, it would not always be appropriate to impose mediation on separating parents.</p>

The extra funding met the Government's commitment in the NHS Cancer Plan 2000 and represents a significant increase in national health service funding of about 40 per cent. over 2000 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1612W.0/2">Reports on the use of the additional &pound;50 million in 2003&ndash;04 have been received from 32 of the 34 cancer networks. The remaining two networks received their allocations later than the others and were not included in this information collection exercise. The 32 networks received a total of &pound;45.8 million and spent &pound;38.4 million of this amount in-year on specialist palliative care. Because of a lack of suitable staff to fill posts within the first year of the budget, &pound;7.4 million has been carried forward for use in future years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1612W.0/4">To date, the allocation has funded 28 new whole-time equivalent (WTE) consultants in palliative medicine, 133 new WTE clinical nurse specialists and the opening of 38 new SPC beds.</p>

The NHS is currently receiving the largest sustained increase in funding in its history, growth money not identified for specific purposes. PCTs will be able to use these extra resources to deliver on both national and local priorities, including, as they determine, palliative care. There are no restrictions on the levels of funding possible for hospices. It is for individual hospices to negotiate funding with their PCT.</p>

	<p pid="a.1621W.0/14">Milk tokens are distributed to eligible households the week before expiry date of the previous four-weekly mail out. This ensures that claimants always receive thetokens before the first Monday of week one of the four-week cycle. Claimants who notify non-receipt of tokens are offered the option to have tokens re-issued or to be sent to a new address if they have recently moved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.0/15">Claimants can request information about milk tokens by phone, letter or e-mail and all the contact details are on the letter they receive with the milk tokens. The helpline is supported by trained operators from 9.30 am to 5.30 pm Monday to Friday. An out-of-hours message also provides a number of options to provide claimants with guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.0/16">The helpline offers claimants a number of message options for milk token guidance. This has consistently provided the relevant guidance for 70 per cent. of callers since it was established in April 2003. The remaining 30 per cent. select the option to speak to a trained operator. The combination of automated message and operator option provides a cost-effective solution as well as giving beneficiaries immediate access to answers to frequently asked questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.0/17">Since April 2003, the helpline received 385,387 calls. Of these 102,618 claimants selected the option to speak to an operator. Between <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-13">13 December 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-22">22 January 2005</phrase>, the helpline received 61,216 calls and 18,407 claimants selected the option to speak to an operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.0/18">Since the TDU assumed responsibility for the distribution of milk tokens to income support and jobseekers allowance there has been a large rise in the volume of calls. To help manage this increase, the TDU has installed a new system and has increased the number of trained helpline staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.0/19">The front-end out-of-hours message provides claimants with details of the date on which the TDU will receive the latest set of instructions from the Inland Revenue and Department of Work and Pensions, as well as the date on which they should expect to receive their next set of milk tokens. This message is changed every four weeks. The message about the previous token mail out is kept on the system for two weeks so that claimants who have not received tokens know that they should ask for their tokens to be reissued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.0/20">Although the helpline was originally designed for inbound calls only helpline staff have, since November 2004 when the TDU took over responsibility for distribution of tokens to income support and income based jobseeker allowance beneficiaries, been increasingly making outbound calls in order to contact local benefit offices on behalf of claimants to help resolve milk token entitlement queries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.0/21">The incorrect message on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-22">22 January</phrase>, giving guidance about tokens until <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December</phrase>, was due to a systems error and this has now been corrected. Daily checks are now made by the TDU to ensure that all messages provide the claimant with current information.</p>
