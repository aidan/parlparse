	<p pid="c.6W.3/1">Eligibility for employment and support allowance is assessed using the work capability assessment. The work capability assessment focuses on the functional effects of an individual's condition on their physical and mental capabilities, rather than on the condition itself. The criteria are set out in Parts 5, 6 and Schedules 2 and 3 of the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 (SI 2008 No. 794).</p>
	<p pid="c.6W.3/2">It is important that we move away from previous practices of parking people on this benefit, so anyone getting employment and support allowance will have a new assessment if and when their individual circumstances and functional abilities are expected to have changed. If at this point the decision-maker determines that they no longer meet the eligibility criteria, they will be found fit for work.</p>

All dairy cattle, in whatever system they are kept, are protected by comprehensive animal welfare legislation in England. It is important to recognise that poor welfare can occur in both intensive and extensive systems, and the most significant influence on the welfare of livestock is the stock-keeper, not the system in which it is reared.</p>

Recently passed election laws and existing security provisions place severe restrictions on campaigning and participation in the process. Over 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, remain under detention, and arbitrary arrests continue. The regime has rejected offers of international election observers. In such circumstances, elections will not have legitimacy or international credibility. Tensions between the military Government and Burma's ethnic ceasefire groups have also increased, as they resist the regime's attempt to absorb their armed wings into the Burmese army.</p>

	<p pid="c.22W.3/1">Since his appointment, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not received reports about China's one child policy, and has not had any discussions with the Chinese Government about it. We are concerned about the implementation of China's Population and Family Planning Law. This issue was last raised in detail under the previous Government with the Chinese authorities at the 16th round of the UK/China Human Rights Dialogue in January 2008. We do not dispute China's right or need to implement family planning policies but we do believe they should be based on principles of consent.</p>

This urged all UN member states to be especially alert to further violations, in particular to exercise enhanced vigilance over all Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines activity, including subjecting its cargo to enhanced scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="c.28W.2/1">Insecurity in Sudan is of serious concern and continues to have a devastating impact on the lives of many Sudanese across the country. The UK continues to support work towards the peaceful implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and an inclusive and lasting settlement in Darfur which is essential for long-term peace in Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="c.28W.2/2">In Darfur security has deteriorated considerably in the past few months, including the resumption of fighting between Government forces and Darfuri movements, intertribal conflict, attacks on peacekeepers and humanitarian workers and civil unrest in North Darfur. The fighting in Eastern Jebel Mara, and around Jebel Moon, is particularly worrying, with potentially severe humanitarian consequences for the civilian population. We continue to urge all sides to immediately cease hostilities and to allow humanitarian access.</p>
	<p pid="c.28W.2/3">We are also concerned by the situation in South Sudan. In 2009 over 390,000 people were forced from their homes and 2,500 were killed, a trend that has continued in 2010. Current insecurity in Jonglei and Unity states are particularly worrying. We continue to urge the Government of South Sudan and the United Nations Mission in Sudan to respond proactively to and reduce the risks of violent clashes. We are also working to improve the capacity of the Government of South Sudan to respond to and reduce insecurity.</p>

	<p pid="c.34W.5/3" class="indent">Installing average speed cameras on the southbound carriageway between A282 junction 31 and the Toll Plaza.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.5/4" class="indent">Installing average speed cameras on the northbound carriageway between M25 junction 2 and A282 junction 1a.</p>

	<p pid="c.37W.5/3" class="indent">Local authority grants<i> -</i>A &#163;309 million reduction in the Department's specific grants to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.5/4" class="indent">Transport for London<i> -</i>I am consulting with the Mayor on a proposed &#163;108 million reduction in the Department's grant to Transport for London.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.5/5" class="indent">Network Rail will reduce spend by &#163;100 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.5/6">The Department is also making &#163;112 million savings in its direct expenditure through a range of measures including a recruitment freeze, reduction in discretionary spend, and re-negotiation of contracts with major suppliers to reduce their cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.5/7">It has also been necessary to defer &#163;54 million that would have been spent on a small number of lower priority rolling stock and highway improvement schemes.</p>

	<p pid="c.38W.14/1">Network Rail is responsible for delivering the majority of investment in rail infrastructure across the UK rail network. The High Level Output Specification (HLOS) developed by the Department for Transport that formed the basis on which Network Rail's income was set by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) for the current regulatory control period (CP4) in 2008. This specifies a number of investments in the north-west of England that are designed to improve services in the region. These include extra capacity in Manchester and Liverpool, longer trains on the West Coast Main Line and improvements in operational performance for regional services. There are also other improvements to the rail network that are being undertaken outside of the north-west that will deliver benefits to the region.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.14/2">Full details of how Network Rail propose to deliver these are set out in their business plan which is available on their website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.14/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk">www.networkrail.co.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="c.38W.14/4">That said, Government funding for the railway is not allocated on a regional basis. It is for Network Rail to deliver their obligations to individual regions as set out in the HLOS within the funds that have been made available to them by the ORR. The sources of these funds come from train operators and direct grants from the Government. Full details of the funding allocation are set out in the ORR's income determination for CP4. Copies of this document are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.43W.2/1">It is for schools to decide the most appropriate range of courses and qualifications to offer to their students. There is no evidence that academies are concentrating resources on vocational courses instead of academic courses. The latest examination results for 2009 show that academies have seen a 5.0 percentage point increase in the proportion of pupils achieving at least five GCSEs at A*-C including English and maths (for those academies with results in 2008 and 2009), double the average national increase of 2.5 percentage points.</p>

	<p pid="c.77W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck:</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking on what occasions the Office for National Statistics received representations on the cost to the public purse of nuclear decommissioning as a proportion of net public sector (a) borrowing and (b) debt in each of the last two years; from whom each such representation was received. (1195)</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/4" class="indent">ONS produces the United Kingdom's National Accounts. The National Accounts are an internationally comparable accounting framework that describes the activities in a national economy, including the transactions that take place between sectors of that economy. The relevant international manuals are the System of National Accounts 1993(SNA93) and the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95) in particular.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/5" class="indent">As part of the process of producing the National Accounts, ONS decides on the classification of institutions and transactions within the economy. This well-established process is published on the ONS website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/national_statistics/cop/downloads/NAclassification.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/national_statistics/cop/downloads/NAclassification.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/7" class="indent">Over recent years, ONS has investigated the classification of a number of bodies related to the Nuclear Industry, and have classified the major bodies related to the decommissioning process-The Nuclear Decommissioning Agency (NDA), the Nuclear Generation Decommissioning Fund Ltd (NGDF) and its successor body the Nuclear Liabilities Fund Trust Company (NLF) as public sector bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/8" class="indent">This will mean the costs of decommissioning borne by these bodies will be recorded within the public sector accounts. The cost of future decommissioning is a contingent liability and as such is outside the definitions of public sector net debt. Under current decommissioning arrangements, the expenditure on actual decommissioning will impact on public sector net borrowing at the time it occurs.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/9" class="indent">These classification decisions were taken during 2007 in the case of the NDA, and during 2003/4 in the case of the NGDF and NLF.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.6/10" class="indent">The decisions were taken independently by ONS and approved by the National Accounts Classification Committee (or its predecessor the Public Sector Classifications Committee). ONS has received no representations in the last two years on this subject.</p>
