	<p pid="a.1W.3/2">Currently, lap dancing clubs are required to obtain a premises licence or club premises certificate for regulated entertainment and the licensing authority will consider such applications in accordance with its powers to control and regulate such clubs under the Licensing Act 2003. The Government do not collect specific information on decisions taken by licensing authorities relating to applications for lap dancing clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/3">On the <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-18">18 June 2008</phrase> the Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport wrote to chief executives of local authorities on the subject of lap dancing clubs to seek their views on whether they considered their powers under the Licensing Act 2003 were sufficient to regulate and control the opening of lap dancing in their area. This attracted 117 responses, the majority of which felt that additional legislation should be introduced to provide controls which are specific to lap dancing and similar premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/4">In response, the Government have included provisions in the Policing and Crime Bill to reclassify lap dancing clubs as sex encounter venues under Schedule 3 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. This will give local authorities more powers to control the number and location of lap dancing clubs. It will also allow them to consider their obligations under the Gender Equality Duty when determining new applications if appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.7W.11/1">There are 110 published target areas for the Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) scheme in England. These are based upon data and evidence and show the areas where the scheme is best able to deliver the environmental outcomes that it was designed to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.11/2">The reason behind the apparent anomaly between the East of England target area statements and those in other regions, is that the East of England contains several target areas which include significant areas of arable land that support populations of rare invertebrates. Therefore there is specific reference to these within the target area statements. In most other regions the majority of arable land, and the rare invertebrates that depend upon it, are found outside the target areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.11/3">Outside of target areas HLS can still be very important so each region has identified themes to address HLS priorities. The supporting regional theme statements give detail on these priorities and, in regions where rare invertebrates are present, these are specifically mentioned as qualifying features.</p>

	<p pid="a.8W.2/1">Determining whether or not a species has become extinct is not an easy task. The approach taken in the UK can be summarised by reference to the guidance drawn up by the IUCN(2001):</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.2/2" class="indent">Extinct (ex). A taxon is extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. A taxon is presumed extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.2/3">The default time frame used in the UK to determine when a species has become extinct, is when there has been no record of the species in the last 50 years. Occasionally, for very well-recorded species, a shorter time frame is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.12W.3/2">On insurance, a road side survey (Operation V79) was carried out by the Department in March 2008. 6,689 vehicles were stopped at random by police and checked for compliance with driver and vehicle licensing regulations. The recorded level of uninsured drivers from this survey was 1.2 per cent. However, comparison of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's vehicle register and motor insurance database suggests the total figure of uninsured driving is likely to be higher. In 2005, a comparison of the two databases estimated that about 2.1 million licensed vehicles were being driven by uninsured drivers. The comparison looks at all vehicle keepers and motor insurance policies and does not rely on vehicles being spotted in use on the road. Further work continues on a more recent comparison of the two databases and is undergoing validity checks by departmental statisticians.</p>

	<p pid="a.20W.9/1">The most recent nutritional assessment in Zimbabwe was conducted by UNICEF in November 2008. This highlighted the seriousness of the situation and the clear need for food aid. It also showed that there is considerable resilience in the Zimbabwe population. The proportion of children under age five who are underweight was estimated at 17 per cent., a rate that has not changed since 2003; while chronic malnutrition has slightly declined by 2 per cent. to 27 per cent. The number of acutely malnourished children is increasing but at 4.8 per cent. remains below internationally recognised emergency levels (10 per cent.) across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.9/2">There are several important reasons for this resilience, notably the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.9/3" class="indent">Many Zimbabwean households receive remittances from household members working abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.9/4" class="indent">There is a culture of children eating available food first while as many as a third of adults will go with one or fewer meals in a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.9/5" class="indent">A high contraceptive prevalence rate has led to smaller family sizes.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.9/6">The main reason, however, for malnutrition levels being less high than might be expected is likely to be the enormous food aid programme that has fed seven million people in February. A sustained feeding programme will be needed through the next growing season in order to ensure nutritional status is protected and even improved.</p>

	<p pid="a.21W.2/1">UN figures suggest that seven million people will have received food aid in Zimbabwe by February 2009. The next harvest&mdash;which will be collected in April&mdash;is likely to be slightly better for those who managed to plant seeds. However, as a result of an NGO ban during the election period last year, distribution of agricultural inputs was delayed and some people were unable to access the fertiliser they needed for a good crop. While an accurate estimate of the harvest will be done in March, early projections suggest a similar scale of food insecurity is anticipated in 2009-10 with a peak before next year's harvest.</p>
	<p pid="a.21W.2/2">The NGO ban and the failure of the Government of Zimbabwe to import their agreed quota of food have made this a particularly challenging situation. The international community has shown considerable flexibility in ensuring that the basic food needs of the people of Zimbabwe are largely being met but more support will continue to be needed next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.22W.8/1">DCMS continues to take significant steps towards reducing administrative burdens arising from its legislation. The latest simplification plan, the third one produced by DCMS, sets out progress to date and details of the forthcoming measures that will be implemented during 2009. Details can be found at the following web address:</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Simplification_Plan_2008.pdf">http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Simplification_Plan_2008.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.22W.8/3">DCMS has exceeded its baseline target to deliver a 43 per cent. reduction in administrative burdens. This has been achieved in large part by the changes to the regulatory regimes under the Licensing Act 2003 and the Gambling Act 2005 which consolidated a number of separate pieces of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.8/4">With the assistance of an expert panel last year, DCMS carried out a costing exercise of the Gambling Act 2005 using the standard cost model. This was a commitment from the previous plan and looked at the administrative costs of the previous regime compared with the new one established under the Act. It found that the administrative burden of the 2005 Act stands at &pound;17.4 million annually which is a reduction from the baseline of the previous regime which was estimated by PricewaterhouseCoopers to be &pound;74 million annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.8/5">In respect of the Licensing Act 2003, the savings to the industry from reduced administrative burdens, validated by an expert panel including industry representatives, is about &pound;99 million annually against a baseline established by PricewaterhouseCoopers in May 2005. The 2003 Licensing Act came into full operation in November 2005 and aggregate savings since then exceed &pound;300 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.23W.2/1">Entrance to the museums listed is free, with the exception of the Tate St Ives. Services offered by the museums are often free or where charges are made, they have fully reflected the reduction in VAT. Exceptions to this, where the museums have handled the rate change in VAT in different ways are summarised in the following list. The remainder of the museums have either fully passed on the reduction or either do not offer or charge for guided tours.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/2" class="italic"> 1. Victoria and Albert Museum</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/3">The museum consolidated the VAT reduction for paying exhibitions into the ticket groups which it is believes will benefit the most. These are the concession rates for students, the unemployed and 12-17 year olds. Audio guides are supplied under contract by an external company, who have not reduced the unit price.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/4" class="italic"> 2. Tate</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/5">The Tate has not reduced charges for guided tours where a fee is incurred, as all guided tours are pre-booked. As a result the tours have been previously advertised and invoiced at the pre-VAT reduction price. The cost of changing this negated any reduction that might have been passed on. However, tour prices which would normally have increased in January 2009, were held at 2008 prices. The gallery's audio guides are supplied under contract by an external company, who have not reduced the unit price.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/6" class="italic"> 3. National Maritime Museum</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/7">The only current admissions charge is for the Peter Harrison Planetarium, where no adjustment has been made for the reduction in VAT as the effect on price was considered too small. The museum decided instead to freeze Planetarium ticket prices for next year. During the most recent paying exhibition, the museum experimented with audio guide pricing and prices were varied on a number of occasions. Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-11">11 January 2009</phrase> the audio guides have been free of charge. Prior to this, where charges were made at varying rates, the price was not adjusted to reflect the reduction in VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/8" class="italic"> 4. National Museum of Science and Industry (NMSI)</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/9">The museum has applied the VAT reduction to entry charges over &pound;10.00. This includes special exhibitions and IMAX. audio guides are only available at one of the NMSI's branches, the National Railway Museum, where no adjustment was made for the reduction in VAT as the charge for these are under &pound;10.00.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/10" class="italic"> 5. National Gallery</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/11">Prices for paying exhibitions have not been reduced as a result of the reduction in VAT. The price reduction was considered not material and would have produced an unwieldy pricing structure. Instead ticket prices are being held without increase throughout 2009. Guided tours, which are part of the gallery's education programme are exempt from VAT. Audio guides for the main collection are by voluntary donation. A charge is made for audio guides for temporary exhibitions which has not been reduced as a result of the reduction in VAT. The first guide produced following the VAT reduction was an improved product with increased production costs which were not passed on to the public as the charge was held at previous levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/12" class="italic"> 6. Geffrye Museum</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.2/13">Guided tours and audio guides are charged at a nominal rate and prices have not been reduced as a result of the reduction in VAT, as the effect on price is considered too small.</p>

	<p pid="a.27W.3/1">The Education Service produces a range of materials about Parliament, the work of Members (of both Houses), and political literacy generally. All resources are provided free to schools. While many of the materials are suitable for use by individual pupils, they are primarily used in the classroom. One publication targeted at pupils directly is the young person's guide entitled &quot;The Houses of Parliament&quot;, which is distributed to all school-aged visitors taking a tour of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.27W.3/2">Teaching resources currently in print include a range of different booklets targeted at pupils from Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 5 (covering ages seven to 18). There is also a set of four films on DVD, including the award-winning &quot;Democracy? You Decide&quot; and &quot;You've Got the Power&quot;. The latter has just been updated and is available with a teacher's booklet for three age groups. It is also being made available on Parliament's You Tube channel</p>

This provides a variety of resources which can be used online and also downloaded, including all the printed publications together with information pages, lesson plans, films, virtual tours of Parliament, games and activities, and podcasts. Users can also subscribe to a monthly electronic newsletter. The Education Service will provide materials on request to Members to support their work with schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.27W.3/7">Plans for the next financial year include the provision of a new set of printed publications to replace and consolidate the existing booklets which have been in use for a number of years. The new publications are being designed to support more directly the citizenship and politics curricula. New content is also being commissioned for the website, including interactive games. There are also plans to replace the films and other content following the next general election.</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.0/1">The review of council housing finance and rents policy is a joint review between HM Treasury and the Department of Communities and Local Government. It was launched by Ministers in March 2008 and the terms of reference were agreed with stakeholders at that event.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.0/2">The full text of the terms of reference is available on the CLG website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.0/6" class="indent">To inform the annual HRA subsidy determinations in the remaining two years of the current spending period;</p>

This change falls within the assumed error margin, and the overall assumptions originally made about the cost and size of the IPC and its Secretariat remain valid, and are the best current estimate of size and cost.&quot;</p>

That power does not extend to attaching a condition relating to the compliance by the licence holder of the provisions in the Mobile Homes Act 1983.

	<p pid="a.38W.12/1">In the White Paper, &quot;Raising Expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future&quot; (Cm 7506, published in December 2008), we said that the next natural step towards a simplified benefit system should be the abolition of income support which would take us to a dual-benefits system based around jobseeker's allowance and employment and support allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.12/2">Provisions to enable this are included in the current Welfare Reform Bill. Subject to the passage of this legislation and as resources allow, we will consider further the timeframe for taking forward income support abolition.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.12/3">There are currently around 460,000 lone parents on income support with a youngest child aged less than seven, around 230,000 with a youngest child aged nought to two, and around 230,000 with a youngest child aged three to six. We are unable to predict accurately how many lone parents may move from income support to jobseeker's allowance when income support is abolished. Even in the case when income support is abolished there are no plans to require single parents with children under 7 to take up employment, even if they are receiving jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.12/4">As a result of the provisions of the Social Security (Lone Parents and Miscellaneous) Regulations 2008, lone parents with a child aged seven or over will no longer be able to claim income support solely on the grounds of being a lone parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.12/5">Based on internal analysis carried out for departmental planning purposes, it has been estimated that around 45 per cent. of lone parents with older children moved off income support as part of these changes will make a claim for jobseeker's allowance. Others may apply for appropriate benefits such as employment and support allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.12/6">The following table shows the number of lone parents with older children on income support who we expect to apply for jobseeker's allowance in each quarter to May 2011.</p>

We have evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of the equipment and armaments used by insurgents against our forces in Iraq was of Iranian origin, or had been transited through Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.2/2">As Iraq's neighbour Iran should have an important role in helping to build a stable and secure Iraq, but instead Iran is undermining stability by supplying weapons, funding and training to militia groups and through political interference and bribery. This action only serves to undermine security in Iraq and should not be tolerated. Both the Government and the Iraqi government have raised Iranian interference in Iraq with the Iranian authorities on many occasions. We and the Government of Iraq will continue to send strong messages that it is not in Iran's interest to destabilise southern Iraq.</p>

The centres were set up last year with the final advice centre opening in December 2008. The regional advice centres provide a one-stop shop offering consumers a range of free and impartial advice on how to reduce their carbon footprint including energy efficiency, microgeneration and renewable energy, low carbon transport, water efficiency and waste reduction and a range of independent services that will help them action that advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.58W.2/2">A number of Departments have already reported plans to install on-site generation technologies, some of which include microgeneration technologies. For example, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will be installing solar photovoltaic (PV) panels; the Department for International Development are undertaking two projects&mdash;a wind turbine and a biomass installation; the Department for Work and Pensions plan to install a wind turbine; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have plans for a biomass project and a wind turbine project; and HM Revenue and Customs plan a mixture of biomass and wind turbine projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.2/3">DECC also plans to consider options for microgeneration on its own estate, as part of a wider strategy to improve the energy efficiency and wider sustainability of the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.2/4">The current number of installations of onsite energy technologies is similar to that in 2007 when three Departments had renewable energy sources on-site. At that time, DEFRA generated 67MWhrs per year from solar thermal water heating. The Insolvency Service headquarters in London used a photovoltaic (PV) system which produces on average 9.1 kWhs a day and the MoD produced small amounts of renewable energy from off grid wind turbines/PV panels.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.2/5">There are 10 combined heat and power (CHP) schemes located on the Government estate registered with the Government's CHP quality assurance programme (CHPQA). In 2007-08 these 10 schemes produced just over 19 gigawatt hours of good quality CHP electricity. This represents around 0.1 per cent. of the 28,677 gigawatts electricity produced in total by good quality CHP plants in the UK in 2007. The Sustainable Development in Government (SDiG) report indicates that total CHP generated electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08 was 311 gigawatt hours. 19 gigawatt hours of good quality CHP electricity generated on the Government estate represents around 6 per cent. of the total CHP electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="a.63W.0/2"><i> </i>The fees charged by an insolvency practitioner reflect the necessary level of specialist knowledge that the insolvency practitioner has to have to be able to take effective action in a wide range of unusual and complex situations. This expertise takes time and training to acquire.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.0/3">The Insolvency Rules 1986 determine how the remuneration of an office holder (liquidator/administrator/trustee etc.) is to be fixed and provide that such remuneration shall be fixed by reference to the time properly given to the administration, or as a percentage of the assets which are realised and distributed. In most insolvency cases it is for the liquidation or creditors' committee to determine the basis for fixing the remuneration or, in the absence of such a committee, the creditors decide the matter. The Rules also make provision for the court to review the amount of remuneration charged.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.0/4">Statement of Insolvency Practice 9 provides regulatory guidance which insolvency practitioners must follow when seeking approval for their fees. Matters to be considered by the approving body (usually the creditors) include the effectiveness with which the insolvency practitioner has carried out his duties and the value and nature of the assets with which he has had to deal. In October 2004 the court issued a practice statement which provides guidance on matters that will be taken into account when the court is dealing with an application for review of remuneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.0/5">As the amount of remuneration is subject to review by the court my noble Friend the Secretary of State has no powers to investigate the amount of remuneration charged. I would therefore confirm that I have no plans to bring forward plans to limit or reduce the fees charged by insolvency practitioners, which are properly a matter for the creditors or the court.</p>

Therefore, the OFT does not usually confirm or deny whether it has received complaints about an individual or business unless it considers it is appropriate to do so in relation to a particular investigation.</p>

In March 2008 MBS and its directors provided undertakings to the OFT following complaints about the appearance of 'pop-up' notices demanding payment for membership of adult content websites on consumers' computers. MBS also advised the OFT at the time that Platte International Ltd. (UK) (&quot;Platte&quot;) would be taking over MBS so the OFT obtained identical undertakings from Platte.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.6/4">Platte has now informed the OFT that it would cease trading from <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-25">25 February 2009</phrase> and that Platte International Ltd.

The plan contains a series of actions to be taken by member states, the Commission, Europol and by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), with the ultimate aim of significantly reducing the prevalence of drug use among the population of the European Union and to reduce the social harm and health damage caused by the use of and trade in illicit drugs.</p>

The cost of entertainment provided in the course of furthering departmental business falls within this budget. There is, however, no departmental requirement to separately report expenditure on entertainment and therefore no separate budget for entertainment is held. The element of the &quot;Travel, Subsistence and Hospitality&quot; budget that relates to entertainment could be separately estimated only at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.18/2">All expenditure on entertainment is in line with the Ministry's internal Finance Policy Manual and its Gifts and Hospitality Policy, which set out mandatory guidance for all staff regarding the use of public funds.

	<p pid="a.86W.2/3">The Ministry of Justice also provides in-house one-to-one coaching on presentation skills.

	<p pid="a.86W.8/1">Drug rehabilitation requirements (DRRs) as an element of community orders came into force in April 2005, in effect replacing and building upon Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs).</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.8/2">A total unit cost of &pound;6,000 per order for DTTOs was calculated from the experience of the pilots run from 1998 to 2000. This was split into approximately &pound;2,000 for offender supervision/management costs and &pound;4,000 for treatment costs, with the latter paid into the Department of Health pooled treatment budget and the remainder met by probation areas from main funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.8/3">Significant regional variations in Drug (and Alcohol) Action Team (D(A)AT) commissioning practice and costs of treatment modalities have made it difficult to establish unit costs for DRRs since the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.8/4">The National Offender Management Service plans to undertake a piece of analysis, informed by work on treatment costs being undertaken by the National Treatment Agency, to establish more accurately the unit cost of a DRR.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.8/5">The most recent analysis of the drug rehabilitation requirements (DRRs) caseload was carried out at the end of 2007-08. At that time there were 10,519 DRRs and 187 Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) in force.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.8/6">The following table shows the number of starts, completions, orders where breach proceedings were instigated and revocation of orders for drug rehabilitation requirements (DRRs) or Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) in each of the last three financial years for which full information is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.8/7">The proportion of offenders successfully completing DTTOs/DRRs has risen significantly from 28 per cent. in 2003 to 43 per cent. in 2007-08. This is encouraging because we know from research that offenders who complete orders have significantly lower reconviction rates (53 per cent.) than those that don't (91 per cent.), although it is not possible to attribute this difference entirely to the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.87W.2/1">The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced a new, explicit requirement for electoral registration officers (EROs) to take all steps that are necessary for the purpose of complying with their duty to maintain the electoral registers. These steps, as set out in the legislation, include sending the canvass form more than once, making house to house inquiries in connection with the canvass, making contact by such other means as the ERO thinks appropriate with a person who does not have an entry in the register, and inspecting any record that the ERO is permitted by law to inspect.</p>

This manual is regularly updated and specifically deals with matters in relation to undertaking an annual canvass, the appointment of canvassers and the requirement to make house visits to non-responding households.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.2/1">The form to be used by Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) for the annual canvass must be that prescribed for the purpose of the canvass or a form to like effect, in accordance with section 10(4) of the Representation of the People Act 1983. The prescribed form is set out in Regulations, for example in England and Wales the form is set out in its entirety in the Schedule to the Representation of the People (Form of Canvass) (England and Wales) Regulations (SI 2006/1694).</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.2/2">The design of rolling registration forms is a matter for EROs: but such forms must contain the detailed information required by Regulation 26 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/341). The Electoral Commission has designed a form that EROs may use. Electors may register to vote by simply writing to their ERO enclosing the required declaration, information and their signature. This can help to speed up the registration process for electors and thus the Government have no current plan to prescribe a rolling registration form in legislation. However, we will consider the need for all electoral registration forms to be identically-worded and whether a rolling registration form should be prescribed, particularly in view of the Government' proposal to allow for the collection of personal identifiers on a voluntary basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.0/1">The Government's White Paper on Lords reform was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-14">14 July 2008</phrase> following cross-party talks. Building on the consensus established in the talks, the Government intend to develop detailed proposals to be put to the electorate as a manifesto commitment at the next general election. Legislation would then be possible in the next Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/2">The White Paper set out three possible models for managing the transition to a fully reformed Chamber. The timetable for completing the transition to a fully reformed second Chamber will be very much determined by which of these models is adopted.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.3/1">The LSC's overall objective on payments to legal service providers is to provide financial stability by paying them a regular sum&mdash;the standard monthly payment (SMP)&mdash;each month that matches their average claim value. The SMP is varied to take account of actual claims and aims to achieve 100 per cent. reconciliation balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.3/2">The current highest claim to payment ratio is for an outstanding balance of &pound;14,800 against an SMP of &pound;1,700. The SMP in this case has been based on the historic performance of the contract but there has been a particularly high claim received recently that has had an impact on the contract balance.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.6/1">The provider in question has both a civil and a criminal contract with the LSC, each of which is reconciled separately to ensure that the LSC's standard monthly payments (SMP) to the provider equate over time to the value of the claims made. At February 2009, the balance of the civil contract account was &pound;4,798 underpaid to the provider, but the balance of the criminal contract account was &pound;8,904 overpaid in the provider's favour. However, in order to assist the provider's particular circumstances, the LSC has agreed to consider the February 2009 claims as soon as they are available from the provider and to take appropriate steps to ensure prompt payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.2/1">The number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for rape against women, from 1998 to 2007 (latest available), by police force area, are shown in tables 1 and 2. The percentage of those proceeded against who were found guilty in England and Wales is shown in table 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.2/2">The figures given relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="a.99W.9/1">Financial advisers are regulated by the financial services authority (FSA) and it is for the FSA to determine whether or not any particular firm is meeting its regulatory obligations. Regarding investment advice to private investors, the FSA launched the retail distribution review over two years ago in order to address persistent problems in the retail investment market which may be undermining consumer confidence and the effective operation of competition. This included the effect of commission structures on the quality of investment advice. In November 2008, the FSA published a feedback statement setting out proposed changes in this area, including proposals that would require financial advisers to set their own charges, rather than product providers being able to determine how much the adviser firms receive through commission. Regarding public authorities, local authorities are responsible for their own investment decisions and guidance issued by Communities and Local Government requires them to produce an annual investment strategy which is approved by the full council.</p>

	<p pid="a.116W.5/1">The Department was informed by Novartis on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-23">23 February 2009</phrase> that <i> staphylococcus aureu</i><i> s</i> bacterial contamination had been found in samples of the solvent used in meningitis C vaccine. The material in question had not been distributed in the United Kingdom but came from the same manufactured batches that had been distributed in the UK. The Department reminded Novartis of its statutory responsibility to inform the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Novartis contacted the Defective Medicines Report Centre (DMRC) at MHRA on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-24">24 February</phrase> by telephone initially, then followed up with an e-mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.5/2">The MHRA issued a class 2 drug alert on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-25">25 February 2009</phrase>. The drug alert informed recipients of the issue and identified potentially affected batches.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.5/3">On the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-25">25 February 2009</phrase> a chief medical officer (CMO) message was sent via the central alert system (formerly known as the public health link) as a class 1, immediate action alert, for immediate cascade (within six hours) to relevant health professionals, including general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses, accident and emergency departments and community pharmacists. At the same time a pager message was also sent that evening to all recipients of the CMO message, instructing them to immediately cascade this information to all relevant health professionals. Local immunisation co-ordinators are direct recipients of CMO messages via the central alert system, and would have received the electronic alert that night.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.5/4">The Department's immunisation team separately contacted all primary care trusts immunisation co-ordinators on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-25">25 February</phrase> and informed them of the GP surgeries in their areas that had received the batches to be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.5/5">The MHRA has arranged for additional sterility tests to be carried out on the affected solvent batch in the UK. A total of 120 solvent samples will be tested. The MHRA is awaiting delivery of test samples. Sterility testing takes at least 14 days, so the date on which the tests are completed will depend on when the samples are put on test. The MHRA understands that Novartis are testing an additional 360 solvent samples. Novartis testing started on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February 2009</phrase> and will be completed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-13">13 March 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.119W.2/1">In November 2008, the Department set out the vision for developing quality indicators including outcomes of care, where available, and using them to improve the quality of services in the national health service in &quot;Measuring for Quality Improvement (MQI)&mdash;The Approach&quot;. A copy of this document has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/2">MQI aims to support measurement at every tier of the NHS from national to local clinical team level, making available measures that already exist, enabling data to be collected and analysed, and facilitating new indicator development.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/3">The Department is currently collating feedback on measurement requirements from a range of NHS and professional organisations and will shortly be publishing an 'assured menu' of available quality indicators for use at local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/4">Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are establishing quality observatories, which will be centres of expertise in analysing these quality indicators to support quality improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/5">The Department is also working with NHS trusts and SHAs to identify the appropriate measures to report in quality accounts, which all NHS trusts will be obliged to publish, beginning in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.122W.2/2">As for newer stem cell derived treatments, it is impossible to establish with any degree of accuracy when will become available on the NHS. There are still uncertainties about which stem cells work that will only be addressed by considerable amounts of laboratory and clinical research. As with earlier stem cell therapies, these newer stem cell therapies are likely to develop at varying rates and with varying efficiencies, depending on the disease and tissue involved. It is therefore impossible at this stage to assess the cost-benefit of newer stem cell derived treatments.</p>

	<p pid="a.122W.8/1">The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) requires a 14 per cent. reduction in the maximum working hours of doctors in training, from 56 to 48 from August 2009. This equates to the hours provided by around 4,000 doctors in training. Implementation can be through a range of measures, including additional medical workforce capacity at either junior or senior level, new ways of working so that non-medical staff can take up duties currently done by doctors in training or through service redesign such as implementing hospital at night working practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.8/2">The Department is making a total of &pound;310 million available by 2009-10 to support implementation in recurrent primary care trust (PCT) allocations. In 2008-09, &pound;110 million was included in the quantum of allocation funding in all PCTs receiving revenues growth of 5.5 per cent. In 2009-10, a further &pound;200 million has been included in PCT revenue allocations, of which &pound;150 million will flow through tariff income to trusts and the remaining &pound;50 million in PCT revenue allocations will be targeted to trusts according to strategic health authority direction to support trained doctor solutions, particularly in paediatrics and anaesthetics.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.8/3">The Department has estimated that the full cost of implementation could be around &pound;300 million per year. This calculation is based on an analysis of the difference in doctors being 100 per cent. compliant at 56 hours and 100 per cent. compliant at 48 hours, so includes a valuation of:</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.8/4" class="indent">difference in pay to existing doctors; and</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.8/5" class="indent">assessment of the value of hours lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.8/6">This level of detail information of the background analysis is not held centrally.</p>

Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/15">HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/16">Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.143W.2/1">Compliance with clinical guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) forms part of the developmental standards for the national health service and NHS organisations are expected to move towards their full implementation. The Department recognises the important contribution of the effective provision of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) and primary care trusts (PCTs) are obliged to provide funding for NICE-recommended cCBT packages where clinicians want to use them, however, the Department does not collect information on the uptake of cCBT.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/2">The core aim of the Departments Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme is to support the NHS to implement the NICE guidelines and deliver effective treatment for people with depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/3">The Government have provided substantial new funding to increase services over the next three years:</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/4" class="indent">&pound;33 million for 2008-09;</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/5" class="indent">a further &pound;70 million to a total of &pound;103 million in 2009-10; and</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/6" class="indent">a further &pound;70 million to a total of &pound;173 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/7">This funding will allow regional training programmes to deliver 3,600 newly trained therapists with an appropriate skill mix and supervision arrangements by 2010-11 and 900,000 people to access IAPT services.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/8">The core aim of the Department's IAPT programme is to support the NHS to implement the NICE guidelines and deliver effective treatment for people with depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/9">The NHS Operating Framework 2008-09 states that to prepare for the new IAPT services being available more widely in the future, all PCTs need to plan how they will implement a stepped-care psychological therapies service. The first step is to carry out a needs assessment of their local population and scope their state of readiness to deliver IAPT services in preparation for becoming an IAPT site in the future. Strategic health authorities have committed to supporting and monitoring all PCTs in improving their psychological therapy services through routine commissioning. However, it is not possible to identify the availability of specific treatments, as information of this nature is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.145W.14/1">The approach to deliver a summary care record (SCR) was defined by a taskforce that published its report in December 2006. A copy has been placed in the Library. This proposed the creation of the SCR from general practitioners' (GP) records uploaded from GP systems and stored on the 'spine' database. Expenditure to <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-28">28 February 2009</phrase> to achieve this has amounted to &pound;18.7 million.</p>

PSIS was one of the original elements of the spine development along with transaction and messaging services, clinical spine application services, security and access controls, personal demographics service and directory services that support, not only SCR but all other clinical information flows.

However, Cumbria PCT has developed its own campaign working with local stakeholders and media. In terms of media coverage, the PCT recently published an article in its in-house magazine promoting the issue, and advising readers on ways to minimise medicine wastage (featured in December 2008 issue). The PCT is also conducting a 'returned medicine' audit to establish what medicines are returned to community pharmacies and why. Linked to the nationally commissioned research, the university of York is helping analyse the results for Cumbria PCT and the findings are expected later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.159W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.6/2">Data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that between 1994 and 1998, the under-18 conception rate 'increased' by 12.0 per cent. In contrast, between 1998 and 2007 (the latest year for which data are available) the rate has fallen by 10.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.6/3">The guidance referred to in paragraph 5.29 of &quot;Healthy lives brighter futures: The strategy for children and young people's health&quot; is entitled &quot;Teenage Pregnancy Next Steps: Guidance for Local Authorities and Primary Care Trusts on Effective Delivery of Local Strategies&quot;. A copy of this guidance&mdash;issued in 2006&mdash;has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.6/4">This guidance was based on international evidence, as well as in-depth reviews in local areas that were carried out by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit and the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit, which identified factors that were evident in areas where rates had fallen, but were either absent or being delivered less intensively in similar areas where rates were static or increasing.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.6/5">The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy has always included action to support young people to resist pressure to engage in early sexual activity and to promote the benefits of delaying first sex, by giving them the knowledge and skills they need to make safe and healthy choices about sex and relationships. These messages are included in both the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy media campaign and the guidance to schools on sex and relationships education (SRE).</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.6/6">In contrast, there is no evidence that education that promotes abstinence until marriage is effective. Recent evidence from the United States shows that young people who pledged to abstain from sex until they were married had sexual behaviour in the next five years similar to that of teenagers who had not taken an abstinence pledge (&quot;Pediatrics&quot; 2009, doi:10.1542/peds.2009-0407). Teenagers who had pledged abstinence, and a matched control group who had not taken a pledge, did not differ in rates of premarital sex.</p>

	<p pid="a.164W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated March 2009:</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.9/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question asking how many people were in <i> (a)</i> full-time education and <i> (b)</i> retired from employment in (i) Hemel Hempstead and (ii) Hertfordshire, in each year since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.9/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles employment statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) and its predecessor the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions. Estimates are provided for the number of working age people (Female 16-59, Male 16-64) who stated they are full-time students. A full time student is defined as being at school, following a sandwich course or full time at university or college. Estimates are also provided for the number of people retired from employment, defined as those who are economically inactive and report their main reason for inactivity as being retired.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.9/5" class="indent">Table 1 shows the number of working age persons in full-time education resident in Hertfordshire in each year since 1997. The estimates from 1997 to 2004 are for the 12 month period ending February each year and taken from the annual LFS. Estimates for 2005 to 2008 are for the 12 month period ending March each year and taken from the APS. Estimates for July 2007 to June 2008 have also been provided, the most recent period for which estimates are available. Estimates are not shown for the Hemel Hempstead parliamentary constituency as they are based on small samples and are considered too unreliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.9/6" class="indent">Table 2 shows the number of people who are retired from employment resident in Hertfordshire and the Hemel Hempstead parliamentary constituency in each year since 1998. Estimates are provided for the 12 months ending in February from 1998, the earliest period for which estimates are available, to 2004, from annual LFS, and for the 12 months ending in March from 2005 to 2008, from APS. Estimates for July 2007 to June 2008 have also been provided, the most recent for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.9/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. A guide to the quality of the estimates is given in Table 1 and Table 2.</p>

The LM has a crucial role in defining local priorities and outcomes, and in working with the Director of Children's Services, to manage children's services. We will shortly issue revised statutory guidance to clarify the roles and responsibilities of both Lead Member and Director of Children's Services.</p>

	<p pid="a.201W.3/1">We have commissioned and will be running throughout 2009 several pilot projects in relation to special educational needs (SEN).</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.3/2">We have been funding the 'No to Failure' project since 2007 (2009 will be the last year of its funding) to trailblaze and evaluate the impact of specialist teaching for children with dyslexia, with three local authorities, and schools within their area, taking part in the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.3/3">We have been funding Dyslexia Action since 2008 to run Partnership for Literacy pilots until 2010. These pilots will provide a body of specialist knowledge in each school so they are better placed to meet the needs of children struggling in the bottom 10 per cent. of attainment, including those at risk of dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.3/4">The Lamb inquiry commissioned eight projects, to run over the 2008/09 school year. These will provide opportunities for local authorities to work with partners to explore ways of increasing parental confidence in the SEN assessment process.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.3/5">We also have pilot projects that have started or are due to start in 2009. We have commenced a pilot project to raise awareness and status of British Sign Language (BSL). This project started in January 2009 and will run until 2011; in addition to awareness raising one of the project's key objectives is to increase the BSL skill levels of the children's work force to meet the needs of pupil who use BSL.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.3/6">The 'Achievement for All' pilots are intended to improve outcomes and progress of children with SEN and disabled children. The pilots will begin in schools in September 2009 in 10 local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.3/7">We will start a pilot on improving the supply of curriculum materials for visually impaired and dyslexic pupils in spring 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.3/8">Additionally, the Department also runs a grant programme (the Children and Young People and Families Grant programme), which funds projects, and there are a number of funded pathfinders. We also run a number of general pilots that benefit children with SEN, for example the 'Making Good Progress' pilots.</p>

The Big Lottery Fund is able to report that 'myplace' projects have engaged thousands of young people across the country through a variety of methods including local youth parliaments, councils or neighbourhood forums; through open consultation events, surveys and focus groups; and through their attendance at existing projects. 'myplace' projects have also demonstrated that young people will continue to influence directly the ongoing management of the new facility. Proposed approaches include the use of youth forums, young people sitting directly on management committees, establishing shadow youth boards, appointing a young person as the project's assistant director and passing the governance of the whole project over to young people through the creation of a youth-led trust.</p>
