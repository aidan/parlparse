	<p pid="d.1069W.6/2">The current development phase is a joint project between the Directorate General for Transport and Energy in the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA). The Supervisory Board of the Galileo Joint Undertaking is established to ensure an adequate information flow and political control by member states of the implementation of the development phase.</p>
	<p pid="d.1069W.6/3">The Government are aware of the sensitive nature of some parts of Galileo. We continue to monitor the project closely. We have been careful to ensure that any agreements with partners in the programme that are not member states of the EU or ESA specifically exclude them from participation in all sensitive aspects.</p>
	<p pid="d.1069W.6/4">Individual member states of the ESA and EU participating in Galileo are responsible, under their own national and/or any international export control regimes&mdash;such as MCTR (Missile Technology Control Regime) and Wassenaar&mdash;of which they are signatories, for the control of strategic exports and should apply these rules to Galileo as required. For example, all EU countries follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports which prohibits export of military technology, including dual use technologies where a military end use is known or suspected, to non-EU states, including China, where this is inappropriate. An assessment of the risk of diversion to an undesirable end user or end use is a key criterion under the code. The UK Government assess Galileo technology proposed for transfer to non-EU states against these criteria.</p>

	<p pid="d.1074W.9/1">The Department has made substantial investment in road transport related schemes in Yorkshire during the first local transport plan period (2001-06) and will sustain this investment throughout the second period, which runs until 2011. This includes significant investment by the Highways Agency on the motorway and trunk road network in the Yorkshire and Humber region over the last five years. This high level of investment is set to continue with, for example, the innovative &pound;1.29 billion programme announced last year to reduce congestion on strategic routes in South and West Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="d.1074W.9/2">To enable better forward planning, the Government in July last year announced three year regional funding allocations to 2007-08 and planning assumptions for 2008-09 to 2015-16, amounting to over &pound;1 billion for the Yorkshire and Humber region. These cover major (greater than &pound;5 million) local transport plan schemes and major Highways Agency schemes other than on those on roads of the greatest strategic national and international importance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1074W.9/3">On rail investment, new services have been introduced between Sheffield and Leeds, and new rolling stock provided to increase capacity on routes to Leeds and Bradford. In addition, the Secretary of State, through the rail re-franchising programme, has sought and will continue to seek improvements to rail links between the towns and cities of Yorkshire.</p>

	<p pid="d.1076W.5/1">The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Wales Office was an early adopter of pre-legislative scrutiny and the national health service (Wales) Bill was scrutinised during the 2001-02 session. Since then, a further three Bills introduced by my Department were published in draft for consultation: the Public Audit (Wales) Bill; the Transport (Wales) Bill; and, the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill. A public consultation has always been conducted in parallel with the pre-legislative scrutiny process. My Department has also introduced two further Bills. My Department had conducted a public consultation jointly with the Welsh Assembly on the principles underlying the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Bill, and as there was general support for the proposals, further scrutiny was not considered necessary, and would only have further delayed the legislation. The Government of Wales Bill, which is currently before the House, was introduced without pre-legislative scrutiny, because the proposals need to be implemented for the May 2007 Assembly elections. Extensive consultation was however undertaken on the White Paper, which was published well in advance of this Bill being introduced. All the Department's formal consultations also abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation.</p>

	<p pid="d.1079W.3/3" class="indent">Make water governance effective;</p>

	<p pid="d.1079W.3/7">The EU Water Fund, formally known as the EU water facility (EUWF), was established, in part, as a response to the fifth objective of the EUWI; namely to identify additional financial resources and mechanisms, but there is no formal link between the two. In contrast to the EUWI, the EUWF is a funding mechanism. The Water Facility has made &euro;500 million available for water and sanitation and aims to leverage additional funds from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="d.1079W.3/8">Progress to date has been slow, mainly because of lengthy procurement procedures, but approximately &euro;230 million is currently being committed to co-fund 97 projects, valued overall at &euro;412 million. An initial analysis of these selected proposals by the EUWF has found that by 2010 approximately 10 million people will benefit from access to drinking water and approximately 5 million people will benefit from access to basic sanitation. A second call for proposals has been launched this year and the full &euro;500 million of the water facility will be committed by 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.1079W.6/1">The UK strongly supports the Global Fund and wants it to be effective in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria. The Global Fund recently revised its resource needs to an estimated US$5.5 billion for 2006 and 2007. There is a current funding gap of US$2.1 billion for 2006 and 2007. Of this, US$1 billion is needed this year to fund a new round of grants which was launched by the board in April. The Mid-Term Review of the Global Fund (4-<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>) will review the fund's performance and mobilise extra resources for 2006-07 to fill the funding gap. The UK has committed &pound;359 million to the Global Fund (2002-08). We have doubled our pledge for 2006 and 2007 to &pound;100 million in each of those years. This means that our overall share of support for the Global Fund at around 5 per cent. is consistent with our support over the 2001-05 period. The UK is meeting its fair share&mdash;other donors need to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="d.1079W.6/2">The Global Fund is only one part of our contribution to tackling AIDS, TB and malaria. The UK is committed to spend at least &pound;1.5 billion on the global AIDS response over three years (2006-08), including our support to the Global Fund. We also provide support to the Roll Back Malaria (&pound;7 million pledged to 2008) and Stop TB initiatives (over &pound;49 million pledged from 1999 to 2007), as well as direct support to countries to help tackle diseases of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="d.1079W.6/3">The UK will continue to encourage other donors including the private sector to support the Global Fund. The Prime Minister has also recently made clear that we are committed to working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to encourage the development of long-term&mdash;10 year&mdash;health plans and to help ensure that predictable support is available from donors to support them. This will be key in helping countries strengthen their health systems and to be able to more effectively combat AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>

	<p pid="d.1080W.2/2">DFID does not track long-term health sector spending because we provide pooled financial support for basic health services. But, as the Prime Minister recently made clear, we are committed to making good on our G8 promises, and a key part of this is to support developing countries with long-term, sustainable financing for health. We are currently working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to encourage development of long-term&mdash;10 year&mdash;health plans and to ensure that predictable support is available from donors for them. This long-term support will provide poor countries with the security to make long-term investments and meet the costs of salaries, drugs, infrastructure and training. We have also increased our funding to multilateral organisations supporting countries to strengthen their health services, including to the Global Fund and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). We are spearheading innovative efforts to secure significant additional resources for essential health care through the International Finance Facility for Immunisation, with the first bond issue due in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="d.1081W.3/1">The main impact of recent military action has been to the loss of electrical power following damage to Gaza's only power plant. The closure of the Nahal Oz oil pipeline from <phrase class="date" code="">26 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">2 July</phrase> and greater difficulty in movement due to the destruction of three bridges providing north-south access have also had an effect. Hospitals in Gaza are maintaining services by using back-up generators, although there are reports that supplies of some essential drugs and supplies are nearly finished. It is difficult for anyone from the south to access to the main referral hospital in Gaza city in the north.</p>
	<p pid="d.1081W.3/2">The Gaza economy has been severely constrained since March, when Hamas assumed power. Since then, the access point for exports from Gaza has been closed, trade with Israel has all but stopped and a very limited number of public sector salaries have been paid. Most of the water supply to Gaza is pumped from wells. Supplies are being continued by connecting pumps to generators, but there is concern that fuel for these generators is dependent on the Nahal Oz pipeline remaining open.</p>

	<p pid="d.1082W.4/1">The House provides child care vouchers to the value of &pound;8 per child per day. The Commission favours the child care voucher scheme because of its flexibility and availability to staff wherever they are based. Vouchers are available for children up to and including age 11. The vouchers can be used to pay registered child minders, nurseries, playgroups, cr&egrave;ches, nannies, holiday play schemes for school age children, and close relatives who care for children, thus allowing staff a range of choices when making their child care arrangements. Information can be found on the parliamentary intranet. The scheme is currently under review to ensure the House continues to offer the most appropriate arrangements for the majority of staff.</p>

The difference in cost between sitting and non-sitting days is small, as the major costs of accommodation and staffing are not appreciably affected. Major works and other contracts were negotiated on the basis of the revised sitting arrangements in both September 2003 and 2004. It is therefore impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that around &pound;90,000 of additional works expenditure was incurred directly by the House sitting in each September period.</p>

	<p pid="d.1096W.6/1">Central Government does not provide direct funding for local community dance facilities. However, funding can be made available through local government programmes and through Arts Council England revenue funding for arts organisations. Funding for dance for 2006-07 is &pound;34 million rising to &pound;35 million for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="d.1096W.6/2">Since 1994 the Arts Council has also invested &pound;126.4 million into establishing a national infrastructure of dedicated dance venues across the country, including Yorkshire Dance in Leeds, the Laban Centre in London and Dance City in Newcastle.</p>

Organisations and individuals can also contribute to the Department's formal consultation which abides by the Code of Conduct on Consultation. Known stakeholders are alerted to the fact that a formal consultation is taking place.

Sport England is providing &pound;8 million in Exchequer funding over the period 2005-09 to support the strategic priorities contained in the LTA's Whole Sport plan.

The training is undertaken by those who have completed the Basic Patrol Arabic Course augmented by specially appointed and trained Operational Unit Education Officers. Once deployed training is continued by the same staff augmented by the Theatre Education Centre. Every soldier is also issued with a language card which is taught during pre-deployment training and is practised regularly by all in theatre.</p>

	<p pid="d.1107W.0/1">Pay 2000 is the generic term used to describe the incremental pay system for armed forces personnel. It arose as a consequence of the recommendations made in the independent review conducted by Sir Michael Bett in 1995, and was introduced in April 2001 for regular personnel, and November 2002 for reservists.</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.0/2">Some 14,160 regular and reserve army personnel have been either under, or overpaid electronically at some time since, and as a result of the implementation of Pay 2000. The number of pay accounts in need of rectification was reduced to some 8,900 during 2004-05, and this figure has been reduced further to some 1,000 during 2006. I am confident that the remaining 1,000 pay accounts will be rectified prior to the roll-out of joint personnel administration to the army.</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.0/3">Arrangements ensure that any shortfalls are paid manually at unit level. The primary causes of the problem have been late changes in the interpretation of policy, computer programming difficulties and the ageing army computer systems.</p>

	<p pid="d.1107W.6/2">At the recent UK-France summit on <phrase class="date" code="">9 June</phrase>, the United Kingdom and France re-affirmed their shared commitment to act together against evolving threats and challenges to our security and defence and to that of our allies and partners. An important element of this is the long-standing military co-operation between our armed forces, who currently work together on operations and regular exercises, and in the fields of concepts, doctrine and training. This collaboration is undertaken both bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as NATO and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.6/3">Our armed forces co-operate on operations in Afghanistan, Kosovo and Bosnia. Other recent interaction includes:</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.6/4" class="indent">Routine integration of Royal Navy and French Navy ships into respective Task Group deployments, most recently in the UK Naval Task Group Deployment AQUILA 2006 and the French Carrier Task Group</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.6/5" class="indent">AGAPANTHE 06, which deployed to the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and Gulf regions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.6/6" class="indent">British Army staff officers attached to the French Rapid Reaction Corps Headquarters in Lille where they contribute to French work on achieving NATO Response Force readiness.</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.6/7" class="indent">The Royal Air Force and French Air Force combining to provide a Joint Force Air Component Headquarters, and substantial force elements, for NATO Response Forces 5 and 6.</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.6/8" class="indent">Agreement to co-operate in establishing a network of Peace Support Training Centres in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="d.1107W.6/9">This close and highly valued military relationship is fostered through regular dialogue at all levels from the Chief of the Defence Staff downwards and underpinned by bilateral agreements and letters of intent. There is also a network of exchange and liaison officers across all three services. The continuation of our excellent military relationship with France will remain important as we work together to tackle the challenges ahead.</p>

	<p pid="d.1109W.11/1">The Ministry of Defence's requirement for tetanus immunoglobulin is low. It is only used to treat patients with wounds who have not received the normal tetanus vaccine. Very few such cases arise in our armed forces since MOD aims to ensure that all its personnel have up-to-date tetanus vaccinations prior to deployment. The only people who would need it would therefore be any service personnel who missed their vaccination and any non-UK individuals who are treated in our medical facilities in theatre.</p>
	<p pid="d.1109W.11/2">There is a temporary UK national shortage of tetanus immunoglobulin. We do not currently have any centrally held defence stocks in the UK. However, with the exception of designated field hospitals, units are not required to hold tetanus immunoglobulin, although some do at the discretion of individual medical officers. We are not aware of any stock shortfall of tetanus immunoglobulin in the designated field hospitals and we do not expect a shortfall to arise before supplies become available again.</p>
	<p pid="d.1109W.11/3">Routine tetanus immunisation is given by the combined low dose diphtheria/tetanus/inactivated polio (Td/IPV) triple booster which is administered at trainee entrant establishments. Personnel who require a further booster dose because they have sustained an injury from which they could be at risk of an acute tetanus infection can also be given the Td/IPV triple booster. Supplies of the Td/IPV triple booster are not affected by the national shortage of immunoglobulin, and there are currently no known shortages in naval or military units.</p>
	<p pid="d.1109W.11/4">In light of the national shortage, the MOD has repeated recent Department of Health guidance on tetanus immunoglobulin to defence medical personnel, advising them of the necessary action they will need to take. This will mainly involve ensuring that all personnel have up-to-date tetanus vaccinations.</p>

	<p pid="d.1111W.8/1">I have never been informed that &quot;wetting&quot; is official policy for dealing with looters in Basra. No witness statements saying that &quot;wetting&quot; is official policy for dealing with looters in Basra were disclosed to Crown counsel either prior to the trial of soldiers relating to the death of an Iraqi youth in the Shatt al Basra River or since the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.8/2">I am told that during the trial three witnesses gave evidence as to a practice of putting detained looters in water which appears to refer to &quot;wetting&quot;. Mr. Daniel O'Connell, formerly a Lieutenant Platoon Commander, said there was a practice of making looters wet which was discussed at the company &quot;O&quot; Group meetings; however it was not formal policy. He indicated that he had witnessed one such incident of looters being put into a dyke where they were waist high and in no real danger.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.8/3">Major Peter MacMullen the Company Commander said that the looting problem was discussed at Battle group meetings and that he was aware of a range of sanctions that were being deployed, which included people being put into water so that they would be left cold, wet and miserable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.8/4">Mr. Niall Brennan, formerly the Company Second in Command, said he knew of other companies throwing looters into the Shatt al Arab River. He did not consider they were in danger of drowning and claimed that he did not consider this dangerous because it involved the use of minimum force.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.8/5">Despite this evidence, coming from higher up the chain of command, the evidence given at trial made it clear that neither the commanders on the ground nor the individual soldiers were aware of such a policy or practice (officially sanctioned or otherwise). Not one of the accused raised this in their witness statements or interviews under caution. None of the members of their platoon or section who gave evidence knew of such a policy or had even heard of looters being put into water. Knowledge of the policy, if one did indeed exist, was restricted to the middle echelons of the chain of command only.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.8/6">During the course of the trial a statement was obtained from the then Battle Group Commander, Brigadier Riddle-Webster, who said that the practice of &quot;wetting&quot; had never been discussed and had he heard of such a practice he would have put a stop to it immediately since he regarded it as illegal, dangerous and immoral. However due to legal reasons this was not put before the Board.</p>

	<p pid="d.1113W.3/1">The Department does not make use of private debt collectors. Of the executive agencies, Companies House uses the services of a debt collector in connection with the administration of the penalties raised on companies for late filing of accounts. The Insolvency Service uses agents for the collection of book debts (moneys owed by creditors to bankrupts and companies in liquidation) where the Official Receiver is trustee or liquidator and to collect costs from directors who are disqualified as a result of a court hearing.</p>

	<p pid="d.1114W.2/1">There are no specific regulations that govern the sale, supply, or purchase of DNA sequences. The potential chemical hazards associated with the sequence itself would be covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended); if DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level of protection for human health and the environment (including animal and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO), administered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, regulates possession of nucleic acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO. In all cases the relevant containment and operating requirements laid down by Health and Safety Executive/Defra would need to be met.</p>
	<p pid="d.1114W.2/2">Provisions in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 place an obligation on managers of laboratories and other premises holding specified pathogens or toxins to notify the authorities and to comply with the security requirements which the police may impose.</p>
	<p pid="d.1114W.2/3">There is a wide range of legitimate uses to which DNA sequences may be put and the imposition of onerous controls could discourage valuable scientific research and industry use. The Government do not believe that it is necessary to require suppliers of DNA sequences to be licensed or for them to screen customers or check the intended use of the sequences. But we will continue to monitor the situation as the relevant technologies develop.</p>

In respect of the numbers of those persons specified in the question who may be on the electoral register, I explained in my previous answer on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1045W, that this information is not collected. Electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual. Currently, it is an offence to fail to supply information to the ERO and knowingly supply false information on the annual canvass form.</p>
	<p pid="d.1115W.0/3">The Electoral Administration Bill strengthens the objection process and creates a new offence of supplying false information of any kind to an ERO, or failing to supply information, in connection with registration, at any time. The electoral register does not specify the immigration or asylum status of individuals entered on it; however, the addition of a &quot;nationality&quot; box in the registration form does provide an opportunity for EROs to determine the eligibility of an applicant for inclusion in the register on the basis of their stated nationality.</p>

	<p pid="d.1116W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1116W.2/2">A key success criterion for Apprenticeships from the outset has been that the programme should be open to all young people regardless of gender, ethnic origin or disability and it should provide equal access particularly to those from potentially socially disadvantaged or marginalised groups. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has worked hard to establish and build on the Apprenticeship Frameworks and procedures required for successful equality. The Apprenticeships Approvals Group (independently chaired by the Skills for Business Network ie Sector Skills Council led) have a key role to play in ensuring that Apprenticeship Frameworks make all reasonable adjustments to maximise participation from diverse groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.1116W.2/3">The LSC maintains a website detailing starts, leavers and completions of individual frameworks <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/apprenticeshipsdata/">http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/ apprenticeshipsdata/</a>. However, published figures for completions are not broken down by geographical area or sex. For this reason Mark Haysom, the council's Chief Executive, has written to my hon. Friend with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>

It collates, summarises and assesses both peer reviewed research material, from this country and abroad, and less formal work conducted by bodies active in this area. It reports the views of a wide range of organisations, 28 in all, with an interest in this area to paint a picture of how the issues are currently perceived. The report is available on the DfES website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research</a> and the findings will be used to inform future work in this area.</p>

	<p pid="d.1125W.15/1">I have no plans to do so. In cases when EU legislation is proposed which would need to be transposed into UK each proposal will be considered on its individual merits. However, EU competence in education and training is limited to supporting and supplementing the actions of member states, and fully respects the responsibility of member states for the content and organisation of education and training. There is therefore not a great deal of EU legislation in the education and vocational training field to be transposed into domestic legislation. In the majority of cases the Department for Education and Skills responds to EU decisions, recommendations and communications through the development of policy rather than legislative changes.</p>

Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under Public Private Partnerships/Public Finance Initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The Club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

	<p pid="d.1134W.3/1">Responsibility for encouraging long-term unemployed people to return to education and training is shared between the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="d.1134W.3/2">Both Departments, along with their respective delivery agencies Jobcentre Plus (JCP) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), are working closely together to ensure that long-term unemployed people have the skills they need to secure sustainable and productive jobs. There has already been significant progress in joint working between the LSC and JCP and a joint delivery plan is currently being developed which will cover the Yeovil area in order to meet local employment and skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1134W.3/3">The Government's skills strategy sends out a strong signal about the priority we attach to helping adults with few or no qualifications to attain a platform of wider employability skills. All those on jobseeker's allowance or income related benefits and their dependents receive free tuition in further education, in addition to the support available through their local JCP office. Unemployed people also have access to in-depth advice about their education and training options through the Learndirect one-stop telephone and online advice service.</p>
	<p pid="d.1134W.3/4">The Government do, however, recognise that more needs to be done to tackle long-term unemployment and published a Green Paper in January 2006 &quot;A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work&quot; including measures to help low skilled adults secure employment through the New Deal for Skills. These include piloting skills coaching in a number of JCP districts and our latest evidence shows that skills coaching is helping long-term unemployed people improve their employability skills.</p>
	<p pid="d.1134W.3/5">In addition, the Chancellor announced in his Budget Report that Lord Leitch's review of skills would be extended to include better alignment of measures to tackle worklessness to support labour market flexibility, better employment outcomes and greater progression to productive and sustainable jobs for those with skill needs. We expect Lord Leitch's report this autumn and my Department looks forward to working with the Department of Work and Pensions to take forward Lord Leitch's proposals.</p>

In 2002, one species, the Starry Breck Lichen (Buellia asterella), was reported as having become extinct, and two UKBAP priority species, the pool frog and interrupted brome, were reported to have been lost. Both the pool frog and interrupted brome have since been re-introduced. Although both re-introduction projects are at an early stage and there is some way to go before the species are successfully re-established, effectively their extinction has been reversed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1135W.3/3">This is the only evidence we have of a UK species becoming extinct within the last 10 years. It is also worth noting that the Pashford pot beetle (Cryptocephalus exiguus), another priority species, has not been found at its known localities for a number of years but this is not thought to represent sufficient evidence of extinction yet.</p>
	<p pid="d.1135W.3/4">In terms of non-priority species, we cannot be certain that there have been no extinctions because some species have never been named and others are recorded extremely infrequently.</p>

	<p pid="d.1135W.9/14">In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.</p>

It will be present in beef at varying concentrations, dependant on the physiological state of the animal when it was slaughtered, and also its sex and age. Muscle, which is the matrix available for testing is not ideal. The EU's community reference laboratory recommends serum, which is not available in imported beef.</p>
	<p pid="d.1142W.2/13">Scientific advice from two of the UK's national reference laboratories for veterinary residues analysis is that any difference in concentrations between untreated animals and those treated with exogenous oestradiol is very small. So, distinguishing between them would be unlikely. Therefore no testing has been carried out on imported beef in the last 10 years. Responsibility for testing produce from non-EU member states rests with the country of entry into the EU. Once produce has entered the EU, it should have free circulation within all member states, as part of the single market.</p>
	<p pid="d.1142W.2/14">EU legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements on non-EU countries before they export food to the EU. These are designed to ensure that imported animals and animal products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. The use of the listed substances as growth promoting hormones is banned in the EU, and therefore they should not be present in beef imported into the EU.</p>
	<p pid="d.1142W.2/15">The European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office check on compliance with such legislation in EU and non-EU countries exporting to the EU.</p>

	<p pid="d.1149W.7/2">The Commission informs me that it regularly communicates with registered political parties to ensure that both they and their registered accounting units comply with the law on submission of accounts. This includes the provision of information, sending out reminder letters and arranging meetings wherever necessary. Where the Commission feels further action is necessary, officers from the Commission work with individual parties in enhancing their financial reporting systems to improve their ability to comply with the law.</p>
	<p pid="d.1149W.7/3">Any registered accounting unit whose gross income or total expenditure in a financial year exceeds &pound;25,000 is required to submit a statement of accounts to the Commission within three months of the year end if these are not required to be audited, and six months if they are. The Commission has no means of knowing, in advance, which accounting units will exceed the &pound;25,000 reporting threshold in any given year.</p>

	<p pid="d.1152W.9/1">The UN peacekeeping operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), MONUC, is the largest and most complex mission that the UN has managed to date. Its key tasks are to facilitate political transition and power sharing arrangements, deal with armed groups outside the political process and to protect civilians.</p>
	<p pid="d.1152W.9/2">MONUC chairing aided the peace process since 2002 by brokering cease-fires and peace deals and the International Committee in Support of the Transition, which engages with the Congolese Government. Following MONUC's support for a successful referendum last December, the country is set to hold its first elections since the 1960s. UN expertise and MONUC's logistical support for this process have been crucial to making this possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.1152W.9/3">MONUC operates in a dangerous and complex environment and has been mandated by the UN Security Council, under chapter VII of the UN charter, to support the Congolese Army to disarm those groups that are a threat to the peace process and to protect civilians from rebel attack. There has been considerable progress in dealing with armed groups, but attacks on civilians remain at an unacceptable level.</p>
	<p pid="d.1152W.9/4">In 2004 a number of cases of sexual abuse and exploitation by UN peacekeepers and staff in the DRC came to light, raising serious concerns about MONUC's management. After a thorough investigation by the Secretary-General's special representative on the issue, a series of measures were introduced to combat the problem of sexual abuse and exploitation by UN peacekeepers across all UN missions. MONUC has stringently imposed these measures on UN staff and peacekeepers.

Each year we offset the previous year's air travel emissions, so in 2005-06 we offset our 2004 emissions. An agreement was signed with the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) at the end of 2005 to offset our 2004 emissions, one year ahead of the requirement for Government Departments to offset air travel by April 2006. Through REEEP we offset our emissions by investing in projects which provide carbon credits from renewable energy and energy efficiency schemes. Investment is concentrated in developing countries, which are highly dependent on fossil fuels and inefficient energy technology.</p>

	<p pid="d.1155W.5/2">The possibility of extending qualified majority voting to police and judicial affairs was provided for in the Amsterdam and Nice treaties. Article 42 of the treaty on European Union (TEU)&mdash;the passerelle&mdash;allows for areas governed by title VI (third pillar) to be transferred to title IV (first pillar) by unanimous Council decision.

	<p pid="d.1155W.5/5">The Commission's formal proposals for changing the decision-making procedure for the area of Justice and Home Affairs were not published until <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1155W.5/6">The Finnish presidency has also announced its intention to explore the possibility of using the article 42 passerelle to improve the decision-making process.

	<p pid="d.1156W.0/1">The UK supports both Serbia's and Montenegro's European aspirations. The pace at which each country moves towards membership of the EU will depend upon it meeting the conditions required at each stage. The next stage for each state is to conclude negotiations with the EU on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The European Commission is likely to bring forward mandates for the negotiations shortly. Conclusion of agreements will depend, in both cases, on fulfilling the appropriate conditions, in particular full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. We will maintain regular discussions with the European Commission and with our EU partners on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="d.1172W.2/1">Earnings-related accruals of state second pension would be tapered away by around 2030 by freezing the national insurance upper earnings limit, for the purpose of state second pension accruals, in cash terms from the point at which earnings uprating of the basic state pension as proposed in the White Paper is introduced. Earnings-related accruals built up under the state earnings-related pension scheme and/or the state second pension prior to 2030 would be fully protected and would continue to be revalued in line with earnings from that date. The combination of our proposals to 'flat-rate' accruals of the state second pension and earnings uprate the basic state pension would ensure that the state pension outcomes for people reaching state pension age after 2030 would not be reduced. The following table shows examples of the state pension outcomes for individuals under the proposed reforms.</p>

	<p pid="d.1176W.2/2">The school is to accommodate pupils with both severe learning difficulties (SLD) and with moderate learning difficulties (MLD). In planning for the establishment of the Speech and Language and Behavioural Units, the Western Education and Library Board always envisaged that it would be a phased three-year project in order to allow time to establish what staffing complement would be required for the pupils and to establish the extent of provision required within the two units.</p>
	<p pid="d.1176W.2/3">Additional recurrent funding of &pound;170,000 was allocated to Knockavoe School in 2005-06 to develop staff resources and equipment, with a further &pound;174,000 provided in 2006-07 for additional staffing costs. The final phase is planned for 2007-08 with the opening of the Speech and Language and Emotional/Behavioural Disorder Units. Funding of &pound;490,000 has been earmarked for 2007-08 to facilitate this and includes for teaching and classroom assistant staff and equipping of both units.</p>

It is the responsibility of public authorities to draw up retention/disposal policies to ensure that records of historical or other research importance are identified and, ultimately, transferred to the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) for permanent preservation. Under the Lord Chancellor's Code of Practice on the Management of Records by Public Authorities, issued under Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, it is the responsibility of local government authorities to develop policies for the creation, keeping, management and destruction of their records. This can include the development of a generic policy for the retention of local government documentation. PRONI would advise local government in the development of the policies and quality assure them.</p>

	<p pid="d.1178W.5/1">A range of service improvements have been implemented by the Royal Group of Hospitals HSS Trust to reduce waiting times for MRI scans at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The current MRI scanner is operated for 49 hours each week; nine of these are evening sessions funded by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board as part of a waiting list initiative. Since April 2006 an additional eight hours have been resourced to facilitate access to emergency scanning at weekends.</p>
	<p pid="d.1178W.5/2">A computerised information system has been introduced to optimise management of the waiting list. This includes patient validation, data cleansing and regular monitoring.

	<p pid="d.1183W.2/1">The Department of Education's earmarked budget for parenting initiatives is currently &pound;250,000 per annum and is allocated entirely to the education and library boards. It is primarily a matter for each board to determine how these earmarked resources should be used and they are also free to supplement this funding by allocating further resources from within their overall block grant.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183W.2/2">Funding has recently been made available to 471 schools from the Children and Young People Funding Package for the Extended Schools Programme. This will enable schools to develop initiatives some of which may involve parents. In addition, a further &pound;10 million has recently been issued directly to all schools and it is open to schools to determine whether some of this additional funding should be used to support parenting initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183W.2/3">Based specifically on the earmarked funding allocated by the Department to the boards for parenting initiatives the figure represents &pound;0.78 per pupil attending grant-aided schools in Northern Ireland. However, this figure is clearly not a true reflection of the actual resources spent on promoting positive parenting within the education sector.</p>

	<p pid="d.1183W.5/1">The Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (Northern Ireland) [PCSPS(NI)] provides pensions for all personnel working in Northern Ireland departments and agencies. The PCSPS(NI), in parity with GB public service schemes, pays cash-equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in compliance with pension law. Members of public service schemes can transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The Club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights. There is also a requirement under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the public sector under Public Private Partnerships/Public Finance Initiatives or under Machinery of Government movements and subsequent transfers for former public servants.</p>

	<p pid="d.1185W.3/1">Statistically older people in Northern Ireland are still the least likely group of citizens to become a victim of crime. However over the past couple of years there has been a disproportional increase in domestic burglaries committed against those aged 65 years and over as a proportion of the population. It is also recognised that the fear of crime among older people is significant.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185W.3/2">The Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office has developed and funds the Lock Out Crime Scheme (LOCs) which supplies and installs free of charge additional home security in the form of door and window locks, door chains and viewers, and external front and rear door lighting to the homes of all those aged 65 and over who are in receipt of housing benefit or a rate rebate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185W.3/3">Since the launch in May 2004 up until <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-03">3 June 2006</phrase>, 52,688 letters have been issued and 16,087 individuals have so far returned forms and have been admitted to the scheme. Since that date a further 4,361 letters of offer have been issued for which registration is on-going.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185W.3/4">In addition on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase> I launched a mobile pilot handy van service in the Greater Belfast area. This service, which is being managed by Help the Aged, fits free additional home security measures for those older people who do not qualify for the LOC Scheme. There is also the Unknown Callers TV Advertising campaign aimed at providing information to older people about answering the door to bogus callers. This advert was screened for a total of six weeks during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185W.3/5">The police offer free advice about home security and personal attack alarms to older people and several of the Community Safety Partnerships (there is a partnership in each district council area) have included the safety of older people as a priority issue in their action plans for tackling crime. These plans have now been agreed with the Community Safety Unit and the Partnerships are currently in the process of setting up their projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185W.3/6">Finally, the police have established a special team to co-ordinate the investigations of attacks upon older people across the Downpatrick, Newry and Mourne, Craigavon, Banbridge, Armagh, Dungannon and South Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cookstown, Omagh, Strabane and Magherafelt districts. I understand that this initiative has identified a number of persons who have been charged and are remanded in custody awaiting trail in relation to burglary offences against older people.</p>

	<p pid="d.1186W.2/1">The Abortion Act 1967 does not extend to Northern Ireland. Consequently the termination of a pregnancy is not permitted except where necessary to save the life of the mother or where continuation of the pregnancy would involve risk of serious injury to her physical or mental health.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186W.2/2">While the information required is available, the numbers involved are very small and individual patients could potentially be identified. It is felt inappropriate therefore, to disclose information on the number of terminations performed on those aged 16 years or younger.</p>

	<p pid="d.1187W.6/1">Older people in Northern Ireland are still the least likely group of citizens to become a victim of crime. However the recorded crime statistics for 2004-05 and 2005-06 to date would indicate that those persons aged 65 years and over are disproportionably affected by domestic burglary as a proportion of the population. It is also recognised that the fear of crime among older people is significant. To address these issues the Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office is currently leading on the development of a strategy for the safety of older people. It is planned to publish the draft strategy document for consultation in the autumn of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.1187W.6/2">On a practical level the Unit has developed and funds a number of ongoing initiatives to tackle the problems of crime and the fear of crime amongst older people. These include the Unknown Callers TV advertising campaign which provides information to older people about answering the door to bogus callers and the Lock Out Crime Scheme that supplies and installs free of charge additional home security, in the form of door and window locks, door chains and viewers and external lighting to the homes of all those aged 65 and over who are in receipt of housing benefit or rate rebate. A mobile pilot Handy Van service was also launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase> in the Greater Belfast area to fit free home security devices for the elderly who do not qualify for the LOC Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1187W.6/3">The police, in addition to offering free advice about personal security and personal attack alarms, have introduced Operation Bullent in the Downpatrick, Newry and Mourne, Craigavon, Banbridge, Armagh, Dungannon and South Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cookstown, Omagh, Strabane and Magherafelt districts. This project deals with the problem of travelling criminals who commit burglary offences, including those that involve violence, predominantly against persons over 65 years in these districts by co-ordinating their intelligence, investigations of crimes and delivery of preventative measures. I understand that this initiative has identified a number of persons who have been charged and are remanded in custody awaiting trial in relation to burglary offences against older people.</p>
	<p pid="d.1187W.6/4">At community level, several of the Community Safety Partnerships (there is a partnership in each council area) after conducting a community audit, have included the safety of older people as a priority issue in their respective action plans to tackle crime. These plans have now been agreed with the Community Safety Unit and the partnerships are currently in the process of setting up their initiatives.</p>

Almost 950 major capital projects, together with many minor works projects, were carried out to improve a number of water treatment works, including Drumaroad, Lough Bradan, Fofanny and Derg. Improvements to the watermain network system were also carried out. The scale and extent of this work varied from small watermain extensions to serve individual housing developments, to large-scale projects such as the replacement of part of the Mourne Conduit which transfers water from the Silent Valley to supply Belfast and surrounding areas.</p>

Nevertheless, as an ONS product, any assessment of methods used in calculating population statistics remains a matter for the ONS.

Further information on this work can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1201W.2/5" class="indent">As part of this work, ONS is investigating how improvements may be made to estimates of internal migration which are currently produced using health records. In particular, the movement of students and young men are being considered and research is being carried out so that we have a better understanding of the movement of these and other mobile groups. We are also investigating other data sources that may inform our estimates of internal migration.</p>
	<p pid="d.1201W.2/6" class="indent">The programme of research described above is also taking forward recommendations from the National Statistics Quality Review (NSQR) into International Migration. The quality review made recommendations for improving the estimation of total migration flows to and from the UK and the allocation of international migration to local areas. This work includes investigating administrative sources that may be used in producing or quality assuring the international migration estimates, investigating potential sources of information about short-term migrants and making improvements to the current source of information on international migrants, the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The latest Progress Report on taking forward the recommendations of the NSQR on International Migration can be found at <a href="http://vrww.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp">http://vrww.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="d.1201W.2/7" class="indent">ONS are also conducting Local Authority case studies as part of the IMPS programme of work. These aim to get a better understanding, from a local perspective, of the administrative data sources that are currently used in the population estimation procedure. They will also investigate any other high quality sources that the local areas use themselves for population purposes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1201W.2/8" class="indent">The local areas selected for these studies are ones that are known to have reasons which make their population difficult to estimate, e.g. those with a high volume of migratory moves.

	<p pid="d.1202W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question about what assessment has been made of the accuracy of the mid-year population estimates. (81990)</p>
	<p pid="d.1202W.2/4" class="indent">Population estimates are calculated using an internationally respected methodology. Further information can be found in the detailed methodology guide 'Making a population estimate in England and Wales'. This is published here:</p>

	<p pid="d.1202W.2/6" class="indent">It is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population because of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements. Nevertheless, the mid-year population estimates remain the best available estimates of the population on a national basis. The decennial Census provides a benchmark against which national and sub-national population estimates can be assessed. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here:</p>
	<p pid="d.1202W.2/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="d.1202W.2/8" class="indent">Migration is acknowledged as the most difficult component of population change to estimate. My answer to your question about the steps being taken to ensure population estimates more closely reflect the effects of migration provides more detail.</p>
	<p pid="d.1202W.2/9" class="indent">In addition, extensive annual quality assurance is undertaken in order to ensure the accuracy of the annual mid-year estimates. Quality assurance starts with detailed checking of the source data used in the components of change (birth, deaths, etc.). Procedures are then in place to ensure that these data sources are correctly processed when deriving the estimates. the calculated national and sub-national estimates, for all 376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a further set of quality assurance procedures before they are published. These procedures include reviews of sex ratios and age profiles, comparisons of change over time, and comparisons of fertility and mortality rates. Substantial effort has already been undertaken, in recent years, to improve the quality assurance of population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.1202W.2/10" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics is also now investing substantially in a project to Improve Migration and Population Statistics (IMPS). (More information on this project can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a> ) The key aims of this project are to reduce the size of the difference between the 2011 Census results and the mid-year estimates and to better understand any difference that does remain.</p>
	<p pid="d.1202W.2/11" class="indent">As part of this project, we are developing a data comparator tool to enable us to compare the annual mid-year estimates against a range of administrative sources. This work is ongoing and the results will inform our understanding of the accuracy of the mid-year population estimates. The tool was trialled in the mid-2004 population estimates, which were published in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.1202W.2/12" class="indent">Another strand of the IMPS project is a review of the quality assurance procedures that are currently in place for population estimates. One of the aims of this review is to assess what improvements can be made to existing procedures, and determine whether additional quality assurance is required.</p>

(81993)</p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/4" class="indent">Migration is particularly difficult to estimate due to a rapidly changing population structure, which includes an increase in mobility and complex changes in living arrangements. ONS recognised this was a particular issue before the 2001| Census was undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/5" class="indent">The sources used to estimate internal migration were changed before the 2001 Census. Up to 1998 the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR) was used in conjunction with data from electoral rolls. There were known limitations with the electoral roll data source. For example there were variations in the registers caused by the procedures used to maintain them. It was also possible for people to be registered in two different areas, such as students, and those under 18 were not included. Research was carried out that identified a higher quality data source in GP registers. From 1999 onwards, the internal migration component of the population estimates was based on a combination of NHSCR and GP register data.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/6" class="indent">Population estimates use the United Nations definition of an international migrant, which is somebody who migrates for a period of at least 12 months. Mid-year population estimates therefore estimate those that are 'usually resident' at that time. Following the 2001 Census a number of improvements were made to the methodology of international migration. Improvements were made to allow for those who stayed in their destination country for longer or shorter than they had originally intended, and therefore either became or were no longer considered a migrant (migrant and visitor switchers). Improvements were also made to fully allow for the migration of dependants of asylum seekers and to fully estimate outflows of failed asylum seekers and their dependants. Along with more minor technical adjustments to migration estimates, these changes have been incorporated into the revised 1991 to 2001 estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/7" class="indent">The National Statistics Quality Review (NSQR) on International Migration was commissioned before the 2001 Census results were published. Please see the following link for further details of the NSQR:</p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/9" class="indent">Following publication of the 2001 Census the 'Improving Migration and Population Estimates' (IMPS) project was set up and incorporated recommendations of the NSQR. The IMPS project is primarily research based and concentrates on aspects of improving both internal and international migration and population statistics through methodology improvements and the identification of the most relevant and reliable data sources. The project is currently involved in liasing with a number of local authorities (LAs). ONS is working in partnership with these LAs to investigate whether local knowledge can help improve migration and population estimates. Any findings can potentially be applied to LAs with similar characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/10" class="indent">More specifically the IMPS project will consider how further improvements can be made to the internal migration methodology and data sources, one example of this is the issues around students registration with GPs. Research involving international migration will consider improvements in how to distribute International Passenger Survey (IPS) flows within England and Wales. In addition to this, other possible data sources will be considered, as will improvements to the estimations of IPS flows by altering and adding to existing questions in the IPS. In addition, ONS set up a Task Force on Migration Statistics in May. This aims to identify improvements that could realistically be made over the next couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203W.5/11" class="indent">We are also researching the feasibility of producing estimates of short-term migrants. The population estimates measure those that are usually resident and therefore do not measure those that are temporarily living in England or Wales. It is hoped that estimates of short-term migrants will be able to be used in conjunction with the existing population estimates.</p>

The new commissioning arrangements introduced in April 2006 will in the future enable primary care trusts (PCTs) to plan and commission services across primary and secondary care trusts. We are looking to develop services outside hospital by encouraging PCTs to contract with specialists working in the community and, where appropriate, general dental practitioners with a special interest in orthodontics.</p>

	<p pid="d.1221W.0/2">Mental health services are not currently required to offer a choice of provider at the point of referral.

At its meeting in November 2004, the ACP considered a report produced by its medical and toxicology panel on the possible links between pesticides and Parkinson's disease. At that meeting, the committee concluded that although this review indicated a correlation between recalled pesticide exposure and Parkinson's disease it did not point to a particular toxic mechanism or a hazard from a specific compound or group of compounds.</p>
	<p pid="d.1228W.0/2">However, the committee did advise that further mechanistic and epidemiological research be carried out on the association between pesticide exposure and Parkinson's disease.
