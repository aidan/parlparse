	<p pid="a.428W.6/1">HMCS will carefully manage the transfer of workload and administration of cases using the detailed implementation plans that are being developed for each court that is closing.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.6/2">Over recent years HMCS has been pursuing a Unified Family Court policy which has taken the majority of Family Proceedings Court hearings out of magistrates courts buildings and into the county courts. The court estate already contains a number of co-located courts that include both magistrates and county courts and Crown and county courts and to a smaller extent all three. There will be some additional co-location of criminal and family jurisdictions in magistrates and county courts as a result of court closures. However, there are operational advantages to co-location and so long as suitable arrangements are made, such as segregated facilities or separate days for family and criminal matters, HMCS will seek to increase the flexibility of court buildings and provide multi-jurisdictional services.</p>

The costs will vary and depend on a number of factors including the risk presented by the individual, the level of supervision required, and the arrangements for delivery in the particular area. It is not possible to accurately disaggregate the cost of this work. However, work is in hand to ensure that all offender services delivered in the community are properly specified and costed so that commissioners can ensure resources are targeted effectively to protect the public and reduce reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="a.429W.2/1">The use of restorative justice conferencing for domestic abuse cases is contentious as it has implications for the safety of victims. Current guidelines do not encourage this approach in domestic violence cases, with victim-offender mediation pointing to the risks for victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.429W.2/2">An alternative approach is the Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme (IDAP), a programme for convicted offenders aimed at tackling physical and psychological domestic abuse, and linked behaviour issues such as control and misuse of power. It also provides support for victims and their families and, where appropriate, the victim may play a role in demonstrating the impact and consequences of the abuse as part of an offender's rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.429W.2/3">More generally, the Ministry of Justice assessment of general restorative justice evidence suggests that restorative justice can, in appropriate cases, have a positive impact on the offender's likelihood of re-offending in the future as well as providing more positive outcomes for victims. As set out in the recent MoJ Green Paper on &quot;Breaking the Cycle&quot;, we are committed to increasing the range and availability of restorative justice approaches and to give victims a greater chance of seeking reparation for the crimes committed against them. We are looking at how we can make restorative justice a fundamental part of the sentencing process.</p>

	<p pid="a.447W.0/1">The Government propose to replace disability living allowance with personal independence payment in 2013-14. We are considering the most appropriate delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken. We believe that advice from an approved independent professional will be an important part of ensuring that assessments are objective and consistent. In most cases, we expect this to involve a face-to-face consultation to enable an in-depth look at an individual's circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.0/2">We know it is essential that the assessment accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the assessment development group that we have established is considering. For example, they believe that the new assessment should explicitly take account of the impact of a health condition or impairment, including autistic spectrum disorders, on an individual's ability to communicate. This would set it apart from the current DLA assessment. We also recognise the importance of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>

However the number of working days lost to sickness absence as a result of work related stress has decreased from an estimate of almost 13 million in 2001-02 to an estimate of 9.8 million in 2009-10.

	<p pid="a.450W.2/1">It is important to be clear that the new assessment for personal independence payment (PIP) will be very different to the work capability assessment (WCA) used in employment and support allowance (ESA). This recognises that ESA and PIP are different benefits paid for different reasons. The emerging assessment for PIP will focus on individuals' ability to carry out key everyday activities, rather than capability for work and direct measures of associated functions as in the WCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.2/2">We are, however, seeking to learn from the overall experience of delivering the WCA. As part of this we are looking closely at the findings of the first independent review carried out by Professor Malcolm Harrington, to see where they can assist with the design of the PIP claim and assessment processes. For example, we fully recognise the need to ensure that these processes are transparent and empathetic; and are considering the scope to use mental, intellectual and cognitive champions to support the assessment as recommended by Harrington.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.2/1">For the purposes of this answer the amount spent on the unit's 'operation' has been interpreted to mean all staff and non-staff administration costs, and 'total capacity costs' to mean total expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.2/2">22 staff, drawn from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Home Office, work full-time in Research Information and Communications Unit (RICU). In addition, the Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development each funds one member of staff engaged part-time on RICU business. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), originally one of three parent Departments, stopped funding RICU and withdrew its seconded employees during 2010, in line with its new remit to lead work to promote integration separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.2/3">Total RICU expenditure in 2008-09 and 2009-10 and projected spend for 2010-11 is set out in the following two tables. The first indicates the proportion of administration (staff and non-staff) and programme costs met by the Home Office, FCO and DCLG in each of the three years. The second shows administration and programme costs as a percentage of total RICU expenditure for the same three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.460W.0/1">The decision to terminate the employment of those Liverpool office staff who had been incorrectly appointed on permanent civil service contracts, was taken by the chief executive following advice from IPS HR and from the Civil Service Commission.</p>

In the case of 10 employees IPS has been able to award fixed-term contracts for the two-year period from their original start date. The remaining four employees had already been employed by IPS for more than two years. IPS has also met with the staff involved and sincerely apologised for this mistake.</p>

	<p pid="a.461W.6/2">The Government have no plans to reinstate the aggregates levy sustainability fund (ALSF). The decision to discontinue the fund was taken as part of the spending review settlement in October 2010 in a very tight spending context where we looked very carefully across all the Department's priorities to identify where we could make best use of available funds. Unfortunately, it was decided that the fund was no longer in a position to continue funding the ALSF programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.6/3">The aggregates levy is a tax on the commercial exploitation of aggregate, administered by HM Revenue and Customs, and is separate from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund. As announced at the recent Budget, the rate increase on the aggregates levy has been postponed until 2012-13.</p>

	<p pid="a.465W.5/1">There is a substantial programme of environmental monitoring for radioactivity in UK waters which has been established for a number of years. The results of this programme, together with implications for human health and environmental health are published annually in the Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE) report series. These reports confirm that the environment and man are adequately protected, and that doses of radioactivity received by people and wildlife continue to be well within regulatory limits. The uncertainty in dose estimations is relatively low.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.5/2">For the wider north-east Atlantic, the UK works with other European states within the OSPAR convention (for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic) to ensure that inputs and levels of radioactivity are reduced. OSPAR's Quality Status Report 2010 assessment for the north-east Atlantic concludes that environmental concentrations and exposure of humans and biota to monitored radionuclides are low.</p>

The Food Standards Agency has implemented Commission Regulation (EU) No. 297/2011 which applies EU-wide controls to prevent the import of food and feed which may be contaminated, including fish and fishery products, from Japan.</p>

Officials have discussed the scheme with interested partners, such as the National Farmers Union and English Heritage, and we will continue to work with partners to promote the scheme.</p>

The research base has an important role to play in addressing such priorities and the research councils, with the support of independent advice, have proposed research programmes to tackle them.

But it is for the research councils to decide on the specific projects and people to fund within these priorities, free from ministerial interference.</p>

This sets out their strategic research priority areas. AHRC has been working since 2008, with four other research councils, on the Connected Communities Research Programme which has been developed through consultation with researchers. It has not been changed or modified in any way because of any intervention from Ministers: there has been none. At the core of this programme is research to understand the changing nature of communities in their historical and cultural contexts, and the value of communities in sustaining and enhancing our quality of life. These issues are also relevant to debates about the 'Big Society'. The AHRC has made clear their position in a statement published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="a.476W.5/2" class="indent">The Budget announced a general moratorium from all new domestic regulations for three years for businesses of less than 10 employees and for new start-ups.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/3" class="indent">The Budget also Introduced 21 new Enterprise Zones offering a package of benefits including a 100% business rate discount worth up to &#163;275,000 over a five year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/4" class="indent">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April</phrase>, Companies House will launch a new web incorporation service which will enable people to set up a simple company within a few hours for just &#163;18; an important step towards the Government's aim of one-click registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/5" class="indent">Alongside the launch of Start-Up Britain, the ground-breaking response from the private sector to the Government's call for an enterprise-led recovery, we announced last week a package of announcements to help inspire, support and grow new businesses in the UK:</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/6" class="indent">support for every school to run its own business through the Enterprise Champions Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/7" class="indent">a major roll-out of Tenner Tycoon, the successful competition owned and run by the Peter Jones Foundation which gives young people the opportunity to take forward their business ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/8" class="indent">the creation of enterprise societies in every university and most further education colleges to develop students with the ambition and skills for enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/9" class="indent">We have announced we will be changing the way we provide information, guidance and support to make it easier to start a business, revamping the <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a> website and introducing a national contact centre. In October we will be launching a new improved, and personalised, online support package for anyone who wants to start up in business. The Start Up Hub will provide a range of tools and checklists, which have been tested by business customers and includes key elements of starting up such as business planning, as well as tax calculators and other help. It will be easy to access online information and guidance including simple 'no nonsense guides' to starting up in a variety of formats, and online training such as video workshops and case studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/10" class="indent">We have announced that we will continue the Enterprise Finance Guarantee until 2014-15, providing up to &#163;600 million of additional lending to around 6,000 SMEs next year, and subject to demand, over &#163;2 billion in total over the next four years, helping to ensure businesses can access the finance they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/11" class="indent">We are providing targeted support for specific groups:</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/12" class="indent">supporting the Royal British Legion's 'Be the Boss' scheme, which provides loans, grants and advice to UK service leavers to help them fund, plan and grow their own businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/13" class="indent">working with the Department for Work and Pensions to deliver a tailored package of measures, including an expansion in the planned New Enterprise Allowance, to help the unemployed become self employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/14" class="indent">Working with mentoring providers to understand and address the barriers to enterprise for all groups, including women, former service personnel and Black, Asian and other Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/15" class="indent">Working with social landlords to remove red tape and encourage more tenants to start up businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/16" class="indent">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April</phrase>, a new prospective entrepreneur visa will be available and there will be changes to the entrepreneurs' visa to encourage more wealth and job creators to come to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/17">The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is one of this Department's key corporate stakeholders, and Ministers and officials meet regularly with their CBI counterparts. I last met with John Cridland, the CBI's Director General, in early March, where we discussed many aspects of policy aimed at making the UK the best place in the world to start a business. These included planning, regulation and employment law. We also spoke on the afternoon of Budget day. The CBI welcomed the Budget overall and the accompanying Growth Review, particularly welcoming the measures on corporation tax, entrepreneurs' taxation, regulation, fuel duty and manufacturing.</p>

Provisions for such payments are included in the notes to The Service's Accounts published annually and laid in Parliament. The Service's Annual Report and Accounts also includes any payments in respect of complaints that are upheld by the independent Adjudicator of complaints.</p>

	<p pid="a.486W.2/2">The Home Office in liaison with OGC and other Government Departments has developed the good practice guidance on procuring services from the voluntary and community sector (VCS). The primary focus of the guidance is to improve the participation of the VCS in public service contracts but it is also highly relevant to procurement relationships with small to medium enterprises and black and minority ethnic enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/3">The Department for Education (DfE) fully supports the use of the good practice guidance and recognises that the voluntary and community sector can make a significant contribution to the delivery of our policies. The Department's procurement policy requires that all procurement must be based on value for money (VFM), however, VFM and supplier diversity are not in opposition to each other and public procurement is generally more effective if it is open to ideas from all potential supply markets. The guidance is not about giving preferential treatment to VCS organisations rather it is about opening up opportunities and building effective relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/4">We are also complying with the actions suggested by ERG and BIS-Growth Review:</p>

	<p pid="a.486W.2/6">to help encourage SMEs and VCS's, e.g. reducing use of Pre Qualification Questionnaires (PQQs) for sub-threshold procurements and meeting the Governments transparency requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/7">To support the transparency agenda, all DfE tenders and contracts over &#163;10,000 are advertised on the Contracts Finder website which provides access and guidance to public sector contracting. Contracts Finder is a free new service for businesses, Government buyers and the public. This service comes from Government under their transparency commitment, and you can find live contract opportunities, tender documentation, contract awards and contract documents.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.2/8" class="indent">'The Impact of Parental Involvement on Children's Education', DCSF 2008, provides a summary of some of the research evidence on the impact of parental involvement on children's education, the stages at which it is know to have an impact, and the types of activities which are influential. Overall, research has consistently shown that parental involvement in children's education does make a positive difference to pupils' achievement, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/9" class="indent">Parental involvement with children from an early age has been found to equate with better outcomes; particularly in terms of cognitive development. (Sylva et al (2004) Effective pre-School Education. Final report. DFES.)</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/10" class="indent">Evidence indicates that a relationship exists between parental involvement and achievement, and that this continues to have a significant effect into adolescence and even adulthood, even when the background factors such as class and family size have been taken into account. (Desforges et al (2003) The Impact of Parental involvement, Parental Support and Family Education on Pupil Achievement and Adjustment: A Literature Review. DCSF).</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/11" class="indent">Evidence suggests that the quality and content of fathers' involvement matter more for children's outcomes than the quantity of time fathers spend with their children. (Goldman, R (2005). Fathers' involvement in their Children's Education. National Family and Parenting Institute.) There is consistent evidence that fathers' interest and involvement in learning is statistically associated with better outcomes, (ibid)</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/12" class="indent">In 2007 two thirds of parents said that they would like to get more involved in the child's school life. Work commitments were the most frequently cited barrier by parents (44%) from getting more involved. (Peters et al (2008) Parental Involvement in Children's Education 2007. DCSF).</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/13">The report is available here:</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.2/15" class="indent">Analysis of data collected from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-97) found a negative and significant effect on the child's educational attainment as a young adult of the mother's full-time employment when the child was aged 0-5.</p>

The greater coherence and accountability of the system will enable our customers to see more clearly who is accountable for what, and to speak more directly to Government about their concerns. Instead of having several, sometimes conflicting, voices from official agencies giving different versions of the Government's policy, there will be a single clear message coming direct from Government. The abolition of several ALBs signals an end to centralised control over aspects of education where there is no need for the government to be involved, and supports greater devolution to localities and the front line, enabling more decisions to be taken by schools themselves, rather than by intermediate bodies The creation of executive agencies, rather than simply bringing the delivery functions into the Department, is also aimed at safeguarding independence in areas where this is important.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.0/1">The Government are committed to tackling all forms of bullying particularly those motivated by prejudice. We want every school to have a strong ethos on good behaviour which includes a culture of respect and acceptance among pupils, staff and the rest of the school community. The Schools White Paper, 'The Importance of Teaching', is a wide-ranging document which sets out the Government's overall approach to different aspects of education, one being behaviour. In that chapter, we made it very clear that schools should not tolerate any form of prejudice-based bullying, regardless of motivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.0/2">Homophobic bullying was cited as an example of bullying which is prevalent and often not tackled effectively. However in developing anti-bullying strategies, school staff should assess the particular motivations behind bullying in their schools including, where appropriate, any transphobic bullying, and incorporate those issues accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.0/3">Our proposed new short advice to schools on preventing and tackling bullying will highlight transphobic bullying as one of the types of prejudice-based bullying schools should address. This advice will also signpost schools to further resources from external organisations who are experts in transgender issues. Officials have been working with a range of organisations in developing this advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.3/1">The Secretary of State has not had any discussions with the Home Office about the likely effects on levels of youth crime of the changes to school sports funding. However, this Department works closely with other Departments with an interest in taking forward the new approach to school sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.3/2">Funding of &#163;47 million has been paid to school sport partnerships to fund their work up until the end of the summer term 2011. Ring-fenced funding for partnerships will not continue beyond then. Instead, the Department is making available &#163;65 million of new funding for schools to enable them to provide more opportunities for competitive sport. The funding will cover the school years 2011/12 and 2012/13, and will pay for one day a week of a secondary PE teacher's time to be spent out of the classroom, encouraging greater take up of competitive sport in primary schools and securing a fixture network for schools to increase the amount of intra- and inter-school competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.3/3">In addition, at the Sports Colleges Conference in February, the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport announced outline plans for a network of School Games Organisers from September 2011. These organisers will be funded by the Department of Health and Sport England for three days a week to help schools sign up for the nationwide school games. Further details on the funding for these organiser posts and their precise roles will be announced shortly.</p>

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) published a report of its review of the latest scientific evidence on the health effects of modern municipal waste incinerators in September 2009. The report concludes that while it is not possible to rule adverse health effects out completely, any potential damage from modern, well run and regulated incinerators is likely to be so small that it would be undetectable. The HPA report also advises that since any possible health effects are likely to be very small, if detectable, studies of public health around modern, well managed municipal waste incinerators would yield no useful information.</p>

	<p pid="a.510W.5/2">Table 2.2 in June Budget 2010 reports figures for 2010-11 of &#163;101.5 billion for Health of which NHS England is &#163;99.5 billion on Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL). The difference in figures is Personal Social Services (PSS) centrally funded services, PSS grants and Food Standards Agency (FSA). Both figures included depreciation of &#163;1.1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/3">The baseline 2010-11 figure in Spending Review Statistical Annex Table A5 of &#163;98.7 billion excludes depreciation (&#163;1.1 billion), but includes &#163;0.3 billion of additions to the NHS baseline by HM Treasury to reverse inter-departmental transfers of funding-this procedure is followed to avoid funding either not being counted or counted twice in spending review bids.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/4">PSS and FSA expenditure is shown separate to NHS funding in the spending review tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/5">Table 2.2 in June Budget 2010 reports figures for 2010-11 of &#163;4.9 billion for Health of which NHS England is &#163;4.7 billion on capital DEL. The difference in figures is capital funding for Personal Social Services.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/6">The baseline 2010-11 figure in Spending Review Statistical Annex Table A6 of &#163;5.1 billion, is higher than the &#163;4.7 billion again due to HM Treasury action to reverse inter-departmental transfers of funding.</p>

A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> 2. Main procedure or intervention-The first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (eg time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedures.<br/> 3. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/>  4. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); Outpatients, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

Where TB is a high risk and common complication of pregnancy, we would expect to invest in that. The monitoring and evaluation framework in the &quot;Choices for women&quot; Framework for Results cannot be all-inclusive given the many aspects of reproductive, maternal and newborn health that we expect to support in the countries where we work. We must balance our need for accurate data to measure progress whilst not creating additional reporting burdens for countries or parallel monitoring systems.</p>

This includes screening for TB.</p>
