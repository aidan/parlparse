	<p pid="a.731W.2/2"><i> </i>The Government are committed to improving current rates of mobility and giving social tenants more control over where they live. We have pledged to introduce a national social home swap programme to make it easier for social tenants to move to another home or another part of the country. The new scheme will increase opportunities to move by allowing tenants to easily see details of every other tenant looking to exchange their home.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.2/3">The homelessness legislation provides an important safety net for people who become homeless through no fault of their own but is not intended to facilitate mobility among tenants in social housing. The definition of intentional homelessness is set out in primary legislation, and in any particular case it is for the local housing authority to decide whether an applicant has made himself intentionally homeless. Where a person has given up his home in order to move to another area to look for work and not made arrangements for alternative accommodation (and there was no other reason for leaving the home), it is likely that a local housing authority would consider that he had made himself homeless intentionally.</p>

Information provided or the overall presentation of a food must not deceive the average consumer such that the average consumer would make a purchasing decision that they would not have taken otherwise.</p>

	<p pid="a.743W.9/1">In the last year, the Ministry of Defence has received nine letters from Members of Parliament and the public about exempting the pay of armed forces personnel from tax during periods of service abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.9/2">There has been no recent assessment of the merits of exempting the pay of those serving overseas from income tax. It is a long-standing rule recognised by successive governments that the armed forces, like other Crown servants, are liable for the payment of income tax wherever they are serving. This is not considered inequitable as the UK armed forces have an expectation of worldwide service, which is reflected in their overall remuneration package, which includes, for example, the payment of the X-factor (currently 14%) in recognition of relative disadvantages on military life and payment to those experiencing an exceptional level of separation. In addition, to further recognise the sacrifices personnel make while deployed further allowances have also been introduced, and the operational allowance, which is itself exempt from tax, has been doubled.</p>

	<p pid="a.745W.3/1">It is Government policy to encourage and assist Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in securing contracts with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and overseas customers. The MOD Defence Suppliers' Service helps SMEs and other companies wishing to sell products and services to the MOD, by explaining the acquisition process and providing contact points both within the Department and for our prime contractors, who may have subcontracting requirements. The MOD encourages competition wherever possible in the allocation of lower-tier subcontracts and this provides opportunities for SMEs to bid for elements of larger projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.3/2">In the specific case of Typhoon, the majority of contracts are placed, on behalf of the participating nations, by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) based in Munich and are, therefore, subject to German law.

	<p pid="a.754W.2/11">The periods covered saw the programme move from procurement of the strategic solution and provision of the Semaphore pilot system to the more complex activity to assure the design and delivery of the strategic solution. The fall in consultant and contractor headcount during this time did not deliver an equivalent reduction in cost since there was an associated change in the mix and type of consultancy support provided, along with a need to use more hours from individual consultants because of the pressures on the programme and the requirement for their specialist knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.2/12">Prior to contract award, the role of consultants was to manage and provide advice on the procurement process. Following contract award, consultants provided advice and support in a number of areas including business design, programme management, carrier and port liaison and testing activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.2/13">All work carried out by consultants was agreed in formal work packages which detailed the deliverables and activities required. Achievement of those deliverables was signed off by civil servants. Consideration of the value for money provided by consultants in carrying out these activities was an integral part of the process in agreeing each work package.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.2/14">The e-Borders programme has been managed throughout by senior civil servants reporting ultimately to the senior responsible officer.

	<p pid="a.761W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh, dated October 2010:</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what recent assessment has been made of the effectiveness of the outreach services offered by Jobcentre Plus. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus currently provides a variety of outreach services at around 1500 locations right across the country. We recognise the potential of these services to meet the needs of customers and communities and to reach the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in society. These outreach services complement our core services delivered through other channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/5" class="indent">Outreach schemes take a number of different forms. Among them are: outreach in local authority and community centres, providing ease of access to advice and support; prison outreach, which provides specific support to prisoners as part of their preparation for release; and outreach at school gates, children's centres and colleges. Much of this outreach work is by its nature local. However, national initiatives are evaluated centrally. For example, in 2008 the Work-Focused Services in Children's Centres pilot was set up, under which Jobcentre Plus Advisers are co-located full-time in children's centres and provide enhanced packages of support. An evaluation is testing the effect of this model on parents' preparation for (and movement into) work, as well as multi-agency working. Interim findings show that parents welcome accessing work-focused services in the children's centre, particularly in comparison to the local Jobcentre Plus office. This work is ongoing and the final evaluation report will be available in September 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/6" class="indent">In Autumn 2009 Jobcentre Plus put in place community outreach teams in three locations to work with the individuals and households that faced the most disadvantages. Working closely with social housing providers and other partner organisations, Jobcentre Plus advisers are engaging with jobless residents, helping them access the support they need to address multiple disadvantages. They are helping people who had previously considered themselves to be outside the labour market. In August 2010 the initiative was extended to a further 13 social housing estates across England, Wales and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/7" class="indent">We intend to produce a comprehensive evaluation of the project that focuses not only on job outcomes and engagements but also covers the specific barriers to employment that have been overcome, social benefits, the localism approach and the value of partnership working. This evaluation is ongoing; the timescale for publishing the report will be dependent on decisions made about the project following the Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/8" class="indent">For the future, I see outreach as an important way of delivering our services. We will continue to work with partners at a local level to establish new and innovative ways of sharing premises, facilitate the provision of more cohesive local services, promote our services to a wider customer base and potentially reduce overall Government estate costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/9" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.762W.0/1">DWP is developing the capacity of community sector financial service providers such as credit unions so that people on low incomes, traditionally not well served by mainstream financial institutions, have access to savings products, affordable credit and basic banking. By August 2010 the DWP Growth Fund had served over 300,000 people, of whom around 65% had been helped to open a bank or savings account. DWP Financial Inclusion Champions are also working with local authorities, social landlords and the community sector to encourage people to access these financial services.</p>
	<p pid="a.762W.0/2">The Government are also committed to introducing a new duty on employers to automatically enrol eligible jobholders into workplace pension schemes to address pension undersaving. Evidence suggests that around seven million people are currently not saving enough to deliver the income they are likely to want or expect in retirement and a high proportion of those are low to moderate earners.</p>

	<p pid="a.762W.3/1">Eligibility for the Motability scheme is dependent on a person being entitled to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance or the War Pensioners' Mobility Supplement. Entitlement is not determined by medical criteria but by the extent to which a person's disability gives rise to mobility difficulties. This is consistent with Motability's objective of helping severely disabled people with personal mobility needs. The Government announced in the June Emergency Budget that it would reform disability living allowance and will continue to work closely with disabled people, voluntary organisations and medical experts to develop a new independent and objective assessment of need.</p>

	<p pid="a.765W.5/1">As part of our consultation arrangements, Pension Disability and Carers Service (PDCS) co-ordinates the PDCS Advisory Forum, membership of which comprises of 22 organisations that collectively represent a broad range of our customers. PDCS routinely consults with the Advisory Forum on how all our claim forms can be improved, which includes Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Attendance Allowance (AA) and Carers Allowance (CA) forms. A new child DLA claim form has been developed in partnership with voluntary organisations including the National Autistic Society, National Deaf Children's Society, Citizens Advice and the Family Fund. This is currently being tested but early feedback from customer and children's organisations has been positive. Additionally, to take account of a new legislative provision where the Higher Rate Mobility Component can be claimed from April 2011 by certain severely visually impaired customers, PDCS are developing a new DLA Adult claim form in partnership with Royal National Institute for the Blind, Action for Blind People, Citizens Advice and representatives from local authorities. It is expected that the new DLA Adult form will be available from February 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.5/2">In addition, questions about the ease with which disabled customers can complete application forms for Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance have been included in the Customer Satisfaction Monitor (a customer survey of 6,000 PDCS customers) that has been commissioned by the Pension Disability and Carers Service. The results from the first year of this survey are currently being assessed ahead of external publication in early 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.5/3">The Chancellor announced in the Emergency Budget that the Government will introduce a new, objective assessment for DLA from 2013-14. We will consider, as part of these reforms, how we can reduce the burden of long claim forms for applicants.</p>

	<p pid="a.767W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide my hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking how many people participated in the Travel to Interview Scheme in each of the last five months; and what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of that scheme. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/4" class="indent">The Travel to Interview Scheme helps customers compete for appropriate jobs outside their local travel to work area by providing help with travel costs for attending interviews. In deciding the appropriateness of an award, advisers will take into account a number of factors, which include making sure that the customer is aware of and is applying for jobs locally, the customer's ability to pay their own travel expenses, and how realistic and achievable the job in question is.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/5" class="indent">Turning to your specific question about the number of people participating in the scheme in each of the last five months, we do not routinely gather this information and to do so would be disproportionately expensive.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/6" class="indent">In terms of effectiveness, advisers and customers tell us the scheme is helpful and popular, but it is difficult to assess the success in terms of job outcomes. This is because the scheme aims to help people compete for appropriate jobs by enabling their attendance at interviews that would otherwise be out of reach. Once at interview the jobseeker is, of course, in competition with other applicants.</p>

Earlier this year, LOCOG appointed Waterford Crystal, Wedgewood and Royal Doulton as its ceramic and crystal licensee, to produce London 2012 commemorative and souvenir merchandise. Beyond this, LOCOG has no major requirement for ceramics procurement.</p>

It is right that Government look at the options for increasing the flexibilities and freedoms under which employers can invest in training.

In most cases there will be a lead professional who will initiate the process, for example a general practitioner, a practice nurse, a specialist nurse, a social care worker or an allied health professional.

CFS/ME sufferers can currently give blood when they are well. These data have not been replicated in Europe. An expert subgroup of National Expert Panel for New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) met in May 2010, to consider all available evidence about XMRV and conduct a risk assessment. The subgroup concluded that XMRV can infect humans but there is currently no evidence that it causes human disease and that on the evidence before the group, no public health action is required at this time. Since the subgroup meeting in May there has been no new scientific evidence that would change the conclusions of the subgroup. In July 2010, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), similarly did not recommend further measures at present. Both groups will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.5/1">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) paper entitled 'Review of the Dissemination of Health Statistics-Confidentiality Guidance', which conforms with departmental policy on data publication, has been adopted to enable the Health Protection Agency (HPA) to provide surveillance information without jeopardising patient confidentiality. When publishing information on sensitive clinical conditions such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), public health interests must be balanced against patient confidentiality and data protection obligations. The HPA aims to consistently apply the principles and uniform standards of the ONS/Department of Health guidance when publishing information.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.5/2">Information on STIs is among the most sensitive data the HPA collects. Where a cell in a table has a number less than five, the risk of indirect ascertainment of the identity of those affected is assessed. Diagnoses of STIs in those aged under 15 years are not published by single year of age because the small numbers concerned, together with the additional information of the exact year of age, pose too great a risk of deductive disclosure. Therefore, only aggregate information on STI diagnoses in those aged under 15 years is presented in HPA publications and there are no plans to review this policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.5/3">Information on the number of selected STIs for those diagnosed in genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics and in the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) in England, in those under the age of 15, 2005-09, is given in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.11/4" class="indent">1. What the mortality rate was for each type of cancer in people aged (a) 49 years and under, (b) 50 to 59 years, (e) 60 to 69 years, (d) 70 to 79 years and (e) over 80 years in (i) each cancer network, (ii) each primary care trust and (iii) England in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/5" class="indent">2. What the incidence was of each type of cancer in people aged (a) 49 years and under, (b) 50 to 59 years, (c) 60 to 69 years, (d) 70 to 79 years and (e) over 80 years in (i) each cancer network, (ii) each primary care trust and (iii) England in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/6" class="indent">3. How many people aged (a) 49 years and under, (b) 50 to 59 years, (c) 60 to 69 years, (d) 70 to 79 years and (e) over 80 years were diagnosed with each type of cancer in (i) each cancer network, (ii) each primary care trust and (iii) England in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/7" class="indent">The latest available figures for newly diagnosed cases of cancer (incidence) are for the year 2007, while the latest figures for mortality are for the year 2009. However, since the latest available population estimates for primary care organisations and cancer networks (required to calculate rates) are for the year 2008, all mortality rates have been provided up to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/8" class="indent">Question 2 above requests figures on 'incidence... [for] each type of cancer', which is the same as 'how many people... were diagnosed' (question 3). Question 2 has the therefore been interpreted as meaning incidence rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/9" class="indent">To supply mortality rates, incidence rates and incidence numbers for all types of cancer for (i) each cancer network, (ii) each primary care organisation and (iii) England in each of the last five years could only be done at disproportionate cost. Therefore, figures have been provided for the four most commonly diagnosed cancers: breast (women), colorectal (bowel), lung and prostate.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/10" class="indent">Age-specific rates have been provided for England, using the age groups as specified in the questions above. Age-standardised rates have been provided for cancer networks and primary care organisations, since numbers were too low to calculate cancer-specific , age-specific rates for all age groups, for all areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/11" class="indent">Table 1 (i) provides the age-standardised mortality rate for breast (women), colorectal, lung and prostate cancer, for each cancer network in England, for the years 2004 to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/12" class="indent">Table 1 (ii) provides the age-standardised mortality rate for breast (women), colorectal. lung and prostate cancer, for each primary care organisation in England, for the years 2004 to 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.11/14" class="indent">Table 2 (i) provides the age-standardised incidence rate for breast (women), colorectal, lung and prostate cancer, for each cancer network in England, for the years 2003 to 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.11/15" class="indent">Table 2 (ii) provides the age-standardised incidence rate for breast (women), colorectal, lung and prostate cancer, for each primary care organisation in England, for the years 2003 to 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.0/1">Victim Impact Statements are now officially known as Victim Personal Statements. All victims of crime or, in cases of homicide, the family of the victim are eligible to make a VPS. The present method of providing a leaflet to inform victims of the Victim Personal Statement is currently being reviewed, but the relevant information and the offer to make a statement can still be provided by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.0/2">Bereaved families of homicide victims are also offered the opportunity to make a Victim Personal Statement under the Crown Prosecution Service's Victim Focus Scheme. Families can meet with prosecutors, who will explain the purpose of the statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.0/3">Ensuring that police officers offer victims or their families the opportunity to make a Victim Personal Statement is the responsibility of individual police forces, many of which have local policies in place. In October 2009, the former Office of Criminal Justice Reform released national guidance called 'Victim Personal Statements: A guide for police officers, investigators and criminal justice practitioners'.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.3/1">The decision whether to grant bail is a matter for the discretion of the court and the Ministry of Justice does not issue guidance. However, the Crown Prosecution Service issues guidance to Crown Prosecutors on prosecuting cases of domestic violence and rape, and this includes advice on how prosecutors should approach the question of bail. The guidance makes clear that the primary concern of the CPS in such cases is the protection of the victim and any children that may be involved. It emphasises the need to gather as much information as possible on the needs and views of victims where the CPS is deciding whether to oppose bail or is recommending conditions to be imposed on a defendant before release. The CPS keeps its guidance under constant review.</p>
