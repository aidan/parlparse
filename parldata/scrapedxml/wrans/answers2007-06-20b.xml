	<p pid="b.1783W.5/2">The Department has also announced a &pound;500,000 capital grant for the new International Slavery Museum (ISM) in Liverpool being developed by National Museums Liverpool. This funding builds on the &pound;250,000 annual contribution to the ISM's running costs which the DCMS has already pledged. The ISM will replace the groundbreaking Transatlantic Slavery Gallery in the Merseyside Maritime Museum and will prove to be a magnificent new national institution and a worthy legacy of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1783W.5/4">MLA's Strategic Commissioning programme has supported a number of regional projects in 2007 between schools and museums and archives across the country. Organisations have worked with the MLA regional agencies to produce new learning resources' including exhibitions and websites that draw on local stories about the impact of slavery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1783W.5/5">All 41 Renaissance Hub museums have engaged in events and exhibitions to mark the bicentenary.

	<p pid="b.1783W.5/7">The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has awarded over &pound;13 million to more than 140 projects related to the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade and the slave trade generally.

	<p pid="b.1783W.5/8">Arts Council England has funded 44 projects related to the bicentenary, making grants totalling &pound;1,234,549 so far this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1784W.3/2">The Criteria Proposals Group (CPG) and the Criteria Review Panel (CRP) were established to develop draft criteria for the initial screening out of areas unsuitable for geological disposal of the UK's higher activity radioactive waste. These criteria will be included in the forthcoming Managing Radioactive Waste Safely consultation document. CPG and CRP have now completed their work. A joint report will be published on the DEFRA website later in summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1784W.3/3">The potential impact of rising sea levels on coastal areas as a result of climate change was considered by CPG and CRP. Sea level rise could affect the location of repository access points and of surface facilities sited in coastal areas during the repository construction, operational and pre-closure phases. CPG and CRP concluded that, because of the potential to protect surface facilities from coastal flooding, for example by engineered means or, where possible, by relocating facilities to higher ground, risk of coastal flooding was not a general exclusion criterion. However, it would need to form part of the future process of site specific consideration.</p>

The FCO database contains records of 352 MoUs, including both MoUs originating with the FCO and MoUs concluded by other Government Departments. However this record is not complete; although there is a widespread practice of other Departments depositing copies of MoUs with the FCO, it is not possible to confirm whether they have done so in every case. To produce a complete record of the MoUs entered into by the FCO and other Government Departments would require lengthy research and would be disproportionally costly. In some circumstances MoUs are deposited in the Library of the House, where hon. Members can consult them. This is a matter for the Department concerned.</p>

The European Neighbourhood Policy offers many opportunities for Moldova to move closer to the EU. We do not see the European Neighbourhood Policy as an alternative to full EU membership, but as a path towards accession. We will continue to work closely with Moldova and help focus their efforts on implementing the Action Plan and its successor. Successful implementation will be important for Moldova in pressing their case for a closer relationship with the EU.</p>

The meeting of the International Contact Group in London on <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase> sent the same strong message to the TFG through the Somali Foreign Minister.

This is to be distinguished from a service agreed for aviation use. There is not yet a timetable for certification of EGNOS for aviation use because it will first be necessary to identify clearly the funding and management structure that will guarantee an operational system in the long-term. These guarantees are dependent on the decisions to be taken in the autumn on the future of the European GNSS Programme.</p>

The Sustainable Development Commission is however producing a report, with financial support from various parties including my Department, looking at various options for harnessing the potential tidal energy resource that exists around the UK, including within the Severn estuary. The SDC will, of course, be looking at the Severn Barrage proposal in detail as part of their report.</p>

The United Nations humanitarian agencies have assessed the situation and have begun an airlift to deliver essential food, shelter and household items to those in need. This assistance is funded by the $100,000 from the UN's local Emergency Response Fund, to which DFID contributed &pound;550,000 in April, in addition to the $6.4 million provided from the UN's global Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) since 2006.

The World Bank has advised us that this will be corrected in the 2007 report, which will show that all HIPC and MDRI debt cancellation for Tanzania and the other countries that have completed the HIPC Initiative has been delivered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1814W.2/1">The information requested is not available as central records of instances of home working are not maintained. However, in the November 2006 Staff Survey, 246 staff (16 per cent.) reported that they had a regular home working arrangement (e.g. one day per week). In addition, 260 (18 per cent.) replied that they had access to occasional home working on request. 72 per cent. of respondents were satisfied with the Department's flexible working policies. 70 per cent. of all staff participated in the staff survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.1814W.2/2">As part of policy on alternative and flexible working patterns, the Department is willing to consider home working arrangements where they are compatible with the work and business needs and with the skills and preferences of individual members of staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.1820W.5/1">The Government's 10-year Science and Innovation Investment Framework, published in July 2004, reaffirmed the commitment to support businesses investing in new and emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology. The delivery mechanism for this work is the Technology Strategy Board, comprising mainly experienced business leaders, which will identify the new and emerging technologies critical to the growth of the UK economy into which Government funding and activities can be directed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.5/2">Over the period 2005-08, &pound;320 million is available to businesses in the form of grants to support research and development through the Technology Strategy Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.5/3">This includes over &pound;100 million already invested in nanotechnology on collaborative R and D and a network of development facilities. A new nanotechnology knowledge transfer network was established in May 2007 to take forward the work of the Micro and Nanotechnology Network. Future decisions on technology and funding priorities will lie with the new TSB.</p>

It is for the NDA, in discussion with the site, to prioritise cleanup in light of available funding. The NDA budget for 2008-09 and beyond is part of the CSR discussions which are in train.</p>

	<p pid="b.1823W.11/1">There has been no reduction in funding for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The settlement for 2007-08 enables the NDA to operate a programme budget of some &pound;2.47 billion, giving the NDA and its contractors the certainty they need without impacting on the planned programme of nuclear clean up work. The NDA's funding in respect of the Comprehensive Spending Review period (2008-09 to 2010-11) is under discussion and will be settled in the autumn.</p>

A formal date for introduction is still to be decided, but it is intended to be brought in alongside the extension of statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance and statutory adoption pay from 39 weeks to 52 weeks. This will give families the choice for the first time on the best arrangements for their family when having a baby.</p>

	<p pid="b.1830W.2/1">Over the past 10 years, this Government have spent &pound;128 billion on transport. After 18 years of neglect, 10 years of investment mean we now have more people travelling on public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/2">Despite this, car use still continues to grow. It is not a new problem, but it has a different form from 1997&mdash;with 10 years of unprecedented economic growth, many families now have two and often three cars. Between 1997 and 2006, the number of vehicles on our roads has increased from 27 million to 33 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/3">This is why we have introduced the draft Local Transport Bill. It proposes a package of measures to further empower interested local authorities to take local action to address local congestion. It also includes important measures to deliver further improvements in public transport, especially bus services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/4">This approach builds on our existing action to tackle the problem of congestion. For example, in the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and Transport Act 2000, we brought in the controversial legislation to allow congestion charging, which Mayor Ken Livingstone then introduced. Over the period of the scheme, it has achieved:</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/5" class="indent">Congestion down by 21 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/6" class="indent">Traffic volumes down 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/7" class="indent">And over &pound;300 million raised to be re-invested into London's public transport network</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/8">We are placing buses at the heart of our transport agenda, to reverse the previous 'deregulation' in 1985 which did so much to damage public transport across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1833W.3/1">Data held by Her Majesty's Courts Service show that 10,480 justified complaints relating to the administrative actions of the county, Crown and magistrates courts were recorded within the period June 2006-May 2007. This represents 64 per cent. of the total number of complaints recorded during the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.3/2">Just under two million civil claims were heard in the county courts, and Crown Court centres disposed of over 127,000 hearings or trials in the financial year 2006-2007. In 2006 the magistrates courts dealt with approximately 2.3 million defendants in criminal cases and 1.2 million civil applications.</p>

	<p pid="b.1833W.6/1">The range of support provided to mentally ill people who commit crimes is set out in the Offender Mental Health Care Pathway (Department of Health, 2005). This outlines best practice in stages from police custody and court appearances through to prison and pre-release arrangements with community mental health teams. Copies have been placed in the Library. It is also available on the Department of Health website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.6/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4102231">http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4102231</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.6/3">Under the Mental Health Act 1983 the courts have powers to assess mentally disordered offenders before sentencing and to divert them to receive specialist treatment in hospital rather than punishment. The police also have the power under the Act to remove a person who appears to be suffering from mental disorder to a place of safety. The Government plan to publish guidance this year to the NHS and partner agencies which supports the development of local diversion services by building on current best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.6/4">Beginning in 2003, and completing in April 2006, the national health service took over commissioning responsibility for all prison health services in public sector prisons. This was previously the responsibility of the Prison Service. One of the main reasons this transfer was made was to help ensure that prisoners had better access to mainstream health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.6/5">Investment in prison mental health in-reach services has been steadily increasing, with nearly &pound;20 million invested in these services each year since 2004-05, and 360 whole time equivalent staff employed&mdash;more than the initial commitment in the NHS Plan to create 300 posts. There are now teams in 102 prisons and their services are available to the entire prison estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.6/6">People who are mentally too ill to remain in prison should be transferred to hospital. We have introduced tighter monitoring to identify prisoners waiting an unacceptably long period for transfer to hospital. A protocol was issued to prisons and primary care trusts in October 2005 setting out what must be done when a prisoner has been waiting for a hospital place for more than three months following acceptance by the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.6/7">These measures have helped bring about positive results. In 2006, 33 per cent. more prisoners, with mental illness too severe for prison, were transferred to hospital than in 2002&mdash;up to 961 from 723. There has been a significant decrease in the number of people waiting over 12 weeks for a transfer&mdash;in the quarter ending March 2007, 40 prisoners were waiting, down from 51 in the same quarter in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.6/8">The ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody and teamwork) care planning process for prisoners in danger of self-harm or suicide has helped contribute to a reduction in the number of suicides in England and Wales. In 2006, these were down 14 per cent. &mdash;down to 67 cases, from 95 in 2004. This is the lowest figure since 1996.</p>

	<p pid="b.1838W.8/17">These figures must be interpreted carefully and do not represent the personal earnings of the individuals listed in any one year. There are a number of reasons for this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.8/18" class="indent">1. The amounts paid to each barrister listed represent payments for work covering many years, for a variety of cases. The amount an individual receives in any year fluctuates widely, and is to a large extent due to the variety of payment processes and schemes used by the Legal Services Commission and the Courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.8/19" class="indent">2. All the figures listed are inclusive of VAT (17.5 per cent.) as paid, and disbursements incurred (e.g. travelling). Individuals must pay that VAT to HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.8/20" class="indent">3. Barristers pay a percentage of their fees towards professional overheads. Additionally, barristers face the same expenses as any other self employed person, including income tax and National Insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.8/21">A number of other qualifications need to be added to these figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.8/22" class="indent">1. Payments are made after claims are carefully scrutinised by the Legal Services Commission or the Courts, and where necessary adjusted. The Legal Services Commission and the Courts may make payments many years after cases conclude.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.8/23" class="indent">2. While these figures represent gross payments actually made to the barristers during the year, some of those monies have been (or may in the future be) repaid to the Community Legal Service Fund by other parties. This will happen in cases where the legally aided party wins the case and recovers costs from the opponent. Once those costs are recovered the legally aided party's solicitor refunds some or all of the money to the CLS Fund. As a consequence the figures may not reflect the actual cost of the barristers' fees to the Fund. In some cases where costs are recovered from the losing party the actual cost to the CLS Fund may be very little or even nothing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.8/24" class="indent">3. Not all payments could be verified with all the individuals concerned. Cases in dispute, where amounts listed as being paid to individual barristers were identified from records held by the Department and the Legal Services Commission, and the practitioner has no such record, have been included. Where possible, amounts have been verified by practitioners and adjusted where necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1846W.0/1">The available information on higher national diploma (HND) qualifiers and foundation degree (FD) qualifiers who went on to study a first degree in the following academic year only is shown in the tables. The figures were derived from the destinations surveys, which collect information about the destinations of qualifiers six months after qualification. Figures for 2005/06 will be available next month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1846W.0/2">The available information is limited to qualifiers who went on to study for a first degree in the year immediately following qualification: it does not cover those who chose to progress to a first degree at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1846W.0/3">For a number of reasons, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the trends in the numbers of FD qualifiers who went on to study for a first degree in the following academic year, compared to students who completed HNDs. FDs were only introduced in 2001/02 and until 2004/05 there were relatively low numbers of qualifiers, which makes the figures inherently more volatile. It is also important to note that FD qualifiers tend to be older than HND qualifiers. Older qualifiers are less likely to go on to study for a first degree in the year immediately following qualification, because they are often already employed and tend to have other financial and domestic commitments. They may therefore be more likely to proceed to further study at a later date.</p>
	<p pid="b.1846W.0/4">In addition, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) reported in their January 2007/03 (web only) report, Foundation Degrees Key Statistics 2001-02 to 2006-07, that some students on FDs who proceed to further study are reported as having qualified with an honours degree without having been reported as obtaining a FD degree, which has the effect of reducing the number of FD qualifiers who are recorded as having gone on to study for a first degree.</p>

	<p pid="b.1851W.8/1">The PSA target is to increase participation in higher education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30. The main measure for tracking progress on increasing participation is currently the higher education initial participation rate (HEIPR). This is the sum of the HE initial participation rates for individual ages between 17 and 30 inclusive. It covers English-domiciled first time entrants to HE courses, which are expected to last for at least six months, at UK higher education institutions and English further education colleges, and who remain on their course for at least six months.

	<p pid="b.1851W.8/15">These figures show that the higher education initial participation rate has increased by 2 percentage points between 1999/2000 and 2004/05, representing 29,000 additional initial participants over the period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1851W.8/16">The HEIPR figure for 2005/06 was released in a Statistical First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1851W.8/17">In the face of significant and ongoing growth in the key age-groups in the underlying population, further progress will be similarly challenging. Still, the funded places provided to the Higher Education Funding Council allow for some growth in the participation rate. In addition, demand for higher education remains strong. Figures from UCAS show that the number of applicants from England accepted onto UK higher education courses starting in 2005 increased by 8.9 per cent. in comparison to 2004 (301,798 in 2005 against 277,079 in 2004). In 2006, the number of accepted applicants from England fell by 4.2 per cent. compared to 2005, but this was still up by 4.4 per cent. compared to 2004. The latest figures for 2007 entry (showing the position as at mid-January, which normally represents around 75 per cent. of the final total) show there has been a large increase in applicants from England (up by 7.1 per cent. compared to 2006, and also slightly up by 2.4 per cent. compared to 2005). These figures suggest that more progress on this target is possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1853W.0/1">This is a matter for the Learning and Skills Council, who operate learner support schemes for 16 to 19-year-olds on behalf of the DfES. Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, has written to my hon. Friend with the information requested and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your recent Parliamentary Question that asked, &quot;What support is available to those 16-19 trainees, in addition to Education Maintenance Allowances, who require assistance with accommodation and other living expenses?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/4" class="indent">There are a number of other Learner Support Schemes from which a young person can access financial support. Aside from Education Maintenance Allowance; a young person may be eligible to receive financial assistance with accommodation and living expenses from the Residential Support Scheme and the Discretionary Learner Support Fund (DLSF).</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/5" class="indent">The Further Education Residential Support Scheme enables learners to access education that is not available within reasonable daily travelling distance of the learner's home address. The scheme will pay for residential accommodation and can also help with the associated travelling costs of living away from home.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/6" class="indent">DLSF are available to students who are experiencing financial hardship. Unlike an EMA this is not a weekly allowance but it does provide financial help via a system of one-off payments for students with particular needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/7" class="indent">Funds are held locally and allocated on a discretionary basis. DLSFs can help with the costs of transport, childcare, residential lodgings and course related costs such as books, materials and equipment. It is also available for domestic emergencies. It does not have an income threshold but it is aimed, specifically, at those in greatest need; because of this it is usually income tested in some way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/8" class="indent">Whilst the LSC provides LSF funding, it is administered by a young person's Learning Provider or Local Authorities (LAs). It is for these organisations to decide their own policies in respect of the distribution of DLSFs and to defend these policies locally. Learners should contact their Learning Provider to find out whether they are eligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/9" class="indent">I hope that you find this information addresses your question.</p>

	<p pid="b.1856W.2/1">In 2004 Communities and Local Government commissioned a two year evaluation of six Intensive Family Support Projects which pioneered new ways of working with families at risk of eviction as a result of antisocial behaviour. The evaluation found that in more than eight out of ten families (85 per cent.), at the point at which they exited the projects, complaints about antisocial behaviour had ceased or reduced and tenancies were stabilised resulting in a reduction in the risk of homelessness. Two further pieces of research have been commissioned. One will track a sample of families who worked with the six Intensive Family Support Projects and the other will be on the study that helped inform roll-out of the 53 Family Intervention Projects which the Government announced in April. The findings of both studies (in the case of the second piece, the first stage of the project) will be published later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1862W.5/1">The figures used in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="">14 March</phrase> reported that 206,087,269 kilowatt hours, representing 63 per cent. of the Departments energy came from renewable resources. This figure included that element of 'green' energy that is supplied from good quality combined heat and power, which whilst sustainable, does not meet the criteria for renewable energy. This combined figure for 'green' energy is used internally to highlight the decreasing use of standard &quot;brown&quot; electricity and was therefore used inadvertently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1862W.5/2">For 2005-06 the Department used 175,174,178 kilowatt hours of energy acquired from renewable sources&mdash;accounting for 53.5 per cent. of the total electricity consumption. The remaining 30,913,091 kilowatt hours of 'green' energy was supplied from good quality combined heat and power.</p>

	<p pid="b.1873W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1873W.6/2">We are committed to learning from the policies and experiences of other countries, including the Scandinavian nations which have long established, high quality, universal services for young children and families. We also regularly make assessments of international evidence and experiences as part of our research programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1873W.6/3">The UK has participated in a number of OECD reviews that have identified policy and practice and shared learning from a range of member countries including Sweden. Recent published OECD reports include &quot;Starting Strong: Early Childhood Education and Care (2006)&quot; and &quot;Babies and Bosses&mdash;Reconciling Work and Family Life (Vol. 4): Canada, Finland, Sweden, United Kingdom (2005)&quot;. These reports are available from the OECD website at <a href="http://www.oecd.org">http://www.oecd.org</a>. We also continue to keep up to date with developments in Sweden in the early childhood area through our participation in the OECD Early Education and Care Network.</p>
	<p pid="b.1873W.6/4">We regularly review the wide range of parental leave and pay policies developed by other EU member states, including those of Sweden. Experience from Sweden suggests that despite the long period over which paid parental leave can be taken by either parent, the majority is still taken by mothers during the child's first year, with most fathers taking less than their entitlement. The UK provides a relatively long period of paid maternity leave, and in developing a new entitlement for fathers to take up to six months' additional paternity leave we are focusing available resources on the child's first year. This will give both parents greater choice and flexibility in deciding how to balance work and family commitments, and will fit with the UK's existing statutory leave entitlement and the range of other financial support available for parents.</p>

	<p pid="b.1882W.0/1">The Government have taken significant steps to promote financial literacy for socially excluded groups. For example, in November 2006, the Department for Education and Skills revised the Sure Start Children's Centre good practice guidance to encourage Children's Centres to offer more financial education for parents. The Government also promotes financial skills for adults with poor literacy and numeracy through its 'Skills for Life' strategy and through the National Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan, which has a commitment to address financial literacy for offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1882W.0/2">Integrating financial literacy across a range of public services, particularly those aimed at the most vulnerable, is one of the Government's long term aspirations set out in &quot;Financial Capability: the Government's long-term approach&quot;, which was published in January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1882W.0/3">The Government have also asked Otto Thoresen, Chief Executive of AEGON UK, to design a national approach to generic financial advice. The Thoresen review terms of reference place particular emphasis on meeting the needs of those most vulnerable to the consequences of poor financial decision-making, including socially excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1882W.0/4">The Government will publish an action plan on financial capability, including the outcome of the Thoresen review, early next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1882W.0/5">The Government also continues to tackle financial exclusion&mdash;promoting access to banking and other financial services, affordable credit and money advice. As part of the Government's financial inclusion strategy, the Department of Work and Pensions' &pound;5.4 million &quot;Now Let's Talk Money&quot; campaign is working through trusted intermediaries&mdash;such as housing associations, community groups and charities&mdash;to provide financially excluded people with the information, advice and support they need to take up financial services products.</p>

	<p pid="b.1899W.2/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is currently conducting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the recent penetration of counterfeit Casodex, Zyprexa and Plavix into the regulated supply chain which led to the class 1 recalls. The number of patients affected will not be known until the completion of the recall and the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1899W.2/2">A class 1 recall, a system to recall medicines with immediate effect, was undertaken because initial analysis has shown a reduced amount of the correct active ingredient present in each of the counterfeit products. Counterfeit products commonly contain reduced quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are unlikely to have been manufactured to good manufacturing standards and may contain impurities which put health at risk. The class 1 recalls were considered necessary as evidence suggested these products may have reached pharmacy and patient level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1899W.2/3">The extent of counterfeit medicine in circulation worldwide is difficult to estimate. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has published estimates suggesting up to 10 per cent. of medicines globally are counterfeit. This is more prevalent in developing countries and less so in developed nations. Within developed nations WHO estimate that up to 1 per cent. of medicines may be counterfeit. The European Commission has recognised that counterfeiting is a growing problem within the European Union and has undertaken a study to identify any legislative and regulatory weaknesses with a view to exploring policy options. As with all other member states, the United Kingdom has provided information on local experiences, statistics and strategies associated with combating counterfeiting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1899W.2/4">The MHRA is developing a strategy which will address the risks to patient safety from counterfeit medicines by providing a comprehensive approach through the implementation of strategic and operational measures to minimise the risk of counterfeit medicines reaching patients through both the regulated and unregulated supply chains. This strategy is being reviewed to take into account the recent incidents and subsequent intelligence gathered from industry and our international counterparts. Resource issues are part of this strategy. The strategy will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1899W.2/5">MHRA works closely with law enforcement and other regulatory bodies both nationally and internationally. MHRA hosts regular meetings with stakeholders within industry, law enforcement and regulatory bodies, intelligence concerning counterfeit medicines is reviewed and assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1899W.2/6">Strong links exist between the MHRA and other law enforcement agencies. MHRA works closely with the Serious and Organised Crime Agency to establish links between organised crime and counterfeit medicines.</p>

	<p pid="b.1915W.2/1">The Government are committed to reducing the number of patients who are delayed in hospital, even though they are fit to be discharged. As part of the strategy to tackle this problem, since January 2004 if a patient is delayed in discharging from acute services solely because community care arrangements are lacking, the culpable local authority will have to reimburse the acute national health service trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.1915W.2/2">In order to help councils with social services responsibility, whether or not they operate care homes for the elderly, &pound;100 million has been transferred from the NHS for each year since 2003-04 to defray the cost of any reimbursements. Those councils that reduce the number of such delayed transfers can reinvest the money saved in alternative social services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1915W.2/3">We have made no estimate of the cost of delayed discharges to the NHS, the effect on operation waiting times, or the development and spread of hospital-acquired infections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1915W.2/4">We have made no assessment of the effect of delayed discharge by either local authority run, or privately run, elderly care homes.

	<p pid="b.1915W.5/1">The Medical Devices Agency (now part of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)) conducted an extensive study into the effects of a wide range of mobile communication equipment on 178 different models of medical device in 1997. The results indicated that only 4 per cent. of the medical devices tested suffered interference from mobile phones at a distance of one metre, with less than 0.1 per cent. showing serious effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1915W.5/2">The results of this study were published in the Device Bulletin DB 9702 'Electromagnetic Compatibility of Medical Devices with Mobile Communications'. This advice has been reviewed on a regular basis by the MHRA since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1915W.5/3">An update document, SN 2001(06) was published in March 2001, which covered the potential interference with medical devices by TETRA radio systems employed by the emergency services and media broadcasts from hospital premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1915W.5/4">Most recently, the MHRA published guidance on its website in July 2004. This guidance advised that healthcare providers should actively manage the use of radio frequency spectrum on their own sites, and consider the potential effects of communication equipment on all medical devices.</p>
	<p pid="b.1915W.5/5">The Department issued guidance on mobile phone usage in May 2007, available on the Department's website, which contains suggestions on where mobile phones should and should not be used.</p>

	<p pid="b.1915W.5/7">Subject to carrying out a risk assessment trusts may wish to consider allowing the use of mobile phones in the following areas: hospital reception and entrance areas; non-clinical communal areas which may including day rooms and cafe areas; specially designated rooms/areas; public corridors.</p>

	<p pid="b.1917W.0/1">Prior to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issuing its original guideline on the use of methylphenidate (Ritalin) in October 2000 no clinical guidance had been issued, other than the prescribing guidance that comes with a licensed medicinal product.</p>
	<p pid="b.1917W.0/2">In March 2006, NICE reviewed its earlier advice on methylphenidate and included in their guideline other drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&mdash;atomoxetine and dexamphetamine. NICE has estimated that around 5 per cent. of school-aged children meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, equivalent to 366,000 children and adolescents in England and Wales, but not all these children will require medication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1917W.0/3">Drug therapy should only be part of a comprehensive treatment programme that includes a range of social, psychological and behavioural interventions. These are mainly aimed at the child, but sometimes involve the parents and/or teachers. NICE has recommended that drug treatment for ADHD should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional with expertise in ADHD and should be based on a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug treatment may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1917W.0/4">NICE is currently developing a clinical guideline on both the pharmacological and psychological interventions to treat ADHD. Publication of the guideline is expected in July 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1918W.5/1">In welcoming the clinical guideline published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in 2004, we advised that the Department would be looking to primary care trusts (PCTs) who provided no in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment to meet a minimum level of one cycle of IVF by April 2005, and to make progress to the full implementation of the guideline in the longer term. We are funding the patient support organisation Infertility Network UK (I N UK) to help primary care trusts share best practice and engage with fertility patients in the planning and prioritisation of fertility services. The questionnaire issued to PCTs by I N UK will help to inform that work and we are discussing the findings with them. The primary responsibility for the provision of fertility services, including the application of social access criteria, rests with the national health service at local level and we have not collected data centrally. The need to restore financial balance has meant that a small number of primary care trusts have suspended the provision of IVF, and the reinstatement of the service is a matter for them, taking account of local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1922W.4/2">On the <phrase class="date" code="">7 March</phrase> we announced that a review of the recruitment processes into specialty training and the Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) would be undertaken by Professor Neil Douglas, Vice President of the Academy of Royal Colleges. Members of the review group included representatives of the Royal Colleges, the British Medical Association, the four United Kingdom Health Departments and NHS Employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/3">In March we also conducted a high level review of the functionality of the MTAS system and whether it was delivering what it was designed to deliver. The conclusion was that the system met its specification, was stable, performed acceptably and contained the necessary functionality to be fit for the purpose for which it was designed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/4">The Review Group made a number of recommendations about the 2007 recruitment process after listening to concerns from doctors and in the light of its own work. These have been implemented including:</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/5" class="indent">giving all applicants in England at least one interview;</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/6" class="indent">making technical enhancements to MTAS;</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/7" class="indent">improving the helpdesk;</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/8" class="indent">improving the business processes within deaneries;</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/9" class="indent">establishing a deanery based process for matching applicants to training posts in Round 1, and</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/10" class="indent">that Round 2 should be managed locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.4/11">After the security breaches in April we changed the way MTAS was used. Once a full security review deemed the MTAS site to be secure, it was re-opened on <phrase class="date" code="">4 May</phrase> and restricted to postgraduate deaneries only, to support the next steps in the recruitment process. The system will continue to be used for national monitoring to ensure that training post are filled efficiently.</p>

For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some BNF sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community.</p>

	<p pid="b.1932W.2/1">Trafford Primary Care Trust (PCT) is putting in place a range of measures to reduce waiting times for psychological therapy services. These include establishing joint working practices across primary care mental health services and primary care psychology services, setting up a single point of access to services and introducing an improved waiting list management service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1932W.2/2">We made a manifesto commitment in 2005 to increase the provision of psychological therapies. This followed 2001 Department guidelines on treatment choice in psychological therapies and 2004 guidance, &quot;Organising and Delivering Psychological Therapies&quot;, to help local services to understand best practice and how to organise local services to support access. Last year we embarked on a new programme, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies, to provide more effective and timely access to psychological therapies for people with mild to moderate mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression.</p>

There has been a change in the terminology of the registers, blind and partial sight should now be expressed as severely sight impaired (blind) and sight impaired (partially sighted).<br/>  Registration of blindness is voluntary. However, it is a pre-condition for the receipt of certain financial benefits. It is this factor which gives greater credibility to the &quot;Register of the Severely Sight Impaired&quot; than to the &quot;Register of the Sight Impaired&quot; and to other disability registration records maintained by councils, where the voluntary principle also applies. Registration is not, however, a pre-requisite for certain social services concessions and this factor, combined with uncertainties about the regularity with which the councils review and update their records, makes it difficult to assign a degree of reliability to either of these registers.<br/>  For people to be registered as severely or partially sight impaired they must first undergo an examination by a consultant ophthalmologist. The consultant records his or her findings on the Certificate of Visual Impairment (CVI) formerly the BD8, on which the consultant also certifies whether or not the person meets the statutory definition of blindness or the non-statutory definition of partial sight.<br/>  The statutory definition of blindness is that a person should be &quot;so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential&quot;.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1938W.2/1">In each case, the Border and Immigration Agency first establishes whether there are special circumstances that would require an applicant to be housed in London or in a specific location outside London (for example if a medical condition was treatable only in a limited number of hospitals in the UK). If no such circumstances exist, asylum applicants who require accommodation are allocated to a case owner in one of the Border and Immigration Agency's regions outside London. This reflects the Border and Immigration Agency's policy of housing destitute asylum seekers away from London and the South East in places where accommodation is more freely available and in a manner which represents better value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.2/2">Once any special circumstances have been ruled out, the decision to allocate to a particular region is made by the Border and Immigration Agency staff and is based upon a complex algorithm incorporating information on the availability of accommodation, the numbers of asylum seekers already housed in that region, the need to ensure each accommodation provider receives an equitable share of the Border and Immigration Agency business and the availability of the Border and Immigration Agency caseowner resource in that region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.2/3">Once an applicant has been allocated to a particular region, the accommodation provider then has some latitude as to in which town or city in that region the applicant is housed. The Regional Strategic Coordination Groups are a forum through which local authorities, accommodation providers, the Border and Immigration Agency and other key players should be able to influence, over time, the spread of the available accommodation within that region.</p>

Alleygating schemes are local initiatives, implemented based on local priorities and therefore an assessment of the contribution of such a scheme is a matter for local agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1950W.5/2">Alleygating is one of a number of ways of incorporating crime prevention measures into existing environments. We are also working with a range of partners including Communities and Local Government, local authorities, architects, designers, builders and others to ensure that when new buildings or communities are planned they are well designed places where crime prevention is taken into account from the outset so that crime and disorder or the fear of crime do not undermine quality of life or community cohesion.</p>

	<p pid="b.1960W.5/1">Every removal centre is required to have a health care team, at least one member of which must be a doctor trained as a general practitioner, to provide primary health care services to detainees. Removal centre contractors operate healthcare by a mixture of full-time employees and outsourced providers. No centre directly employs a doctor; their services are provided under contract by local practices or the local primary care trusts or health authority, and therefore there are no full-time equivalents.
