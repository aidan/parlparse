	<p pid="a.445W.4/1">The Ministry of Defence and the International Security Assistance Force do not maintain an overall estimate of the number of insurgents killed in Afghanistan. To collect and verify such information is extremely difficult given the nature of the conflict, and the risks involved would outweigh the benefits of obtaining the information. There is also no reliable method to calculate the number of insurgents killed.</p>
	<p pid="a.445W.4/2">The long-term strategy for defeating the insurgency in Afghanistan is not as a purely military campaign but rather through a wide range of military and non-military activities. As such, the number of insurgents killed or injured during the campaign does not provide a useful measure of success.</p>

	<p pid="a.447W.2/1">Operation Telic has evolved through a number of separate phases since the start of operations in 2003. Initial high-intensity war fighting soon transitioned to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations, and in 2009 there was a fundamental change of mission to training and mentoring. Planning for the future of Operation Telic is the subject of ongoing work but the partnership between the UK and Iraq will continue to be strengthened through co-operation in a range of areas including the economy, culture, commerce, education and defence. It is clearly in the UK's interest to continue to develop a strong bilateral relationship with Iraq and in support of this we will look to build on our long tradition of defence co-operation. The nature and timing of such co-operation will depend on the wishes and approval of the Iraqi Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.448W.10/1">The Wales Office was established in July 1999. From 1999 until 2004 the maintenance of its building in London was undertaken through contracts managed by the National Assembly for Wales, and since then this has been done through Ministry of Justice contracts. Charges made by the Ministry of Justice to the Wales Office do not split costs down to light bulbs. If these figures could be obtained, it would be at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.457W.3/1">The Environment Agency continues to monitor for the presence of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), as a consequence of the Buncefield explosion in December 2005. This monitoring showed a peak in concentrations of pollutants indicative of fire fighting foam and petrol during 2006. Since 2006 the concentrations have reduced but the Environment Agency's monitoring still shows these pollutants consistently throughout the chalk aquifer, with higher levels under the site itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.3/2">The detection of PFOS in the aquifer has not resulted in any impact on drinking water quality. The quality of drinking water in England is regulated by the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000. The requirements of these regulations are enforced by the Drinking Water Inspectorate. Although standards are not specified for all chemical compounds in existence, the regulations do require that, in order to be considered &quot;wholesome&quot;, drinking water must not contain any substance at a level which would constitute a potential danger to human health.</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.3/3">The Drinking Water Inspectorate has issued guidance on the levels of PFOS perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) that water companies should act on in order to fulfil their statutory obligations to ensure the safety of drinking water. This guidance was based on independent advice from the Health Protection Agency. Weekly monitoring by the water company of treated drinking water supplied to consumers has shown that detections of PFOS are significantly below trigger levels in place to protect public health.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.0/1">Regulations are in place which make it an offence to display or offer for sale the most endangered species via any medium, including the internet. Nevertheless, the UK is working with the international community, and chairs a convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES) e-commerce group, to assess the best means of reducing or tackling such offences. As part of this process DEFRA will be considering introducing a code of conduct for internet operators to raise awareness of the legal situation, and in doing so take account of the experiences of other countries in drawing up such a code, including the means and merits of a reporting element.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.0/2">Animal Health's wildlife licensing and registration service (WLRS) already has systems in place for the reporting of suspected illegal trade in CITES listed species and their parts and derivatives, including a telephone number and e-mail address. Suspected illegal trade in CITES and non-CITES listed species can also be reported to the police, or in the case of imports and exports to the HM Revenue and Customs confidential hot-line (which is shared with the UK Border Agency).</p>

	<p pid="a.467W.3/1">It is forecast that traffic levels on the A3 between Liphook and Petersfield following the opening of the Hindhead tunnel will be around 38,000 vehicles per average day.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/2">By comparison the flow on the A3 in the five years between 2004 and 2009 remained consistent at 35,000 vehicles per average day.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/3">The A3 Hindhead scheme, including a 1.2 mile tunnel under the Devils Punchbowl Site of Special Scientific Interest, started construction in January 2007 and is planned to open in early July 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/4">The section of A3 for which traffic flows have been requested lies to the south of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/5">The increase in traffic on scheme opening is largely due to drivers returning to the A3 from other routes used to avoid the congestion at the A3/A287 traffic lights in Hindhead.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/6">The forecast includes a relatively small amount of traffic generated as a result of the journey time improvement and reliability delivered by the scheme. The reason this aspect of the increase is small, is due to network constraints through Guildford and at M25 J10.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.11/2">The Highways Agency does consider and, following successful trials, has implemented restrictions on heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) using the overtaking lanes on motorways and trunk roads to ease congestion. Examples of this are on the M42 between J10 and 11, and the A14 in Northamptonshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.11/3">Similarly, in May 2010 the Highways Agency made permanent restrictions on two sections on the A1(M) southbound in County Durham at junction 63 to north of junction 62 at Lumley Road Bridge, Great Lumley and at junction 61 north of Coxhoe to north of junction 60 at Bishop Middleham. At these sections HGVs are restricted from using lane 2 (the right hand lane in the direction of travel) between 7.00 am and 7.00 pm, seven days a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.11/4">The agency has also considered introducing overtaking restrictions for HGVs on other sections of the A1, including A1 south of the A57 at Markham Moor; A1 south of Grantham; A1 south of Stamford (between the A6121 and Carpenter's Lodge Roundabout); A1 junction 49 (junction of A1/A168) to start of A1(M) at junction 56; end of A1(M) at junction 65 to A1/A697 junction; B6345 overbridge at Felton, Northumberland to approximately one mile north of B1340 overbridge at Denwick, Northumberland; and the dual carriageway section near North Charlton, Northumberland. However, analysis has shown there to be either insufficient justification or an adverse impact on safety for traffic emerging from side roads at these locations thus discounting the introduction of HGV overtaking restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.11/5">When considering whether to prohibit heavy goods vehicles from lane 2 on the A1 dual carriageway the Highways Agency considers whether:</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.11/6" class="indent">there is insufficient HGV traffic volume;</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.11/7" class="indent">there are frequent at-grade junctions that break the flow of HGVs naturally;</p>

	<p pid="a.469W.2/3">For drivers who have already embarked on their journey, variable message signs (VMS) are used to inform them of any problems ahead.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-07-12a.7104.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-07-12a.473W.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40594" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="473W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100712/text/100712w0002.htm#10071232000356">
	<p pid="a.473W.7/1">The national health service bowel cancer screening programme in England began by inviting people aged 60 to 69 to be screened because over 80% of bowel cancers are diagnosed in those aged over 60. Although the pilot on which the programme was based invited people aged 50 to 69, those in their 60s were more likely to complete a testing kit. There was also insufficient endoscopy capacity at the time to invite a wider age range. This decision was informed by a formal options appraisal undertaken in 2004 by the School for Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield. The programme is currently being extended to people aged 70 to their 75th birthday, and the review of the Cancer Reform Strategy will consider how best we can extend screening to people in their 50s.</p>

	<p pid="a.473W.7/34">Funding for the programme will rise to around &#163;120 million per year once the age extension to people aged 70 to their 75th birthday is fully implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.473W.7/35">The average cost of issuing and analysing a bowel cancer testing kit is a local operational cost, which is not held centrally. The ScHARR 2004 options appraisal estimated that the cost of a faecal occult blood testing kit was &#163;10 per person invited, comprising of the cost of two kits (to cover repeat tests and non-compliance), analysis of the kits and sending results letters. An additional &#163;1.74 per person invited was estimated for administration costs.</p>

Bow Cross and Leopold are part of the Kickstart projects that were successful at the due diligence process under round 2 of Kickstart and still subject to approval. The Holland Estates is a National Affordable Housing programme project. Bids for this project received in January are still being appraised.

This was demonstrated by the Prime Minister's recent commitments made at the G8 for women and children's health. There are numerous ways in which DFID demonstrates its commitment to child health. For example, we are increasing the number of children under-five who are immunized against childhood diseases, backed by &#163;150 million over 10 years to the GAVI Alliance. We work to tackle under nutrition which contributes to one third of child deaths as well as one fifth of maternal deaths. We are increasing our support to the prevention and treatment of malaria. Some 90% of deaths to malaria are in children and malaria is the cause of one in five child deaths in Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.2/1">Combating all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, remains an important part of the Government's human rights agenda. We condemn all instances of violence and discrimination against individuals and groups because of their race, faith or belief. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's overseas missions have a responsibility to monitor and raise human rights in their host countries and routinely raise our concerns with host governments. Where possible our embassies take action on individual cases where persecution or discrimination has occurred and lobby for changes in discriminatory practices and laws. The Government also support the All Party Parliamentary Group against anti-Semitism and their work on tackling anti-Semitism across Europe and encourages MEPs to get involved in tackling anti-Semitism in their own countries. We will continue to promote these issues within the EU, the UN, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other multilateral fora.</p>

The Government are arguing that payments in the 2011 EU budget should remain at cash levels equivalent to the 2010 budget. Further, we will continue to engage with counterparts across the EU to build support where possible to end the wasteful dual sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and Brussels.</p>

The combined impacts of tax, tax credits and benefit changes have been assessed by household expenditure and income as set out in Annex A of the Red Book. Analysis of VAT at an individual level could be misleading as although goods and services are purchased by an individual they may be utilised by other individuals within the household. The Government therefore believe that analysis at a household level is the most appropriate. It is not possible to provide the total additional tax paid by individuals in the different income tax bands of all other tax measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.550W.4/1">The equipment under Project Champion, whether ANPR or CCTV, does not have either facial recognition or audio monitoring facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.4/2">The locations of the cameras installed under Project Champion are provided in maps (marked with stars) of Hall Green and Washwood Heath constituencies which have been placed in the Libraries of the House. It should be noted that there are a number of locations starred on the map where there are multiple cameras in the same place.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.4/3">ANPR provides a tactical option to disrupt, deter and detect criminal activity and, by doing so, helps to increase public confidence in the police. The technology automatically reads vehicle registration marks (VRMs) allowing these details to be compared against database records. Therefore, ANPR does not &quot;track&quot; every journey but relies on intelligence-led policing and flags VRMs which are linked to criminality and allows the police to focus on those engaged in unlawful activity; law-abiding road users go unhindered by ANPR technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.4/4">ANPR systems are used by the police, government agencies and commercial companies including petrol forecourts, shopping centres and car parks. The system design and intended use of Project Champion ANPR capability is consistent with policy, practice and guidance from ACPO, NPIA and extensive evaluation studies including former Police Standards Unit work on behalf of Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.4/5">With regard to CCTV, I am advised that no device was located with the purpose of monitoring a specific individual or individuals. The system design and intended use of Project Champion CCTV capability is consistent with existing force policy, including advice contained in the CCTV Privacy Masking Guide issued by the British Security Industry Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.4/6">It is important to note that on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July 2010</phrase> West Midlands police announced that a number of cameras installed under Project Champion would be removed, and that the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit would no longer have any involvement with the scheme. This follows an earlier announcement in June that the activation of the cameras would be suspended, pending a full public consultation later this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.4/7">This Government will never compromise the safety and security of the British public but neither will we sacrifice their civil liberties for their security. The Government sees a need to re-examine the balance between liberty and security and, as part of this broader agenda, is looking closely at the regulatory framework for both CCTV and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems. Work is currently under way with a view to bringing forward proposals as soon as possible.</p>

The police have a range of powers to deal with any criminal activity that takes place at a demonstration. The police are committed to using their powers to ensure local communities and property are protected and I understand that a number of individuals have been arrested and charged at previous demonstrations. Local police forces do work closely with local community leaders in planning the policing of such demonstrations, and ACPO have provided good practice advice for these events.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.4/2">The public sector is now paying suppliers faster than ever before. For the private sector, Experian calculate that Prompt Payment Code signatories now represent over 60% of UK supply chain value and there have been over 165,000 downloads of the Managing Cash Flow guides:</p>

We also know that over half of UK business transactions are not covered by pre-agreed payment terms and that nine out of ten suppliers fail to credit check their customers regularly. Supporting UK business to better manage cash flow and customer relationships can therefore make a huge impact upon payment times and we are working with the UK's leading finance and business representative organisations to improve awareness.</p>

	<p pid="a.555W.8/1">Like any employer, the Department has to act in accordance with a wide variety of regulation, ranging from for instance health and safety law to employment law. However, it is not standard accounting practice to distinguish regulatory compliance costs from overall running costs, whether of EU origin or domestic.</p>
	<p pid="a.555W.8/2">There is therefore no pre-existing breakdown of the costs imposed on it by EU regulations upon which the Department can draw to produce an estimate of such compliance. To produce such an estimate would be a major undertaking, and would involve disproportionate expenditure. By way of comparison, the administrative burdens measurement exercise, which provided an indicative estimate of administrative burdens across the UK economy, cost in excess of &#163;10 million to undertake.</p>

This Government have already committed to changes to the funding system through the introduction of a pupil premium for disadvantaged children. As well as the premium, any changes to the funding system will need to support our policy objective of raising standards and closing the attainment gap between those from the richest and poorest in society.

	<p pid="a.567W.11/5" class="indent">Information about the number of pupils on roll and the number of pupils eligible for free school meals in each school has been taken from the Department for Education's <phrase class="date" code="">2009 January</phrase> School Census. The number on roll at each school has been adjusted, in line with Department for Education National Statistics, to remove part time pupils aged under five and any students aged 16 or over at the start of the academic year as they are not able to claim free school meals regardless of their economic circumstances. Information on which schools were open on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-21">21 April 2010</phrase> has been taken from the Department for Education's Edubase system.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.11/6" class="indent">In this answer the term 'secondary school' is used to cover maintained secondary schools including middle deemed secondary schools, academies and city technology colleges.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.11/7" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> there were 22,249 schools open and eligible for a section 5 inspection in England. Two hundred and fifty-eight open schools which have not yet been inspected by Ofsted are excluded from this analysis, as are maintained nursery schools, special schools and pupil referral units. This leaves a pool of 16,904 primary schools and 3,189 secondary schools to contribute to this answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.11/8" class="indent">Of those primary schools judged outstanding during their most recent inspection, 12.8% of pupils were recorded as eligible for free school meals.

It is for each local authority to decide what they charge for a school meal, based, for example, on the local cost of food, catering services, fuel costs and whether, and if so how much, they subsidise school meals. From this local authorities then decide how much cost they can apportion to a free school meal.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.2/2">The legislation that protects school playing fields, under section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, extends to all of a school's outdoor areas. No school or local authority in England can dispose or change the use of a school playing field or any part of a school playing field without the Secretary of State's consent. The legislation defines playing fields as land in the open air which is provided for the purposes of physical education or recreation, and includes playgrounds, hard games courts, social areas etc as well as grassed playing fields.</p>

We have adopted a fair approach to the reductions in grants and funding streams and have limited the amount councils lose. The impact on the area of reductions in grants this year will be for the local authority to decide. We have ensured that councils, including Birmingham, are able to deliver essential frontline services by making no changes to the &#163;29 billion they receive through Formula Grant and by increasing flexibility for local spending decisions through removing restrictions on how they spend their money.</p>

	<p pid="a.588W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/consultation-cp08-10.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/consultation-cp08-10.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.588W.8/3">The initial impact assessment states there may be a travel cost impact on users of magistrates and county courts and that fewer courts could increase journey times and costs for court users such as victims, witnesses, general public, businesses, solicitors, barristers, police and NOMS-both probation services and prisoner transfers. However, consolidation of the court estate both in terms of function as well as location could mean that some court users will make fewer trips to court, e.g. CPS officers and solicitors may have to travel to fewer courts, and so lessening the overall impact. Fewer courts may also reduce the need for duty solicitors, decreasing costs incurred by the Legal Services Commission.</p>

These project the prison population under three different scenarios (high, medium and low), based on different assumptions about future sentencing trends. The projected populations in the next three years (at the end of June) are in the following table. Although the published prison population projections did not anticipate the change in March 2010, the figures provided here incorporate the impact of the ending of End of Custody Licence (ECL).</p>
