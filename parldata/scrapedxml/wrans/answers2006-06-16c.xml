There are complex and overlapping issues affecting the whole group. All the applicants involved, including those who made final submissions, have been asked for further information in relation to their application. In a number of cases replies have not been received. The remainder were submitted to him within the last 12 months.

In these cases final submissions have not been made by the applicants and information regarding the level of compensation being claimed is awaited from the applicants or their representatives, before final assessments can be considered by the Assessor.</p>

	<p pid="c.1428W.2/1">There are an estimated 67,556 individuals who have a DNA profile on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) taken by Avon and Somerset constabulary, of which 1,994 are currently under 16 years of age and 65,562 are 16 years or over (as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-30">30 May 2006</phrase>). Information held on the NDNAD is available on a police force area basis only and although the DNA sample in these cases was taken by Avon and Somerset constabulary, the individuals to whom the sample relates will not necessarily be resident in Avon and Somerset.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.2/2">Data on whether these individuals have been convicted or acquitted of a criminal offence are held on the police national computer (PNC) but not on the NDNAD.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.2/3">PNC data are available for 60,521 individuals only, of which 1,490 are under 16 years of age and 59,031 are 16 years or over. Of the 1,490 persons who are under 16, 1,243 have not been convicted of an offence and of the 59,031 persons who are 16 years or over, 15,824 have not been convicted of an offence. (It should be noted that for the purposes of these data, cautions are included as non convictions.)</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.2/4">The difference of approximately 7,000 individuals between the NDNAD records and the PNC records is largely accounted for by the fact that, until recently, records for persons who were acquitted of an offence were removed from the PNC, but retained on the NDNAD. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the ages of these 7,000 who were acquitted as the records are no longer available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1429W.2/1">There is no requirement in the contracts for contractors to record separately the movement of pregnant and mobility impaired prisoners. Information on the transport of pregnant or mobility impaired prisoners in cellular vehicles is not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.2/2">There are a number of methods by which prisoners may make complaints. These are to prison staff at the establishment or to the senior operational manager as well as to Prison Service HQ. Complaints may also be made by prisoners under transport to the contractors. It has not proved possible to separate out complaints made by or about pregnant or mobility impaired prisoners from available records.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.2/3">All prisoners should be assessed as being fit for travel by a health care professional before being transported. Guidance has been issued to all women's prisons to remind them of correct assessment procedures and there is a strong presumption that pregnant prisoners should not travel in cellular vehicles. A similar presumption applies to the transport of mobility impaired prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="c.1429W.5/2">Prisoners are usually transferred when their security category has been changed, to enable them to meet the requirements of their sentence plan, for compassionate reasons, as part of their preparation for release and for operational security reasons. High population levels can also lead to prisoners being transferred to establishments with a greater number of vacancies.</p>

Conditions which relate to victims, might for example, include non-contact with the victim or members of their families or a geographical exclusion zone into which the offender is not allowed to travel.

	<p pid="c.1445W.2/2">The annual Food Standards Agency's consumer attitudes survey is used to track 5 A DAY awareness and consumption. The survey shows knowledge of the 5 A DAY message has increased from 43 per cent. in 2000 to 67 per cent. in 2005, while those claiming to have eaten at least five portions of fruit and vegetables the previous day has risen from 26 per cent. in 2000 to 30 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.2/3">The national foundation for educational research (NFER), in partnership with Leeds University, was commissioned by the Big Lottery Fund to carry out an evaluation of the school fruit and vegetable scheme. Results published in September 2005 demonstrated that children ate significantly more fruit while participating in the scheme. The results showed that increased consumption of fruit was not sustained when children's participation in the scheme came to an end. However, there was some evidence of increased knowledge of healthy eating, particularly in children from deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.2/4">We will be working to integrate the scheme more closely with other healthy eating initiatives in schools, to provide opportunities to maintain the behaviour change achieved by participation in the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.1446W.8/1">The Water Act 2003 introduced competition in water supply for large users. Licensed water suppliers are now able to compete with statutory water companies to supply customers with a consumption of at least 50 million litres per year. The Act provides a mechanism to alter the customer consumption threshold. A review of the threshold will take place in 2008 to consider the impact of the regime on drinking water quality, environmental protection, customer service and prices for eligible and other customers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1447W.2/1">Leakage targets are set and monitored by the Economic Regulator, Ofwat. They require water companies to compare the cost of reducing leakage and the value of the water saved, including any associated environmental and social costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.1447W.2/2">In March 2003, the tripartite group of Defra, the Environment Agency and Ofwat published the report, &quot;Future approaches to leakage target setting for water companies in England and Wales&quot;. This sets out the best practice principles in the economic level of leakage calculation. Ofwat assesses the water companies' economic levels of leakage analyses against these principles.</p>
	<p pid="c.1447W.2/3">As well as analysing the companies' economic assessments, Ofwat also monitors their annual performance in managing leakage. This is done through an annual submission to Ofwat known as the June Return. Through this return the companies provide a full reconciliation of how all treated water put into supply is used, including the volume lost to leakage.</p>

	<p pid="c.1448W.1/1">The concept of a national water grid has been raised many times in the last 30 years and was has never been considered remotely viable. It was most recently discussed at the Secretary of State's meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase> with representatives of water companies and the water industry regulators. It was rejected by all those present on the grounds of its disproportionate and unjustifiable cost, both for the environment and for water bills, compared with the benefits such a grid could deliver. This stance was informed by a recent desk study undertaken by the Environment Agency, which will be published later this summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1448W.1/2">A good deal of water is already transferred within water companies' areas of operation to give individual companies greater flexibility to meet local shortages. Longer distance links have long been established between, for example, Wales and the West Midlands and South East Lancashire, the Lake District and Lancashire, and from the Fenland watercourses to Essex.</p>
	<p pid="c.1448W.1/3">The Environment Agency, in consultation with Ofwat, is able to propose to a water company that it enters into a bulk supply agreement with another water company, where it is necessary to secure the proper use of water resources.</p>

In February, we and international partners formally presented President Kabila with a dossier cataloguing major abuses carried out by Congolese armed forces, including rape and sexual violence. We demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice.

	<p pid="c.1457W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-29">29 April 2005</phrase> our high commission in Kampala issued a press release which reaffirmed the elements we considered necessary to achieving a legitimate process of political and constitutional change in Uganda. These included establishment of the rules for multi-party competition and separation of the organs of state from the Movement in law and practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.5/2">In that statement we made clear that we were concerned by several aspects of the transition, including that insufficient progress had been made towards establishing a fair basis for a multi-party system. We therefore decided then to withhold &pound;5 million of budget support (out of a total of &pound;40 million for the financial year).</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.5/3">We have not received, nor would we expect to, a formal response to our press release. We have of course maintained a high-level dialogue with the Government of Uganda on all aspects of the transition to a multi-party system in the run up to the multi-party elections in February 2006. I will arrange for a copy of the statement to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.1464W.9/4">The savings realised by this change will be re-invested in the programme, and, as a result of this change, support for disabled people will be more greatly focused towards those disabled people who work for small and medium sized employers.</p>

A breakdown of this figure by gender and Welsh parliamentary constituency is in the table. This information was not available for the reply I gave to my hon. friend on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 721-22 because the data then available for the numbers of recipients of carer's allowance at <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August 2005</phrase> were rounded to the nearest 100, and this did not permit figures for the recipients of a non-standard rate of the allowance in each constituency to be provided where they numbered fewer than 50. The new statistical data are rounded to the nearest 10 and, as shown in the table, this does permit figures for the recipients in each constituency to be provided where they number five or more. The estimated additional annual cost to public funds of paying the standard weekly rate of carer's allowance to the carers listed in the table, rather than the non-standard rate they are receiving, would be around &pound;1.25 million at current benefit rates.</p>

	<p pid="c.1468W.2/2">It is a basic principle of the social security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for the same purpose. Even though the circumstances which give rise to entitlement to carer's allowance and state pension are different, they are both designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or forgone income. Carer's allowance was designed to provide a measure of replacement income where the duties of caring for a severely disabled person prevent the prospect of full-time work and the earnings it would yield. State pension was designed to provide a replacement income in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1468W.2/3">Although an entitlement to both benefits will mean that carer's allowance is not payable, or not payable in full, an underlying entitlement to carer's allowance gives access to additional financial support through the carer premium in housing benefit and council tax benefit and since 2003 the additional amount for carers in state pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.1470W.2/1">The Performance and Development System (PDS) appraisal policy, introduced for the 2003-04 financial year, allows the allocation of a Lower (U) box mark to denote unsatisfactory performance:</p>
	<p pid="c.1470W.2/2" class="indent">In 2004-05, 35 people were awarded a Lower (U) box mark. This represented 0.03 per cent. of the total number of employees (127,828) allocated a box mark in this period.</p>

Previous to this, each of the businesses had their own guidance on disciplinary procedures. It is possible that this change in process may account for some of the change in the numbers allocated Lower (U) between 2003-04 and 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="c.1470W.2/5">Previous to the introduction of PDS, there were several box marking systems in concurrent use in different parts of the DWP. There was not a universally applicable equivalent of the PDS Lower (U) category and, hence, it is not possible to provide comparable statistics for 2002-03.</p>

	<p pid="c.1473W.0/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/2" class="italic"> Disability Equality Scheme</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/3">One of the main ways DWP is already working towards ensuring compliance with existing and new Disability Discrimination legislation is through publication of its Disability Equality Schemes by <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>. Businesses and corporate centre directorates will be involving disabled people in developing action plans for tackling problem areas and identifying positive actions to address these. The process to develop our Schemes was formally launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April 2006</phrase> by the Permanent Secretary. We have begun the process of involving both staff and customers in developing our Schemes and are planning a training strategy to ensure our staff are aware of the new legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/4" class="italic"> Equality Impact Assessment</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/5">We advise that all parts of DWP undertake to consider the potential impact of policy and services on all equality groups and we are implementing a new impact assessment tool across all diversity areas. We have already undertaken at least three impact assessments taking into account disability, with a number of additional assessments in the process of being completed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/6" class="italic"> Premises</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/7">DWP commissioned public access audits of all its premises used by the public during 2003. The results were used to develop a programme of public access improvements that was implemented in the following year and completed in March 2005, with the exception of a small number of Jobcentre Plus refurbishment programme sites, scheduled for completion in June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/8">A total of 1,735 buildings were surveyed with access impotents works being undertaken at 1,032 sites at a cost of &pound;4 million. The existing public access provisions are subject to annual review and any future additional requirement is built into the annual maintenance work programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/9" class="italic"> Disability Confident</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/10">The Department has worked in partnership with the Employers' Forum on Disability (EFD) in order to address the needs of its disabled customers. In particular, it has contributed, along with other public and private organisations, to the highly acclaimed interactive &quot;Disability Confident&quot; training resource pack.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/11" class="italic"> Reasonable Adjustment pilots</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/12">DWP has been running two pilot exercises in the Disability and Carers' Service (DCS) on a revised process for delivering reasonable adjustments. The development of the new process was partly in response to the length of time it took to assess and put reasonable adjustments into place and partly to ensure that the recommended adjustment was the most suitable for that individual. The new process opens formal communication channels between suppliers and so far, the results have been positive. There has been a notable reduction in the time it is taking to achieve a successful outcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/13">A third pilot is due to start in Jobcentre Plus shortly. We are already planning national implantation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/14" class="italic"> Diversity toolkit</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/15">We want our staff to understand and embrace diversity. An important part of achieving this has been our Diversity Toolkit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/16">The Toolkit makes all our diversity and equality information in one place. It sits on our internal website, where staff can work through its training modules at their own pace.</p>
	<p pid="c.1473W.0/17">The Toolkit has been commended by the Institute of Welfare and is now being used, not only by them but also by around 70 other organisations, including the Metropolitan Police.</p>

In common with all Government Departments, DWP has in place standard pre-appointment checks which are carried out during the recruitment process and which are intended to ensure that the employment status of all applicants is confirmed prior to them being offered a post. These controls also have the effect of deterring prospective applicants who are not entitled to work in the UK. Decisions on the legality of an individual's status would be determined by the immigration authorities. Any information that comes to light during the recruitment process which raises a question about the immigration status of any individual applicant would be dealt with at the time.

The threshold of below 60 per cent. contemporary median income is the most commonly used in reporting trends in low income.</p>
	<p pid="c.1477W.6/2">Our current approach in &quot;Opportunity for all&quot; is to present a range of low-income thresholds (50, 60 and 70 per cent.). This gives an idea of the depth of poverty and it is simple to interpret. Indeed, the incorporation of two different relative low-income thresholds into our new child poverty measure (60 and 70 per cent. of median), together with the absolute tier, further ensures that different depths of poverty will be looked at separately.</p>
	<p pid="c.1477W.6/3">We know that there are some anomalies at the very bottom end of the income distribution, due to people misreporting income, to self-employment, and to people on temporary zero income but with high living standards (e.g. students, people taking a career break). These become proportionally more important the smaller the group we focus on. That is part of the reason that, from next year, we will be collating material deprivation data as well, excluding people with low measured income but high living standards.</p>

	<p pid="c.1484W.2/18">In both Peterborough constituency and Peterborough city council area the stock of VAT registered businesses has increased each year since 1997, as registrations have exceeded de-registrations throughout this period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1484W.2/19">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million businesses (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.1488W.5/1">The Government take the recent increases in energy prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. We have been engaged in continual dialogue with industry to find solutions and mitigate the impacts of high gas and electricity prices. Our discussions with the Energy Intensive Users Group and others have helped us focus our efforts on maximising gas and electricity supplies, improving the operation of the market, encouraging demand side response and pursuing fair access to markets across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="c.1488W.5/2">Over the summer we will be pursuing a detailed work plan with Ofgem, national grid, industry and others to ensure we are in the best possible position ahead of next winter. And at a higher level, the new Business Energy Forum will discuss security of supply from a strategic viewpoint.</p>
	<p pid="c.1488W.5/3">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas and electricity prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas or electricity a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed on.</p>
	<p pid="c.1488W.5/4">It should be noted that between 1990 and 2004, the relative costs of gas and electricity to UK industry were approximately &pound;8 billion and &pound;9 billion less respectively than their German counterparts. I do however recognise that the UK has seen sharp price rises since then.</p>

	<p pid="c.1492W.5/1">The Petroleum Act 1998 consolidated previous enactments about petroleum, offshore installations and submarine pipelines. In brief, part I of the Petroleum Act 1998 empowers the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to grant to such persons as he thinks fit licences to explore for, drill for and extract petroleum; Part II applies criminal law to offshore activities; Part III empowers the Secretary of State to control the construction and use of offshore pipelines; and Part IV deals with the abandonment of offshore installations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1492W.5/2">The Petroleum Act 1998 is a key part of the regulatory regime that allows the Government to manage the UK's oil and gas resources, with the overall aim of maximising economic recovery. The Government continue to work closely with industry in PILOT, the oil and gas taskforce that I chair, to ensure that we have the licensing, environmental and business frameworks that will attract the investment needed to deliver the North sea's full potential. The operation of the Petroleum Act 1998 naturally forms part of that wider picture, alongside a range of positive initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.1492W.5/3">The Fossil Fuel Levy Act 1998 (which amended section 33 of the Electricity Act in its original form) was repealed by the Utilities Act 2000, which introduced the renewables obligation. However, provisions dealing with the Fossil Fuel Levy continue in a modified form by virtue of the Electricity from Non-Fossil Fuel Sources Savings Arrangements Orders made in 2000 and 2001. The fossil fuel levy is currently set at zero. The contractual arrangements made under the non-fossil fuel obligation also remain in place by virtue of the NFFO Savings Order. I have received no recent representations about the fossil fuel levy.</p>

The Chancellor also announced in the Budget a further &pound;50 million, on top of the &pound;30 million that I had previously announced, for the Low Carbon Building Programme, which supports microgeneration and energy efficiency measures.</p>

	<p pid="c.1496W.2/1">Manufacturing is still, and will continue to be, a very important part of the UK economy. The importance of manufacturing to the North East of England, and to the whole UK economy, is recognised in the Department of Trade and Industry's Manufacturing Strategy. Launched in 2002 and reviewed in 2004, the strategy sets out the actions needed to create a high value, high skill manufacturing sector capable of introducing new products and processes into our economy, creating new markets, and delivering a huge boost to our growth and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/2">Government will continue to work with regional agencies, the business community, trade unions and others to ensure that the region (and the UK) makes the most of the opportunities to shift from low-cost/low added-value manufacturing to a sustainable, high added value, high skill, knowledge-led economy. We will continue to develop policies to achieve the right climate for business growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/3">The UK is widely acknowledged as possessing a dynamic and efficient financial market, meeting the financing needs of the majority of businesses. Nevertheless, a small but important minority of innovative, growth-oriented small businesses continue to face difficulties in attracting the funding (particularly risk capital and equity in the &pound;500,000 to &pound;2 million region) that they need to realise their ambitions, providing a case for targeted Government intervention to assist markets where these difficulties create a significant barrier to enterprise and innovation, and hence to productivity growth. Over recent years, the Government have played an important role in ensuring that markets work effectively and that any gaps or weaknesses are addressed. The provision of publicly supported finance schemes (loan, mezzanine and equity) for small businesses has increased significantly over the last few years, increasing access to funding for manufacturing firms and others in order to invest in new technologies and improve productivity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/4">The Regional Venture Capital Fund (RVCF), an England-wide programme to provide risk capital in amounts up to &pound;500,000, was created to support small growing companies, with &pound;80 million of Government investment attracting a further &pound;155 million from private sector investors. Capital North East (the North East RVCF) was launched in 2002, and the fund totalled &pound;15 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/5">The consultation paper &quot;Bridging the finance gap&mdash;a consultation on improving access to growth capital for small businesses&quot; published jointly by HM Treasury and SBS/DTI in April 2003 set out what more could be done to ensure that entrepreneurs have access to the finance they need to turn their ideas into thriving businesses. This led to the creation of Enterprise Capital Funds (ECFs), which will invest a combination of private and public money in small high-growth businesses seeking between &pound;250,000 and &pound;2 million of equity finance. Four funds have been approved to date, with the possibility of further funds being announced, and although not targeted specifically at the North East, they will be available to SMEs in the region. North East enterprise agency Entrust is a partner in the Seraphim Capital Fund, one of the successful funds announced last month, and will act to promote and co-ordinate applications from regional companies seeking growth funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/6">Among schemes to support social enterprise and growth in disadvantaged areas, the Bridges Community Development Venture Fund is a &pound;40 million, 50:50 partnership between Government and the Venture Capital industry. The fund is targeted at the most deprived 25 per cent. of areas of England and includes a number of North East wards. The Coalfields Enterprise Fund, launched by the Deputy Prime Minister in early 2004, is a venture capital fund specifically set up to finance growth-oriented companies and to encourage entrepreneurship in England's former coalfield areas. Investments are on a 50:50 co-investment basis between &pound;40,000 and &pound;500,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/7">The North East Equity Matching Fund (NEEMF) is an innovative and unique venture capital co-investment fund which aims to generate and increase Business Angel activity in the North East of England. NEEMF can match, on a pari passu basis, investments made by private investors or business angels who may not have sufficient resources to wholly fund the business or who wish to spread the risk. The investment range is from &pound;25,000 to &pound;100,000 in the first round with the capacity to aggregate up to &pound;200,000 in a second round after nine months has elapsed. The total equity raised in the initial round must not exceed &pound;250,000. Investments will usually be in the form of ordinary and/or preference shares and will be made at the same time as the private investment. The legal process is aimed at keeping time scales and costs to a minimum.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/8">European funding in the form of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is also used to support Venture Capital and Loan Funds (VCLFs) in the region. The North East Co-Investment Fund (CoIF) and the North East Proof of Concept (PoC) Fund are both managed by NorthStar Equity Investors. The Proof of Concept Fund is a convertible loan fund, investing in technology and science based SMEs and in activities leading to SME formation spun-out from the research and business base in the North East of England. The Co-Investment Fund (COIF) is a &pound;23 million venture capital fund that invests alongside private investors in high-growth technology-focused SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1496W.2/9">Equity is of course only a part of the overall funding picture and the North East region has also benefited from other publicly supported funds including the North East Investment Fund 3. Launched in 2003, this &pound;18 million fund provides unsecured convertible loans for SMEs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1497W.2/1">The 'UK Survey of SME Finances 2004' identified that gender was not an issue for female entrepreneurs accessing external finance. Among established businesses, women-led businesses seek the same levels of external finance and are just as likely as male-owned business to obtain the finance they sought.</p>
	<p pid="c.1497W.2/2">While there is no universal gender issue regarding access to finance, depending upon their personal circumstances, some women do experience problems. In light of this, the SBS Women's Stakeholder Group and RDAs supported a series of regional 'Access to Finance' roadshow events for female entrepreneurs between January and June 2006.</p>

A number of working groups are currently working on the implementation of various aspects of the legislation taking account of both the guidance and regulations.

DFID officials have participated in frequent co-ordination meetings in Jakarta and Yogyakarta on emergency relief, and are now in regular contact with the European Commission and other member states about longer- term reconstruction needs and the case for financial contributions. The preliminary damage and loss assessment, a joint report by the Government of Indonesia and international partners, was presented to donors on June 14. It provides a basis for longer-term reconstruction and recovery assistance, and ways to deliver this are now being considered. No firm decisions have yet been taken by EU member states on financial contributions to the recovery effort, except by the Netherlands which has announced a contribution of &euro;10 million.</p>

Here it has been made worse by fighting in Guinea-Bissau between Senegalese separatist rebels and the Guinea- Bissau army. The World Food Programme estimates that approximately 2,100 people fled the fighting into Casamance, living with family and friends in the city of Ziguinchor. Given the region's limited resources and potentially high flows of additional refugees and displaced people, humanitarian vulnerability and food insecurity could increase if the fighting does not end soon.</p>

The consequent long term decline in new programme work is expected to lead to a significant rationalisation of the UK defence aerospace business. That is why MOD is negotiating with BAE Systems on the terms of the business rationalisation and transformation agreement required to facilitate the effective sustainment of the industrial skills, capability and technologies&mdash;wherever they may be in the supply chain&mdash;that will be important to our ability to operate, support and upgrade our fast jet combat aircraft through life. We aim to work with the company during 2006 to agree the way ahead&mdash;and to implement it from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1518W.11/2">The MOD is also planning to invest in UAV Technology Demonstrator Programmes (TDP) to better understand technologies that are likely to play an important role in this future military capability. The investment should also help sustain aerospace engineering and design capabilities in the UK, providing further assurance of our ability to operate and support our future fixed wing aircraft. We expect to be in a position to announce the commencement of the TDP later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1521W.7/1">In 1997 the Government announced a foreign policy-led strategic defence review (SDR) to reassess Britain's security interests and defence needs and consider how the roles, missions and capabilities of our armed forces should be adjusted to meet the new strategic realities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/2">The resulting report, in July 1998, placed a great emphasis on the deployability of our forces, including the requirement to ensure that our armed forces are properly supported in the field&mdash;a key aspect of which is the provision of timely, modern and effective medical support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/3">A medical quinquennial review (MQR) which reported to Parliament in April 2002 developed detailed proposals for the effective delivery of deployable operational medical capability and appropriate, timely health care to maximise the availability of service personnel for deployment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/4">The MQR identified a need for a much stronger focus on delivery of key outputs, with responsibilities for both central and single service authorities. It recommended new managerial tools (including an annual DMS service delivery plan and a DMS management board) to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/5">The MQR also advocated a further strengthening of the partnership between the DMS and the NHS. This was achieved through the MOD and Department of Health signing a formal concordat (in September 2002) at ministerial level and, at official level, the establishment of a MOD/NHS partnership board to oversee effective co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/6">The MQR also rationalised the existing medical agencies as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/7" class="indent">An expanded Defence Medical Training Organisation (DMTO), renamed the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency (DMETA), became responsible for all the training and training-related activities of the Defence Secondary Care Agency (DSCA);</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/8" class="indent">Responsibility for the provision of secondary health care to service personnel in the UK, previously handled by DSCA, would now be handled within DMSD;</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/9" class="indent">The Medical Supplies Agency was transferred out of the DMS to become part of the Defence Logistics Organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/10">In terms of improvements to DMS treatment facilities, the DMS no longer run separate military hospitals. The decision was taken to close them because they no longer had sufficient patient volume and case mix to develop and maintain the skills of our medical personnel to the appropriate operational and NHS standards. We created Ministry of Defence hospital units located within NHS hospitals at Birmingham, Derriford, Frimley Park, Northallerton/Middlesbrough, Peterborough and Portsmouth. They provide the most effective way of giving the UK armed forces patients access to the latest advances in medical treatment and the major recent investments in NHS facilities. The integration of service personnel throughout the NHS trust also enables DMS staff to take advantage of NHS expertise and to maintain their own clinical skills in an active, up-to-date environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/11">We have also introduced regional rehabilitation units (RRUs). A total of 12 RRUs have been established within the UK, with similar facilities in Germany and Cyprus, to provide assessment and treatment of musculo-skeletal disorders. They were introduced to alleviate pressure on the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court and to provide more accessible regionally-based facilities. Patients are referred from unit medical facilities, where the simpler injuries would be diagnosed and treated. The benefit is that patients are assessed and treated in a timely fashion and receive the optimal high quality treatment and rehabilitation to maximise functional outcome and return to operational fitness when this is clinically possible. Specifically, the RRU system leads to reduced overall patient waiting times, earlier access to diagnosis and therefore quicker treatment and patient monitoring throughout the rehabilitation programme on an individual basis by physiotherapists and remedial instructors at the RRU. For example, most patients who undergo a simple knee arthroscopic procedure are currently being returned fit for task within four months, and patients who undergo an anterior cruciate ligament repair procedure are being returned fit for task in about seven months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/12">Additionally, to improve our patient care, in 2005 the MOD set up a Defence Medical Rehabilitation Evaluation Co-ordination Cell to support personnel injured on operations. This improves the co-ordination of care from the point of entry into UK until the individual is returned to full fitness or is medically discharged from the service. It also improves the provision of a clinical assessment and decisions on the most appropriate care from a consultant-led multi-disciplinary team.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/13">With regard to mental health care, an independent review of mental health care provision to the armed forces, undertaken by a leading consultancy in the field, recommended that out-patient care be provided in regional departments of community mental health (DCMH) and in-patient care be contracted out to a suitable independent or NHS provider. We have 15 DCMHs across the UK plus satellite centres in Cyprus, Germany and Gibraltar. The Priory Group won the competition to provide in-patient care. Patients can now be admitted much closer to their home or base.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/14">The MOD recently announced a new mental health care initiative for recently demobilised reservists, which will include the opportunity for a dedicated mental health assessment by appropriately qualified members of the DMS. Details of the programme will be confirmed later this year, including the location(s) at which the assessments will be provided, and the date on which the service will commence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/15">In terms of operational improvements, DMS support to the deployed force has benefited from investment in modern equipment designed to meet the specific needs of deployed medical capability; this uplift in capability has included the development and deployment of a telemedicine capability, digital imaging, CCAST (critical care aeromedical evacuation support team) and haemostatic products. These improvements have been backed by improved operational training, doctrine and through the lessons learnt process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/16">There are also three current projects which will contribute significantly to improvements in the DMS:</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/17">First, the Managed Military Health System for Force Generation project (MMHS) was conceived to improve the pan-DMS management and delivery of health care (medical and dental) to the armed forces and other entitled personnel. MMHS has the threefold aim of maximising the number of armed forces personnel 'fit for task', contributing to deployed medical operational capability and improving morale in the DMS. The scope of the MMHS project is to cover the UK non-deployed medical capability only, but many of the changes expected from it will beneficially impact on health and health care provision across the MOD including the overseas Commands.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/18">Second, the director general medical operational capability project (DG Med Op Cap) has been set up to determine how to optimise the delivery of medical capability to support operations and ensure the process will deliver continual quality assurance and improvement in clinical output. The intended outcome of this project is the delivery of properly trained personnel with the right equipment and sustainability, to meet the requirements of the front line commanders-in-chief in the most effective and efficient manner.</p>
	<p pid="c.1521W.7/19">Third, the defence medical information capability programme (DMICP) is a major business change programme enabled by IT which will provide an integrated health care information system across the DMS, and will also link to the NHS's major new national programme for IT. DMICP will provide many benefits with the overarching benefit being more service personnel fit for task. It will provide DMS doctors and dentists with immediate access worldwide to complete, up-to-date electronic medical and dental records, supported by the latest clinical decision support software and online reference material, giving greater support to service clinicians, analysts and administrators in all aspects of their work. In April 2006 my predecessor announced the award of an &pound;80 million contract which aims to have the first stages of DMICP phased in from the beginning of next year, initially to medical and dental units in barracks, air stations, naval bases, and then, after 2008, on military deployments.</p>

	<p pid="c.1525W.9/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-28">28 May 2006</phrase>, we very much regret that a total of 113 UK military and civilian defence personnel have died, or are missing presumed dead, while serving on Operation Telic since the start of the campaign in March 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1525W.9/2">Of these, 84 are classed as killed in action, including as a result of hostile action, 29 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents, or have not yet been officially assigned a cause of death pending the outcome of an investigation. These figures may change as inquests are concluded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1525W.9/3">During the period March 2003 to the end of April 2006, the best centrally available, verified, figures show that: around 240 UK military and civilian personnel have been treated at the UK's main Field Hospital in Shaibah for wounds received as a result of hostile action and; up to 4,000 UK personnel were medically evacuated from Iraq from all causes, the majority due to accident, illness, or for routine outpatient activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1525W.9/4">Separate records for the same period from Notification of Casualty reporting (NOTICAS), show that around 40 UK military and civilian personnel have been categorised as Very Seriously Ill/Injured/Wounded (VSI) from all causes, and that around 75 personnel have been categorised as Seriously Ill/Injured/Wounded (SI) from all causes. These figures include some personnel treated for wounds received as a result of hostile action. The figures are only comprehensive, including personnel treated at non-UK facilities, from April 11 2005 onwards. During the early phases of Operation Telic the tempo of operations meant that the paperwork associated with the NOTICAS process was not always completed properly and we cannot be certain our records are complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.1525W.9/5">We are working to improve our casualty reporting for Operation Telic. We are currently verifying records from the other Field Hospitals which deployed on Operation Telic including RFA Argus, and are engaging with the US to find out a comprehensive figure on how many personnel were treated at their facilities. As far as we know no UK personnel serving in Iraq were treated on Royal Navy or Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships other than RFA Argus. We are also in the process of transferring the paper records sent back from medical facilities deployed on Telic to the Central Health Records Library.</p>

It is the responsibility of the local primary care trusts and their partners to fund the treatment needed for their community. We do not routinely collect data on the amount of funding they have provided for alcohol treatment, so we are unable to provide year on year details. However, the alcohol needs assessment research project, published November 2005 conducted a more in-depth survey for 2005 and reached a conclusion that about &pound;217 million is being spent on alcohol treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1531W.2/1">The Government believes that care homes are one of a range of options that should be available for supporting people with long-term care needs. Most people want to live in their own home for as long as possible. To this end, there has been substantial investment in other care settings, such as domiciliary care and extra care housing. We believe that no one should be admitted into a care home until all other options have been explored and discussed with the service user, their carers and relatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.1531W.2/2">However, we recognise that there will always be people who need or want the type of care that only care homes can provide. For them, care in a care home will be best suited to their needs and wishes and care homes offer them a positive choice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1531W.2/3">The Government have introduced national minimum standards (NMS) for care homes, domiciliary care and adult placements. The NMS are intended to ensure vulnerable and older people can live in a safe environment, where their rights and dignity are respected and staff are properly trained. All care homes in England are regulated, registered and inspected by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI). CSCI regulates care homes in accordance with statutory regulations and the NMS. CSCI has strong enforcement powers and will take action to protect the welfare of residents, with the aim of raising the quality of care and level of protection for vulnerable people and ensuring that service users and their families can be confident that their welfare and interests are safeguarded.</p>

But they are only one aspect of children's palliative care. We want to see children and their families have a real choice as to where they receive their care so that they can live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible. Our White Paper, &quot;Our health, Our care, Our say&quot;, expects primary care trusts to ensure that the right model of service is developed by undertaking a review to audit capacity and delivery of integrated pathways against national service framework standards and then to agree service models, funding and commissioning arrangements with their strategic health authorities. The White Paper also restates the Government manifesto commitment to increase funding for end of life care which includes palliative care for children and young people. We will make an announcement about funding this manifesto commitment as soon as we can.</p>
	<p pid="c.1535W.2/2">We announced that &pound;9 million per year would be available to voluntary children's hospices for the next three years starting from this financial year and it will be centrally funded. This will enable services funded by the Big Lottery Fund to continue, pending the outcome of a review of children's hospice services and their funding arrangements. We will publish funding criteria and arrangements for allocation as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.1536W.2/3">The NHSLA record the legal funding arrangements of claimants when legal proceedings are issued. As a defendant organisation, they will not necessarily know about the funding status of claims that are pre-litigation. Claimants are not required to declare funding arrangements until the litigation process is entered. Information held by the NHSLA on the funding arrangements of claimants is therefore necessarily incomplete.</p>

CSC has further strengthened and enhanced the management team this year and fully expects to see the programme at the forefront of its priorities throughout the lifetime of the contract. CSC believes that this intent is demonstrated by the substantial number of projects already deployed, and the current user base of some 30,000 NHS staff.

The agency's primary responsibilities are for delivering the national programme for information technology, and maintaining the critical business systems previously provided to the national health service by the former NHS Information Authority. Outturn running cost expenditure for 2005-06 was &pound;144 million against a budget of &pound;178 million. The equivalent budget for 2006-07 is &pound;168 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1538W.2/2">The pace and scale of deployment of new national programme systems and services is accelerating on a weekly basis, and the budget increase over 2005-06 mainly reflects targets for continuing expansion through the year in support of the Department's plans for developing, procuring and implementing integrated information technology infrastructure and systems in all NHS organisations in England by 2010. In the course of the coming year we anticipate, for example, that choose and book will be effectively deployed, full deployment of release one of the electronic prescription service, further upgrading of NHS care records service software providing ever richer functionality, and complete roll-out of the new broadband connections across the NHS by the end of the financial year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1539W.11/1">Local national health service organisations have the responsibility for determining which of their staff may access the detailed care records available within the particular deployment of new information technology systems to that organisation. Sophisticated tools are being developed and provided by NHS Connecting for Health to enable local organisations to restrict access to records to those staff involved in an individual's care in accordance with the guidance provided in the Department's publication &quot;Confidentiality: NHS Code of Practice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.11/2">NHS Connecting for Health is implementing e-Government interoperability framework (eGif) level three standards for the registration and authentication of staff. This provides a high level of assurance that only bona fide personnel have access to the care record service. eGif level three requires a face-to-face meeting, and the provision of official documentation and authentication to systems, using a two-factor approach. NHS Connecting for Health use a smartcard and a passcode.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.11/3">When fully deployed, NHS Connecting for Health-delivered systems will utilise a number of separate mechanisms, including consent/dissent, legitimate relationships, role-based access and sealed envelopes. Consent/dissent provides for patients to formally opt-out of sharing their clinical data. Legitimate relationships restrict access to only those clinicians involved in the patients care. Role-based access identifies the staff role and only allows access to the relevant part of the record, for example, restricting the access a receptionist has to clinical details. Sealed envelopes allow a patient to restrict access further to particularly sensitive parts of their record.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.11/4">These controls have been designed to put the patient at the heart of care rather than having restrictions based on NHS organisational boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.11/5">Initially, as systems begin to be rolled out, access to an individual's detailed care record will still be restricted to the originating organisation. This will gradually be extended to local health communities and eventually across larger areas as the scope of the access controls are extended and the systems capable of utilising them are deployed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.11/6">In addition the NHS care record service specifies strict audit requirements that log which individuals have accessed which records. This will provide an unprecedented level of traceability and assurance, and is in very marked contrast to the significant risk of casual and unauthorised inspection associated with current paper-based and electronic systems.</p>

One such service a PCT may specify is the provision of emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) to females of child-bearing age. This is an enhanced service by virtue of Direction 4(1) (k) and possibly (m) if a patient group direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.1542W.9/7">It is for the applicant to decide whether or not to make an application under one of these exemptions. If an applicant does not wish to provide the additional services specified by a PCT for an exempt application, it may instead apply to provide services under the conventional route in Regulation 12. This does not allow a PCT to specify additional services that applicants are to provide.</p>
	<p pid="c.1542W.9/8">The Department does not collect data on the number of PCTs which have specified the provision of EHC as a required additional service for an application made under Regulation 13, nor the number of refusals of applications by PCTs on these grounds or subsequent appeals. However, The Information Centre for health and social care publishes general data on applications to provide pharmaceutical services and appeals annually. The next bulletin for the year 2005-06 will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1542W.9/9">The family health services appeal unit of the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) deals with appeals relating to these regulations. The NHSLA produces an annual report every autumn. The website of the appeal unit at <a href="http://www.nhsla.nhs.uk">www.nhsla.nhs.uk</a> reports details of appeal decisions, of which only one up until May 2006 related to EHC. This appeal was dismissed.</p>

Results published in September 2005 demonstrated that children ate significantly more fruit while participating in the scheme. Analysis also showed that among those participating in the scheme fruit and vegetable consumption declined at home and increased in school, suggesting that the scheme did not encourage additional consumption outside of the direct influence of the SFVS.</p>

	<p pid="c.1558W.0/1">The national service framework (NSF) for older people published in March 2001 recommended implementation of a single assessment process by the health and social care professionals involved in the care of each individual. The national programme for information technology included IT support as an additional service for a single assessment process within the contracts let to local service providers. A variety of information systems and tools are available to support this process. Successful local deployments of such systems by national programme suppliers, notably in the programme's north east and eastern clusters, have demonstrated the value of the technology and its potential to support the rapid development of integrated multi-agency working across all client groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.0/2">In addition, the &pound;25 million capital expenditure grant recently paid to local authorities (LAs) by the Department for improving information management made specific reference to the single assessment process. The circular issued to LAs contained the following reference:</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.0/3" class="indent">'The integration of social care information is a key requirement in the final phase of NCRS implementation. This will include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.0/4" class="indent">Electronic implementation of the Single Assessment Process...</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.0/5" class="indent">It follows, therefore, that significant benefits will be gained by using the grant to facilitate that integration, in particular preparation for the NCRS implementation ... each local authority would be asked to summarise its spending proposals for 2006-07 and 2007-08, as covered by the extension of the grant. The Department is therefore asking each local authority to submit these proposals...&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.0/6">A study has also been commissioned into options for national implementation of the electronic single assessment process (e-SAP), including linkage between health and social care systems. Consultation has been undertaken with health, social care and supplier representatives, and a report is due later in 2006.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-16c.74059.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-16c.1558W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="1558W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060616/text/60616w0029.htm#06061911001014">
	<p pid="c.1558W.3/1">Many of the components of the national programme for information technology have been delivered to time. There have been some delays to local systems but local plans for deployment of systems and services are subject to regular update and revision by the national health service as well as suppliers depending, for example, on the readiness of NHS bodies to receive them. In general, payment is not made to suppliers until systems have been satisfactorily delivered and have been demonstrated to be safe to use and fit for purpose, and, where appropriate, been the subject of consultation with representatives of end-user groups. In some areas of the programme this process is determining the pace at which development and deployment takes place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.3/2">In some instances savings have been achieved by NHS organisations where national programme systems and services have been delivered ahead of time, or additional to those originally planned. Examples include email and new national network connections in many areas, and the benefits of national software licensing arrangements with Microsoft and Novell. There has been no clawback of the savings in these instances. The question of compensation for non-delivery, either to or from the NHS, therefore does not arise in either case.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.3/3">There was a situation in the early days of the new national network (N3) contract when early milestones were missed and compensation of &pound;4.5 million was agreed with BT. The N3 performance has since recovered and is now ahead of schedule.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.3/4">Delivery of systems and services to the NHS is generally ahead of schedule in some areas, and, in the context of a 10-year programme, broadly on track in others. Such delays that have occurred have been more than made up for by delivery of projects additional to the original contracted components such as the quality management and analysis system (QMAS), the secure NHSmail email service and payment by results, which are in addition to the original scope of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.3/5">Two years since contracts were first awarded, over 10,000 instances of new deployments of all types are currently live in NHS locations in England. 8,800 general practices (28,000 general practitioners (GPs)) are daily using QMAS that pays GPs &pound;600 million a year based on quality outcomes. There are almost 230,000 users registered for access to the NHS care record spine with over 45,000 users accessing every day and around one and a quarter million prescriptions have been transmitted using the electronic transmission of prescriptions system. Over 14,500 secure broadband connections have been delivered, including to almost 10,000 general practice locations, and there are over 175,000 registered NHSmail users, over 79,000 of whom use the system daily.</p>

	<p pid="c.1559W.2/1">The new national network (N3) provides connections of 0.5 up to 2 megabits per second (Mbps) of dedicated bandwidth for general practitioner (GP) sites, and of 2Mbps up to l00Mbps for national health service trusts. This can be topped up by local organisations to accommodate local business requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1559W.2/2">Bandwidth deployed in any particular site depends on the size of the site, and the type of application usage predicted. More than 85 per cent. of GP sites have or are planned to have 1Mbps bandwidth or higher. Around 60 per cent. of NHS trusts have or are planned to have l00Mbps bandwidth.</p>
	<p pid="c.1559W.2/3">Research on bandwidth requirements was undertaken with the NHS user community and prospective local service providers as part of the N3 procurement exercise. Results of the research were used as the basis for developing N3 products and services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1559W.2/4">N3 deployment is one of the national programme's major success stories. In the two years since it began, over 14,500 installations have been completed at a rate significantly in advance of the original deployment plan. Before N3, only main GP practice sites were connected, the majority at 64kbps and some at 256kbps. None of these had any backup service provided and no branch practices were funded centrally. Trusts were provisioned at one 2mbps connection per trust. Under N3 all GP practice sites are eligible for centrally funded connections, and trusts are provided with a connection per site and receive bandwidth commensurate with their size. In order to provide a standard level of service, the provision of broadband services in some rural communities was accelerated under N3 in order that GPs could benefit from consistent services, regardless of location. The NHS was the first public service organisation to achieve this ambition for equitability of services in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1559W.2/5">All N3 services receive significant backup connectivity, and average service availability across both primary and secondary care sites routinely exceeds 99.9 per cent. It is estimated that the total cost of N3 connections will be at least &pound;800 million less than the provision of the same amount of N3 bandwidth under the old NHSnet contract.</p>

Only those people involved in the care of the patient will have access to patient information, and the level of detail to which they have access will be appropriate to their role. The NHS care records service registration authority is responsible for registering and verifying the identity of NHS staff who need to use the NHS Care Records Service (NHS CRS) and related systems and services. The number having access when the service is fully deployed across the NHS will be determined by the operational and professional needs of NHS organisations and their staff. Access to these systems and services, and the patient information they contain and use, is controlled by smartcards with identification and passcode, superior to a chip and pin credit card. Registration authorities locally issue smartcards to authorised staff with an approved level of access to patient information.

	<p pid="c.1562W.2/1">In order to monitor the implementation of turnaround plans for organisations within the turnaround cohort, the turnaround national programme office at the Department has developed a fortnightly reporting process which will capture, for example, the following information: risks/issues during implementation; progress against milestones; overall financial performance against plan: for example cost savings achieved; monthly run rate information<sup>(1)</sup>; year to date/outturn performance; and forecast full year deficit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/2">Following an independent baseline assessment of organisations with some of the largest deficits, 98<sup>(2)</sup> organisations were identified as those with significant deficits. These organisations, also known as the turnaround cohort were categorised in terms of their support requirements as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/3" class="indent">Category 1: Immediate priority. Urgent intervention required to drive turnaround.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/4" class="indent">Category 2: Additional expertise/resource needed to support turnaround.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/5" class="indent">Category 3: Drive/focus. Maintain high priority of actions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/6" class="indent">Category 4: Encourage to share what works and deliver easy wins.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/7">Category 1 and 2 organisations were expected to secure additional turnaround support in order to assist them in the development of robust credible turnaround plans. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) and chief executives of organisations retain the responsibility for financial recovery. Over and above the central expectation for additional turnaround support for categories 1 and 2, triggers to fund external turnaround support are determined locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/8">All national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) are required to submit financial forecasts to the Department on a monthly basis. SHAs may have additional reporting requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/9" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Monthly balance of income and expenditure (run rate balance).</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/10" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> There are 102 (48 trusts and 54 PCTs) statutory organisations within the turnaround cohort but Ipswich PCT and Suffolk Coastal are under joint management and are treated as one organisation, as are Fareham and Gosport PCT and East Hampshire PCT, and three Cumbrian PCTs.</p>

NHS Connecting for Health has retained extensive rights under its contracts to defer payments, receive compensation for missed milestones and, if necessary, to terminate contracts, for failure to achieve the required performance levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.5/2">In the early days of the new national network (N3) contract some early milestones were missed and clawback of &pound;4.5 million was agreed with BT. N3 performance has since recovered and is now ahead of schedule.</p>

LAs directly employ occupational therapists and the delivery of the service will be determined by the employing authority.

	<p pid="c.1570W.2/1">Value for money of the independent sector treatment centre (ISTC) procurement has been ensured by running a robust and competitive procurement process, and by benchmarking procedure prices between contracts and comparing them to the national health service equivalent cost and the prices paid by the NHS to the independent sector under spot purchase arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1570W.2/2">Across the full period of the wave 1 ISTC contracts, the average percentage cost compares favourably with the historical cost to the NHS of spot purchasing from the independent sector.</p>
