	<p pid=".1339W.7/2">The UK ratified the Kyoto Protocol, along with the rest of the EU, in May 2002. The Kyoto Protocol is a crucial first step in developing an effective international regime on climate change and we continue to encourage all countries that have not yet done so to ratify. In order to enter into force the Protocol must be ratified by at least 55 countries including developed countries that account for 55 per cent. of this group's greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. Because of the withdrawal of the United States from the Protocol in 2001, entry into force requires ratification by Russia, responsible for 17.4 per cent. of developed countries' greenhouse gas emissions in 1990.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.7/3">This Department along with others continues to urge Russia to ratify as soon as possible. We believe there are strong economic as well as environmental advantages to Russia of ratification and put these across at every opportunity. We welcomed President Putin's positive statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-21">21 May</phrase> that in light of progress made in WTO negotiations he would accelerate movement towards ratification.</p>

	<p pid=".1342W.11/1">We are committed to introducing the new right of access in England under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 in every region of England before the end of 2005. The South East and lower North West, will open for access on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-19">19 September</phrase>. I have announced a timetable for opening access in the other areas to ensure that those people preparing to use their new rights can plan ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".1342W.11/2">We have drawn up a detailed communications framework, in partnership with the Countryside Agency, the Association of National Park Authorities, English Nature, the Forestry Commission, the Local Government Association, the Ministry of Defence and Ordnance Survey. The plan sets out a number of objectives and actions for each organisation so that the public, land managers, interest groups and other stakeholders should be aware, understand and appreciate the new countryside access rights and responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".1342W.11/3">Ordnance Survey is carrying out a revision of its Explorer maps to inform walkers about what land is open. It is preparing for the launch of access land in the first two regions in September. In later regions it will also publish updated Explorer maps as close as possible to the commencement of the new rights, with complete coverage scheduled for summer 2006. The maps will provide clear information on access land to map users.</p>
	<p pid=".1342W.11/4">In addition, to coincide with the issue of a new and up-to-date Countryside Code on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-12">12 July</phrase>, the Countryside Agency launched a new website to help the public find out what they can do and where they can go in the English countryside. The new website contains information about the new access rights and also advice for landowners and managers on how to manage public access and details of the restrictions process. As the new rights are commenced, the website will include a map showing access land in each region. The public will be able to see if other access rights are available (such as bridleways), to check whether any local closures or restrictions are in force and to find the location of local &quot;Access Information Points&quot;. An Open Access Contact Centre has also been established to provide information to the public about the new access rights.</p>
	<p pid=".1342W.11/5">We also expect information for walkers to be available locally, from a variety of outlets including National Park visitor centres, and 'on the ground'. The Countryside Agency is issuing guidance to access authorities (National Park Authorities in National Parks and local highway authorities elsewhere) and to land managers on the use of signs. An open access symbol will indicate land that may be open for public access on foot.</p>

	<p pid=".1345W.2/1">EU regulations require that a specific percentage of claims across all CAP schemes are subject to on the spot checks within defined periods and with limits on the amount of notice that can be given. The Rural Payments Agency endeavour to minimise disruption to farmers by combining different inspections into one visit. An example of this is the Cattle inspections which can incorporate up to six different schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".1345W.2/2">The estimated average length of farm staff time taken on inspections will depend on the type of inspection, the size and clarity of the submitted claim and how that compares with what is found on the ground. However, the RPA is committed to reducing, as far as possible, the time spent on farm by ensuring that its inspectors are fully trained in all aspects of the schemes they are verifying.</p>
	<p pid=".1345W.2/3">EU regulations for on farm inspections require that no notice of inspections to be given. However, for some visits up to 48 hours notice may be given without breaching the regulations. Nevertheless the EU expectation is that visits will take place without notice and only exceptionally should notice be given for example, when farm staff need to gather animals which are extensively grazed.</p>

	<p pid=".1347W.0/1">Information is not collected in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1347W.0/2">Natura 2000 sites are underpinned by designation as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), with approximately 70 per cent. of SSSIs being Natura 2000 sites. There is not separate accounting for costs relating to European and National site designations, and protection of Natura 2000 sites is not differentiated from measures to protect SSSIs more generally. Moreover, decisions on spending are devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".1347W.0/3">Measures which contribute to protecting Natura 2000 sites in England include the operation of the planning system, the work of Sea Fisheries Committees, funding from English Nature, the Environment Agency, the Forestry Commission, agri-environment schemes and spending by public bodies in their role as owners of Natura 2000 sites.</p>
	<p pid=".1347W.0/4">In 2002 the European Commission asked member states for a 10 year estimate of forecast spending on Natura 2000 sites. In reply we estimated that, as a minimum, in the region of &euro;50 million per annum was likely to be spent on the UK's network of SSSI and Natura 2000 sites from all sources.</p>

	<p pid=".1359W.2/2">However, Code C requires that persons detained at police stations on behalf of the Immigration Service are subject to periodic review as a matter of good practice. The purpose of such reviews is to check the particular power under which a detainee is held continues to apply, any associated conditions are complied with and to make sure appropriate action is taken to deal with any changes.</p>

I take the report's findings very seriously and accept its conclusion that many organisations and individuals share the responsibility for failures in information handling including, in part, the Home Office. All Government Departments with responsibilities under the report are developing urgently a programme for addressing its findings and implementing its recommendations. The Home Office will co-ordinate this programme of work.</p>
	<p pid=".1360W.5/3">In particular, I have announced the planned introduction of the first National Police Intelligence Computer system, entitled 'IMPACT', which will ensure that all police forces use the same system to manage and share intelligence information. I have also undertaken, in partnership with tripartite stakeholders, to develop a statutory code of practice on police information handling, to be introduced by the end of this year, which will require all forces to deal with intelligence information in the same way.</p>

	<p pid=".1364W.5/1">I speak regularly with many developing country Ministers and officials, including on trade. Many of them have formed alliances and come together to agree common positions on trade, for example under the G90 banner, which comprises members of the Africa Union, the group of African Caribbean and Pacific Countries, and the group of Least Developed Countries. Their position on agriculture for example, as set out during a recent meeting they held in Guyana, is that they want progress in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the three key issues of reducing export subsidies, reducing trade distorting domestic subsidies, and increasing market access for developing country exports.</p>
	<p pid=".1364W.5/2">They recognise however that increasing market access through general tariff reductions will have an impact on those developing countries that benefit from trade preferences&mdash;the problem of so-called preference erosion. The main focus now is on the WTO General Council that will meet at the end of July in Geneva, where I hope a satisfactory agreement will be reached to provide a framework for more detailed negotiations later in the year.</p>

	<p pid=".1372W.9/1">Out of classroom learning is already a part of both the primary and secondary cycle of a child's education. In England, the Geography programmes of study at Key Stages 1, 2 and 3 include a requirement for all pupils to carry out fieldwork investigations outside the classroom. Opportunities for outdoor learning also exist across the curriculum, in particular in Science, and we are encouraging all schools to take them up.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.9/2">In order to help build confidence and competence in teachers, we have funded the Field Studies Council in association with the Geographical Association, the Association of Science Education and the Open University to develop a professional development unit for geography and science teachers. From autumn, complementary courses will be offered through the new national network of Science Learning Centres across England, specifically for science teachers. Lastly, our Growing Schools programme, which has engaged over 12,000 English schools so far, supports teachers with educating pupils about food cultivation, farming, and understanding the natural environment, as well how to use the outdoors for teaching subjects across the curriculum for pupils of all ages.</p>

	<p pid=".1374W.3/1">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. The most recent survey, published in October 2003, showed that the level of opium cultivation in 2003 was 80,000 hectares and production was 3,600 tonnes. The UNODC is in the process of assessing the 2004 harvest in conjunction with the Afghan Government. Its report will be published in the autumn. We expect to see a rise in levels of cultivation. This is unwelcome but experience of counter-narcotic policies in Pakistan and Thailand, which both had much lower initial levels of production and were more stable countries, shows that cultivation tends to increase before declining. In my response to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/775" name="David Cairns">the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-09">9 June 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2004-06-09.124"><i>Official Report,</i> columns124&ndash;27WH</phrase>, I set out the action in hand to tackle drugs in Afghanistan and made clear that the UK, as lead nation, remains committed to supporting the Afghan Government in its strategy to eliminate opium production from its country.</p>

	<p pid=".1375W.2/1">Security remains fragile throughout Afghanistan. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) continues to help the Afghan authorities maintain security in Kabul and its environs. ISAF is now expanding to the north, which is subject to long-standing tensions between regional factions but is generally stable. The UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Mazar-e Sharif and Meymana have transferred to ISAF authority and continue to help defuse tensions in the region. The New Zealand-led PRT in Bamian and the coalition PRT in Oruzgan are helping to maintain stability in central areas. There tend to be fewer security incidents in the west but units of the Afghan National Army (ANA) have deployed to Herat and Ghowr in recent months in response to violent incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".1375W.2/2">Security in the south and east is more worrying, with attacks resulting in the murder of international and Afghan aid workers and officials. Seven PRTs have been established in southern and eastern provinces to help improve the security environment. Coalition forces and units of the ANA continue to pursue terrorists in these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1375W.2/3">Attempts by remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda to disrupt and undermine the democratic process are likely to increase as the elections approach. The UN, ISAF and the Coalition are working closely with the Afghan government on providing a stable and secure environment for the elections.</p>

PricewaterhouseCoopers received &pound;21.4 million in fees. LRT also took advice from their auditors KPMG, who received about &pound;2.4 million.</p>

Under the Convention, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is responsible for establishing minimum safety standards which contracting states are required to implement. States are required to recognise the certificates issued by other contracting states unless they have reason to believe that they have not been issued in accordance with ICAO standards, ICAO also audits contracting states' aviation authorities to help identify and address any deficiencies in the implementation of international standards.</p>

	<p pid=".1385W.5/3">If we have doubts about whether an aircraft or airline complies with international safety standards we will arrange for the aircraft to be inspected by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Permits may be refused, and existing permits suspended or revoked by the Secretary of State. This may occur where there is a breach of a permit condition, which would include non-compliance with international safety standards; however action can also be taken for reasons other than safety. Permit decisions will be reviewed in the light of new information or changed circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".1390W.0/1">The Highways Agency has been carrying out further detailed work on a scheme to widen the M6 between junctions 11a and 19, following the announcement in December 2002, when the Secretary of State for Transport confirmed his support, in principle, for this scheme. The further work has taken longer than expected, due partly to the complexity of the associated traffic modelling. It is currently expected that this scheme will cost around &pound;2 billion. However, the Secretary of State for Transport announced last week that he is considering building a new expressway to run parallel with the M6 between Birmingham and Manchester as an alternative to widening the existing M6. The Department for Transport issued a consultation paper &quot;M6: giving motorists a choice&quot;, which invites views.</p>

The special arrangements for the Safety Camera Programme provide that the Safety Camera Partnerships of local police and highway authorities can be reimbursed for the costs involved in the installation and operation of safety cameras and the enforcement of the resulting fixed penalty fines. Any remaining fines go to the Consolidated Fund.</p>

	<p pid=".1396W.2/1">The West Coast Main Line renewal and upgrade is projected to cost &pound;7.6 billion. The route mileage is some 700 miles, implying a unit cost of &pound;10.9 million per mile. The actual cost will be sensitive to the number of tracks and the scope of work within each route mile. Care needs to be taken in comparing the unit costs of different projects, given the widely different scope of works and the different characteristics and geography of lines.</p>
