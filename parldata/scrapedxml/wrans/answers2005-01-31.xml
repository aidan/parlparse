The United Nations Mission in Burundi (ONUB) Force Commander is in close contact with the commander of the Burundian First Military Region. United Nations High Commission for Refugees is closely monitoring the situation in those camps and humanitarian assistance is being provided.</p>
	<p pid=".565W.14/4">In addition, another 80 Banyamulenge families are living in a former transit site at Ngagara in Bujumbura town, living and working among the local community. Their security is the responsibility of the Burundi Government, but ONUB are also monitoring the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid=".566W.2/1">Cyclical periods of drought and cassava pest (manioc mosaic) are having an adverse impact on the availability of food and on household's capacity to produce food in the northern provinces of Burundi. The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it will assist 520,000 people in the provinces of Kirundo and Muyinga for the next two months. This month it delivered 1,485 metric tonnes of food aid to 176,000 people in the communes of Busoni, Bugabira and Kirundo.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/2">Distribution of food aid and emergency agricultural inputs (seeds and tools) have been increased since July 2004, but these have had a limited impact because of poor rains, extremely low productivity of the land, reduced arable land by household and the poor health status of the population. The negative impact of these combined factors on food security and nutrition show the widespread and extreme fragility of an average Burundian household.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/3">DFID has contributed &pound;750,000 to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) through the UN Consolidated Appeal for emergency agriculture activities in an effort to improve the food security situation. The WFP has said it has enough funding for food aid for the next five months. We are concentrating our efforts on food security through the FAO and looking at other support in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the present situation.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.0/1">The last 18 months has seen the formation of many new Iraqi Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) seeking to address and articulate the rights of ordinary Iraqis. CSOs include such bodies as non-governmental organisations, professional unions and associations, faith-based organisations, government and legislative bodies. With little history of independent civil society in Iraq, many of these CSOs lack capacity. DFID's Civil Society Fund (CSF), a two year programme with a budget of &pound;5 million, seeks to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi CSOs to better address the needs of poor, vulnerable and socially excluded groups, especially women and young people. Much of the fund is aimed at building links between Iraqi and international CSOs. However, direct funding for Iraqi CSOs is also available.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.2/1">At the Global Partners' Forum on orphans and vulnerable children in Washington DC in December 2004, my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, announced how DFID would be meeting its spending target of at least &pound;150 million on orphans and vulnerable children over the next three years. This included &pound;38 million to be delivered through UNICEF for work in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/2">DFID plans to work very closely with UNICEF to support elements of the Rapid Assessment Analysis Action Planning Process (RAAAP) plans in some of the countries in Africa which are most affected by AIDS&mdash;this includes six Southern African countries: Angola, Botswana, Swaziland, Namibia, Lesotho and South Africa under a regional programme estimated at &pound;18 million over three years, and in a separate programme of support in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/3">The support DFID provides will be based upon the UNICEF Framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children living in a world with HIV/AIDS, which aims to: strengthen families' ability to cope, through such things as financial credits, child care and developing skills; start and support community-based responses, largely through involving local leaders; ensure that vulnerable children have access to essential services, such as education and health care; ensure that governments protect the children that are the most vulnerable; and, finally, raise awareness to create an environment that understands and supports those children.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/4">DFID is also planning to work with UNICEF and provide assistance to strengthen the capacity and competence of UNICEF's Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO). This is in order that RAAAP plans can be built into wider planning and implementation processes and interventions are based on firm evidence about their effectiveness. We are also developing a programme of support to UNICEF in New York so that they can provide global oversight and develop country commitment and the means to monitor and track the international response to meeting the needs of vulnerable children.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/5">We are working though our bilateral programmes in DFID's target countries in Africa, with Government, and civil society organisations to address the needs of vulnerable children. Where countries have their own Poverty Reduction Strategies, DFID is pressing for &quot;children and AIDS&quot; issues to be included in budget planning, allocation and expenditure. This is being done in close consultation with UNICEF.</p>

	<p pid=".570W.5/1">The Department for International Development's humanitarian response to the tsunami disaster in Sri Lanka has been channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross movement, and non-governmental organisations and in direct in kind interventions aimed at addressing immediate needs. DFID is providing financial support to five NGOs: Save the Children Fund UK, HelpAge International, World Vision UK, Basic Needs and ZOA Refugee Care. We are also considering proposals from 12 other NGOs regarding transitional shelter, water and sanitation and livelihoods support. The assistance that DFID has provided, and is supporting, is geographically spread throughout the country. This includes substantial support to Tamil communities in proportion to needs across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".570W.5/2">DFID's focus for longer-term reconstruction in Sri Lanka is likely to be on providing support to the rebuilding of livelihoods and services for poor people in affected regions. The Sri Lankan Government are putting together a needs assessment with the support of the World Bank and others and DFID will consider how we can best channel our support when we receive the completed assessments.</p>

	<p pid=".571W.2/1">I have received no representations on the cost of transporting food to the Asian disaster zone, nor have I heard reports to suggest wide scale problems relating to food availability in the region, but DFID continues to monitor the situation closely to ensure appropriate coverage in meeting clearly identified needs. DFID is maintaining close contact with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) on these issues. Non-governmental organisations have commented that the WFP has done a very good job at short notice in distributing food but are concerned about medium-term implications of distributing large quantities of food. DFID will remain in contact with the WFP on discussions about potential longer-term food aid requirements to ensure these are both appropriate and cost effective.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.2/2">DFID has provided &pound;3.5 million to the WFP's Emergency and Special Operations for food distributions in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and in support of their regional logistics role. In addition, DFID has provided &pound;600,000 to the Food and Agriculture Organisation and our support to Christian Aid, Help Age International, Save the Children Fund and World Vision each contain food assistance as part of their relief programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".576W.8/4">The UK presidency will take forward work on those thematic strategies in the framework of the Sixth Community Environmental Action Programme that have been published by the European Commission in time for the UK presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.8/5">The Government will follow-up action to the spring European Council's review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, and will provide environmental input to the 2006 review. We will apply the principles of better regulation by proceeding with proposals that have been through proper economic, social and environmental impact assessment, and seek to build on the Cardiff integration process at the level of individual policies.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.8/6">In 2005 momentum will be maintained on the regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE+) and on the INSPIRE directive which aims to put in place infrastructures for the prevention and better management of potential environmental risk. Concerning nature and biodiversity, we will take forward work on biodiversity action, depending on the timely submission of proposals from the European Commission, and on the directive on humane trapping standards.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.8/7">Work will also continue on: the bathing waters directive; the sulphur content of marine fuels; a Pollutant Release and Transfer Register; priority substances and emissions control; protection of ground water; waste shipments; the directive on batteries and accumulators; the management of mining waste; end-use energy efficiency and energy services directive; stricter emissions standards for light duty vehicles; and applying the Aarhus Convention to the EC.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.8/8">The Government will also seek to make progress on the implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan (ETAP), to ensure that measures are taken to stimulate innovation and market penetration for environmental technologies so that synergies between environmental protection and enhanced economic competitiveness are fully exploited.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.8/9">The UK and Luxembourg presidencies will also ensure effective preparation and coordination of international meetings throughout the year, including for the UNEP Governing Council, the UN CSD and the UN's high level review of Progress against the Millennium Declaration and the WSSD commitments. The annual meeting of the UN Climate Change Convention will be particularly important because of the expected entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

	<p pid=".584W.9/1">The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road causalities in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 290,607 in 2003, and the numbers of children aged under 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 4,100 in 2003. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&ndash;97 to 40.9 billion in 2003&ndash;04, a rise of 27 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK's two main pollutants&mdash;nitrous oxides and particles&mdash;fell by 31 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.9/2">The funding provided directly to Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East since 2001 is shown in the following table. It has been for Middlesbrough and Redcar and Cleveland councils to determine how that allocation has spent, in line with their local transport plan and their priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.2/1">The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Kingston Upon Hull constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road causalities in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 290,607 in 2003, and the numbers of children aged under 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 4,100 in 2003. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&ndash;07 to 40.9 billion in 2003&ndash;04, a rise of 27 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK's two main pollutants(nitrous oxides and particles(fell by 31 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/2">The funding provided directly to Kingston Upon Hull since 1997 are shown in the table below <sup>1</sup> . It has been for Kingston Upon Hull to determine how that allocation was spent, in line with their local transport plan and their priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.0/1">The two main action points arising from the report in question are being taken forward. The European Commission has made a legislative proposal to replace Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3820/85 on drivers' hours; this proposal is intended to clarify and simplify the legislation, make it easier to enforce, and update and remove outdated exemptions. Linked to this is a proposal to amend Directive 88/599/EEC on drivers' hours enforcement which is intended to increase the quantity and quality of checks and harmonise enforcement practices.</p>

Purchasers of plates are required to produce evidence of their identity as well as the vehicle registration document. Number plate suppliers who fail to comply with these requirements can be fined up to 5,000 and suspended from the register for up to five years.

	<p pid=".594W.5/7">The Commission's report deliberately does not provide a breakdown between cases of irregularity and fraud, fraud is defined and treated differently in each member state. Past estimates made by OLAF (the EU Anti-Fraud office) have suggested that around 20 per cent. of reported irregularities may turn out to be fraud. Applying this to the 2003 figure would suggest that the amount of fraud could be around &euro;185 million. This would represent around 0.2 per cent. of total EC Budget expenditure in 2003.</p>

Forecasts from 2002 suggested that costs would reach around &euro;1.5 billion by 2015 but then stabilise in real terms.

	<p pid=".605W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/2">Since 1997 the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Clwyd South will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly families with severely disabled 3 and 4 year old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 31 per cent. of adults and 7 per cent. of children in the Wales are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/5">Information on the numbers of customers in Clwyd South who are in receipt of disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) is in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".605W.2/19">DWP Information Centre. Figures are from a 5 per cent. sample at <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase> each year.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Clwyd South, the proportion in employment has risen to 74 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/21">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 1,400 in Clwyd South alone.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures for 2002&ndash;03 show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 1,200 families in Clwyd South.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/24">Our reforms include the State Second Pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. Around 3,860 pensioners in Clwyd South are receiving pension credit, with an average award of 41.20 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;02) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally for this year eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the One-off 70+ Payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their Basic State Pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 12,900 pensioners in Clwyd South have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.11/1">There has been no specific study on the effectiveness of the social fund on helping homeless people move from temporary to permanent accommodation. However, we know from more general research that the discretionary social fund is used by people in these circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.11/2">DWP research report 139 &quot;The use of the social fund by families with children&quot; contains secondary analysis of the Families and Children study and the Family Resources Survey. This study found that moving home is one of the three main trigger events for social fund loan applications and the main trigger event for lone parents. We can guarantee a Budgeting Loan payment to help people in these circumstances, provided the applicant satisfies the eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.11/3">Community Care Grants (CCG's) are also available to help people with the cost of setting up home. In particular it is available to people leaving institutional care, families under exceptional pressure, and people taking part in a planned programme of resettlement. These can include former rough sleepers, families fleeing domestic violence and ex-prisoners. However, as the CCG scheme is discretionary and cash limited, there can be no guarantee of payment.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.11/4">We believe that the social fund provides valuable support to the poorest and most vulnerable people in society, including those in temporary accommodation, which is why an additional &pound;90 million has been made available to the discretionary fund over the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. This has allowed the Community Care Grant budget to be increased from &pound;108 million in 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;128 million for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.11/5">We have recently announced that we intend to abolish the Budgeting Loan 'double debt' rule and reduce the standard repayment rate of 15 per cent. of a customers benefit to 12 per cent. from April 2006. These changes will make budgeting loans more consistent, easier to understand and access and will improve the help available to those who are setting up home, in particular many of those who have outstanding social fund debt. To support these changes the Social Fund loans budget will be increased by &pound;210 million over the three years 2006&ndash;07 to 2008&ndash;09.</p>

	<p pid=".609W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Dr. Vincent Cable, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the response times on telephone calls. You asked specifically about the response times before telephone numbers which are advertised to the public are answered, the percentage of time in a working day when lines are not engaged and what the most recent figures are for the performance against these standards. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a Customers' Charter which sets out the level of service that customers can expect when dealing with us, including the standards we aim for when answering telephone calls. The current standard states &quot;when you phone us or use a textphone we aim to answer your call within 30 seconds&quot;. The Charter is available from our local offices or can be printed from the internet through the Jobcentre Plus website. I have placed a copy of the latest version of the Charter in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/5" class="indent">This standard has been in place since the introduction of Jobcentre Plus and applies equally to all areas of the business&mdash;whether delivered through our local offices or through the network of modern contact centres that we are putting in place.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/6" class="indent">In the Jobcentre Plus National Customer Satisfaction Survey 2003, a copy of which is available in the Library, we asked our customers if this standard still met their expectations. Of those respondents who normally contacted us by telephone 69 per cent. felt that it was reasonable to wait at least 30 seconds and nearly two thirds of those people considered it reasonable to wait over a minute.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/7" class="indent">However, although the length of time taken is considered reasonable by many of our customers we endeavour to answer all incoming calls as quickly as possible for the people who need our services.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/8" class="indent">You asked for our most recent figures for performance in two separate areas. The performance of the 30 second response time is measured in two ways: through a Mystery Shopping Programme which measures performance against a range of service standards as defined in our Customer Service Target; and by Management Information from our contact centre network. I have provided that information. However, our telephony systems do not measure the percentage of time in a working day when lines are not engaged and I am therefore unable to respond to that part of your question.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/9" class="indentitalic">Mystery Shopping Programme</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/10" class="indent">We are moving towards an organisational structure in which many of our services will be delivered by telephone&mdash;but at the moment nearly 50 per cent. of the local office network has still to be converted to the integrated Jobcentre Plus service delivery model. Many of those offices do not have centralised switchboard systems, nor dedicated telephony teams. We therefore use the Mystery Shopping programme to undertake telephone calls on a sampled basis at a level that will provide us with robust information for the network as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/11" class="indent">The programme is undertaken by an external contractor (NOP Mystery Shopping). It includes three telephone calls to each office per quarter. The information for the first three quarters of this year (April&mdash;December) show:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".609W.2/14"> <th>Time taken to answer</th> <th>Percentage</th> </tr>

			<tr pid=".609W.2/20"> <td>Total calls made</td> <td>10,105</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".609W.2/23" class="indent">Of the remaining calls, they were either not completed as we instruct NOP to abandon calls not answered within one minute or a message/answer phone service cut in.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/24" class="indentitalic">Contact Centres</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/25" class="indent">Our network of contact centres deliver services by telephone to those customers making new/repeat claims to benefit or those wanting to find jobs. For each type of service the contact centres have a more demanding internal standard of answering 80 per cent. of all calls within 20 seconds from the time that a call is routed to an agent. There is also a target to answer 95 per cent. of calls.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/26" class="indent">The contact centres handling new/repeat claims answered on average 80 per cent. of calls within 20 seconds, with 91.1 per cent. of calls being answered.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.2/27" class="indent">The contact centres helping customers to find jobs answered 91 per cent. of calls within 20 seconds, with 97.5 per cent. of all calls being answered.</p>

	<p pid=".610W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-25">25 January 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/2">Research has been conducted on the macro-economic effect of new deal for young people (NDYP) and new deal for lone parents (NDLP). Information is not available on costs per additional job by region. A full cost benefit analysis, including the effect on tax benefits and unemployment benefits, is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/3" class="italic">New Deal for Young People</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/4">The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) undertook a detailed macro-economic analysis of NDYP until March 2000 <sup>1</sup> . NIESR calculated the net budgetary cost per job was &pound;7,000 per annum (excluding the Environmental Task Force and Voluntary Sector options) or &pound;4,000 per annum when these two options are included. The National Audit Office report <sup>2</sup> suggested that the average annual cost per additional person of any age in employment through new deal for young people is within the range of &pound;5,000-&pound;8,000.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/5">NIESR calculated that by March 2000, NDYP had reduced unemployment among all age groups by 35,000. They also estimated that NDYP raised youth employment by 15,000 (excluding those on the Environmental Task Force and Voluntary Sector options). Adding these two options raised this to 30,000 more young people in work due to NDYP.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/6" class="italic">New Deal for Lone Parents</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/7">Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of new deal for lone parents (NDLP) comes from the provisional cost benefit analysis of NDLP carried out by departmental economists. The findings were published in the NDLP Evaluation Synthesis Report in June 2003 <sup>3</sup> . The unit costs of NDLP in 2000&ndash;01 were &pound;400 per participant. The gross cost per job was around &pound;860.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/8">A calculation of cost-effectiveness takes into account the additional earnings from movements into work and the costs of running the programme in 2000&ndash;01. NDLP provided a significant net economic gain to society, with a net benefit of over &pound;4,400 from each additional job, and a total net gain of &pound;115 million.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/9">The net impact on public finance was also calculated. This included the cost of in-work credits and benefits such as the working families' tax credit. NDLP in 2001&ndash;02 resulted in a net exchequer saving of &pound;1,600 for each additional job entry; a total saving of &pound;41.5 million.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/10" class="italic">Employment Zones</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/11">The gross cost per job of Employment Zones has been estimated by the Department to be &pound;3,115 per job without benefit payments and &pound;6,027 per job with benefit payments.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/12">There has been no macro-economic analysis undertaken of the net impact of Employment Zones on the 25 plus client group. Research undertaken by the National Centre for Social Research <sup>4</sup> estimated the comparative outcomes of Employment Zones and new deal 25 plus.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/13" class="italic">Other New Deals</p>
	<p pid=".610W.2/14">Information is not available on new deal 25 Plus, new deal for disabled or new deal for partners. Information is not available on those who would have found employment without the new deal.</p>

	<p pid=".615W.2/1">Although there is nothing specific to London, there are a number of programmes designed to help disabled people return to work which are available to disabled people within the Greater London area.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) have applied to all employers, with the exception of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/3">The ending of the exclusion from the employment provisions of employers with fewer than 15 staff brings into coverage a further one million small employers with seven million further jobs in which 600,000 disabled people already work.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/4">During 2004 the Department undertook a major campaign to raise awareness of the DDA particularly among small and medium sized businesses. Around a million businesses were directly mailed information; this was supported by radio advertising, press articles in specialist and trade press and website fact sheets. A free information pack with video is also available and the second presentation of the 'Access All Areas' awards, which congratulates small service providers who have made services more accessible, took place in November 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/5">Initiatives which seek to enhance the employability of disabled people include the use of Jobcentre Plus Disability Employment Advisers who visit employers and advise them on the support and help available in the employment of disabled people and the Job Introduction Scheme (JIS) which aims to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities by offering a weekly grant, currently &pound;75 per week, to employers during the first six weeks of their employment.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/6">New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) is designed to support people in receipt of disability or health-related benefits in finding and sustaining paid employment. It is delivered through a network of Job Brokers across England, Scotland and Wales who agree with each customer what is the most appropriate route into employment for them and work closely with providers of training and other provision where the customer needs additional help. NDDP Job Brokers were introduced in July 2001 and to September 2004 the programme showed 115,930 registrations with Job Brokers and over 54,000 job entries.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/7">In addition there are a number of other programmes designed to help disabled people return to work which are available to disabled people within the Greater London area.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/8">Access to Work is a specialist disability programme which provides practical advice and support to help disabled people enter or stay in paid employment. The support is aimed at overcoming work related obstacles resulting from disability. It does this through a system of grants towards the cost of providing support. Access to Work is open to those who are employed as well as people moving out of unemployment and is a highly effective job retention measure.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/9">Work Preparation is a highly flexible programme open to benefit recipients (incapacity or unemployment related benefits) and non-benefit recipients. It is an individually tailored, work-focused programme that enables disabled people to address barriers associated with their disability and prepare for work with the confidence necessary to achieve and sustain their job goals. The vast majority of Work Preparation programmes take the form of short unpaid work placements.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/10">WORKSTEP was introduced in April 2001 to modernise the former Supported Employment Programme. It provides job support to over 30,000 people in employment and in this financial year up to October 2004 just under 900 clients had progressed into open unsupported work. In 2003&ndash;04 it held a budget of &pound;163 million and is delivered by over 200 providers, including Remploy, in England, Scotland and Wales. WORKSTEP is managed by Jobcentre Plus and involves a three-way partnership between the employer, the WORKSTEP provider, and a disabled person.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/11">People receiving incapacity benefit can do permitted work and keep benefit in some circumstances. The pre-Budget report announced new national measures for improving permitted work provision including an extension of the initial period of permitted work from 26 weeks to 52 weeks in all cases and an expansion of permitted work provisions to people facing the greatest barriers to full-time employment.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/12">People with the most limiting conditions such as advanced progressive conditions will be covered by a widened version of the permitted work provisions and be able to work for a longer period of time while maintaining their entitlement to benefit. The new measures will improve take up and provide better support on entry to permitted work through face-to-face meetings with personal advisers including a requirement for clients to consider the prospects of a move into full-time employment but only where they are able to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".616W.2/1">The Social Fund plays an important role in the Government's commitment to tackling poverty and social exclusion. It provides support to millions of people on low incomes, including some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.2/2">The Social Fund is continually under review and we have announced a number of improvements. For example, &pound;90 million is being added to the Discretionary Social Fund budget over the three years to 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.2/3">We have recently announced that we intend to abolish the Budgeting Loan 'double Debt' rule and reduce the standard repayment rate of 15 per cent. of a customers benefit to 12 per cent., from April 2006. These changes will make Budgeting Loans more consistent and easier to understand and the Social Fund more effective in assisting those families most likely to experience overindebtedness. To support these changes the Social Fund loans budget will be increased by &pound;210 million over the three years 2006&ndash;07 to 2008&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.2/4">The Government are also looking at ways in which more affordable loans can be made available to people on low incomes, and is seeking to work in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors to find ways of delivering these, while ensuring that the loans enhance the ability of people to manage their finances responsibly.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.3/2">The HSC's fundamental review of the gas safety regime 1999&ndash;2000 addressed a wide range of issues, including carbon monoxide poisoning. Of the 49 recommendations made, almost half have been implemented. Action has been taken on the remainder, with the exception of four that are either not yet due or rely on other work being completed. Some of the recommendations were drafted with a continuing obligation and so cannot be deemed as completed.</p>

The Government have decided that HSE should retain its responsibilities for the regulatory regime.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.6/2">A DTI study, completed in May 2004, looked at the feasibility of CO <sub>2</sub> enhanced oil recovery in the North Sea and published its findings in &quot;Implementing a Demonstration of Enhanced Oil Recovery using Carbon Dioxide&quot; (DTI Pub URN 04/1028). This study evaluated the potential for CO <sub>2</sub> injection into our North Sea oil fields for the purposes of carbon sequestration together with Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Our studies show that there are several operating fields where this can be technically feasible. However the cost of CO <sub>2</sub> captured and delivered to these sites and the capital costs involved are high, and none of these schemes have been shown to be commercially feasible under the current economic conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".621W.6/3">We plan to publish a Carbon Abatement Technology Strategy to address the future requirements for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from large-scale sources in the UK and storage in geological structures such as those in the North Sea. This strategy will reconsider the potential for using CO <sub>2</sub> for EOR and eventual sequestration in the North Sea. The strategy is due to be published within the next few weeks.</p>

	<p pid=".625W.2/1">The Government works with the police and industry to tackle fraud and other online crime through a number of initiatives. A key factor in dealing with online fraud is prevention and education and the Government take an active role in educating computer users about the risks of fraud committed through the internet. The Home Office website provides advice on avoiding internet fraud and the Home Office has also created, and maintains the 'e-tailing mini site', which forms part of the crime reduction website. The mini site provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves specifically when using the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/2">The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 protect consumers against payment card fraud including credit cards. The Regulations apply to contracts made at a distance including online ones. The Card issuer is required to reimburse consumers the full amount in the event of fraudulent use of the consumer's card.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/3">In addition, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 also allows consumers to recover the cost of a purchase made by credit card from either the supplier or the credit card provider. This provides additional protection should a consumer be unable to trace the company they were dealing with over the internet. The Banking Code stipulates the consumers' liability for misuse of a card will be limited unless there is evidence that they have acted fraudulently or without reasonable care.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/4">Through the Department of Trade and Industry's Safe Internet Shopping initiative consumers have access to information on how to shop online safely. Consumers need to be aware of security features on websites and to look for a closed padlock sign when they are asked for personal details. The Consumer Direct website at <a href="http://www.consumerdirect.gov.uk">www.consumerdirect.gov.uk</a> also offers advice on internet auctions, online scams and information on a range of consumer-related issues.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/5">The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 are included in a list of EC Directives, which is part of the Injunctions Directive. The Injunctions Directive requires all member states to have in place arrangements, which will allow certain unlawful actions harmful to consumers to be stopped in good time. The Injunctions Directive allows consumer protection bodies designated by the member states to apply to the courts or competent administrative authorities for orders to require traders to cease conduct that constitutes a breach of any of the consumer protection directives specified. Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002 implements the Injunctions Directive in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/6">Co-operation arrangements exist to ensure we can tackle scams that cross borders. In Europe member states have just agreed a Regulation (Consumer Protection Co-operation) to ensure that all consumer protection enforcement agencies are working closely together to combat cross border scams, and 30 OECD countries have all signed up to a co-operation agreement to tackle cross border fraud that affects consumers. The International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network (ICPEN) is a network of consumer protection enforcement agencies in over 30 countries that exists to facilitate cross border co-operation on cross border scams and consumer fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/7">The Home Office has published, jointly with the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) a leaflet on card safety, which includes a section on using cards safely over the internet. The leaflet has been sent to all police forces in England and Wales, and to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships. It is also available on the Home Office website and the e-tailing mini site, and APACS members (banks) will be sending a version of the leaflet to their cardholders.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/8">The Home Office is represented on an industry-led Steering Group, which aims to tackle 'Card Not Present' (CNP) fraud (which includes fraud over the internet). We support practical measures being introduced by the industry to increase levels of security for internet transactions. These include Address Verification Services (AVS) and Card Security Code (CSC), along with Mastercard Secure Code and Verified by Visa which require password verification for internet transactions. These initiatives are already making a significant impact on CNP Fraud. The work of the CNP Steering Group has also led to the production of a manual (Spot and Stop Card Fraud Retailer Pack), which aims to educate merchants on the dangers of CNP fraud and the steps which can be taken to prevent it.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/9">Government are also involved in the development of Project Endurance, an initiative that will launch an internet security public awareness campaign in spring this year. The project is an alliance of public and private sector, which brings together a number of UK Government Departments and law enforcement organisations with a number of high-profile private sector companies. This campaign is to be targeted at micro businesses and consumers, primarily aimed at helping these users gain confidence in using the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.2/10">We will continue to monitor and review the effectiveness of these many different initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".631W.5/1">There is no tax payable under the Licensing Act 2003. No provisions of the 2003 Act give rise to additional tax liability for organisers of country shows. Fee levels under the 2003 Act were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-21">21 January</phrase>. They have been set centrally at a level that we believe will allow the full recovery of the costs of administration, inspection and enforcement associated with the new system. There is an additional fee for premises licence applications for exceptionally large scale events (over 5,000 people) unless certain conditions apply. We met with organisers of agricultural and country shows and, on the basis of those discussions, believe from what we have been told that such events can be organised in a way so that they are unlikely to be affected by the additional fee for large scale events.</p>

	<p pid=".632W.2/1">Most of the matters for which the Department is responsible in England have been devolved in Wales to the National Assembly for Wales. However, there are some reserved areas in which the Government has introduced initiatives which affect Preseli Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/2">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality and original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and S4C, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/3">In November 2000 we introduced free television licenses for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Preseli Pembrokeshire with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 4,835.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/4">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on New Year's Eve to 11 am on New Year's Day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/5">The Licensing Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2003 repealed those parts of the Licensing Act 1964 which allowed the local government electorate in the counties and county boroughs of Wales to requisition polls to decide whether licensed premises should be allowed to open on Sundays. This has removed the uncertainty which businesses in Wales, including those in Preseli Pembrokeshire, faced, allowing them to exercise long-term planning. It also removes a costly administrative burden on local authorities and an artificial difference in licensing controls between Wales and England, which prevented businesses and customers exercising freedom of choice.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/6">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Preseli Pembrokeshire, a greater say in the regulation Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/7">No statistics are available for international visits or expenditure by constituency. However, VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination benefit all parts of the country, including Preseli Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/8">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Preseli Pembrokeshire has benefited from over 430 awards totalling over &pound;17.8 million. Of these, 63 awards worth over &pound;3.7 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

Views from parties with an interest in fee levels have been considered, including from organisers of rural shows and rural local authorities.

	<p pid=".642W.6/1">Small Business Rate Relief is applied to qualifying properties with a rateable value under &pound;10,000 while qualifying properties under the thresholds (&pound;15,000 outside Greater London and &pound;21,500 inside Greater London) pay the lower small business rate multiplier.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.6/2">The scheme is aimed at businesses occupying a single small property and so is not available to larger businesses with several small hereditaments (e.g. a chain of small shops, a company with many advertising rights).</p>
	<p pid=".642W.6/3">About 1,017,000 hereditaments outside London have a rateable value (RV) less than &pound;15,000 and 196,000 hereditaments within Greater London are under &pound;21,500 RV. Because the rating list does not distinguish between those occupied by large companies with many small hereditaments from those occupied by businesses occupying a single hereditament, the Government conducted research in early 2004 on the likely eligibility for the relief. This research indicated that around 350,000 businesses would benefit. A summary of this research is on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.6/4">This figure was based on a proposed threshold of &pound;8,000 and was revised when the threshold was set at &pound;10,000. The new estimates indicated that about 430,000 would be eligible for the relief and this was reflected in the consultation paper and RIA as &quot;over 400,000&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.6/5">As a result of the feedback from the consultation, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister further extended the eligibility for the relief by allowing applicants to discount additional properties with a rateable value below &pound;2,200. We estimate that this will further increase the eligibility for the relief.</p>

This booklet, entitled &quot;Your right to buy your home&quot;, has been updated regularly to reflect changes to the scheme introduced by successive Governments. It was revised to include the reductions in maximum discounts introduced in March 2003 and reissued at that time, and has since been revised again to reflect the changes to the scheme introduced by the Housing Act 2004. A copy of that latest revision was sent to all local authorities and housing associations in England in advance of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January 2005</phrase>, when most of these changes came into effect. The covering letter encouraged social landlords to distribute the booklet to their secure tenants. It also set out the changes to the Right to Buy rules, and stated that further copies of the new booklet are available from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Free Literature supplier at Wetherby in Yorkshire.</p>

In 2003, the West Midlands Regional Housing Board did not identify the provision of affordable homes for key workers as a sufficient priority to specifically allocate resources to key worker schemes in 2004&ndash;05 or 2005&ndash;06. It is however open to them to make recommendations for helping key workers in their region through the ADP in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister as part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's five year plan, there are no sites currently identified to build homes under the scheme in Coventry. English Partnerships (EP) is leading on the delivery of 15,000 homes, which at the moment are focussed on the areas of greatest need, London and the South East, where its portfolio is concentrated. However we expect Regional Housing Boards to work closely with EP to identify future housing priorities and we encourage other landowners, such as local authorities to use this model to address issues of housing affordability in their area.</p>

The aforementioned Order will remove the requirement for excellent authorities to publish, produce or prepare (as the case may be) Homelessness Strategies, Home Energy Conservation Reports, Youth Justice Plans, Rights of Way Improvement Plans, Local Transport Plans and Bus Strategies and Air Quality Action Plans.</p>

	<p pid=".656W.0/1">Accurate data is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. All local authorities maintain their own records of privately-owned trees that are protected by tree preservation orders and many have inventories of trees for which they are responsible. The last survey of trees in London (Action for London's Trees, 1993) estimated that there were nearly 6,000,000 individual trees and hedges and more than 65,000 woodlands and stands of trees. A survey is currently being carried out to assess the composition of trees in towns and cities in England, including London. The results will be available in summer 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.9/2">It is essential to the success of any school building project, including Building Schools for the Future, that those who will use the buildings are involved in the design and building from start to finish. This includes head teachers, other staff, pupils and the local community. The process of design and building is also an excellent educational opportunity for pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.9/3">To this end, the Department develops and spreads good practice through projects with expert bodies such as CABE, School Works, Learning through Landscapes and &quot;joinedupdesignforschools&quot;, guidance such as the exemplar designs, and materials such as the School Works Toolkit and post-occupancy evaluations. For Building Schools for the Future, our delivery body Partnerships for Schools is charged with supporting local government so that all projects are models of good practice.</p>

	<p pid=".673W.2/1">The South Greenwich Sure Start local programme was approved in 2000 and supports around 900 young local children and their families living in Eltham and Kidbrooke. The programme delivers a wide range of services to support local families including: a &quot;resourceful friends&quot; scheme in partnership with Home Start Greenwich that provides one-to-one support to families in crisis; a support group for single parents; provision of Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Educational Therapy and Portage services for families and children with special needs; provision of safety equipment which is loaned to families at a subsidised rate; a toy library; a creche; additional home visits by qualified midwife and health visitors; and early assessment and referral for children with development delay.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/2">Since opening, Sure Start South Greenwich has helped improve the quality of life for local families. For example: the percentage of women smoking during pregnancy has fallen from 45 per cent. to 39 per cent.; the percentage of children identified with speech and language development delay has fallen from 33 per cent. to 9.73 per cent. Local health visitors report back to the local programme on all women identified with post natal depression including specific referral to the Sure Start programme to provide support. Recent Sure Start Unit monitoring reports show that the programme is seeing 858 of their 909 children (a 94 per cent. increase since the programme opened).</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/3">The programme has strong parental participation both in the management board which has 10 parent representatives (up from three since 2000)&mdash;and in activities where parents act as volunteers.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.11/1">The Drug Interventions Programme (formerly Criminal Justice Interventions Programme) is a critical part of the Government's national strategy for tackling drugs. The programme aims to make the most of opportunities provided by the criminal justice system to get drug misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.11/2">The 'intensive' elements of the Drug Interventions Programme are currently operational in 66 police Basic Command Units (47 DATs) with high levels of acquisitive crime. From April 2005&ndash;06, we will expand the intensive elements of the programme to a further 32 Basic Command Units covering 23 DATs. These elements include testing for Class A drugs following charge for certain trigger offences.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.11/3">The programme will be enhanced by measures included in the Drugs Bill, which entered Commons Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-27">27 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.11/4">Between April and November 2004, over 9,000 people entered treatment through the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.11/5">Early evidence shows that acquisitive crime is falling faster in Drug Interventions Programme areas than non-programme areas.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.2/1">The skills and knowledge required for the post of custody officer are identical whether or not the statutory functions required under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) were to be carried out by a police sergeant, as currently provided for under PACE or, under Clause 111 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, for a staff custody officer.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.2/2">Currently, there is no formal qualification required before a police officer can take on the role of custody sergeant.

	<p pid=".687W.2/3">National Occupational Standards for the Police Sector developed by Skills for Justice set out the competencies and skills required for authorising and managing police detention and form an Integrated Competency Framework. In terms of the custody officer, the competency framework focuses on the key areas of making detention decisions; managing the detention of individuals; and authorising and reviewing continued detention.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.2/4">In addition, further work is currently under way with stakeholders and the National Centre for Policing Excellence on developing guidance on how these standards are to be achieved. This will be published later this year. Combined with the competency framework, we will have in place definitive standards for police and police staff employed in the custody suite.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.5/1">The Home Office has implemented eight European Community Directives and/or Regulations in the time specified.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/2" class="indent">1. Council Regulation (EC) no. 1030/2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals. Adopted 27/11/2003</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> In implementing the Council Decision the UK introduced the UK Residence Permit (UKRP). It is a secure vignette, in an EU-wide format that replaces ink stamps for the purpose of granting leave to enter or remain in the UK for periods in excess of six months.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/4" class="indent">2. Council Regulation (EC) NO. 333/2002 on a uniform format for forms for affixing the visa issued by member states to persons holding travel documents not recognised by the member states drawing up the form. Adopted 18/02/2002</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/5" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> Where member states do not recognise the country or authority that issued a person's travel document, the appropriate visa is stuck onto a separate form. The purpose of Regulation 333/2002 is to ensure that member states adopt a standard, recognisable format for the forms used in these circumstances. The Regulation also prescribes various security features which will help prevent counterfeiting and falsification.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/6" class="indent">3. Council Regulation no. 343/2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third country national (Dublin Convention II). Adopted 18/02/2003</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/7" class="indent">4. Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1560/2003 of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-02">2 September 2003</phrase> laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third country national.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/8" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> Provisions of the Dublin II Regulation entered into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase> and replaced the 1990 Dublin Convention, which was operational since 1997. The Dublin arrangements enable member states to identify whether another member state is responsible for determining an individual's application, and to return them to that responsible State.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/9" class="indent">5. Council Directive 2002/90/EC defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence. Adopted 22/11/02</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/10" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> The purpose of this Directive is to provide a definition of the facilitation of illegal immigration and consequently to render more effective the implementation of the Framework Decision in order to prevent that offence.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/11" class="indent">6. Council Regulation (EC) 2725/2000 concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Regulation (Eurodac Regulation). Adopted 11/12/00</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/12" class="indent">7. Council Regulation (EC) No. 407/2002 of <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February 2003</phrase> laying down certain rules to implement Regulation (EC) No. 2725/2000 concerning the establishment of &quot;Eurodac&quot; for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/13" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> The Central Unit database established by the Eurodac Regulations became operational on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-15">15 January 2003</phrase>. The Eurodac system provides for the computerised exchange and storage of fingerprint information on asylum claimants and illegal entrants apprehended when attempting to cross the external frontier of the EU. Eurodac evidence underpins the effective operation of the Dublin arrangements, now provided by the Dublin II Regulation (above) to secure returns and rapidly identify multiple asylum applications.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/14" class="indent">8. Council Directive 2001/51/EC supplementing the provision of Article 26 of the convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of <phrase class="date" code="1985-06-14">14 June 1985</phrase> (Carriers' Liability Directive). Adopted 28/06/01</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/15" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> The aim of this Directive is to supplement the provisions of Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of <phrase class="date" code="1985-06-14">14 June 1985</phrase>, signed at Schengen on <phrase class="date" code="1990-06-19">19 June 1990</phrase>(5) (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Schengen Convention&quot;) and to define certain conditions with respect to their implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/16">Records of the cost of implementation of these measures to public funds are not kept by the Home Department; to endeavour to do so would incur disproportionate cost. This applies to all of the aforementioned.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.5/17">Records of the cost of each measure to business are monitored through the production of Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs). These project the likely costs on businesses, charities or voluntary organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".703W.5/1">The Home Office has had not had any representations about the current level of violent crime in the Thames Valley area. The British Crime Survey which is the most reliable long-term indicator of underlying trends in violence suggests that nationally the levels of violent crime are stable, levelling off after significant falls&mdash;36 per cent. since a peak in 1995 and 26 per cent. since 1997. The most recent statistics show that violent crime has continued to fall by 9 per cent. in the year ending September 2004 but this is not statistically significant.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/2">The Government remain committed to tackling violent crime and encourage local crime and disorder reduction partnerships to work together to tackle local problems.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/3">The Thames Valley area has a number of initiatives designed to do just this. Examples include:</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/4" class="italic">In Oxford</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/5" class="indent">A Nightsafe project established to encourage safe drinking including: working with licencees; door staff issues; transport for faster and safer journeys home and other factors facing the night-time economy.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/6" class="indent">A dedicated Domestic Violence Unit has been established to provide services to victims of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/7" class="indent">High visibility patrols to tackle robbery in 'hotspot' areas.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/8" class="indent">Personal safety projects for children.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/9" class="indent">A bespoke 'Operation Redcard' in the hon. Member's constituency of Witney.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/10" class="italic">In Slough</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/11" class="indent">A staggered closing scheme reducing the number of people leaving licensed premises at any one time.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/12" class="indent">More police officers to continue to drive down alcohol-related violence in the town centre.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/13" class="indent">Operation Crater involves high visibility foot patrols in the High Street on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/14" class="indent">Recent initiatives under Pub Watch have including the winding down of cheap drink promotions, premises holding photographs of people banned for causing trouble, and the expansion of searching at the door of all club-goers for weapons and/or drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.5/15" class="indent">CCTV is also being used to identify potential disorder.</p>

	<p pid=".748W.2/1">Nutrition is a key component of a healthy start in life and schools, alongside parents and carers, have a role in shaping the habits and eating behaviours of children. As set out in the Government White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health: Making healthier choices easier&quot;, we want to see all schools deliver clear and consistent messages about nutrition and healthy eating, provide opportunities to learn about diet, nutrition, food safety and hygiene, good preparation and cooking as well as where food comes from and actively promote healthy food as part of an enjoyable balanced diet. This message is supported by a number of activities and White Paper commitments regarding nutrition in schools, including:</p>
	<p pid=".748W.2/2" class="indent">Funding of &pound;77 million is being provided over 2004&ndash;06 to enable over two million children (all four to six-year-old children in local education authority- maintained infant, primary and special schools throughout England) to receive a free piece of fruit or vegetable every school day.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.2/3" class="indent">The Government aim is that half of all schools will be part of the healthy schools programme by 2006, with the rest working towards healthy school status by 2009. From April 2005, a healthy school will provide a supportive environment, including policies on healthy and nutritious food.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.2/4" class="indent">Revising both primary and secondary school meal standards to reduce consumption of fat, salt and sugar and increase consumption of fruit and vegetables. We will strongly consider introducing nutrient based standards.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.2/5" class="indent">Subject to legislation, extending the new standards to cover food across the school day, including vending machines and tuck shops.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.2/6" class="indent">Supporting schools to provide the best meal service possible&mdash;through guidance on food procurement for heads and governors and improving training for school meal providers.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.2/7" class="indent">Ofsted inspectors will be looking at healthy eating in schools and will take into account any school meals provided in doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.2/8" class="indent">A comprehensive &quot;Food in Schools&quot; package to provide guidance and resources for implementing the whole school approach to healthy eating and drinking.</p>

However, we do share a commitment with the GMC, the Council of Heads of Medical Schools and other relevant bodies that all health professionals are trained so that they have the skills and knowledge to deliver a high quality health service to all groups of the population with whom they deal. I am aware of the British Medical Association's recent publication, &quot;Healthcare in a rural setting&quot;, which recommends a greater accent on placements in such settings.

	<p pid=".753W.6/1">The Government are committed to halting the rise in childhood obesity and have outlined their strategy for doing so in &quot;Choosing Health: making healthy choices easier&quot;. This includes a new cross-Government campaign to raise awareness of the health risks of obesity and the steps people can take through diet and physical activity to prevent obesity. We have already taken a number of steps to increase awareness of issues relating to obesity during the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; consultation last year, including staging a conference on obesity and publishing separate consultation papers, &quot;Choosing a Better Diet&quot; and &quot;Choosing Activity&quot;. Ministers and senior officials have presented at a wide range of conferences and seminars on obesity throughout the year and continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.6/2">This builds on the five-a-day programme, which includes a number of initiatives to inform consumers of the benefits of eating a variety of at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day as part of a healthy balanced diet, which can help to maintain a healthy weight. Last summer, Sport England also piloted a social marketing campaign to increase exercise in the north east of England. The &quot;Everyday Sport&quot; campaign focused on opportunities for people to include more physical activity in their daily routine and will contribute to the evidence base for an obesity awareness campaign. The Department also funds a range of non-governmental organisations to increase awareness of the benefits of healthy diet and active lifestyles.</p>
