	<p pid="a.617W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/2">The frequency of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) herd testing is determined by EU legislation but this does not establish the frequency of tests on individual cattle. In Great Britain, cattle herds are tested every one, two, three or four years depending on how widespread bTB is in their respective regions; these frequencies are reviewed on an annual basis. The percentage of herds and parishes being tested annually has increased over the last few years; currently, about 25 per cent. of herds are tested annually and another 14 per cent. are tested every two years. In 2005, approximately 43,500 herd tests were carried out on 4.85 million cattle.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/3">An analysis of bTB testing coverage in the GB cattle population has been carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and published in the Proceedings of the Society for Veterinary Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine 2006<sup>(1)</sup>. The findings from this preliminary work showed that 71 per cent. to 85 per cent. of the cattle included in the study appeared not to have been bTB tested during their lifetimes. However, it should be noted that the study included cattle which had lived through the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak when bTB testing was severely disrupted.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/4">Many of the animals not being tested do not present a disease control risk. For example, some animals in low risk herds are slaughtered prior to a herd test becoming due. However, we accept that a small percentage of animals missing a bTB test may present a disease risk. Defra is supporting further work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/5">Recent policy changes should have a positive effect on the percentage of animals being tested during their lifetimes, such as the introduction of zero tolerance for overdue herd tests and pre-movement testing for animals moving out of high risk herds.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/6">In addition to live skin testing of cattle, the bTB surveillance programme is supplemented by statutory inspection of cattle carcases at slaughterhouses by the Meat Hygiene Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.619W.15/2">I have received no recent representations about this Act, which there are no plans to repeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.15/3">The Government do not however propose to introduce a Graduated Fixed Penalty and Deposit Scheme. This would amend Part III of the Act, in which the sections referred to are located and which deals with the fixed penalty system for motoring offences. The proposals are contained in the Road Safety Bill, currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.15/4">The new Scheme would allow for a graduated system of fixed penalties for traffic and roadworthiness offences, so that the level of penalty would vary according to the level of offence severity and number of offences committed. There would also be new arrangements for enforcement examiners of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency to issue fixed penalty notices.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.15/5">There would also be a provision for the taking of deposits, similar to arrangements in many other EU countries. This would require drivers without satisfactory proof of an address in the UK to make an immediate payment at the roadside at the time the offence is committed. The deposit would be returned if the driver was subsequently found innocent by the Courts.</p>

Military aircrew continue to form part of the strategy for delivery of this future service. Real-life training experience will be provided for military aircrew both through the training they will undergo to fulfil this role and their operational experience. This in turn will continue to meet our policy of transferring skills to the deployable military forces. Counter-terrorism capabilities will also continue and will be provided by equally capable military units in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.633W.5/1">Child care costs are affected by a number of factors, such as the availability of child care provision, local wage levels, or land or rental prices where child care is offered. The child care element of the working tax credit has had a significant impact on the affordability of child care for low to moderate-income families, reducing the proportion of child care costs that they pay. Through the child care element of the working tax credit, working parents receive financial assistance with up to 80 per cent. of the costs of registered and approved child care, up to a maximum of &pound;300 per week (&pound;175 for one child). In April 2006 374,000 families were benefiting from the child care element, and they were receiving an average of &pound;50 per week towards their child care costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.2/6" class="indent">The pay award for 2005/06 was rejected because the initial offer was regarded as too low. Following a short and constructive negotiation, a revised offer was accepted.</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.2/8" class="indent">At the end of March 2006, CAFCASS staff vacancies were equivalent to 65.3 full time posts, broken down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.2/9" class="indent">Family Court Advisors&mdash;37.9;</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.2/12" class="indent">A regional breakdown is attached. The vacancies represent 3.5% of the workforce. CAFCASS vacancies levels are kept under regular review.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.2/13" class="indentitalic"> PQ74683&mdash;what plans he has to negotiate a new strategic pay deal with the trade unions in the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.2/14" class="indent">CAFCASS has agreed a set of principles with the CAFCASS trade unions, to underpin a strategic pay review, and discussions on the review have started. Completion is expected before the end of 2006, with at least partial implementation anticipated from April 2007, depending on the progress made and budgetary considerations at the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.644W.5/2">We do not collect data on the number of under 16s who play chess as part of school activities. However, we know that a number of schools incorporate chess clubs within their study support (out of school hours learning) provision. Schools and local authorities have access to government funding for study support, and have the freedom to decide which activities to offer to best meet local need and demand. By 2010 the Government also wants all schools, as part of their extended schools provision, to provide a varied range of interesting activities, such as chess clubs, before and after school and during the school holidays.</p>

	<p pid="a.654W.2/1">Local authorities are not obliged to provide milk, but where they do so they must provide it free of charge to pupils entitled to receive a free school lunch. Local authorities decide whether or not to provide whole milk. They are also free to make use of the EU School Milk Subsidy Scheme, which reduces the cost of whole milk and semi-skimmed milk purchased. The new nutritional standards in schools, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-19">19 May 2006</phrase>, stipulate that only semi-skimmed and skimmed milk should be made available in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.654W.2/2">The advice of the School Meals Review Panel and the School Food Trust was that only very young children require full-fat milk as part of their diet; and that once children are at school, semi-skimmed and skimmed versions of milk are entirely adequate. This approach reflects current nutrition advice, which is based on advice from the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (now replaced by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition) who considered this issue in relation to cardiovascular disease. Current advice highlights the important role that milk and dairy products play in children's diets, particularly their contribution to children's calcium intake; and states that school-aged children should have the opportunity to choose lower fat versions of milk as these contain at least the same amount of calcium as whole milk, but less fat.</p>

	<p pid="a.655W.9/1">There is scope in the Personal Social and Health Education framework for schools to explore issues such as parental separation and divorce. Since 2003, we have been providing training for teachers of PSHE through the PSHE certificate for teachers, from which over 5,000 teachers have so far benefited. In addition, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has produced a package of guidance for teachers of PSHE. This package includes units of work which can be used to address issues of divorce and separation.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.9/2">The DfES-funded Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource for primary schools provides ideas for developing children's ability to deal with loss and separation, sometimes through explicit reference to the separation and divorce of parents, as well as other areas of loss. There is also brief guidance for staff on working with children on these subjects.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.5/1">The Healthy Schools' Programme includes physical activity and healthy eating as compulsory elements that schools will need to address to achieve the National Healthy Schools' Standard. The Programme encourages children and parents to adopt a healthy lifestyle within and beyond the school environment. We are aiming for all schools to be working towards 'Healthy School' status by 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.5/2">The national PE, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL) strategy has set an ambitious target to increase the percentage of 5-16 year olds who spend at least two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport, within and beyond the curriculum, to75 per cent. by 2006, and to raise this to 85 per cent. by 2008. The strategy is also encouraging children and young people to participate in sports clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.5/3">Food education within the National Curriculum aims to develop healthy eating habits both inside and outside the school environment. Pupils should learn about diet, nutrition, cooking, food hygiene and safety. In addition, the School Food Trust will play a key role in taking forward the Government's programme for improving school food. It will give independent support and advice to schools and parents to improve the standard of school meals and to ensure that the issue of school food remains high on the agenda. We have developed a parents' toolkit &quot;Food in Schools: A short guide for parents and carers&quot; which encourages parents to take an interest in the food their children are being served at school and supporting what happens at school in the home.</p>

	<p pid="a.658W.2/2">Schools' core business is teaching and learning, but teachers themselves recognise that to achieve the best results they must supplement their focus on teaching and learning with appropriate additional support, and work with other professional agencies to remove barriers to achievement. The Every Child Matters reforms will help them do this by enabling schools to link in with wider children's services, and access their expertise and experience. This is particularly useful in helping schools respond to the needs of more vulnerable young people, such as those who may run away. In addition, the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme is improving integrated working at the local level along with enhanced information sharing between children's services leading to earlier identification of young people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/3">More broadly, there exist opportunities within the current curriculum, under PSHE and Citizenship Frameworks, for schools to explore issues to do with recognising and managing risks (i.e. if you runaway, what risks would you face); understanding emotions and strategies for dealing with stress; the importance of family and stable relationships; and knowing where to get help. We are not prescriptive with schools about what issues schools explore to achieve the learning objectives set out within the Frameworks, and local need determines local provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/4">In addition, DfES has run 6 development projects to test out how best to provide safe, flexible and responsive community-based services that can be easily incorporated into mainstream children's services. When we disseminate the lessons learnt so far from these, later this year, they will include information, materials and support models from work with schools in the pilot areas.</p>

An assessment should be carried out in each case to assess the risks to other children and to decide what plan of action should be put in place to address the young person's behaviour and to ensure the safety of others. This might include arrangements for monitoring the child to ensure that he does not have unsupervised access to children under 16 while at school or college or provision of specialist services, including education, not in mainstream settings which help address the young person's behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.662W.5/1">The Department has a health and attendance management strategy that draws on the recommendations of the &quot;Choosing health&quot; White Paper, &quot;Health, Work and Well Being&quot; Paper and &quot;Small Change Big Difference Campaign (SCBD)&quot;. In this context, we have recently delivered a number of initiatives to promote health and well being within the Department. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/2" class="indent">Health Events on all of our sites to promote &quot;5 a day&quot; where literature on 5 a day was supplied by the Department of Health and this was distributed to staff along with free fruit. These events were well attended with around 50 per cent. of our staff participating;</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/3" class="indent">Free pedometers have been made available to all staff along with literature supplied to us by the British Heart Foundation and Countryside Agency on the benefits of walking. Around half our staff have come forward to claim their pedometer and we plan to distribute more at future health events;</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/4" class="indent">Yearly site health check events where staff are offered health literature, weight assessment, cholesterol tests, lung function and blood pressure tests. Our last events were held in October 2005;</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/5" class="indent">The launch of our new smoking policy, shortly after National No Smoking Day (8/3/2006). This acted as a launch pad to announce that we will close all our smoking rooms, in line with the commitment that we have made to the Health Secretary to make DfES smoke free by the end of 2006. We have offered the services of our occupational health advisers to have initial discussions with staff about giving up smoking and we have distributed smoking cessation literature supplied to us by the Department of Health. We intend to provide focussed smoking cessation support to all staff who require it as we close down our smoking rooms on a phased site by site basis throughout 2006;</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/6" class="indent">We have ensured that our catering contractor, Aramark, provides health options in the staff canteens including reducing salt levels in food, using semi skimmed milk, lowering fat content and vegetarian options;</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/7" class="indent">Our two largest sites (London and Sheffield) have a gym available to all staff and all sites have exercise or well-being classes such as aerobics or yoga with the exception of Darlington (one of our smaller sites) where there was insufficient demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/8">As the programme of work on SCBD develops, the Department of Health will be working across all of Government to ensure the programme joins up to promote maximum impact. DH is leading the implementation for this initiative as part of its cross-government commitment to deliver the public health White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.2/1">Subject to Parliament's approval of the necessary legislation, our intention is to introduce the new Vetting and Barring Scheme in 2008. Implementation will be staged&mdash;as was recommended in Sir Michael Bichard's report into the Soham murders&mdash;to ensure that the new requirements are established effectively. Until then the current barring schemes will continue to operate alongside the system of Criminal Records Bureau checks. Since the Secretary of State's review into list 99 in January, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen this scheme including the establishment of an independent expert panel to advise and assist the Secretary of State in carrying out his list 99 functions, and new regulations making Criminal Records Bureau checks mandatory for all newly appointed school employees. We will also be introducing new regulations shortly to ensure that any individuals working with children who are convicted or cautioned for sex offences against children will be automatically entered on list 99.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.3/4">In Tameside 301 council homes were transferred to Ashton Pioneer homes in 1999 and this RSL has now completed its investment programme. There are no non-decent properties in the stock and a substantial reduction in empty properties has been reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.3/5">In March 2000, 16,466 homes were transferred to New Charter Housing Group. Non-decency rates are estimated to have been c.70 per cent. at the time. A10 year investment programme was begun worth approximately &pound;25 million per annum. In 2005, approximately 23 per cent. of the stock was non-decent and New Charter estimate all the stock will have met the decent homes standard by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.3/6">In addition, Manchester city council has successfully transferred estates in Houghton Green and Carrbrook both of which have been in receipt of substantial new investment to take homes up to and beyond the decent homes standard.

The application was approved by Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council in September 2003. I understand the local planning authority did not refer the case at the time to the Secretary of State to consider whether to call it in for his own decision, as the authority considered the application was in accordance with the terms of the adopted local plan. It was for the borough council as local planning authority to take into account the views of local residents when determining the application.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.5/3" class="indent">supported private saving by helping people to make better informed choices about their retirement, introducing a range of pension forecasts to give individuals an understanding of the income they are likely to receive in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/4" class="indent">Abolition of the minimum contribution conditions in basic State Pension and awarding new credits for parenting and caring to ensure such contributions are rewarded through the state pension in the same way as paid contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.669W.3/1">I have had regular meetings with colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions throughout the development of the pension reforms. I am pleased that the White Paper &quot;Security in Retirement: Towards a new Pension System&quot; has proposals to modernise home responsibilities protection and introduce a new carer's credit to improve state pension outcomes for women and carers. These two measures, allied to the whole package of pension reforms, will deliver a full basic State Pension to 270,000 more women by 2020, and extend State Second Pension to an estimated 1 million people&mdash;over 90 per cent. of whom are women.</p>

(The Life Time Plans set out the total scope of activities e.g. project scope, schedule, and cost which need to be undertaken over each site's planned lifetime to bring the site to its proposed end state). The process is that each site produces a skills strategy which, as a minimum, covers the following areas: key skills required in the short, medium, and long term; identification of skills gaps and links to the migration of the existing work force; sensitivities relating to demographic change; recruitment and training strategies; links with training providers; succession planning; and supply chain strategies for long-term availability of skills. The sites' skills strategies are analysed and developed by the NDA to ensure the appropriate supporting infrastructure is in place, and that any key issues or skills gaps are identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.3/2">The European Defence Agency's 2006 budget was agreed in November 2005 on the basis of ninety four staff. To date, no recruiting action has been taken on two of these posts. These will remain unfilled until the Agency's Steering Board decides that they are required. Any plans to change the number of staff working for the Agency in future years will be considered whenthe Steering Board approves the 2007 budget and the Agency's Council, acting by unanimity, approves the3 year financial framework for the Agency later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.678W.3/3">In practice, where there is entitlement to both benefits, bereavement allowance as a contributory benefit takes precedence. However, where the rate of bereavement allowance is less than the rate of carer's allowance, an amount of carer's allowance can be paid to make up the difference. Even where no carer's allowance can be paid, underlying entitlement to the allowance gives access to the carer premium in income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit, and to the carer's additional amount in pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.690W.3/5" class="indent">Roads Service recently produced a 32-page information supplement called 'The Link' on the M1/Westlink scheme. This is one of the largest and most high profile schemes ever undertaken by Roads Service and has attracted a huge level of public interest and an equally high level of demand from the media for information about the scheme. The supplement was distributed to homes across Northern Ireland in late May, through the 3 main newspapers.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.3/6" class="indent">Road Service produced the supplement in house with the assistance of the Departmental Graphic Design Unit and Press Office, and the only costs incurred were for printing and insertion into the three main local daily papers. Some 206,000 copies were printed at a cost of &pound;50,118, and associated distribution costs were approximately &pound;8,500, which equates to just over 28 pence per copy.</p>

During the year EHS runs two shoreline booming exercises in order to test its resource and command and control functions in response to a major coastal water pollution incident. The latest exercise, in mid-2005, was designed to test the agency's ability to protect the River Roe. In 2003, EHS took part in a major national coastal pollution response exercise in Lough Foyle, coordinated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which was designed to test the National Contingency Plan.</p>

Both of these options currently include a link road from Ascot Park to Shandon Park. We plan to present these options at a public consultation day in spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.698W.2/1">Sex offender compliance with the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is high at around 97 per cent. in Northern Ireland. Notifications are recorded by the police on a live database and the number of unregistered offenders in breach of the requirements may therefore fluctuate on a daily basis. A search of the database to provide the information in reply to the hon. gentleman's question showed that the number of offenders subject to the notification requirements and for whom the police did not have a current residential address has now reduced to 11. The offences for which these offenders had been convicted were as follows: three for rape; one attempted rape; two unlawful carnal knowledge; two indecent assault on a female; two making/possessing indecent images of children; one buggery. One person with a conviction for making/possessing indecent images of children was subject to probation supervision at the time they failed to comply with the notification requirements. Of the eleven offenders, four had been subject to a multi agency risk assessment with no one being assessed as Category 3 High Risk i.e. someone whose sexual offending has been assessed as currently likely to lead them to seriously harm other people. PSNI pursue a policy of actively seeking to trace offenders who fail to comply with the notification requirements. This includes placing the offender's details on ViSOR and PNC to alert other UK police forces, checking with agencies such as social security to establish if the offender is claiming benefits etc, and providing full details to colleagues in An Garda Siochana who then complete similar checks for the offender in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.8/1">Good quality scientific studies from relevant populations in the United States of America and the United Kingdom suggest that childhood obesity does appear to persist into adulthood. It should be noted that the majority of obese adults have gained weight during adulthood. However, a significant proportion of children will remain obese and become obese adults. The risk increases when one or both parents are obese. The likelihood of adult obesity also increases with the age of the child and their degree of obesity.</p>

	<p pid="a.713W.2/2">The registration figures for 1997 are not comparable with the figures for subsequent years because the 1997 data reflect the previous registration periods (24 months for adults and until the end of the following calendar year for children), while the later data mainly reflects the shorter registration period of 15 months. The introduction of personal dental services pilots in October 1998 and subsequent growth has affected the figures from September 1999 onwards; these changes affect comparisons over time. Registration rates are given for SHAs and for England. However, registration rates for PCTs are not available before 2001 because population estimates are not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.0/1">No such estimate or assessment has been made centrally. The Department is quite clear in that referrals to community-based clinical assessment services, and other such centres, should happen only where it adds genuine clinical value for patients. Where they add clinical benefits and are properly integrated as part of the wider primary care health team, such services have a real potential to benefit patients by ensuring that they see the most appropriate clinician in the most convenient setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.0/2">The Department is working closely with Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority to ensure that waiting times of patients referred through North Somerset primary care trust's referral management centre are reported appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.0/3">The Department recognises however, that guidance on waiting list reporting is complex, especially in light of changing referral practices; choice; and the 18-week pathway. We therefore intend to work closely with the Royal College of General Practitioners and other professional bodies to develop clear guidance on the role and appropriate use of clinical assessment services and other similar services within the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.8/1">It is for councils to decide on whether and how to set charges for non-residential social services. The legal basis is that charges generally should be 'reasonable' and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can. This position contrasts with that applying to charges for residential care, where regulations prescribe a national means test, which councils must follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.8/2">The Department issued statutory guidance, 'Fairer Charging Policies for Home Care and other non-residential Social Services&mdash;Guidance for Councils with Social Services Responsibilities', which is available in the Library, to all local councils in November 2001. It was amended in September 2003 to reflect the introduction of pension credits. It does not seek to change councils' power to charge, or not, for these services. It is intended to ensure that charges generally should be reasonable and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.8/3">The guidance aims to ensure in particular that service users on low incomes are protected from charging and that any charges levied on disability benefits are subject to an assessment of disability costs, to ensure their reasonableness. Councils are required to ensure that charges do not put any users' incomes below basic income support levels or the guarantee credit of pension credit, plus a buffer of 25 per cent. This can lead to real improvements in the position of many users, who will cease to pay charges or pay a smaller charge.</p>

However, there is now a much closer match between the demand and supply of health care workers and there is more competition for posts. It is a joint responsibility between higher education institutions and local NHS organisations to see that nursing and other health care graduates are supported to find employment. Vacancies for graduates continue to be posted on NHS Jobs and the NHS Careers information service can direct graduates to appropriate sources of information and advice.

	<p pid="a.720W.0/1">Departmental Ministers have received 19 letters from Members of Parliament, nine letters and five emails from members of the public, and a large petition about plagiocephaly in the past 12 months. It is for doctors working in national health service trusts to decide how and whether to treat children with positional plagiocephaly. We do not collect information centrally on how they do so. Health visitors and general practitioners are trained to recognise deformities in babies, including plagiocephaly. We have not tried to raise awareness of parents about plagiocephaly but the advice we give in &quot;Birth to Five&quot; which is available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.0/3">This suggests that babies should experience a range of positions. If followed, this advice would not only help prevent plagiocephaly, but also enhance a child's development. We do not collect statistics on the incidence of plagiocephaly centrally.</p>

The widespread introduction of targeted BCG vaccination means that the majority of children at high risk of tuberculosis will now be vaccinated in early life.</p>

In support of these changes an updated leaflet, factsheet, and poster were produced and sent directly to the professionals and primary care trusts. All of these resources were aimed at raising awareness of tuberculosis, and also informing health professionals and the general public alike, of the changes to BCG policy.

	<p pid="a.734W.2/1">The Government's Drug Interventions programme (DIP) which began in 2003 is providing a route out of crime and into treatment for drug misusing offenders who commit crime to feed their habit. DIP uses contact with the criminal justice system as an opportunity to engage drug misusing offenders in treatment and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.2/2">Individuals who are arrested for certain offences including theft&mdash;which includes shoplifting&mdash;in the98 areas with the highest levels of acquisitive crime are tested for Class A drugs as a part of DIP. Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drugs worker. Testing on arrest is a way of identifying drug misusers at an early stage in the criminal justice process. Other key elements of the programme are operating across England and in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.2/3">The Drug Interventions programme continues to have a positive impact in communities not only by the interventions that it offers but also by delivering a more integrated approach by local agencies to the problems of offenders. Since the programme began over 43,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through DIP.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.2/4">Acquisitive recorded crime&mdash;to which drug related crime (including theft) makes a substantial contribution fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005 compared with the previous 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.9/1">Joint police and Crown Prosecution Service Witness Care Units (WCUs) were piloted in 2003 in 5 areas, Gwent, Essex, North Wales, South Yorkshire and the West Midlands. An independent evaluation of these pilots found that witness attendance at court improved by nearly 20 per cent. and that there was an overall increase of six per cent. in victim and witness satisfaction. It also showed that the number of trials which had to be adjourned as a result of witness difficulties decreased by 27 per cent. and that there was a 17 per cent. reduction in 'cracked' trials where the witness withdrew their statement or did not attend. There was a 10 per cent. increase in the number of 'positive' cracked trials where the defendant entered a late guilty plea.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.9/2">Building on the success of these pilots, Witness Care Units were rolled out across all 42 criminal justices areas in England and Wales under the No Witness No Justice project. Full coverage was achieved in line with our target of December 2005, with 165 Witness Care Units now in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.9/3">Although relatively new, Witness Care Units have already demonstrated their effectiveness. The number of trials that did not go ahead as planned because a witness did not attend was reduced from a national average of 908 in September 2004 to 727 in August 2005, a decrease of almost 20 per cent. In those cases handled by Witness Care Units, the witness attendance rate has increased from 78.5 per cent. in the 3 months before WCUs went live to 84 per cent. in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.9/4">A sustainability plan for the project is currently being developed which will provide a detailed analysis of the benefits of Witness Care Units, taking into account savings in time for the police, prosecutors and court officials, reductions in cracked and ineffective trials and savings in legal costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.743W.2/1">The Government met their target to have full national coverage of Witness Care Units by the end of 2005. There are now 165 Witness Care Units in operation across every criminal justice area in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/2">Witness Care Units are a vital part of the Government's drive to improve support for victims and witnesses. Witness Care Units, jointly staffed by the Crown Prosecution Service and the police, have helped to move the criminal justice system from a concept of partnership to a reality, where Government, agencies and practitioners work together to deliver better services for the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/3">It is important that witnesses are valued, kept informed and looked after?whether or not they are called upon to attend court. Witness Care Units ensure that witnesses receive a more thoughtful and tailor-made service, with their individual needs considered from the time a statement is first taken by the police. If the case proceeds to court, witnesses will have a single point of contact to keep them up to date on how the case is proceeding, if and when they are required to give evidence and what the final outcome is.</p>

However, governors have been instructed to take into account recent public statements made by Ministers, including the Prime Minister, regarding the likelihood of deportation when considering foreign national prisoners for category D status and allocation to open conditions. The overriding purpose of the security classification must be to ensure that prisoners are retained in custody with a level of security that is consistent with the need to protect the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.750W.17/2">The Public Prosecution Service, which when fully rolled out will be responsible for all prosecutions arising from police investigations, only came into existence in June 2005. Prior to that date, the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions was only responsible for the conduct of the more serious criminal cases and the bulk of prosecutions in the magistrates court were conducted by the police. The police continue to conduct prosecutions in the magistrates court in those areas not yet covered by the PPS. The figures provided in the tables reflect, therefore, only those cases conducted by the PPS or the old Department of the DPP.</p>

The SOCA Board has subsequently determined that approximately 10 per cent. of its overall effort should be devoted to fraud.</p>

The measures on which SOCA will be judged will include the quality of its knowledge and understanding of the crime networks and markets in its priority areas, and the dislocation that it is achieving in respect of those networks and markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.754W.0/1">The Government are determined to tackle sales of alcohol to under-18s. Enforcement of the law takes place on a daily basis through test-purchase operations carried out by Police and Trading Standards officers. In addition to this regular activity, the fourth national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC 4) is currently under way. Part of this includes the provision of extra funding for up to 5,000 test-purchase operations during the four-week period of the campaign. Those who sell to under-18s risk a &pound;80 Fixed Penalty Notice, or prosecution. Licensees selling to uder-18s additionally risk having their licence reviewed and conditions applied, or even having their license revoked.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/2">The Violent Crime Reduction Bill currently before Parliament establishes a new offence of persistently selling alcohol to under-18s. If three sales are made in3 consecutive months, the new offence will be committed, and the licensee risks a fine of &pound;10,000 and having their licence suspended for 3 months. The police can offer the licensee the option of avoiding prosecution by closing their premises for 48 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/3">In addition to enforcement activity, Ministers and officials from the Home Office and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport are working very closely with the licensed industry, and have secured commitments from both the off-licensed sector and the on-licensed sector to seek to eliminate sales of alcohol to children. Progress against these commitments will be monitored closely through test-purchase failure rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/4">The Government are aware of the problems faced by young people when wishing to prove their age or purchase age restricted products, also by retailers when requesting proof of identity. Consequently, the Government are working with the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) which validates the variety of proof of age card schemes available. This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic logo. This is easily recognisable both to retailers and young people and helps them know that they have a proof of age document which should be accepted. The logo is trademark registered, making it an offence to forge. In the longer term, the identity card can be used as proof of age as well as proof of identity, however, this is a few years away from introduction.</p>
