	<p pid="e.353W.9/2">Oral evidence taking in Public Bill Committees began in January 2007. Four Bills which began their passage in session 2006-07 took such evidence, and in the current session it will now be standard practice for all programmed Government Bills starting in the Commons to hold sessions of oral evidence. The ability of such committees to take oral evidence before proceeding to clause by clause scrutiny has brought benefits to the consideration of Bills. Good co-operation between the Government and other representatives on the committee, and the House authorities, can maximise the effectiveness of the process. The power for such committees to receive written evidence is increasingly made use of by a range of organisations and individuals. The initial view is that these processes have helped to improve the opportunities for those outside Parliament to engage with the legislative process.</p>

However, there is a provision prohibiting the contractor from assigning any portion of the Contract without the prior written consent of the Lords Commissioners of HM Treasury (or such other person or persons duly appointed by them). On the basis that a prohibition on 'assignment of debt' includes a prohibition on the contractor from assigning money owed to it under a contract to a third party, the legal team take this provision to mean that under HMT's standard terms and conditions of purchase a contractor may not assign its debts without HMT's prior consent.</p>

	<p pid="e.371W.3/1">The Government's objectives in the field of private equity are the same as their objectives in relation to other forms of ownership: to promote an environment of long-term, sustainable business success, underpinned by a strong culture of clear disclosure to, and engagement with, underlying investors and stakeholders. The Government's assessment also suggests that it is in the interests of the private equity industry to provide information which will improve public understanding of the industry by demonstrating the extent of its contribution to the UK economy and employment.</p>
	<p pid="e.371W.3/2">The Government also welcomed the announcement earlier this year by leading private equity houses and the British Venture Capital Association that it would undertake a review to draw up a comply-or-explain code to improve levels of disclosure. Sir David Walker's code is an important step forward in improving the transparency of the industry. He has set a challenge for the private equity industry and the Government will watch with interest to see how the industry responds to this.</p>

	<p pid="e.386W.5/20">The Prison Service has &quot;safer cells&quot;&mdash;no cell can be considered totally &quot;safe&quot;&mdash;that can complement a regime providing care of at risk prisoners and reduce risks around impulsive suicide attempts. The use of this type of accommodation should be seen as just one part of the comprehensive suicide prevention strategy. The design of safer cells has several features which can assist staff in the task of managing those at risk from suicide, such as specially designed furniture and fixtures which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult, and access to window bars prevented via-non-opening windows with integral ventilation grills.</p>

	<p pid="e.396W.9/21">The Ministry of Defence employs staff in many hundreds of different roles. I have placed in the Library of the House a complete list of the departmental grades, job families and job codes.</p>
	<p pid="e.396W.9/22"><i> (a)</i> Staff in the non-industrial broader banded groups and industrial skill zones (excluding Trading Funds) are eligible to receive end of year bonus awards based on relative assessment of performance against their peers. In 2007 up to 75 per cent. of non-industrial staff and 100 per cent. of industrial staff could be awarded one of three tiers of bonuses. For the senior civil service, bonuses are used to reward excellent performance during the year and the award is based on a judgment of how well an individual has performed against their peers. Fixed term employees brought into the Department through fair and open competition have contracts which allow for payment of a non-consolidated, performance related bonus, usually of a maximum of 10 per cent. of basic salary. Individual performance is judged by line managers and, for those who are agency chief executives, there is an annual audit of performance against agency key targets. The Agency owner then takes a view of the individual's performance guided by the independent audit agency and the remuneration committee. MOD also operates a special bonus scheme to reward civilian staff for exceptional performance in a specific task or for the achievement of professional qualifications which benefit MOD and the individual. Staff in Trading Funds are subject to separate arrangements which meet their business needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.396W.9/23"><i> (b)</i> All MOD civil servants are eligible to belong to a pension scheme. Most belong to the principal civil service pension scheme (PCSPS)&mdash;although there are a number of different schemes under the overall PCSPS umbrella. Some analogue grades&mdash;such as lecturers, teachers and medical grades&mdash;belong to the pension scheme appropriate to that profession such as the teachers pension scheme, the Scottish teachers pension scheme and the NHS pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.396W.9/24"><i> (c)</i> An MOD employed civil servant is eligible to claim for the reasonable extra expense of travel and subsistence while on official duty. This may mean travel expenses by public transport, official or private vehicle, the actual bed and breakfast costs where overnight accommodation is required and the reimbursement of actual and reasonable additional meal and refreshment costs while undertaking the official duty.</p>

	<p pid="e.401W.5/2">EU legislation requires that all bird gatherings are banned unless the member state is satisfied that a risk assessment shows that gatherings would not significantly increase the risk of avian influenza. Therefore, consistent with previous outbreaks, following confirmation of avian influenza in Suffolk on <phrase class="date" code="">12 November</phrase>, all bird gatherings, including falconry displays, fairs, markets, shows (including pigeon shows), exhibitions and pigeon races, were banned throughout Great Britain. This is because in the immediate aftermath of an outbreak there is great uncertainty over undetected infection elsewhere in the country, which means that all bird gatherings are high risk activities.</p>
	<p pid="e.401W.5/3">This ban was kept under constant review, and following a veterinary risk assessment, all bird gatherings outside non-restricted areas were permitted again from <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase>. As before, this is under the normal general licence conditions of good biosecurity, notification to Animal Health seven days prior to an event and record-keeping. Also, birds coming from outside the British Isles (for example, the UK, Republic of Ireland and the Isle of Man but excluding the Channel Islands for these purposes) cannot be taken to a gathering for 28 days after their importation, and pigeons must be isolated from other birds for at least seven days after a race.</p>

	<p pid="e.411W.8/2">Labelling and guidance for consumers on poultry meat extends to various product attributes and advice on cooking and handling and the Food Standards Agency is the lead Government Department on general food labelling and guidance. Labelling on poultry meat, in common with all foods, is also subject to the legislative requirements on food labelling. Specific provisions governing marketing standards and labelling of (uncooked) poultry meat are laid down in EU regulations, notably Council Regulation No. 1906/90 and Commission Regulation No. 1538/91 (both as amended). As the EU Commission are in the process of reviewing the latter, decisions on labelling in these areas are likely to await the outcome of this.</p>

	<p pid="e.415W.2/3">(ii) the UK-Indonesia multi-stakeholder forestry programme (MFP) has operated in Papua, among other regions. Activities under this programme include support for forest policy reform, indigenous and other local community land rights, economic livelihoods, and tackling deforestation and illegal logging. Further information on this innovative programme can be found in the book 'Aid That Works', published in 2006 and available from DFID. Funding under MFP for Papua in 2007-08 is likely to amount to approximately &pound;120,000. Funding levels for 2008-09 have not yet been set.</p>
	<p pid="e.415W.2/4">(iii) through the Indonesia Partnership Fund for HIV/AIDS (IPF), DFID is supporting the strengthening of the two Provincial AIDS Commissions for Papua and West Papua, as well as district AIDS Commissions, primarily through the National AIDS Commission Secretariat. In addition, Family Health International and the Indonesian HIV Prevention and Care Project both have HIV programmes in Papua and West Papua which receive support from DFID through the IPF. This work focuses on health system strengthening, providing care, support and treatment to people living with HIV, and prevention of sexual transmission of HIV in the two provinces. It is not possible to disaggregate the financial disbursement data sufficiently to indicate expenditure by province without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="e.418W.6/1">Advanced biofuel production processes, including so-called &quot;second generation&quot; biofuels, offer the potential to deliver very high levels of greenhouse gas savings from the transport sector in a highly sustainable way. This is principally because they may allow liquid transport fuels to be produced efficiently from a much wider range of sources than is possible today (including wood, agricultural residues and the organic fraction of municipal waste).</p>
	<p pid="e.418W.6/2">Many of these processes are proven at laboratory scale, and a number of demonstration projects are up and running in various parts of the world. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, as to whether, and if so when, they will become viable at commercial scale.</p>
	<p pid="e.418W.6/3">European Union Heads of Government have made clear that future biofuel targets (including the 10 per cent. by 2020 target agreed at the March 2007 European Council) should be conditional on second generation biofuels becoming commercially available. This is to ensure that these targets can be delivered in a sustainable and cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid="e.418W.6/4">The UK Government are aiming to incentivise the development of advanced biofuels under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. Further details of how this might be done are set out in a policy paper which is available via the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="e.432W.8/2">The Southeastern franchise is limited to an average annual increase in regulated fares (including those for season tickets, full fare singles and returns) of RPI +3 per cent. for five years from 2007 reflecting the very significant investment in the franchise in recent years including more than &pound;600 million in new rolling stock (some 408 new carriages) and &pound;93 million in power supply, stations, depots and infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="e.436W.4/2">We recognise the many wider benefits of participation in learning and its vital contribution to personal health and wellbeing, community involvement and quality of life as people age. Learning helps older people to fulfil themselves as active citizens and as members of their families and communities. People who keep mentally and physically active not only live longer but live happier and more fulfilled lives and pursuing learning can play a real part in this. We remain committed to ensuring the continuing availability of a wide range of suitable learning opportunities in every area for adult learners, including older people, and have safeguarded funding for learning for personal and community development at &pound;210 million through to 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="e.436W.4/3">We continue to work closely with ministerial colleagues in the context of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Ageing Policy (DA(AP)), to take forward the Government's opportunity age strategy, to ensure that longer life is healthy and fulfilling and that older people can participate fully in society. Colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions lead on Opportunity Age and we are working with them to deliver the opportunities for older people proposed in World Class Skills and in the Green Paper: In Work, Better Off, both published in July this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.436W.4/4">My officials are also working closely with their counterparts in Department of Health and Department for Communities and Local Government on the Opportunity Age Strategy Partnership Group, as well as its Sub-Group on Education and Training, and on the Task Group we have established to steer our reforms in Personal and Community Development Learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.436W.4/5">I know that there are concerns about the impact of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 on fee concessions for older learners and I must make clear that the regulations do not bar providers from offering fee discounts for learners aged 65 and over. They allow for such positive action provided that it can be objectively justified. I refer my hon. Friend to my written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 35WS.</p>

	<p pid="e.450W.5/1">Security is, and always has been, of paramount importance to the ContactPoint project and we are mindful that the Data Protection Act 1988 requires that the level of technical and organisational security must be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="e.450W.5/2">In relation to practitioner access to ContactPoint, I refer the hon. Member to the reply given on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 926-27W.</p>
	<p pid="e.450W.5/3">In relation to the storage and use of data, on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 November</phrase> my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, asked the Department's Permanent Secretary to conduct an immediate assessment of how personal data are stored and protected in the Department. The Permanent Secretary reported back within 24 hours to confirm the Department is confident that we have very robust procedures in place. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. On <phrase class="date" code="">Wednesday 21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all Departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. Given the obvious importance of ensuring that ContactPoint has extremely robust security measures in place, on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State also asked for an independent assessment of ContactPoint's security procedures. This will be conducted by Deloitte.</p>
	<p pid="e.450W.5/4">In line with best practice, ContactPoint will be routinely backed up. This will be done only by specifically identified system operators within Capgemini, with whom we have contracted for the build and initial host of ContactPoint. Two Capgemini staff will have to be present when back-ups take place. This dual control is considered best practice. The backup tapes will be encrypted, protected with a strong (complex) password and stored in a fire-proof safe in a secure room. The limited number of Capgemini staff who do have access to these data must have enhanced CRB clearance.</p>
	<p pid="e.450W.5/5">There is no facility that would allow users to copy personal identifiable information to a file, other than when files need to be backed up as indicated. The vast majority of users will only be able to view child data on the screen &mdash; they will not be able to extract files in a personally identifiable form. A very limited number of people will be able to extract identifiable data, one record at a time, from ContactPoint in order to meet legal requirements as set out in The Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007, including responding to Subject Access Requests. There is a clear right under the Data Protection Act 1998 for children and young people (or their parents or carers when acting appropriately on their behalf) to have access to their information on ContactPoint and for it to be corrected if it is found to be inaccurate.</p>
	<p pid="e.450W.5/6">A very limited number of people in local authorities and the national ContactPoint team will be able to run reports to, for example, produce aggregated data or support data quality checks. These reports will be in an anonymised form and will not contain personally identifiable data. The only exception to this is a report produced to support local authorities in their duty to identify children who are missing education. The information provided in this report is restricted by regulations and can only contain child name, address, date of birth, unique identifying number, parent/carer contact details and the details of start and end dates for educational institutions attended by the child or young person.</p>

	<p pid="e.466W.11/1">There are already a number of lone parents who are claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) rather than Income Support who are able to meet the conditions for receipt of JSA and make use of the help available to get back to work.</p>
	<p pid="e.466W.11/2">JSA conditions already have flexibilities with the necessary scope to allow carers, including lone parents, to tailor their availability for work to suit their personal circumstances. These include: changing their pattern of availability during school holidays; limiting availability to a minimum of 16 hours and; being treated as available and actively seeking work if there is a domestic emergency. Each case is judged on its own merit and all the available evidence is considered in reaching a decision. However, these flexibilities are subject to them having a reasonable prospect of finding work and being available for work for at least 16 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="e.466W.11/3">The impact of these measures and how they can best be tailored to lone parents, were considered in our Green Paper 'In work, better off: next steps to full employment' and in the subsequent consultation on its proposals.

	<p pid="e.468W.0/1">New Deal 25 plus is mandatory for people aged 25 and over who have claimed jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 out of the last 21 months. Participants enter a Gateway of intensive job search and specialist help to improve job prospects which lasts for a maximum of 16 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="e.468W.0/2">Those still claiming JSA at the end of the Gateway take part in the Intensive Activity Period (IAP). This lasts for a minimum of 13 weeks and is designed to give people the skills and experience they need to move into work. IAP provision includes basic employability training, self-employment support, education and training opportunities, and flexible packages of support, which can combine work experience or placements, work-focused training and help with motivation and soft skills. Those still unemployed at the end of the IAP period are referred to the Follow-Through phase of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="e.472W.0/1">Since 2003-04, the Home Office has made &pound;34.4 million available in each year specifically and solely to tackle antisocial behaviour. This includes funding for the Respect programme, which is now the responsibility of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and a grant for antisocial behaviour co-ordinators.</p>
	<p pid="e.472W.0/2">In 2005-06, in England the antisocial co-ordinators grant was pooled within the safer and stronger communities fund. This pooled budget supports the delivery of outcomes contained in local area agreements (LAAs). All LAAs include for this year (2007-08) mandatory outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="e.472W.0/3">There are many funding streams that impact on antisocial behaviour. A more detailed account can be found in the report by the National Audit Office &quot;Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour&quot; (HC99 2006-07, December 2006). Other Home Office led activities also act to tackle antisocial behaviour, for example the introduction of community support officers, but a monetary value cannot be assigned to that contribution. Similarly, other Government Departments fund services that directly bear upon antisocial behaviour. For example the Crown Prosecution Service provides a network of specialist antisocial behaviour prosecutors, and Her Majesty's Court Service provides specialist antisocial behaviour response courts. There are many other programmes and services that contribute, sometimes indirectly, to tackling antisocial behaviour, including diversionary activities for young people, action against enviro-crime such as fly-tipping, neighbourhood wardens, as well as neighbourhood policing and neighbourhood management. A more detailed account can be found in the report of, and evidence to, the Home Affairs Select Committee's report on anti-social behaviour (Fifth Report, Session 2004-05, HC80).</p>

	<p pid="e.494W.2/1">There is no evidence to suggest that premature charging of suspects in terrorism cases occurs. Crown prosecutors are responsible for deciding whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence, and if so, what that offence should be. They make these decisions in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the Director's Guidance on Charging. The code sets out the general principles Crown prosecutors should follow when they make decisions on cases. In cases where it is proposed to keep the suspect in custody after charge, but the evidence required to apply the Full Code Test is not yet available, the Threshold test can be used. This test is frequently used in terrorism cases and a charge is brought at the earliest opportunity. It is already possible to make a judicial challenge to unlawful detention through the use of habeas corpus proceedings. No such challenge has been made in terrorism cases.</p>

	<p pid="e.504W.5/1">The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is responsible, under the Care Standards Act 2000 and associated Regulations, for all aspects of regulation and inspection of care homes providing nursing care.</p>
	<p pid="e.504W.5/2">Up until April 2005, all care and nursing homes were required to be inspected twice yearly. From April 2005, CSCI's inspectors started using new ways of inspecting social care providers, based on the aims set out in the consultation document, &quot;Inspecting for Better Lives&quot;. The new inspection methodology is designed to place the people who use social care services and their experiences at the heart of the way CSCI inspects and regulates care services.</p>
	<p pid="e.504W.5/3">From April 2005, CSCI has carried out key inspections for care and nursing homes at a frequency determined by the quality of the service. A key inspection is a thorough, detailed inspection, under which CSCI will assess all of the key national minimum standards. For example, a 'poor' quality service will receive a minimum of two key inspections a year, an 'adequate' service will receive a minimum of one key inspection a year, a 'good' service will receive a minimum of one key inspection every two years, and an 'excellent' service will receive a key inspection a minimum of once every three years. CSCI also carries out 'random' and 'thematic' inspections, which are short, focused inspections on a specific theme or area.</p>
	<p pid="e.504W.5/4">The following table shows the percentages of care homes which failed to meet the National Minimum Standards (NMS) on meals and mealtimes and medication in each year from 2002-03. Information is not available for 2001-02; the NMS were introduced in April 2002.</p>
	<p pid="e.504W.5/5">CSCI inspectors rate homes' performance against each standard and score it on a scale of one to four. Scores of three or four mean the standard has been met. Scores one or two mean the standard has not been met. However, the score of two indicates that the failure is due to a more minor issue.</p>

It does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.<br/> 4. Exemption Category Estimates: The exemption data are identified from the box ticked on the back of the prescription form and relies on the form being completed correctly which may not always be the case. Information for categories that are not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a one in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors.

Information is therefore provided on the PCTs most closely aligned with this area: Central and Eastern Cheshire and Western Cheshire.<br/> In October 2006, there was PCT restructure. For the QOF years 2004-05 and 2005-06, information is provided on the old PCTs that made up the new ones when the restructure occurred. Central Cheshire and Eastern Cheshire became Central and Eastern Cheshire, and Cheshire West and Ellesmere Port and Neston became Western Cheshire.<br/> In July 2006, Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) were restructured. Information is provided for 2004-05 and 2005-06 on the old SHAs that became the new North West SHA. Cheshire and Merseyside, Cumbria and Lancashire and Greater Manchester SHAs became the North West SHA.<br/> 3. Coverage of QOF<br/> Patients will only contribute to the figures in QOF if they are registered with a general practice participating in QOF.

	<p pid="e.519W.3/1">Heart transplantation operations are inherently high risk and services need to be actively monitored and practice reviewed to assure the quality and the safety of patients. Papworth hospital has resumed heart transplantation after the Healthcare Commission said that quality of care at the hospital was good and the Trust agreed to implement a number of recommendations to improve some aspects of practice in line with the best standards. We are aware that Papworth hospital has participated in a European study looking at the merits of using beating heart technology but that results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

	<p pid="e.520W.0/1">A European study of the use of the organ care system has been carried out in 20 patients including seven at Papworth hospital and one at Harefield hospital. We understand that the study was not a randomised controlled trial and had no comparison group. The results were presented at 2007 meeting of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation but have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This presentation stated that there were no deaths within 30 days of transplantation in the 20 patients in the study. We have not made an assessment of the merits of using the organ care system in United Kingdom transplant units but understand that the Food and Drug Administration has given approval of a research study at five named centres in the United States of America to evaluate the safety and performance of the organ care system in heart transplantation. This study will start in 2008 and may provide relevant evidence for the future. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation publishes figures for survival at one year following heart transplant according to different ischaemic times.</p>

The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  2. <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  3. <i> All Diagnoses count of episodes</i> These figures represent a count of all FCEs where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record. An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.  4. <i> Ungrossed Data</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for Health and Social Care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.540W.3/1">I have arranged for a table showing: the level of housing debt, the amount each authority with debt set-aside for the repayment of that housing debt, the cost of servicing the debt (the 'Item 8 debit' in the Housing Revenue Account) and the interest rate that the housing debt attracted (the 'Consolidated rate of Interest' or CRI) for each financial year from 1997-98 to 2005-06 (the last year for which audited data is available) to be deposited in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.540W.3/2">Until <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, local authorities were required to 'set aside' a proportion of their capital receipts for the repayment of housing debt, although whether or not the amount set aside was actually used to repay housing debt was a treasury management decision for the authority. It was assumed for the purposes of HRA subsidy that housing debt was repaid. The absence of set-aside data in the table after 2003-04 reflects the introduction of the housing capital receipts 'pooling' regime replacing set-aside and there being no requirement to collect 'set-aside' data from that year. Set-aside data used in the HRA subsidy calculation were audited and so collected in the year following the year it was actually set-aside. It was considered that building set-aside into the HRA subsidy model for 2004-05 was not appropriate as the pooling of capital receipts would also be operating for this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.540W.3/3">The data available to Communities and Local Government do not allow the break-down of set-aside into its constitute parts, which will include right to buy sales, transfer receipts and receipts from other disposals such as the sale of housing land.</p>
	<p pid="e.540W.3/4">Treasury does not 'write off' housing debt. Any overhanging housing debt arising from a housing stock transfer is cleared by a payment from Communities and Local Government. These payments are made from an Annually Managed Expenditure Budget held by the Department. Under this arrangement debt moves from one part of the public sector to another, and in consequence there is no net increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. The Exchequer meets future interest payments generated by such transactions.</p>
	<p pid="e.540W.3/5">The following table shows the value of transfer receipts and the value of overhanging debt payments by year for England since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="e.560W.8/2">In the written ministerial statement I made to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 65-69WS, I announced that we are still minded not to implement Norwich city council's unitary proposal and intend to ask the Boundary Committee for advice on the proposal and on whether for the area affected, Norwich city and the remaining county area, there could be alternative unitary solutions, involving boundary changes, which would meet the five criteria set out in our invitation.</p>
