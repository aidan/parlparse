	<p pid="c.299W.3/1">The armed forces have not undertaken any specific research or study into the impact of Deepcut on recruitment levels. Nevertheless, the Services continually monitor recruitment and seek to identify the reasons for any significant variation in the number of enquiries received. There is some evidence to suggest that the media coverage of Deepcut has been a factor in depressing encouragement from parents and teachers for those in the target audience to join.</p>

This triple approach aims to reduce drug taking in the Army as far as is possible in order to maintain the integrity of the force. CDT is a part of this approach by providing an active deterrent to drug taking. The Army tests 85 per cent. of the force annually for all controlled drugs and those who are caught are almost always discharged. Additionally, education and information strategies for substance misuse, including drugs and alcohol, have been developed and are implemented at all stages in the careers of soldiers wherever they are based and on at least an annual basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.306W.8/29">Since 2001, the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine has been the main receiving unit for patients aeromedically evacuated from an operational theatre. If a long stay is expected, patients can be transferred to a hospital local to their home for less acute treatment, enabling them to be nearer to their family. Indeed, a significant proportion of Service personnel requiring hospital treatment in the UK in general are treated, both as emergencies and electively, at other NHS hospitals. The decision to do this is based on relative waiting times and on convenience for the individual patient and the patient's family. Additionally, patients requiring more complex rehabilitation for musculo-skeletal conditions can be referred, where appropriate, to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court.</p>

	<p pid="c.308W.5/1">It is not possible to provide comprehensive and accurate details on Territorial Army (TA) recruiting spend alone nor break it down into the detail requested. Spending on TA recruitment is a multi-layer activity involving disparate formations, units and agencies spanning a number of different budget areas, which allocate funds over a financial year, not by quarters.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.5/2">The overall national marketing spend for financial year (FY) 2005-06 for the Army (both Regular and TA) was &pound;38.4 million and the national marketing budget for FY 2006-07 is &pound;25.8 million. This includes &pound;5 million and &pound;2.3 million specifically earmarked for TA activities. However, the TA also benefits further from many elements of the rest of the national Army marketing budget, which are aimed at both the Regular Army and the TA. These encompass television and press advertising, the production of DVDs, leaflets, pamphlets and brochures as well as the overarching production and design costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.5/3">In addition, &pound;12.9 million was spent on various TA recruiting (and in some cases retention) initiatives in FY 2005-06 and &pound;12.5 million is allocated for 2006-07. These initiatives include the establishment of additional posts to further improve TA recruiting hierarchy and infrastructure, the establishment of Brigade Recruitment and Advisory Teams, improvement of recruiting Reception Centres and other ad hoc recruiting drives.</p>

Particular areas for recruiting focus on increasing the number of young officers joining the TA, medical technicians, specialist trades in the Royal Logistics Corps, communications technicians and other more general trade soldiers in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Infantry and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. A major change programme, known as Project One Army Recruiting is under way to improve recruiting into the Regular and Territorial Army by integrating the recruiting operations of the two organisations.</p>

Arrangements are in place at both airports which allow the IOM and their representatives unrestricted access, enabling staff to provide assistance to returnees from the moment they land.

Arrival is confirmed by the transportation company. For returns through Baghdad, passengers are met at the airport by IOM staff. Only one company is able to provide transportation from Baghdad International airport. The IOM arranges for the returnees to be taken to Baghdad's main land transportation hubs where onward travel is organised either by taxi or bus. For enforced returns, there is clearly a difficult position in those parts of Iraq most affected by insurgent action, but it is not accepted that this applies to all areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.312W.9/3">Returns are taken forward on a case by case basis and are only enforced to areas assessed as sufficiently stable and where the Home Office is satisfied that the individual concerned will not be at risk of persecution or in need of humanitarian protection.

	<p pid="c.314W.5/1">There have been some recent developments in respect of immigration detention in Northern Ireland. Until early 2006 it had been the case that where it was necessary to detain individuals in Northern Ireland men were accommodated in the Working Out Unit, Crumlin Road, Belfast and women were accommodated at HMYOC Hydebank Wood.</p>
	<p pid="c.314W.5/2">It is now the case that individuals in Northern Ireland who are detained under Immigration Act powers are no longer held in Northern Ireland. Such individuals are transferred to a detention facility in Great Britain either on the day of detention or within 24 hours. In the majority of cases individuals will, initially, be detained at Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre. Individuals whose asylum applications are straightforward and capable of being decided quickly may be held at Oakington Reception Centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.314W.5/3">While there are occasions when consultation with outside bodies is appropriate, there will be other occasions, of which this was one, where such consultation would delay changes to operational policy and practice that can and should be made quickly. In this case, consultation would simply have served to prolong the routine use of prison places in Northern Ireland for detainees beyond the point that it was operationally necessary to do so. This would not have been desirable.</p>

	<p pid="c.319W.3/1">In 2004 the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) undertook an exercise to evaluate the compliance of Registered Bodies with the Bureau's Code of Practice. This identified risks to the Disclosure service posed by an increasing and remote Registered Body network. Although the CRB and the Bichard Inquiry recognise the vital role of Registered Bodies in the Disclosure service, both share concern over the high numbers and proficiency of the existing Registered Body network.</p>
	<p pid="c.319W.3/2">The CRB will consequently reduce the number of Registered Bodies to work with those that remain to make the network more professional and more experienced in the Disclosure process. This will allow the CRB to ensure that the network of users is fully proficient in the security and policies of the CRB. A minimum threshold of 100 applications per year, per Registered Body has been set. The CRB will provide advice, guidance and support to organisations that do not meet the volume criteria about how they can access the Disclosure service in the future before their registration is cancelled.</p>
	<p pid="c.319W.3/3">The CRB has developed an alternative distribution network, through the Umbrella Body (UB) network to ensure cancelled organisations maintain full access to the Disclosure service. The CRB has been working closely with the existing UB network to ensure that they are able to provide an effective, robust and efficient service and have the capacity to absorb the increased volume of applications from new and cancelled organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.319W.3/4">The CRB have developed a 'controlled roll out programme' to ensure that UB's can manage any increased volume with ease. The CRB have also been encouraging those organisations that remain part of the Registered Body network to become UBs. The UBs are able to offer a great deal of experience in handling and processing CRB checks that can also pay dividends in ensuring that the check is completed as quickly as possible. In addition, improved UB web pages have been developed and implemented on the CRB website, which provides an enhanced search facility to enable eligible organisations to find a suitable Umbrella Body.</p>

	<p pid="c.320W.0/2">In England, resources previously held by the Home Office for the dental care of prisoners have been devolved to those primary care trusts (PCTs) that host a publicly managed prison. This forms part of their general allocation to commission appropriate healthcare services for prisoners. These resources are not ring fenced, and PCTs as part of their commissioning role are able to move resources from one healthcare service to another to meet their specific local needs. It is therefore not possible for us to identify centrally how much is spent on dentistry in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.320W.0/3">The dental services provided to prisoners are an integral part of primary dental services under the new contractual arrangements for national health service dentistry. PCTs are required to provide all dental services required to meet the reasonable needs of their resident population, including prisoners. In Wales, these resources have been devolved to local health boards. Arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland are a matter for the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland office respectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.320W.9/1">The importance of involving crime reduction partnership agencies in the resettlement of offenders is recognised in the NOMS regional strategies to reduce re-offending as well as nationally in the Government's Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan. In November 2005 Baroness Scotland launched three alliances, including the Civic Alliance which set out how NOMS can work with local authorities and local communities to reduce re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="c.320W.9/2">These are now being rolled out across the nine regions and Wales by Regional Offender Managers (ROMs). The ROM in the East Midlands, along with the Local Government Association and Society of Local Government Chief Executives, is leading a demonstration project on how NOMS will work with local Strategic Partnerships and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) through local area agreements to reduce re-offending in local communities. To date no evaluation of the effectiveness of CDRPs' involvement specifically in the resettlement of ex-prisoners has been completed. However, work has recently begun in London to examine the operation of a scheme aimed at meeting the needs of prisoners resettling in eight London boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="c.320W.9/3">The scheme&mdash;the London Resettlement Pilot&mdash;forms part of the London Resettlement Strategy published in September 2005. The Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in the eight boroughs (Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Brent, Barnet, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Harrow and Ealing) are working with Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London. They have nominated local strategic leaders who are working to develop enhanced and co-ordinated responses to the needs of resettling prisoners. An action research project has been commissioned which will report in summer 2006 on the resettlement pilot and will include an assessment of progress being made through working with local partnerships in this way.</p>
	<p pid="c.320W.9/4">An evaluation is also currently underway of the impact of Prolific and other Priority Offenders Programme (PPO), which is being implemented by CDRPs and local Strategic Partnerships. One strand of the programme is aimed at rehabilitating and resettling PPOs who are in custody or serving sentences in the community, through closer working between all relevant agencies and continued post-sentence support. A final report on this work is due in autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.333W.5/1">The Home Secretary has regular meetings with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. Recent meetings have not covered the effect of 'churn' specifically, but have focused on the establishment of the Offenders Learning and Skills (OLASS) project, which will introduce a new service of education and skills for offenders in both custody and the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.333W.5/2">There have also been discussions about the Reducing Reoffending through Skills and Employment Green Paper launched in December 2005, which looks at strengthening the link between education and employability for prisoners. The Department for Education and Skills, the National Offender Management Service and the national probation directorate (NPD) are working closely to ensure that all prisoners have education opportunities in prison and in the community after release. The throughput of prisoners in establishments (i.e. numbers of prisoners received and discharged on a daily basis, also known as &quot;churn&quot;) has increased significantly.</p>
	<p pid="c.333W.5/3">It has had some impact on establishment performance, particularly in hard pressed local prisons. However, since April 2002, over 150,000 basic skills qualifications have been achieved by learners in prison. (In the last year, the NPD in partnership with the Learning and Skills Council supported the achievement of just under 9,500 qualifications to offenders in the community).</p>

	<p pid="c.333W.8/1">The Prison Service already has a scheme at HMP Coldingley that pays prisoners market rates for their work. However any expansion of such a pilot is limited by finding sufficient work that generates income to support such schemes. Under present legislation prisoners cannot be required to contribute directly to the cost of their stay in prison. Section 51 of the Prison Act 1952 requires that all expenses incurred for the maintenance of prisons and prisoners are met from public funds. However some schemes do exist that enable prisoners to make voluntary contributions to a variety of charitable causes, including those for victims. The Prisoners' Earnings Act 1996, which would, if implemented, allow deductions to be made, is very complex and prescriptive and would cost substantially more to administer than it would raise in revenue.</p>

	<p pid="c.336W.0/1">An assessment has been made based on the number of in-country work related applications for settlement received each year. This indicates that around 45,000 applicants may be affected by the change and will now have to wait a further year for settlement. This estimate has been made subject to certain assumptions; for instance, that applicants who are eligible will apply for settlement at the earliest opportunity, and that the broad pattern of applications will remain the same as before.</p>

Between that date and the introduction of the change we received no views from employers on the substance of the policy, and the views that we have received since have been about the effect of the timing on individuals, not on sectors of business or employment. Most of the views we receive from employers in the normal course of events are that skilled workers do not stay with them for long enough, which, of course, is not affected by this change.

	<p pid="c.336W.9/1">The change does not affect anyone's right to remain and work in the UK; anyone with valid leave to remain and who is continuing in employment will qualify to remain as before and should have no difficulty in completing the fifth year. It will, therefore, have no affect on the employability of those on work permits since their employability is linked first and foremost to the skills that they possess, whether there is an employer who continues to require those skills, and whether the skills are still not available in the resident labour market. In some cases an employer may have to obtain renewal of a work permit and to pay a fee. We wish to maintain the attractiveness of the UK as a destination for investors. But our assessment is that the length of the qualifying period for settlement is of marginal importance in inward investment decisions compared with economic factors and the specific investment opportunities available. The discussions that we have had with representatives include those who represent individual overseas investors and these discussions have reassured us that the impact of this change on its own is likely to be neutral.</p>

	<p pid="c.337W.2/1">The Government looked closely at the merits of introducing transitional arrangements for those affected by the increase in the minimum qualifying period for settlement. In deciding not to introduce transitional arrangements the Government was took account, amongst other things, the following: this change does not prevent anyone from doing anything that they are currently doing; it does not limit anyone's time with any employer or reduce their stay in the United Kingdom in any way; and that to introduce transitional arrangements for those who arrived when the qualifying period was four years would mean that a desirable policy would not take effect until 2011.</p>

However, our embassy in Bangkok regularly discusses the situation of Burmese refugees from all ethnic groups with the office of the UNHCR. The Royal Thai Government are not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees and does not give refugee status to refugees from any of the Burmese ethnic groups, including the Shan. There are, however, more than 150,000 Burmese refugees in the area. We have not had any recent discussions with the Royal Thai Government or other Association of South East Asian Nations countries about the status or treatment of Shan refugees.</p>

We have no firm evidence of widespread mistreatment of native Papuans and/or Christians. Officials from our Embassy in Jakarta visit Papua regularly and meet local officials, academics, journalists and non-governmental organisations. We are also in regular contact with Papuan groups in the UK. We raise cases of concern with the Government of Indonesia and ask them to follow up substantiated allegations.</p>
	<p pid="c.356W.6/2">We regularly encourage the Indonesian Government to allow access to Papua for media organisations. We understand that the BBC correspondent in Jakarta has been given permission to visit Papua this month. We welcome this.</p>

The skills required for these programmes were not available from civil servants. In addition consultants have been engaged by ODPM to support the delivery of projects to enhance the ability of the Fire and Rescue Service to respond to major incidents. The work undertaken by consultants includes radio engineering expertise for the new radio systems for the Fire and Rescue Service; also, logistical support and design for responding to a chemical, biological, radioactive or nuclear incident and search and rescue incidents. Some 60 per cent. of expenditure has been in support of these projects.</p>

The list shows the one off payment that was made to discharge the Office's continued liability, through the Housing Revenue Account (HRA), to pay subsidy on an authority's housing attributable debt that remains after transfer. This option of paying off debt, as opposed to continuing to pay subsidy, was introduced in 1999 following consultation and is not an extra cost, it is largely a question of when the liability to meet the cost of HRA debt is discharged. There is no debt repayment for ALMOs as the local authority continues to be support through the HRA subsidy system.</p>

	<p pid="c.383W.2/1">The national bowel cancer screening programme will be rolled out nationally over the next three years. Funding for the first year of the screening programme is being transferred to the national cancer screening team in Sheffield, and Wolverhampton will be the first local screening centre. We intend that all five programme hubs will be established and around 14 local screening centres will be operating, out of a total of 90 to 100 for full national coverage, by March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.383W.2/2">We do not hold data on how many of the 217 people diagnosed with bowel cancer as a result of the bowel cancer screening pilot are still alive.</p>
	<p pid="c.383W.2/3">The clinicians in Rugby have advised that all persons diagnosed with bowel polyps have been treated.</p>
	<p pid="c.383W.2/4">Once the bowel cancer screening programme is fully operational we would estimate that around 2 per cent, of all those screened will have a positive FOB test result. Of these around 10 per cent. will have bowel cancer and approximately 45 per cent. will have polyps.</p>

	<p pid="c.392W.2/1">The service development guide 'Everybody's Business' was launched in November 2005 as the next step in the Department's strategy for improving mental health and care services for older people, including those with dementia. It builds on the existing service models outlined in the 'National Service Framework for Older People' (2001) and the principles promoted in 'Securing Better Mental Health for Older Adults' (July 2005). One of the main aims of the guide is that older adults with mental health problems and their carers have their needs met wherever they are in the system, including where possible being supported and enabled to live independently at home.</p>

	<p pid="c.396W.5/1">The Mental Health Act 1983 sets out the circumstances in which people with a mental disorder who are being treated compulsorily under that act may receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The act allows ECT to be given to patients who are under compulsory powers when a patient with capacity consents or if the patient's doctor prescribes it and a second opinion appointed doctor agrees to it. People can also receive ECT voluntarily. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance on the use of ECT in 2003. The guidance is available on NICE'S website at <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.400W.2/2">Between 1998 and 2005, the provision of single-sex accommodation was measured as compliance at national health service trust-level with three objectives set by the Department. These objectives have been superseded by the core national standards presented in &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/3">The core standards require that:</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Staff treat patients, their relatives and carers with dignity and respect&quot; (C13) and</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;Health care services are provided in environments which promote effective care and optimize health outcomes by being ... Supportive of patient privacy and confidentiality&quot; (C20b)</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/6">The Healthcare Commission will measure compliance with these standards. Previously compliance was measured annually at trust level. The results of the most recent compliance survey (December 2004) show that:</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/7" class="indent">99 per cent. of NHS trusts provided single-sex sleeping accommodation for planned admissions and had robust operational policies in place to protect patients' privacy and dignity;</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/8" class="indent">99 per cent. of NHS trusts met the additional criteria set to ensure the safety of patients who are mentally ill; and</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/9" class="indent">97 per cent. of NHS trusts provided properly segregated bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/10">The small number of hospitals who did not achieve these objectives are building new hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.2/11">The 2004 position of each NHS trust was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-26">26 May 2005</phrase> and is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a> and is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.402W.0/1">The Department has not examined any specific research on the impact on obesity of using beverages containing calorie-free sweeteners. Research has been carried out in the United States of America, and published in the Journal of American Academy of Paediatrics, on the effects of decreasing consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks on body weight in adolescents. The available evidence on the relationship between sugar and body weight is not clear and more evidence of an association is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn.</p>
	<p pid="c.402W.0/2">Calorie-free soft drinks contribute to consumer choice and current consumption levels of artificial sweeteners are within safe limits. The Government's healthy eating advice remains that consumers should drink plenty of water, or other fluids, daily, and to drink fewer sugary soft and fizzy drinks.</p>
	<p pid="c.402W.0/3">The Food Standards Agency and Department have published guidance for schools on practical ways of developing approaches, which provide healthy drinks and snacks. This encourages schools to provide, in addition to drinking and bottled water, other drinks which provide a nutritional benefit to pupils, such as fruit juices and milk-based drinks.</p>

For example, action on sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of achievements relating to these policy areas can be found at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm</a>. I am confident that the West Lancashire constituency will have benefited from these.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/2">In particular, the West Lancashire constituency has benefited from funding through the National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund as well as the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant to deliver household waste recycling levels that are currently well above the national average. Singly, or in partnership with other Lancashire authorities, West Lancashire has received more than &pound;7 million to support progress in this area in the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/3">Under the Nitrates Directive, around 80 per cent. of the West Lancashire constituency was designated as an Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2002; currently about 55 per cent. of England is designated. Farmers in NVZs are required to follow an action programme aimed at reducing the risk of nitrates loss; for example by limiting the amount of Nitrogen applied on the farm during the year and by not applying manure or fertilisers during certain times of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/4">Since 2003, local authority performance on street cleanliness has been measured through best value performance indicator BV199. This assesses the percentage of survey sites in each local authority area with unacceptable levels of litter and detritus. In 2003-04 West Lancashire scored 18.2 per cent. against a national average of21.2 per cent., and in 2004-05 19 per cent. against a national average of 18.1 per cent. These results are for West Lancashire district, comprising the constituencies of West Lancashire and South Ribble. Data are not available at the constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/5">In March 2005 we announced that Lancashire would be one of eight rural pathfinders in England. The pathfinder initiative is a key part of the Government's Rural Strategy and reflects the Government's commitment to devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. The Lancashire rural pathfinder is helping to ensure greater co-ordination of rural delivery programmes, including testing new and innovative methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to rural communities and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/6">Lancashire has also proved to be a fertile ground for our Defra's Project Based Schemes which are generally available to farmers to help them develop new business opportunities and widen the skills they already possess. For example, Farmer Ted's Farm Park, located at Worral House Farm just outside Southport, was opened in 2003 with the help of funding from the Rural Enterprise Scheme. In the first 18 months it received over 38,000 visitors including 480 school trips. The attraction also contributes to the local economy by employing 10 full-time and 30 part-time employees.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/7">The RPA will be releasing details of payments made under the new Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in due course. It will publish an annual figure for payments to each recipient under the SPS drawn from its financial records. The information will be extracted and published on the RPA website later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/8">Indicators of environmental quality for West Lancashire district are given as follows, they are for water quality and waste and recycling. Data for other indicators are available only either at regional and/or national level and not local level, or for individual monitoring sites not within the area local to West Lancashire. For some indicators data for 1997 are not available and the nearest year for which data are available has been given.</p>

	<p pid="c.414W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.2/2">The Government have sought to establish the facts about the extent of the alleged trade in domestic cat and dog fur in the UK. We have found no evidence that such fur is being imported into this country in significant volumes. The Government have also been working to establish a scientific test to make it possible to ascertain reliably from what species of animal any given fur sample has come.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.2/3">We firmly believe that action on this issue should and would best be taken at EU level as a harmonised approach would have greater impact, enhance animal-welfare standards within the EU itself and avoid obstacles to the operation of the single market. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs supported calls for the European Commission to investigate these allegations when the Agriculture and Fisheries Council met in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.2/4">In January 2006, the Commission published its Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, which proposes action in the course of 2006 to address public concerns on the trading of cat and dog fur and derived products. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase>, Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Kyprianou stated at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council that the Commission was planning to publish a proposal on the import of cat and dog fur within the next few months.</p>

However, preparation for the 2006 scheme is well under way, with the vast majority of 2005 scheme claimants having received a claim form for this year's scheme. Business processes and IT systems required to process 2006 scheme claims are being developed and deployed on an iterative basis, and data capture of 2006 scheme claims will commence shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.428W.2/1">The preparation and writing of the draft North East regional planning assessment (RPA) was carried out by a single consultancy firm procured by the Strategic Rail Authority at a fee cost of &pound;224,997 (including VAT).

	<p pid="c.428W.2/2">A number of SRA, and subsequently Department for Transport (DfT) staff supported the development and production of the published RPA, but were not solely dedicated to this task. SRA and DfT staff costs for the RPA work alone are therefore not available. However, it is estimated that around 15 per cent. of a full-time DfT post (plus formerly 25 per cent. of a full-time SRA post) was spent supporting this work, with additional administrative support.</p>

They increased the adult minimum wage rate from &pound;3.70 to &pound;4.10 an hour and the rate for workers aged 18-21 (inclusive) from &pound;3.20 to &pound;3.50 an hour. They also made a number of other amendments relating to the level of the accommodation offset and workers taking part in accredited training.

This Directive applied to the employment field only. These regulations are enforceable through the Employment Tribunal system.</p>

The Inspectorate can prosecute an agency found to be in breach of the legislation and can also apply for a Prohibition Order preventing an individual from operating as an agency or employment business for up to 10 years.

It extended the previous two-year limit on the period over which an employment tribunal could award back pay in successful equal pay cases, extended the six-month time limit within which a woman must bring an equal pay claim before an employment tribunal in specific, limited cases, and introduced a new rule that enables equal pay claims to be brought during the period of a stable employment relationship or within six months of it ending. These Regulations are enforceable through the Employment Tribunal system.</p>

Between 1984 and 1992 a different interpretation ofICD-9 selection rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994*. The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution. An article specifically examining the effect of the change in classification for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics Quarterly 23**.

	<p pid="c.450W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding (1) the size of the electorate and the registration rate in each local authority in (i) England, (ii) Wales, (iii) Scotland and (iv) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years; (2) the percentage of those eligible to vote who were registered to vote in each local authority in (a) England, (b) Wales, (c) Scotland and (d) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years and (3) the total electorate for (a) the Vale of Clwyd and (b) Denbighshire in each of the last 10 years. (68582, 64195 and 65905)</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/4" class="indent">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England &amp; Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate 'total electorate'. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/5" class="indent">Historical UK Electorate by LA</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/6" class="indent">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the 'registration rate' using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/7" class="indent">It is not possible to 'split' estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a 'split'.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/8" class="indent">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual 'usual resident' mid-year population; (ii) the size of the (a) Parliamentary electorate and (b) local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as (a) Parliamentary electors and (b) local/European electors. These are labelled as 'registration rates' on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/9" class="indent">This 'registration rate' is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated 'registration rate' calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate 'registration rates' on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/10" class="indent">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/11" class="indent">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/12" class="indent">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/13" class="indent">We have also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data provide the best possible comparison.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/14" class="indent">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/15" class="indent">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/16" class="indent">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated 'registration rates' for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/17" class="indent">A copy of the tables will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.6/18" class="indent">The tables provide as comprehensive as possible comparisons between historic local authority population and electorate numbers. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are also interested in the percentage of residents who are registered to vote on a Parliamentary constituency basis. Official Report number 82 column 1719, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>, provides the best possible consistent UK comparison for Parliamentary constituencies. For England and Wales we hope to investigate the possibility of producing population estimates by Parliamentary constituency in the future using Small Area Population Estimates. For Northern Ireland, population estimates by Parliamentary constituency are already available from the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency (NISRA).

	<p pid="c.453W.3/1">The DFID bilateral programme in Angola has commitments of &pound;5 million for the financial year 2006-07. Expenditure is concentrated in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/2" class="indent">Relief and recovery. This includes support for bridge repairs that are necessary to allow humanitarian aid to reach affected areas of the country. Funding has also been provided for emergency operations to contain the outbreak of the Marburg virus in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/3" class="indent">Strengthening democratisation. Our work here focuses on decentralisation and supporting civil-society contributions to the elections process. We also work with the World Bank to try and improve governance in the country and support the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/4" class="indent">Urban poverty in Luanda. This programme has created space for local communities to organise and better engage with local government on a range of issues, such as local water supply. The programme will end this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/5" class="indent">HIV and AIDS. We are providing support for condom promotion, access to testing and behaviour change programmes, and are also providing anti-retrovirals.</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/6">This year, Angola has also received approximately &pound;1.3 million from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACCP). ACCP funds are agreed on a yearly basis. In addition, DFID continues to support de-mining operations in Angola. &pound;1 million has been provided this year for de-mining in the country. A similar commitment is expected in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/7">Angola will also be involved in regional programmes that DFID in Southern Africa is currently developing. This regional programme is a &pound;20 million per annum commitment, addressing regional peace and security, trade and growth, and resilient livelihoods concerns. As part of this regional commitment, we have recently approved an &pound;18 million UNICEF programme to address children affected by AIDS. Around &pound;3 million of this programme will be directed to Angola.</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/8">All DFID bilateral resources are managed through third party civil society and UN organisations and not by the Government of Angola.</p>
	<p pid="c.453W.3/9">Allocated bilateral expenditure from DFID is expected to be &pound;3 million for 2007-08. Angola also benefits from DFID contributions to European Union and the World Bank operations in Angola. The EU has committed &euro;146 million over the five year period from 2002-07. The World Bank's contribution this year is approximately US$30 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.454W.5/1">DFID staff continually monitor the humanitarian situation (including food needs) in Chad, and undertake periodic assessments in the east of the country. Of immediate concern, is the food situation of the estimated 50,000 Chadians who have been displaced as a result of attacks and violence in the border area with Darfur. The World Food Programme (WFP), along with other UN agencies and non governmental organisations (NGOs), are currently assessing needs and are launching programmes to assist these displaced and vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.5/2">Another critical issue at this time of year is the pre-positioning of food aid for the 205,000 Darfur refugees in Chad prior to the start of the rains. The WFP has indicated that, despite the deterioration of security in April, this process is on-track. The UK provided the WFP with &pound;2 million for its operations in Chad last financial year, and we are considering providing further support.</p>

Each time staff log on to our computer network, they are required to acknowledge that they have read and agree to comply with the Acceptable Use of IT policy. Our system also alerts staff when logging in that their activity on the system may be monitored. The policy provides clear guidance that misuse of official equipment will be a disciplinary offence, and, subject to the particular offence, could lead to dismissal. The policy applies to civil servants working in the UK and overseas, and to our locally appointed staff overseas, who work under local contacts.</p>

	<p pid="c.457W.2/1">DFID's current retirement age is (i) for UK staff below the senior civil service and our locally appointed staff overseas who work under local contracts (unless local law dictates otherwise)&mdash;60, with staff having the option to continue working up to 65 if they wish, subject to continued capability and satisfactory service; (ii) for the senior civil service&mdash;60. We have flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 in certain circumstances if it is judged to be in the public interest, and similarly, exceptionally, staff below the senior civil service beyond 65. Currently there are three senior civil servants aged beyond 60, and three staff below the senior civil service aged beyond 65.</p>
	<p pid="c.457W.2/2">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase>, the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations come in to force, introducing wide ranging provisions against discrimination on age in employment and vocational training. The Regulations introduce a default retirement age of 65. DFID is presently considering what its retirement age should be from October 2006. For the senior civil service, it will be 65, in line with the default retirement age. DFID retains its delegated authority to set the retirement age for staff below the senior civil service and will decide shortly whether to adopt the default retirement age of 65 or to have no retirement age at all. The Age Regulations also introduce a &quot;duty to consider&quot; procedure to ensure retirements at whatever age are fair. This will allow employees to request to work beyond the normal retirement age, and require discussions between DFID and the employee about when the employee will retire. Both parties will have to give adequate notice in order to ensure the retirement constitutes a fair dismissal in employment law.</p>

	<p pid="c.457W.5/1">All children, including those with disabilities or living in difficult circumstances, should have equal access to a good quality basic education. DFID is committed to working with the Governments of developing countries towards the education of all children, including those with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.457W.5/2">DFID's policy on social exclusion is laid out in its September 2005 policy paper entitled 'Reducing poverty by tackling social exclusion'. The paper sets out how DFID will build on the work that is already under way and some practical actions that DFID is taking to tackle social exclusion and make a real difference to the lives of excluded people.</p>
	<p pid="c.457W.5/3">Also, DFID's strategy paper of last year, 'Girls' education: towards a better future for all' recognised that certain groups of girls are more likely to be excluded from school on the basis of caste, ethnicity, religion or disability and that disabled children, and among them disabled girls in particular, constitute a significant group that is denied access to education. The challenge is to support governments to provide quality education for excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.457W.5/4">It is not possible, without incurring a disproportionate cost, to identify a comprehensive list of projects supported by DFID which include supporting disabled children's right to education. DFID's approach is to support developing country governments' own education plans rather than directly manage discrete projects. In India, for example, DFID has supported through its country programme, the District Primary Education Programme, which promotes inclusive education, and some states have been successful in integrating disabled children into mainstream schools. In Vietnam, DFID has co-financed with the Government of Vietnam, the World Bank and other donors the Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children programme, a &pound;243 million project which was launched in October 2003 and includes a strong focus on primary education for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="c.457W.5/5">DFID also provides funding through UK non-governmental organisations to support projects that benefit disabled people and advocate for disabled people's rights. DFID has partnership agreements with a number of organisations that support disability-focused activities, such as World Vision, HelpAge International, Save the Children and VSO, among others. In addition, through our partner Action on Disability and Development, with whom we have a six-year Programme Partnership Agreement, we work to promote greater participation and inclusion of disabled people and their organisations in decision-making processes, particularly on partner governments' Poverty Reduction Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="c.462W.2/1">Agriculture in India is generally a success story. India is self sufficient in staple grain crops in most years and stores a substantial surplus. The so-called 'green revolution' has been the main driving force behind this success, promoting the use of improved crop varieties and fertilisers in areas with access to irrigation.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/2">However, the benefits of new technologies have not been equitably distributed. DFID's focus has been on improving the livelihoods of farmers and other rural people in rain-fed areas which are not suited to the particular packages of improvements offered by the green revolution. The focus on livelihoods, rather than agriculture, recognises that poor people are often landless and depend on a diverse range of activities to support themselves. However, DFID-supported projects have developed and tested appropriate new agricultural technologies and tools in these areas that have resulted in increases in production and income, more efficient and sustainable use of soil and water resources and reduction of hard manual labour, particularly for women. Some examples are treadle pumps for small scale irrigation, seed drills, paddy rice transplanters, which have made work easier as well as contributing to improvements in production.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/3">Consistent with this approach, DFID has concentrated on micro-credit rather than agricultural credit. DFID is working with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to develop the capacity of micro-finance institutions to on-lend to individuals or groups. Approximately 45 per cent. of these loans are for agriculture, livestock, fisheries or related activities. DFID's rural livelihoods projects incorporate revolving funds at the village level to support agriculture, livestock and micro-enterprise activities.</p>

	<p pid="c.463W.2/1">DFID reviews the effectiveness of all bilateral projects over &pound;1 million at least once a year. This includes money which DFID country programmes channel through multilateral agencies since according to international convention this aid is classified as bilateral. DFID has a public service agreement target to achieve a sustained increase in the quality of DFID's bilateral projects. DFID reports progress towards this target in the Departmental Report and the Autumn Performance Report. This year's Departmental Report will be published on 9<sup>(th)</sup> May.</p>
	<p pid="c.463W.2/2">This monitoring system cannot track core contributions to multilateral agencies because these funds are pooled. However, DFID uses a Multilateral Effectiveness Framework and other assessments to evaluate the performance of the multilateral agencies. During 2004, DFID used the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework to assess 23 multilateral agencies against their objectives. These objectives were agreed jointly with DFID and set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper. These institutional strategies are publicly available. DFID uses the results of the Multilateral Effectiveness Frameworks and other mechanisms to inform decisions around funding for the multilateral agencies.</p>

	<p pid="c.463W.5/1">There is a close relationship in action to improve reproductive health and family planning, maternal health and to make progress on HIV and AIDS. Closing the gap in unmet needs for family planning would make a big contribution to helping to lower maternal mortality. Sexual and reproductive health services are vital in ensuring that women have a choice about if and when to have children, and play a key role in helping them avoid sexually transmitted infection including HIV, including through condom provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.463W.5/2">HIV Pregnant women with HIV and AIDS are four times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than un-infected women. Women with HIV need care and services in pregnancy to help protect their own health and to help prevent transmission of HIV to their babies. The United Nations Secretary General's progress report on the 2001 Declaration of Commitment in HIV and AIDS, released in April, estimates that only 9 per cent. of HIV positive women in low and middle income countries currently receive antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV. In countries with weak health systems this falls to less than 1 per cent..</p>
	<p pid="c.463W.5/3">DFID is working to support stronger health systems, with more adequate staff, equipment and drug supplies that are needed to improve access to HIV treatment, as well as to provide women with the care needed in pregnancy, especially when complications arise. Sustained improvements in maternal health and AIDS prevention, treatment and care will in large part depend on strengthening basic health services. Access to sexual and reproductive health and family planning services must be an essential part of this effort, and we are working to ensure that the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS in June gives a clear and strong message on the importance of sexual and reproductive health to efforts to make progress in HIV and AIDS.</p>

	<p pid="c.470W.2/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) will put a greater emphasis on practical cooking skills in the review of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3. QCA is also revising the criteria for food related GCSEs to put a greater emphasis on diet and health, consumer awareness, food safety and hygiene and food preparation skills. The Training Development Agency is aiming to increase the number of food technology training places in initial teacher training. We have invested &pound;1.5 million in professional development for primary teachers through our Food in Schools programme. However, in each school, Headteachers and governors set priorities for professional development and it is for them to decide whether further food education provision is needed for their staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.470W.2/2">In addition, our aim is for all schools to be working towards Healthy Schools status by 2009. The programme now includes a compulsory healthy eating strand. Schools develop whole school food policies, linking what is taught across the curriculum with the food children eat at school, to ensure that consistent messages about healthy food choices run throughout all aspects of school life. Healthy Schools co-ordinators are being trained to support schools, including on healthy eating.</p>

Comprehensive data on subsequent disposal of assets at Fresh Start schools, and therefore income, is not centrally available. However, since 1998, disposal of areas capable of forming a sports pitch has needed approval from the Secretary of State, and there is no recorded instance of such an approval at a Fresh Start school.</p>

The strategy's prime objective?a joint Department for Education and Skills and Department for Culture, Media and Sport PSA target?is to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum, to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition?by 2010?is to offer all children at least four hours of sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/2">Spearheading action is the creation of a national network of sports colleges and school sport partnerships. There are currently 411 live school sport partnerships incorporating 80 per cent. of schools in England. All maintained schools will be within a partnership by September 2006. Good progress is being made towards the PSA target. The 2004/05 school sport survey found that 69 per cent. of pupils in the 11,4000 schools taking part were spending at least two hours in a typical week on high quality PE and school sport, an 11 per cent. increase on 2003/04. Copies of the survey reports for 2003/04 and 2004/05 have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.474W.0/1">The Department is encouraging schools to put the guidance on participation into practice in ways that are meaningful to children and young people. As a key outcome for all children, local partners including schools and local authorities have to listen to children and involve them in planning and delivery of services. We have ensured that inspection arrangements make the views of children and young people an important part of assessing how local areas are doing, and of school inspections. In addition, we have changed the law so that school governing bodies can now appoint pupils as associate members allowing them to attend governing body meetings and become members of committees.</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.0/2">Printed copies of the guidance were sent to all schools and local education authorities and are available online. Since then 10,853 additional copies have been requested. Evidence from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority monitoring and the National Foundation for Educational Research longitudinal reports shows that more schools than ever before have set up school councils as a way of involving pupils in decision-making processes.</p>

	<p pid="c.474W.3/1">School lunches provided in all local authority maintained schools in England must meet the minimum requirements set out in the Education (Nutritional Standards for School Lunches) (England) Regulations 2000. Introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>, the first such regulations for over 20 years, they require schools to make foods from the following groups available on a daily basis:</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.3/2" class="indent">Fruit and vegetables;</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.3/3" class="indent">Milk and dairy;</p>

	<p pid="c.474W.3/6">In addition, the standards make separate requirements in relation to the frequency that certain foods e.g. red meat and fish are served.</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.3/7">Later in May 2006, we intend to announce, in response to recommendations from the School Meals Review Panel and the School Food Trust, a full suite of new standards for school food.</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.3/8">To implement these new standards, we intend to replace the Education (Nutritional Standards for School Lunches) Regulations 2000 with new regulations enshrining new food-based and nutrient-based standards for school lunches.

	<p pid="c.474W.3/9">These standards, which will form part of our forthcoming announcement, would play a significant role in preventing the sale of less healthy foods and drinks in schools, including through vending machines.</p>
