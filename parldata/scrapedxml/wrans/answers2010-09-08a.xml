	<p pid="a.521W.3/1">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for more than 99% of private businesses, and SME performance and activity is clearly a key driver of the UK economy. If we are to promote growth in the economy, we need to address the challenges that small businesses face: providing a predictable tax system that rewards endeavour; better access to both debt and equity finance; less red tape; a skilled workforce; and support for exports to markets around the globe.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/2">That is why June's Budget announced a series of measures aimed at helping small businesses, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/3" class="indent">A &#163;200 million extension to the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG), to benefit around 2,000 extra small businesses. In total, the EFG will now support up to &#163;700 million in bank lending to viable small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/4" class="indent">A new Enterprise Capita! Fund to support small businesses with high growth potential-combining both Government and private sector funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/5" class="indent">Confirmation of a Growth Capital Fund, to provide funding of between &#163;2 million and &#163;10 million for SMEs with strong growth potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/6" class="indent">Creation of a Regional Growth Fund in 2011-12 and 2012-13, encouraging private sector enterprise to help areas adjust to reductions in public spending, particularly in those places most reliant on public sector employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/7">Two key areas of concern to small businesses are ensuring that there is less red tape and being able to access the finance they need to grow. We have already committed to introducing a &quot;one-in one-out&quot; rule for new regulations, sunset clauses, a new Reducing Regulation Cabinet Committee and an immediate review of all inherited regulation in the pipeline. We have also published a joint consultation with the Treasury on business finance, aimed at ensuring that the banking system and financial markets meet the needs of the economy over the long term. This is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/businessfinance">http://www.bis.gov.uk/businessfinance</a></p>
	<p pid="a.521W.3/9">We are also making it easier for small businesses to bid for public sector contracts, with an aspiration that 25% of all Government procurement should be from SMEs. Together with the Office of Government Commerce, this Department is taking forward measures in this area. For example, by the end of 2010, businesses will be able to gain free and easy online access to all new central Government tender documents for contracts over &#163;10,000. This will be a significant step forward, as currently only contracts worth over &#163;20,000 are available online.</p>

	<p pid="a.522W.2/1">The Department is committed to modernising how support, information and advice are provided to businesses. With the proposed reform of the regional development agencies who manage the service in the regions, we are currently considering how services are best delivered in the future. The Spending Review and current financial realities mean that we are also examining how to deliver these within a smaller overall Department budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/2">No decision will be taken on the future of Business Link, not only in the West Midlands but across England, until all the options have been properly considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/3">In terms of Business Link West Midlands' effectiveness, during 2009/10 the Business Link:</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/4" class="indent"><i> </i><i> (a)</i> Provided support for access to finance to 731 businesses, with 360 of these undertaking in depth consultancy support helping them to raise over &#163;15 million of external finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/5" class="indent"><i> </i><i> (b)</i> Helped 300 businesses to diversify into new markets or products, with these businesses investing over &#163;2 million of their own funds to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/6" class="indent"><i> </i><i> (c</i><i> )</i><i> </i>and<i> </i><i> (</i><i> d)</i> Supported over 200 businesses via it's Resource Efficiency programme, which was only launched in September 2009 to help businesses to reduce costs and their carbon footprint, and to increase their competitiveness. However, it is too early to be able to measure the impact on carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/7">Lastly, the Government have also launched a consultation paper 'Financing a Private Sector Recovery', which closes to responses on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-20">20 September 2010</phrase> and this will help inform our future approach to supporting businesses to access appropriate finance.</p>

In that review the Office of Fair Trading recommended that the complaints process should be extended to include complaints over fees charged by insolvency practitioners.

For the service's work in company investigation and enforcement, and redundancy payments, funding is set through allocations made from BIS and HMRC respectively and the level of this allocation is made in response to submissions from the service to each Department, as part of their wider budget-setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.525W.6/2">For all areas of the service, the corporate plan sets out its vision for delivering services, with particular emphasis on its plans and targets for the coming year. The plan is reviewed by BIS to ensure that its goals are realistic and that targets are achievable within the resources available, and yet are set at a level to stretch the organisation. Performance against the targets and budgets is reported to the Minister on a quarterly basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.527W.6/1">We want Post Offices to offer a wide range of services-including financial and Government services-to generate revenues in order to help sustain the network. Post Offices already play an important role in putting essential financial services within everyone's reach, in particular those who may have difficulty accessing other providers. The size of the Post Office network means that important services are available throughout the country: the access criteria for the Post Office network ensure that 99% of the UK population are within three miles of their nearest post office outlet, and in deprived urban areas 99% are within one mile of their nearest post office outlet.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.8/1">The Government have no plans to prohibit the advertising of legally permitted sexual services in newspapers and other mainstream media. Non-broadcast advertising in the UK is strictly controlled through industry self-regulation, enforced by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Broadcast advertising is similarly controlled by the ASA working in a co-regulatory partnership with Ofcom. This regulatory system is independent of Government and is ultimately responsible for setting the standards in advertising.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.8/2">The advertising of legally permitted sexual services is subject to strict rules in both Advertising Codes on misleading the public, social responsibility, harm, and offence (with a particular emphasis on protecting children) and taking into account both the content of an advertisement and the context in which it appears. Advertisements found to be in breach of these rules are removed and prohibited from appearing again.</p>

Of this, the figure for businesses in Wolverhampton is &#163;261,785,842 and to date no businesses have been awarded contracts in the Wolverhampton North East constituency. The ODA is unable to release the value of individual contracts at this time as this is commercially sensitive information. These figures represent the committed spend to date, rather than the end contract value, as in many cases this will not yet be known. These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

	<p pid="a.537W.5/1">Over the period 2009-12, Sport England plans to invest &#163;480 million in the national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport to deliver increases in participation across different groups in society within their individual sports. In addition to this core funding, Sport England is investing in a &#163;10 million Active Women initiative. This funding is aimed at helping women in disadvantaged communities and women caring for children under 16 to take part. Successful applicants will demonstrate the ability to increase participation for these two groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.5/2">Sport England are committed to continuing to help NGBs deliver and to push them to do as much as possible to deliver for less well represented groups in sport. In the particular case of women and girls; funded and supported by Sport England, the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation is actively engaged with all of the NGBs, working in a consultancy capacity to advise the individual NGBs on best practice for increasing women's participation in sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.5/3">The focus of Sport England funding is delivered through the national governing bodies of sport and as a result we do not break down our funding on a purely constituency basis. Investments have been made on the basis of each governing body's ability to increase the number of people playing and enjoying their sport, and to create development pathways for those with talent. Newcastle upon Tyne North, as well as other areas of the country will benefit directly from this investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.538W.0/1">Before any research work involving animals is undertaken, it is essential to establish that the use of animals is justified ethically as well as scientifically. Consequently, an ethical review is mandatory under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 before the Home Office will grant a licence for research involving animals. The Home Office also recommends that the ethical review process should include lay members who are independent of the work.</p>
	<p pid="a.538W.0/2">To meet these requirements the Dstl ethical review process is conducted through meetings that are open to all members of Dstl staff working at the Porton Down site and has an independent chair. The meetings start with the licence holder presenting the work proposed and answering any questions. This is followed by a general discussion of the ethical issues, including the overall welfare of the animals, surrounding the work. The aim of the meeting is to arrive at a consensus as to whether it is reasonable ethically to carry out the work under discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.538W.0/3">The Home Office independent Animal Procedures Committee (APC) is responsible for monitoring compliance with animal welfare regulations. The MOD is confident that through the Home Office Inspectorate and the APC, the issues of animal welfare will be seriously considered and compliance with all extant regulations ensured.</p>
	<p pid="a.538W.0/4">Dstl Porton Down operates in accordance with the principles of the three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) and has an active programme to increase the implementation of the three Rs by exploring the use of non-living models in order to reduce the requirement for animal experimentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.538W.0/5">Tissue and cell cultures, and physical or computer based modelling are used wherever it is possible and commensurate with good practice. However, where these alternatives are considered inadequate as a means of predicting human response, experiments on animals may be necessary.</p>

In England, Scotland and Wales, the MOD's fleet of administrative and other non-operational transport, commonly known as the White Fleet, is provided under a private finance initiative contract currently provided by Babcock Land (Whitefleet Management) Ltd. The combined expenditure in the last three financial years was:</p>

However, on current plans Project Phoenix is looking at how the MOD's White Fleet requirements could be provided in a more cohesive way in order to achieve value for money by, for example, including requirements for Northern Ireland and the mainland UK under one contract or making use of pan-government framework agreements. This work is unlikely to start before September 2011 and is dependent on the outcome of the SDSR.</p>

	<p pid="a.542W.3/1">Three potential options were considered for translating the content of Your Freedom in to other languages. Firstly, re-architecting the current system, so that it can handle multiple languages. This would mean that users could view a translated version of the site that would mirror the current site but would not translate any user generated content. While this was the best option in terms of giving equal experience to English and other language speakers, because it would involve significant changes to an off-the-shelf-product, the costs were prohibitive at &#163;120, 000 (more than 37 times the cost of the original Your Freedom application).</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.3/2">Secondly, we looked at producing a static page to the existing site copy in other languages and a box into which comments/ideas could be entered. This would have ensured that ideas and comments of those submitting in other languages were gathered. However, the cost of this option was disproportionate at &#163;1, 800 per language, or more than 50% the cost of the original application.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.3/3">Thirdly, we considered incorporating a sentence of copy at the bottom of the home page text, linking people to a freely-available online translation tool. While cost-free, none of the tools available was judged to be sufficiently accurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.3/4">Having considered options for translation of the content, it was decided that a better approach would be to enable users to submit ideas, which could then be. translated before passing on to officials working on processing and evaluating contributions. At the moment, this option is only available to Welsh speakers. Translation is being provided by the Wales Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.2/1">Local authorities should be able to achieve the necessary savings through efficiencies across their budgets rather than cuts to frontline services. The Area Based Grant is a form of funding where the Department makes specific allocations to local authorities, but where local authorities have flexibility about how they spend it.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.2/2">The ring-fenced Music Grant in the Standards Fund is not part of the Area Based Grant, and is not affected by the wider decision to remove ring-fencing from funds that go to local authorities. The Area Based Grant includes start up funding for extended services through schools-which can include homework clubs, breakfast clubs, and after school activities. The start-up funding is intended to support the co-ordination and advice provided by local authorities that has enabled schools to develop access to extended services. In practice 98% of schools are now providing access to these services, and so there is less need for the start-up funding.</p>

In that consultation, we have said that for 2011-12 we intend to continue with the current methodology for the distribution of school funding to allow for a clear and transparent introduction of the pupil premium.

	<p pid="a.550W.6/2">The number of valid vouchers yet to be claimed is 24. There are fewer than 200 claims, or less than 0.2%, which have yet to be paid. These are mainly outstanding claims where we have requested additional information before we will be able to make the payment. The Energy Saving Trust who deliver the scheme are acting within advertised service standards to pay monies on receipt of a valid claim within five weeks. Their guidance notes that it some cases it will take a little longer for the payments to go through and appear on bank statements.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.3/2">The Government have made it clear that tackling health inequalities is a priority. Improving equity and fairness is a theme of this Government. Everyone should have the same opportunities to lead a healthy life, no matter where they live or who they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.3/3">The White Paper, &quot;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July 2010</phrase>, announced the establishment of an independent and accountable National Health Service Commissioning Board. The board will have an explicit duty to tackle inequalities in health care access and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.3/4">This White Paper also announced plans for the new public health service that will have an important role in reducing inequalities in health. The public health budget will be ring-fenced and allocated to reflect relative population health outcomes, with a new &quot;health premium&quot; to promote action to reduce health inequalities. We will therefore create a service that both recognises the impact of deprivation and rewards improvement, providing further incentives to reduce inequalities in health.</p>

Many families are now voluntarily making their homes and cars smokefree, reducing their children's exposure to second-hand smoke. We will continue to urge parents to do this in encouraging them to take responsibility for their children's health. The Public Health White Paper due later this year will set out our priorities for action in this and other areas of tobacco control.</p>

	<p pid="a.576W.10/1">Prison staff are asked to submit reports to prison security departments on any subject of concern. Guidance and training have been provided to help staff identify potential concerns around extremism and radicalisation. The guidance draws a clear distinction with the legitimate practice of faith or expression of political ideas. Where staff observe behaviours which give rise to concern they are reported using these established procedures. Each report is considered and its likely reliability and importance assessed, in order for appropriate actions to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.10/2">It is important to note that reporting may be partial, uncorroborated or duplicative. Therefore the number of prisons where reports of radicalisation has been received does not of itself indicate an established or absolute level of risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.10/3">In the most recent three month period (May to July 2010), national recording systems show 44 prisons in England and Wales logged Security Information Reports of incidents which might relate to manifestations of attempted radicalisation. This figure represents a snapshot in time influenced by operational variables such as population mix, regime and other factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.10/4">Radicalisation is a societal phenomenon; the holding of extremist views does not necessarily lead to violent extremist behaviour and the challenge is to identify and manage risks appropriately. Prisons therefore work closely with the police and other partners to manage those risks among offenders and have a developed programme of work to deliver more effective management of those risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.10/5">Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.</p>

The outstanding balance includes fines imposed a number of years ago during the period when fines could not be cancelled (2004 to 2006) and fines which are being paid by instalments.

The outstanding balance has risen through the application of a strict policy that only allows fines to be written off in certain circumstances. The outstanding balance includes fines imposed a number of years ago during the period when fines could not be cancelled (2004-06) and fines which are being paid by instalments. Some of the balance outstanding could be as much as 10 years old.</p>

	<p pid="a.594W.2/1">Securing the opinions of young people is essential to the Department for Work and Pensions and its Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/2">We encourage the involvement, not only of young people, but of all groups in society, in our policy-making processes. We highlight major consultations as widely as possible, notifying them to a wide variety of interested parties through relevant media, and produce them in a number of formats to promote ease of access.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/3">We work routinely with a wide variety of stakeholders and, through our various consultative forums, DWP and its agencies endeavour to involve a full range of customer organisations that represent the interests of all our customers, including young people. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/4" class="indent">Our Equality Schemes Customer Reference Group was formed to help the Department involve customers specifically on equality issues and to act as a consultation group. It provides insight across the range of the Department's policies and services through the personal experience of the representatives. A protected characteristic of its remit is age and a young representative has been specifically recruited to be a regular member of the group.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/5" class="indent">Equality 2025 is a high-level advisory group of disabled people which offers Ministers and senior Government officials strategic advice at the very early stages of policy development and in-depth examinations of existing policy areas on issues that affect disabled people. The group has members who have experience in dealing with issues that affect young people, and includes two young disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/6" class="indent">Under the auspices of the European year for combating poverty, DWP is funding a project in conjunction with the EU which involves the voices of young people. The project is being managed by Save the Children and is called Inspiring Change. The project supports young people to run 'change' projects to the benefit of their communities, while learning new skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/7" class="indent">DWP regularly uses customer insight research techniques to gain a better understanding of their customers. This has included recently seeking the views of young people as part of a cross-section of customers on a variety of topics including the barriers homeless and people with mental health problems experience in joining the labour market, their experience in claiming benefits including Social Fund and the design of future service delivery models.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/8" class="indent">Children and young people are a priority customer group within the Pension Disability and Carers Service. In recognition of this, the Family Carers Group was established. This is a forum which provides a focus on issues specific to children and young people claiming disability living allowance and provides a mechanism for consultation on service delivery issues impacting on them.</p>

	<p pid="a.595W.2/2">The Department also encourages a wide range of providers from the voluntary and charitable sectors-alongside providers in the private and public sectors-to contract with it to deliver employment programmes. It is not possible, however, to identify payments made to charitable organisations except at disproportionate cost; the Department's payment systems identify the individual recipients, but do not show the status of those recipients i.e. whether they are private, public, charitable or voluntary sector organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.596W.6/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what the geographic direct dial phone number for the Jobcentre Plus area benefits office at James Watt Way, Crawley is; and what estimate he has made of the annual cost to benefit claimants of directing them to use 0845 phone numbers to contact area benefit offices. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/4" class="indent">The Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) telephony strategy is to rationalise the numbers we publish for our customers so that they are clearly directed to the service they require. Jobcentre Plus contact centres operate a virtual telephony network where calls are directed to the next available advisor with the appropriate skills to answer customers' enquiries. Disclosure of the geographic number you requested would compromise this strategy and would lead to a reduced service to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/5" class="indent">Additionally, releasing geographic numbers behind the 0845 service lines would result in additional costs to Jobcentre Plus as we would not be able to manage calls as effectively. Jobcentre Plus would also lose key call management information essential to the planning and allocation of staff resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/6" class="indent">It is free to call DWP 0800 numbers from BT landlines and agreements are in place to ensure that it is free to call via nine of the UK's largest mobile phone operators, representing 95% of the mobile market. The 0845 numbers are not part of the agreement because they are for enquiries that typically take less time to resolve. DWP strives to achieve the right balance between meeting customer needs and using taxpayers' money effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/7" class="indent">Calls from landlines to 0845 numbers vary according to provider and are subject to periodic change. The rate is set based on the customer's personal contract arrangements. For example, BT, the largest landline provider, does not charge for 0845 calls where the customer has a Call Plan and the call is made within the call plan times. BT accounts for two-thirds of landline provision and our recent research shows that over 75% of our customers contact us using landlines.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/8" class="indent">As the cost to the customer of calling our 0845 numbers is dependant upon their method of calling and their personal call plans it is not possible to determine the cost of calls to the Department's 0845 telephone numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.598W.0/4">In 1997-98, there were around 2.9 million pensioners in relative poverty in Great Britain, which equates to around 29% of all pensioners. The 2008-09 UK figures show that around 1.8 million pensioners were in relative poverty, equating to around 16%.</p>

	<p pid="a.598W.3/1">The main reason for the lower reported expenditure in 2007-08 is because this only covers the single month of March 2008, whereas the figures for 2008-09 represent 12 month's expenditure. The Personal Accounts Delivery Authority only started to account for its own expenditure from <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-01">1 March 2008</phrase>, when it achieved grant-in-aid status. Prior to this, all its expenditure was accounted for and reported within DWP accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.3/2">2008-09 also represented a period of growth for PADA, when teams were expanded in London, Newcastle and Leeds in preparation for the procurement of services that will underpin the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). This period also necessitated a small number of overseas visits so that PADA could gain a better understanding of the scheme's administration and investment markets and how future NEST contracts for such services might be structured.</p>
