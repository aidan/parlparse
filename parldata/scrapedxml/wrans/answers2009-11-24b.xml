These were recruitments that were open to existing civil servants only. Posts open external to the civil service are often advertised in the press as well. As yet no provisions are in place to advertise internal Civil service recruitments in a non-electronic format, however, paper-only applications are accepted by the Department and information on current vacancies is available and readily given to any individual who contacts the Department inquiring about current opportunities.</p>

Members of Parliament and district councillors are not responsible authorities under the 2003 Act and, currently, are interested parties only if they live, or operate a business, in the vicinity of the premises. In addition, if requested to do so, they can make representations on behalf of a resident or a business who themselves is an interested party under the 2003 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.50W.2/2">In recognition of the important role that local authorities play in co-ordinating efforts to manage local alcohol related problems, the Policing and Crime Act 2009 includes a provision which, when in force, will make local councillors interested parties under the 2003 Act and therefore able to make representations on licence applications and seek licence reviews in their own right as councillors.</p>

	<p pid="b.51W.3/1">We fully recognise the contribution that the cadets make to the long-term future of the Army and to society in general. But tough choices have to be made. Our focus is on Afghanistan and the cadets do not contribute directly to that main effort. We have therefore taken the very difficult decision to reduce the amount of money available to the Army Cadet Force for the remainder of the year. This means that instructors will receive no further payments for weekend Cadet training, although we will continue to meet enabling costs such as travel where we can. We will also continue to provide training courses at the Cadet Training Centre and at Brigade level for adult instructors, as it is essential that we maintain that core of skill and expertise. Instructors are not paid for evening training activity, so this is continuing as normal. The reduction in activity is saving a total of &#163;4 million. By the end of 2009-10 Army cadet instructors will have received some &#163;13 million from the Army budget.</p>

Individuals will, nonetheless, remain liable for the amounts as ordered. Such arrears must either be cleared via private arrangements, or by continued monthly deductions from salary at the end of the period of liability.</p>

	<p pid="b.56W.8/1">It is very difficult to verify reports or allegations of sexual and gender-based violence in the camps in Sri Lanka. This is because access for humanitarian agencies, particularly those who work on protection activities, has been extremely restricted. We continue to press the Government of Sri Lanka to allow humanitarian agencies access to the camps to assess allegations of abuses such as sexual and gender-based violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.8/2">The UK Government have consistently advocated for the treatment of all internally displaced persons (IDPs) held in camps in Sri Lanka to be in accordance with international standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.62W.2/1">It is for local authorities and regions to determine whether or not a re-opened railway or a new station is the best way to meet local or regional transport needs. They can fund a scheme from the regional funding allocation if it is a priority and demonstrates value for money. The Department for Transport is prepared to work with promoters of new lines, services and stations to help and advise them on how their objectives can be achieved and to facilitate their implementation through changes to franchises.</p>
	<p pid="b.62W.2/2">Where investment requires the provision of new or enhanced services, the policy is that a subsidy required should be funded by the promoter for at least the first three years. Following that period, if the service is successful and demonstrates value for money, subject to funds being made available, the Government would consider funding it thereafter as part of the national rail network.</p>

	<p pid="b.65W.0/2">A second report on the proportion of domestically produced food used by Government Departments and also supplied to hospitals and prisons under contracts negotiated by NHS Supply Chain and HM Prison Service was published in November 2008, covering the year from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.65W.0/4">The report gives details of the proportion of individual meat, fruit and vegetable categories purchased.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.0/5">Although it is too early to show a trend, the report indicates that the amount of domestically produced food consumed by Government Departments in England is increasing. The proportion of domestically produced food procured by Communities has gone up from 59 per cent. in 2006-07 to 65 per cent. in 2007-08. We expect to publish a third report at the end of 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.79W.3/3">There are around 4,500 eligible CESP areas across GB, 3248 are in England. Within this constraint energy companies, working with local authorities and community groups, are free to choose where they deliver CESP.

	<p pid="b.79W.3/4">Given CESP's focus on delivering energy efficiency measures to hundreds of households in each particular area targeted we expect this to create business and employment opportunities. For example, the energy companies are currently assessing their options for delivering CESP including in the first instance recruiting staff where necessary and reviewing their supply chains to deliver the significant number of energy efficiency measures expected under CESP.</p>

	<p pid="b.80W.9/1">It is difficult to reduce the carbon emissions and heating bills of park homes due to the lack of scope for key energy efficiency measures, such as cavity wall and loft insulation. Where scope does exist, such as through draught-proofing and high-efficiency lights and appliances, assistance is available to park homes residents through schemes such as the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and Warm Front.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.9/2">Warm Front is currently working in partnership with a gas distributor and a local residents association to enable 61 residents of Elm Tree caravan park in Hartlepool to be connected to the mains gas network. This project meant these homes, previously utilising liquid petroleum gas, coal or forms of electric heating, reduced their likely energy bills and likely carbon consumption. The project considerably reduced the otherwise prohibitive cost that had prevented each park home individually connecting to the gas network.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.9/3">The Warm Front Scheme has also begun a piloting exercise of external wall insulation for 100 park home properties. If this trial is successful, then this may be included as a main measure offered through the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.81W.2/1">Almost all homes can benefit from further insulation, whether this is through taking relatively simple actions such as topping up levels of loft insulation and filling un-insulated cavity wall, or though more difficult or expensive steps such as insulating floors, installing high efficiency glazing or fitting solid wall insulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.81W.2/2">We have made good progress insulating lofts and cavity walls with five million homes insulated between 2002 and 2008 and a commitment to insulate a further six million homes by 2011. The Heat and Energy Saving Strategy (HESS) consultation published in February sets out our ambitions to insulate all of the remaining lofts and cavities where practical by 2015. The HESS also explains the approaches we are considering to make it easier for households to take on more difficult or expensive forms of insulation and thus gain the benefits of reduced energy bills and a warmer home.</p>

In the year following April 2008 around 1.5 million homes were insulated by CERT and other programmes. In addition, as set out in the Low Carbon Transition Plan, the Government have committed to extend CERT to the end of 2012 with an even stronger focus on delivering insulation.</p>

	<p pid="b.84W.6/1">The majority of the rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights are not absolute. Most rights are qualified, which means that interference with a right is permitted where that is in accordance with the law, proportionate to a certain specified aim, and/or necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others. For example, it is sometimes necessary to balance the right of the media to freedom of expression with the right of individuals to respect for their private life. Many areas of Government policy involve making these difficult decisions on a daily basis and it is not possible to list them exhaustively. It is also possible for states party to make reservations to some rights or to derogate from some articles of the convention in times of emergency. However, the UK currently has no derogations to the convention.</p>

	<p pid="b.85W.6/1">This year HMI Probation introduced a new core case inspection regime for youth offending teams (YOTs) looking at three specific areas of practice-safeguarding, risk of harm to others and risk of reoffending. To date only the inspection reports of North West YOTs have been published. Of the 21 YOTs in the North West 12 were assessed as requiring significant improvement in at least one area of practice. Three YOTs were assessed as requiring substantial improvement in a single area of the inspected work: Cumbria, Manchester and Stockport. The following were assessed as requiring substantial improvement in two or more of the areas inspected: Bolton, Bury, Lancashire, Liverpool, Rochdale, Salford, Tameside and Wirral. In addition Sefton YOT was assessed as requiring drastic improvement in two of the three areas and substantial improvement in the other.</p>
	<p pid="b.85W.6/2">The assessment of YOT performance does not rest soley with the HMI Probation core case inspection. It has been designed to include two distinct but complementary processes which together give a complete picture of the performance of a YOT Partnership. The HMIP Inspection regime looks in depth at practice whilst the YJB YOT assessment is at a strategic level and looks additionally at: reducing re-offending; first time entrants; engagement in education, training and employment; access to suitable accommodation; public and victim confidence and reducing numbers in custody. The most recent YJB quarterly assessment of YOT performance was completed in July. The results for the 139 English YOTs show that 79 per cent. of YOTs were classified as either good or outstanding.</p>

	<p pid="b.86W.2/1">Youth offending teams (YOTs) receive funding from a number of sources. The table shows financial contributions made to YOTs via the Youth Justice Board and other Government sources (including police, probation, social services and via local authorities) by financial year:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.2/2">The Youth Justice Board funding is divided between Wales and England in the ratio 5 to 85. The YJB grant funding for England is allocated to individual YOTs according to the prescribed formula, in which 40 per cent. weighting is given to the local 10-17 population, 10 per cent. to the geographical size of the area, and 50 per cent. in aggregate to 'Deprivation Indices'-Local Concentration, Extent (the proportion of a YOT's population living in the wards which rank within the most deprived 10 per cent. of wards in the country), income deprivement, employment deprivement, average of ward ranks, average of ward scores.</p>

	<p pid="b.93W.6/2" class="indent">The design of a new school has to comply with Approved Document M of the Building Regulations 'Access to and use of buildings' and this is checked through the Building Control system.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/3" class="indent">Under the Disability Discrimination Act, all buildings have to provide suitable access for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/4" class="indent">Teams bidding for Building Schools for the Future projects cannot proceed through to procurement if their sample designs do not meet a Minimum Design Standard judged by a panel set up by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) which includes people with experience in special school design and accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/5" class="indent">The Building Schools for the Future standard contract documentation includes a requirement to create an access document, which records all actions taken to ensure access and inclusion are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/6">In addition, the Department and Partnerships for Schools have regular contact with a variety of disability groups over design matters. For example, a number of organisations-including the Council for Disabled Children, the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) and the National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS)-advised the Department on its publication Building Bulletin 102: 'Designing for Disabled Children and Children with Special Educational Needs', which is the main reference guide for designing inclusive mainstream and special schools in Building Schools for the Future.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/7">More recently DCSF ministers and officials have held extensive discussions with the NDCS about acoustics in Building Schools for the Future projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/8">The Department and Partnerships for Schools encourage local authorities and designers to involve all children-including those with disabilities or special educational needs-and their parents in the design briefing process. The Design Quality Indicator (DQI) for Schools, which helps staff children, and parents to establish what they want in their new building, is mandatory for all Building Schools for the Future projects over &#163;1 million. The resulting information has to be submitted to the Minimum Design Standard panel to inform their decision on whether the design is suitable and passes the threshold. Partnerships for Schools also use the DQI information to inform Building Schools for the Future benchmarking, and in turn to improve the design brief template that forms part of the Building Schools for the Future standard documentation. For more information on the DQI for Schools process, see:</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dqi.org.uk">www.dqi.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/10">In addition, Partnerships for Schools encourages all students involved in Building Schools for the Future to take part in the Sorrell Foundation's 'joinedupdesign' sessions where they create a Pupils' Brief to be fed into the schools design brief. For more information on joinedupdesign, see:</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/11" class="indent"><a href="http://www.thesorrellfoundation.com">www.thesorrellfoundation.com</a></p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/12">The Department and Partnerships for Schools have estimated that around 50 per cent. of Building Schools for the Future projects will involve remodelling or refurbishment. All design guidance issued by the Department and Partnerships for Schools has therefore been written with this in mind. Building Bulletin 102: 'Designing for Disabled Children and Children with Special Educational Needs' can be used to design new facilities and for assessing the suitability of existing accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.6/13">The Department does not routinely collect information about revisions that have been made to new build proposals. But we expect all school projects to be designed to be accessible and inclusive, following the requirements of the Building Regulations, the DDA and the Departments design guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.0/1">Of the 129 schools where work under Building Schools for the Future (BSF) is complete, 30 have included refurbishment. In a further 21, the work was confined to ICT renewal. Asbestos surveys may or may not have been required, depending on the age of the buildings. The total capital funding provided for these schools under BSF is &#163;429 million, including &#163;66 million for ICT. Information on the number of refurbished schools that contained asbestos or the amounts spent on asbestos removal is not held centrally. Overall the BSF programme is expected to comprise approximately 35 per cent. major refurbishment, 15 per cent. minor refurbishment and 50 per cent. new build in terms of floor area. Major refurbishments carried out under the Building Schools for the Future programme normally include removal of all asbestos in areas likely to be disturbed by the work. Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) that are likely to deteriorate are identified by an asbestos survey for each refurbishment and normally removed.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.0/2">Asbestos is also removed when buildings are demolished. For minor refurbishment work, an asbestos survey is done and ACMs are either removed or managed in place, depending on their condition.</p>

	<p pid="b.106W.5/1">As part of the implementation of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA), the Department made funding available to the health and social care economy for training purposes. In addition, the Department funded a range of training materials and booklets on the MCA. These included materials to be used by trainers in face to face training, e-learning materials and the booklets in the Making Decisions series.</p>
	<p pid="b.106W.5/2">All were made available to the national health service. In addition, the Department encouraged primary care trusts (PCTs) to use the resources they received for implementation to fund a MCA co-ordinator. Many have done so and MCA co-ordinators have been active in developing local training plans and commissioning and arranging training.</p>
	<p pid="b.106W.5/3">The number of cancer specialists who have made use of the training is not held centrally; arranging training is a local issue. Training opportunities continue and we know that cancer specialists have been making referrals to Independent Mental Capacity Advocates, which is an indication they are aware of the MCA.</p>

	<p pid="b.109W.2/1">There is currently no national screening programme for prostate cancer. However, in March 2009, we announced that the UK National Screening Committee will review new evidence surrounding screening for prostate cancer. The Committee is due to report back to Ministers during 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/2">In 2002, as part of the Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme (PCRMP), a pack of materials was produced for use in primary care to help men make an informed choice about having a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. If a man wants a PSA test after consultation with his general practitioner (GP) and consideration of the information leaflet included for men, he may have one free on the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/3">The PCRMP packs have been formally evaluated and revised packs were issued to GPs in August 2009. The PCRMP Scientific Reference Group discussed whether separate materials should be produced for men with a learning disability. They concluded that as the programme was aimed at men with no symptoms of prostate cancer, was not a population screening programme, and the patient leaflet was an aide memoire following a consultation with a primary care practitioner, it would not be appropriate to produce such materials. The primary care team should use their best clinical judgment in explaining the materials for men with a learning disability who are aware of the programme or whose carers are aware of the programme, especially if the individual is at a higher risk of prostate cancer if, for example, his brother has had prostate cancer.</p>

	<p pid="b.127W.11/1">The UK Border Agency is mindful of its obligation to ensure that its operations are compatible with the European Convention of Human Rights. The case of S. and Marper found that Article 8 (right to privacy) was infringed by the collection and retention of DNA from those individuals arrested but later acquitted. The Home Office conducted a public consultation exercise from May to August 2009 and the Home Secretary made a written statement announcing the Government's response to the judgement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-11">11 November 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2009-11-11.25"><i> Official Report</i>, column 25WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.127W.11/2">The agency has in place in the draft Immigration Bill, currently under pre-legislative scrutiny, provisions for the laying of regulations specifying retention periods. The agency is formulating a retention policy that will be both mindful of the need to protect people's privacy under Article 8 of the ECHR while at the same time ensure that immigration officers have the necessary tools and powers in which to fulfil their jobs. This policy will be subject to public consultation with various interested groups including the Information Commissioner's Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.127W.11/3">I should like to emphasise however that the UKBA overwhelmingly uses fingerprints, which is less intrusive, rather than DNA for the purpose of immigration control. Where DNA is used, it is done so only on a voluntary basis.</p>
