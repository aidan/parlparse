Although we shall certainly consider whether it would be appropriate to use these powers to restrict the keeping of primates, the purpose of the consultation exercise is to seek views on how these powers should be used, rather than presenting a detailed list of protected species at this stage.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.2/2">As has been demonstrated by the tax and other financial benefits introduced over recent years for Community Amateur Sports Clubs, and the significant sums in Lottery support for them which is channelled through sport's governing bodies, the Government continues to support the estimated 140,000 amateur clubs across England and Wales. In introducing the new licensing regime, there is no intention to penalise those involved in running clubs, or to affect the important roles such clubs play in local communities. This was made clear during the passage of the Act, and thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/3">My Department is working closely with the Central Council of Physical Recreation, and other sports bodies, as implementation continues. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made a commitment to an independent review of fee levels and associated costs, within a reasonable period after the new framework is fully introduced. The results of that review will inform any necessary adjustments to the levels of fees introduced under the Act.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.6/3">The Sure Start local programme has strong parental participation reflected in the management board membership with seven of the 20 places taken by parents. Parents have also been trained as researchers for the local evaluation of the programme and have been encouraged to use the findings to improve the way the programme is being developed.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.6/4">The Everton Early Childhood Centre provides health, education and family support services to around 188 0&ndash;5 year olds. The services include baby clinic drop in sessions, eye clinic, outdoor play and environmental education, and reading support.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.9/1">Completion of the channel tunnel rail link (CTRL) will have two significant effects on the rail network in the south. First, it will allow the operation of high speed domestic services from Kent to St. Pancras. This will provide some relief to existing capacity constraints at London Bridge. The new service pattern proposed in the specification for the Integrated Kent Franchise will improve operational performance at London Bridge, delivering improved reliability and punctuality for passengers. The high speed domestic services from Kent are expected to begin operation in 2009.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.9/2">Second, international services will no longer require access to the domestic network, except for access to Ashford International, so existing international facilities at Waterloo and at North Pole depot will become available for alternative use. The Strategic Rail Authority, in conjunction with the Department for Transport, has commissioned the first phase of a study to examine the best alternative uses for these facilities. The study is examining the potential impact of options on London Bridge Station, as well as Waterloo station. The phase 1 report, which will be completed this summer, will identify the most promising options for further detailed evaluation.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.8/1">The last assessment of the possible effects of raising the motorway speed limit was conducted in 2001. This concluded that to raise the motorway speed limit would run too great a risk of increasing accidents and casualties. However, the Department will continue to keep the motorway speed limit under review to ensure it remains appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.9/5" class="indent">predicted spinal ligament forces were almost an order of magnitude smaller than the damage threshold for such ligaments and predicted forces transmitted through the spine were at least a factor of four smaller than those generated in discs by heavy lifting. Therefore, although it is not possible to predict the effect of such forces on people with pre-existing spinal conditions, it was considered that vehicle occupants with healthy spines were very unlikely to be injured as a result of single or repeated traversing of road humps (including cushions) constructed to recommended dimensions.</p>

	<p pid=".17W.2/1">By implementing the recommendations of the Gershon review of public sector efficiency, the Government will achieve &pound;21 billion of annual efficiency gains by 2007&ndash;08 and a gross reduction of 84,000 civil service and administrative posts. The Government have already achieved efficiency gains exceeding &pound;2 billion and a reduction of 12,500 posts. By implementing the Lyons review of public sector relocation over 4,300 posts have already been moved out of London and the south east. These efficiency gains will help to drive increases in Government output and productivity. The Government have previously welcomed the Atkinson review as the first step to improve the measurement of Government output and productivity and to ensure that measures of the impact of increased investment in our schools, hospitals and other public services are informative and robust. In the year to October 2004, measured public sector output grew by just over 5 per cent. nearly twice as fast as during the previous 12 months.</p>

These estimates are published on the DTI's Oil and Gas website [at <a href="http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bbupdates/chapters/reservesindex.html">http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb updates/chapters/reserves index.html</a>]. The latest published estimates relate to the position as at the end of 2003; estimates as at the end of 2004 are due to be released in June. The published figures are given as ranges depending on the degree of certainty attaching to the estimates. The number of months' supply represented by these resources would depend on the month in question, since gas production (like gas demand) is not flat through the year (being lower in summer and higher in winter) or from year to year (production is now generally falling while demand is flat or rising slowly). Gas production from the UKCS is expected to continue for many years to come but already it no longer meets UK demand on an annual basis though it does still in summer months.</p>

The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which assumed responsibility from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> for discharging the nuclear legacy accepted that figure in its first Annual Plan. A key task now for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is to review that estimate carefully to reduce uncertainty and work on that is now under way with a view to publication in December. In the short run, better estimating will almost certainly mean that the estimate will rise. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority maintain the most recent estimate on their website (nda.gov.uk).</p>

Most boots are sourced through a prime contract placed for footwear, although some boots are procured on other contracts. Manufacture of boots is carried out world-wide, including the UK. Costs for each type of boot vary from item to item and fall within the following price ranges: Combat &pound;15&ndash;&pound;120, Parade/Ceremonial &pound;45-&pound;85 (although for Riding boots this varies from &pound;150-&pound;1,300) and Safety Footwear &pound;8&ndash;&pound;45. Life expectancy varies from boot to boot depending on their use and conditions, although in broad terms life expectancy is: Combat one year up to a shelf-life of five years (although Jungle Boots and Desert Boots may only have a life of six weeks or six months respectively); Parade/Ceremonial these boots are repairable and can last from one year up to five years plus; Safety Footwear six months to two years.</p>

	<p pid=".29W.5/1">There are no plans to institute a departmental inquiry into the Iraq Oil for Food Programme. We are following closely the work of the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) established by the UN Secretary-General in April 2004 to investigate allegations of corruption and mismanagement of the UN's Iraq Oil for Food Programme. We support the inquiry and are co-operating fully with it. So far, the IIC has published two interim reports and we expect a final report this summer. Once the IIC has completed its investigations the Government will judge what further action might be appropriate as a result of any findings against British nationals or entities.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/2">We have no evidence to suggest that any findings relating to the role of the British Government at the UN Security Council, or the involvement of British nationals or entities in the Oil for Food Programme, will impact significantly on UK relations with Russia, France or China.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/3">As permanent members of the UN Security Council we worked closely with the Governments of Russia, France and China during the lifetime of the Oil for Food Programme and continue to do so on a wide range of issues.</p>

The next results, for adults, are expected to be available in July.</p>
