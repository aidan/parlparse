While the actual populations hospitals will serve in the future will differ slightly across the country, in general it may be that they will need to serve larger populations than is currently the case. Different clinical specialties may also have different demands in terms of the number of cases required to maintain clinical expertise.</p>

	<p pid="b.543W.6/1">In 1997, the Department together with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) commissioned a joint research programme on the effects on health of exposure to air pollutants and damp in the home. This programme focused on indoor air pollution and its effects on health. In particular, the health effects on sensitive individuals within the population and the interactions between indoor air pollutants and health effects of damp in the domestic environment. There were 13 projects in total, seven of which were funded directly by the Department. Further details of these projects can be found at table three of 'Air Pollution Research Funded' which is available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.550W.2/1">The UK is committed to progress in multilateral disarmament and plays a strong role in all the relevant international fora. We continue to press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons. The forum responsible for nuclear disarmament is the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, whose achievements include the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty, ratified by the UK in 1998. Our current priority is the early start of negotiations, without preconditions, on a Fissile Material Cut-Off treaty (FMCT). The US tabled a draft treaty text in 2006. The start of such negotiations is subject to the agreement by consensus of all states represented at the conference. While there has been no agreement on a programme of work for the Conference on Disarmament, significant progress was made last year by the conference's presidency, and the UK is committed to building on this momentum.</p>

	<p pid="b.552W.0/10">It is likely that those who received deep second or third degree burns to 70 per cent. of the body would be included in either the VSI or SI figures, but this would depend on the severity of their injury. It is not possible to say whether all those blinded in both eyes or made deaf would be included.</p>

Consistent estimates below the NUTS1 level are only available from 1995 onwards. These estimates are expressed at current basic prices, and do not allow for changes in prices over time (inflation) or differences in regional price levels (purchasing power).

	<p pid="b.566W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking for an estimate of the rate of (a) household inflation, (b) single pensioner household inflation and (c) pensioner household inflation. (116944)</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/4" class="indent">Retail Prices Index (RPI) is defined as an average measure of change in the prices of goods and services bought for the purpose of consumption by the vast majority of households in the UK. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has recently published the RPI for December 2006 as 202.7, giving a percentage change over 12 months of 4.4%.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/5" class="indent">The weights for the RPI explicitly exclude data on households where the head of the household is retired (at least 65 years of age for men and 60 years or more for women) and economically inactive, and where at least three quarters of the household's income is from state benefits. Although no general &quot;pensioner household&quot; index exists, separate indices are produced for one-pensioner and for two-pensioner households whose expenditure is excluded from the RPI weights, i.e. those who rely on state pensions and benefit for at least 75% of their income. This roughly relates to around 20% of all pensioners (there are very few private households consisting solely of three or more pensioners): These indices use the same price data as the RPI and are only published for quarters, rather than months. They make no allowance for the fact that pensioners may shop in different outlets and therefore experience different prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/6" class="indent">The one-person pensioner households index for the fourth quarter of 2006 stands at 176.6, a change of 5.7% over 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/7" class="indent">The two-person pensioner households index for the fourth quarter of 2006 stands at 179.2, a change of 4.4% over 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/8" class="indent">The corresponding value for the RPI for the fourth quarter of 2006, stands at 201.4, a change of 4.0% over 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/9" class="indent">The main differences from the RPI in the construction of the pensioner indices are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/10" class="indent">section weights are derived from information on expenditure by one-pensioner and two-pensioner households respectively;</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/11" class="indent">canteen meals (including state school meals) and all housing sections are excluded;</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/12" class="indent">Other items are also excluded, including NHS prescription, dental and eyesight test charges which are not paid by pensioners. For rail and bus fares, special pensioners' rail and bus fare indices are substituted for the normal index household indices to allow for fare concessions available in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/13" class="indent">The exclusion of housing sections was made on the grounds that the price indicators used in the all items RPI would not be appropriate and would overstate the price increases experienced by these pensioners as they would mostly be cushioned against some rises by rebates. Also, it would be technically difficult to compile separate house price indicator items for these households.</p>

	<p pid="b.574W.7/1">The start of the Cultural Olympiad, and indeed the whole of the London 2012 Olympiad, occurs at the moment of &quot;handover&quot; during the closing ceremony of the Beijing Games in 2008. It is likely that many groups and communities around London and the rest of the UK will want to mark this moment with celebrations. The formal launch event for the Cultural Olympiad is likely to take place shortly afterwards. Discussions are ongoing between my Department, London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games and the Greater London Authority on the details for the launch. This will be an important benchmark on our journey towards 2012, and we know that many organisations are keen to show their support for this event. In particular, we are in discussions with the organisers of the Liverpool 08 celebrations to explore the potential for collaboration with the plans for the Cultural Olympiad.</p>

Some UKTI posts are therefore being lost in the developed markets as resource is redeployed to the following emerging markets: Brazil, mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Dubai, Mexico, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Vietnam and Russia.</p>

	<p pid="b.600W.8/3">If additional costs incurred by the force are of a magnitude that puts at risk their operational capability, after use of any contingency reserves, then they may apply to the Home Office for special grant support.</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.2/2">The Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April 2006</phrase>, places a number of statutory requirements on forces to support victims during an investigation. Under the Code, police forces are required to:</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.2/4" class="indent">provide victims with, information about the criminal justice system;</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.2/10">ACPO have also introduced the Professionalising the Investigative Process (PIP). The PIP Core Investigative Doctrine provides definitive national advice for all investigators on the key principles of criminal investigation, irrespective of the nature or complexity of the investigation. The Victim and Witness Strategy section of the PIP Doctrine outlines the process for dealing with victims and witnesses during the investigative process and it also makes reference to the existing detailed guidance and best practice documents along with further sources of relevant information.</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.5/1">Section 4 of the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime sets out the criteria for establishing if a victim is vulnerable or intimidated and, therefore, eligible for enhanced services under the code. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/2" class="indent">4.1 Some services under this Code are to be provided only to vulnerable or intimidated victims based on the definitions given by sections 16 and 17 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. For the purposes of this Code, vulnerable and intimidated victims are defined as such at the time of the offence, rather than at the time of hearing as specified in the 1999 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/3" class="italic"> Vulnerable victims</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/4" class="indent">4.2 For the purposes of the Code a victim of crime is eligible for an enhanced service under the Code:</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/5" class="indent">(a) If under the age of 17 at the time of the offence; or</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/6" class="indent">(b) If the service provider considers that the quality of evidence given by the victim is likely to be diminished by reason of any circumstances falling within 4.3.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/7" class="indent">4.3 The circumstances falling within this subsection are:</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/8" class="indent">(a) That the victim</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/9" class="indent">(i) suffers from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983,</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/10" class="indent">(ii) otherwise has a significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning;</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/11" class="indent">(b) that the victim has a physical disability or is suffering from a physical disorder.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/12" class="indent">4.4 In determining whether a victim falls within the definition in paragraph 4.3 the service provider must consider any views expressed by the victim.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/13" class="indent">4.5 In this Section references to the quality of a victim's evidence are to its quality in terms of completeness, coherence and accuracy; and for this purpose &quot;coherence&quot; refers to a victim's ability in giving evidence to give answers which address the questions put to the victim and can be understood both individually and collectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/14" class="italic"> Intimidated victims</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/15" class="indent">4.6 For the purposes of the Code a victim of criminal conduct is eligible for an enhanced service under the Code if the service provider is satisfied that the quality of evidence given by the victim is likely to be diminished by reason of fear or distress on the part of the victim in connection with testifying in the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/16" class="indent">4.7 In determining whether a victim falls within the definition in paragraph 4.6 the service provider must take into account, in particular:</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/17" class="indent">(a) the nature and alleged circumstances of the offence to which the proceedings relate;</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/18" class="indent">(b) the age of the victim;</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/19" class="indent">(c) such of the following matters as appear to the service provider to be relevant, namely:</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/20" class="indent">(i) the social and cultural background and ethnic origins of the victim,</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/21" class="indent">(ii) the domestic and employment circumstances of the victim, and</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/22" class="indent">(iii) any religious beliefs or political opinions of the victim;</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/23" class="indent">(d) any behaviour towards the victim on the part of:</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/24" class="indent">(i) the accused,</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/25" class="indent">(ii) members of the family or associates of the accused, or</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/26" class="indent">(iii) any other person who is likely to be an accused or a witness in the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/27" class="indent">4.8 In determining whether a victim falls within the definition in paragraph 4.6, the service provider must in addition consider any views expressed by the victim.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/28" class="indent">4.9 The complainant in respect of a sexual offence or domestic abuse and the relatives of those who have died as a result of criminal conduct are eligible for an enhanced service under the Code unless the victim has informed the service provider of the victim's wish not to be so.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/29" class="indent">4.10 A victim's vulnerability may change during the course of an investigation due to health, intimidation or other reason. Service providers must give the victim the opportunity to be provided with an enhanced service if such a change in circumstance is brought to their attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.5/30" class="indent">4.11 All organisations with responsibilities under the Code should identify victims as vulnerable or intimidated as defined by this Code. Once the service provider has identified a victim as vulnerable or intimidated, that service provider must ensure that this information is passed on as necessary to other organisations with responsibilities in this Code.</p>

	<p pid="b.613W.6/1">It is known that areas of the United Kingdom have mineral deficient soil and that deficiencies of selenium occur in farmed animals. Mineral supplements for cattle can therefore be desirable to help alleviate this where it occurs.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.6/2">We remain open minded about the possibility of a nutritional link between selenium deficiency and mastitis. The use of selenium supplements in any particular herd should be based on veterinary advice or expert advice from a nutritionist, as selenium can be toxic in excess and has a narrow safety margin. Organic standards allow the inclusion of trace element salts into the diet and in some cases allow trace element treatments within an animal health plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.616W.5/1">The Environment Agency is currently carrying out a study considering the environmental impacts of a range of carrier bags, including disposable plastic carrier bags and biodegradable alternatives. The study will look at their entire life-cycle (from raw material extraction through to product manufacture, use and final disposal) and is due to report by the end of March this year. The evidence so far suggests there would be no benefit in reducing the number of plastic bags in use if this encourages the use of alternative packaging or materials which are even more environmentally damaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.616W.5/2">The National Non-Food Crops Centre has also started work on life cycle analysis comparison of plastic, oxodegradable and biodegradable bags. Again, this will be available by March 2007. They have established a thematic working group on biopolymers which aims to promote and facilitate the expansion of this sector. Biopolymers are derived from renewable sources and can be used in a range of products, including bags, which helps to develop a sustainable supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="b.616W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-12">12 October</phrase> last year, the Scottish Minister, Ross Finnie, and I jointly chaired a meeting with major UK retailers, to discuss a proposed voluntary code of practice on reducing the use of paper and plastic carrier bags. Defra is working closely with the devolved administrations, the Waste Resources Action Programme, the British Retail Consortium, retailers and the plastics industry to develop a voluntary approach for reducing the environmental impact of carrier bags. This is looking at ways of encouraging consumers to 'reduce, reuse and recycle' carrier bags. We intend to announce a programme of joint activity shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.616W.5/4">In addition, the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 require that 60 per cent. of packaging is recovered by 2008 and that a minimum of 55 per cent. is recycled. The regulations have succeeded so far in raising the recycling rate in the UK for packaging waste from around 27 per cent. in 1997 to 54.4 per cent. in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.617W.2/1">Rising energy costs are encouraging industry to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and consider greater use of recycled materials, especially in the glass and plastic sectors. This, and a range of other factors such as Government interventions, have caused a period of unprecedented growth in recycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/2">We can expect recycling to increase further, and it will be important to continue to progress market development (the development of sustainable markets for recycled materials) in the UK. Defra's Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has been established with this role. WRAP's work is focusing on materials where barriers need to be tackled to improve the sustainability of the markets concerned. These include paper, plastics, glass, wood and compost.</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/3">Broadly, challenges in these and other markets include:</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/4" class="indent">(i) developing alternative markets for recycled material and improving standards, specifications and procurement arrangements (particularly in the case of paper, plastics, wood and compost);</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/5" class="indent">(ii) improving reprocessing capacity (particularly for plastics, wood and compost);</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/6" class="indent">(iii) addressing quality sourcing problems (particularly in the case of paper, glass, wood and compost); and</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/7" class="indent">(iv) improving collection infrastructure (especially for plastics, wood and compost).</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/8">The current WRAP business plan outlines how these market development challenges are being addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/9">WRAP has also started to produce public market situation reports for key recyclable materials. The first of these, on glass, was published in January 2007. This identified that a particular challenge for glass market development will be increasing the quantity of high quality colour-separated cullet. WRAP plans that a report on paper will follow in spring 2007 and another on plastic in summer 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.618W.2/1">It is difficult to give a precise estimate of past sea level rise at specific locations because of the relative short length of most tide gauge records and the significant inter-annual variation, including a 19 year lunar cycle. However, it is generally accepted that sea levels along the south coast have been rising by between 1 and 2 mm per year over recent decades.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.2/2">Defra published revised guidance for operating authorities on future rates of sea level rise to be taken into account in flood and coastal erosion risk management decisions in November 2006. This recommended that, including the effects of vertical land movement in the south west, an allowance of 3.5 mm rise per year should be made from the baseline of nominal 1990 levels to 2025 (that is, that levels in 2025 could be 122.5 mm higher than in 1990).</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.2/3">From 2025 to 2050, it is recommended that an 8.0 mm rise per year is assumed, to give a total rise of 178.5 mm by 2032, relative to 1990 levels. These are not predictions but are intended to be reasonably precautionary working allowances. The assumptions and qualifications on which these recommendations are based are included in the guidance which is published on the Defra website.</p>
