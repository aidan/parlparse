	<p pid="b.531W.3/1">The Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (&quot;the Act&quot;) represents a missed opportunity during a time of high commodity prices to reduce the levels of trade distorting domestic support given to US agriculture. The impact of domestic support payments on global agricultural markets is difficult to disaggregate at the country by country level and we have not conducted detailed analysis of the impact of changes in the Act on British farming exports. The Act makes relatively minor changes to the commodity title in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (i.e. the last US Farm Bill).</p>

	<p pid="b.533W.3/1">My Department is aware of a number of scientific studies on these devices, but considers that to date those studies published are not sufficiently robust. Further research into these types of collars is a priority. An Open Competition Call was published in DEFRA's annual research requirements document in August 2005 inviting bids for research on the effect of both electronic and non-electronic training aids on the welfare of dogs. A single proposal was received in response to the call but it did not satisfactorily meet the advertised requirement and it was rejected.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.3/2">In July 2006, DEFRA circulated a revised call for research in the form of a limited tender call. The call invited proposals for studies to assess the effect of specific electronic pet training aids (excluding electric fences) on the welfare of dogs. The call encouraged an epidemiological approach, based on observation of collars already in use. One proposal was received in response to the call and a study commissioned which is due to complete in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.3/3">DEFRA has also asked the Companion Animal Welfare Council, advisory body to Government on companion animal welfare matters, to undertake an independent study of available evidence on the use of these electronic training aids to help inform policy and complement the DEFRA funded study.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.3/4">The study will not cover electric mats and leads. We are not aware that these devices are used to any significant extent. If they do cause a dog to suffer unnecessarily then it would be possible to bring a prosecution under the Animal welfare act 2006.</p>

However, rabies susceptible animals have to go into quarantine for a six month period, and these costs must be met or the animals will be destroyed or returned to the exporting country. If there is no owner or importer to claim responsibility for the animals, and charities wish to save the animals from being euthanized&mdash;it is the responsibility of those charities to meet the costs of the quarantine period.

Any decision to offer these discretionary elements is a matter for individual TCAs.</p>

	<p pid="b.541W.3/2">The Government aim to reduce drinking and driving through a combination of effective law enforcement, maintaining a tough penalties regime and continuing to invest in high-profile national publicity campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.3/3">Police enforcement has been enhanced in recent years by enabling blood specimens to be taken from unconscious, hospitalised drink-drive suspects. The police have also been given powers to carry out evidential roadside breathtesting, subject to type approval of appropriate devices.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.3/4">The Road Safety Act 2006 contains a number of other measures designed to deter drink-driving and reduce reoffending. These include enabling powers to require serious, including repeat, offenders to retake the driving test at the end of their disqualification; to improve the operation of the drink-drive rehabilitation scheme; to close loopholes in the law relating to high risk offenders; and to create a statutory alcohol ignition interlock programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.3/5">We have recently launched the THINK! Summer 2008 drink-drive publicity campaign, which is running in parallel with the police's enforcement campaign throughout June. This is a multi-media campaign which builds on the Moment of Doubt commercial launched last year emphasising the serious personal consequences of a drink-drive conviction. The new campaign focuses on the 11-year driving licence endorsement for most drink-drive offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.3/6">We remain committed to public consultation on further measures for tackling drink-driving, including ways of making police enforcement easier, and are aiming to publish a consultation document within the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="b.542W.11/2">The Department for Transport recognises that during road maintenance and street works it is important to protect adequately both road workers and road users. To enable highway authorities, statutory utilities and contractors to maintain safety there is comprehensive, national guidance on how to design and operate temporary traffic management in Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual. This guidance is developed by the Highways Agency in association with industry and other stakeholders such as the Health and Safety Executive. Additional guidance, mainly for workers undertaking urban utilities work is also included in &quot;Safety at Street Works and Road Works: a Code of Practice&quot;. Both documents are published on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.11/3">These documents recognise that the principle of maintaining adequate safety requires workers to be protected with cones, barriers and safety zones. However, as cones and barriers can pose a risk to road users speed limits are often imposed to reduce that risk, with enforcement measures where practicable.</p>

Transport improvements have long-term impacts many years into the future and current oil prices will necessarily only provide some of the evidence. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) analyses both current oil prices and factors determining long-term trends in the price of oil.

The Department for Transport records the number of accessible rail vehicles as they enter service.</p>
	<p pid="b.545W.5/3">Data on the number of accessible buses is collected for the annual Public Transport Statistics Bulletin for Great Britain. There was an increase in the percentage of low floor buses up from 50 per cent. in 2005-06 to 58 per cent. in 2006-07. We have met the voluntary target agreed with the bus industry which is that 50 per cent. of buses should be low floor by 2010. All full size buses must comply with the Public Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, which include a requirement for low floor, wheelchair accessible buses, by 2017.</p>

	<p pid="b.549W.0/1">The Department published its Departmental Report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-19">19 May 2008</phrase> which included latest assessments against Spending Review 2004 PSA targets. Two target elements were reported as not met:</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/2" class="indent">PSA target 6 (element 1)&mdash;By 2006 85 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieve level 4 or above, with this level of performance sustained until 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/3" class="indent">PSA target 7 (element 1)&mdash;By 2007 85 per cent. of 14-year-olds achieve level 5 or above in English, mathematics and ICT (80 per cent. in science) nationally, with this level of performance sustained to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/4">PSA target 6 (element 1) was first reported as not met in the Autumn Performance Report 2006 (CM 6992) which also included the following information on performance:</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/5" class="indent">Provisional 2005/06 results of Key Stage 2 tests show that 79 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved level 4 or above in English (no change over 2004/05) and 76 per cent. achieved level 4 or above in mathematics (an increase of one percentage point over 2004/05).</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/6" class="indent">Although primary standards are now at their highest ever level, the headline Key Stage 2 targets have not been met.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/7" class="indent">Compared to 1996/97, about 95,000 more 11-year-olds are now achieving the target level for their age in English and 83,000 more are doing so in mathematics. The 2005/06 results showed the largest increase in children achieving above the target level 4 in English since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/8" class="indent">Since 1996/97, the increase in standards and in the quality of teaching and learning in schools has been dramatic and sustained. Ofsted have stated that teaching in primary schools has never been better and describes the current generation of newly-qualified teachers as the best trained ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/9">PSA target 7 (element 1) was first reported as not met in the Autumn Performance Report 2007 (CM 7279) which also included the following information on performance:</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/10" class="indent">The 2006/07 provisional results of the National Curriculum Key Stage 3 tests show that 74 per cent. of 14-year-olds achieved level 5 or above in English, 76 per cent. achieved level 5 or above in mathematics, and 73 per cent. achieved level 5 or above in science. This represents an increase of three percentage points from the target's 2003/04 baseline in English, three percentage points from the target's 2003/04 baseline in mathematics, and seven percentage points from the target's 2003/04 baseline in science.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/11" class="indent">Recent slow progress has meant the 2007 target has not been met. However, there has been some progress in 2006/07 with provisional results showing improvement in attainment in English, science and IT.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/12" class="indent">The 2006/07 results mean that 95,000 additional pupils reached the expected level in English compared to 1997, with 95,000 more reaching the expected level in mathematics and 75,000 in science.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/13" class="indent">To build on these results, the Making Good Progress pilot which started in September 2007 will help all children to progress well at school, giving the brightest pupils an opportunity to reach their full potential, and ensuring that those at risk of falling behind are identified and supported in their learning. A new secondary curriculum will be introduced from next year, which will give teachers more flexibility and provide additional time to help children who are at risk of falling behind to master the basics, as well as offering more stretching opportunities for those who excel.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.0/14" class="indent">Tools, guidance and training on Assessing Pupil Progress have now been rolled out for reading, writing and mathematics; speaking and listening and science will follow over the next year. The effective tracking of pupil progress is the most common feature of successful schools, and these materials will support schools in doing that. Through the National Strategies, targeted intervention materials for pupils who fall behind is also continuing.</p>

Promoting the use of UK-based small and medium enterprises where they add value to the programme is, however, clearly desirable.</p>
	<p pid="b.556W.0/4">The assessment of when a demonstration vehicle would be available was an area of focus during the Utility Vehicle trials in 2007, as was specifying a platform weight for the Future Rapid Effect System. Our assessment is continuing and these areas will remain a focus during the forthcoming programme of risk reduction work that will address a number of commercial, programme and technical issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.556W.0/5">Only when the MOD is satisfied on all the issues being addressed during the programme of risk reduction work, including when a demonstration vehicle will be available and a platform weight specified, will General Dynamics achieve preferred bidder status and these decisions will be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.561W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-13">13 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary questions asking: how many <i> (a)</i> men and <i> (b)</i> women were in work in (i) Jarrow constituency, (ii) South Tyneside, (iii) the North East and (iv) the UK in 2007-08; how many <i> (a)</i> men, <i> (b)</i> women and <i> (c)</i> single parents were unemployed in (i) Jarrow constituency, (ii) South Tyneside, (iii) the North East and (iv) the UK in 2007-08; and how many single parents were in work in <i> (a)</i> Jarrow constituency, <i> (b)</i> South Tyneside, <i> (c)</i> the North East and <i> (d)</i> the UK in 2007-08. (206761, 206775 and 206774).</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.0/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles labour market statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions. Estimates for single parents are compiled from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS) household datasets.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.0/5" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the number of men and women aged 16 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, South Tyneside, the North East and the UK who were in employment in 2007. Table 2, attached, shows the number of men and women aged 16 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, South Tyneside, the North East and the UK who were unemployed in 2007. Estimates are obtained from the APS for the 12 month period ending in September 2007, which is the most recent period for which estimates are available. Estimates for the North East and UK have been provided from the APS for consistency with the estimates for Jarrow and South Tyneside. These will differ from figures published in the Labour Market First Release which are based on Labour Force Survey data.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.0/6" class="indent">Table 3, attached, shows the number of single parents aged 16 plus, with dependent children, resident in the Jarrow constituency, South Tyneside, the North East and the UK who were in employment and unemployed in 2007. Estimates are obtained from the LFS household dataset for April-June 2007, which is the most recent period for which estimates are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.0/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.0/8" class="indent">In order to produce estimates for small geographical areas, LFS household and APS estimates are provided based on survey microdata. The LFS household datasets are consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003, whereas APS datasets are consistent with the latest population figures, so the two are not directly comparable. LFS household datasets reweighted to the latest population estimates are currently expected to be available in summer 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.567W.2/4" class="indent">The tables attached provide the figures for period life expectancy at birth, for wards with the 100 highest and 100 lowest life expectancies for males (tables 1 and 2) and females (tables 3 and 4), in England and Wales, 1999-2003 (the only period available).

	<p pid="b.567W.2/5" class="indent">These figures are experimental statistics&mdash;that is, statistics which are in a testing or consultation phase and are not fully developed&mdash;and should therefore be treated with caution. Life expectancies for wards can be based on very small numbers of deaths and small populations. They may therefore be subject to large variations even when aggregated over five years, as shown by the width of the '95 per cent. confidence interval' in the tables. The precise ranking of wards may therefore be due partly to chance, as are the extreme results of the wards with the highest female life expectancies.</p>

	<p pid="b.568W.0/4" class="indent">What international (a) immigration, (b) emigration and (c) net migration was for (i) each government office region in England, (ii) each local authority area in England, (iii) Wales and (iv) Scotland in each five year period since 1987; and what proportion per 1,000 population these figures represent.

	<p pid="b.568W.0/9" class="indent">Tables Al, A2, and A3 give figures for Parliamentary Question number 205759 between mid-1986 and mid-2006, the latest year for which figures are available based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The international immigration and emigration data for local authorities are only available from mid-2001 onwards. The footnotes to the tables provide the basis for the figures. (205759)</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.0/10" class="indent">Table B gives an estimate of net international migration by country of birth (UK and elsewhere) between 1987 and 2006. Data from 1991 to 2006 are based on Total International Migration (TIM) whilst data from 1987 to 1990 are based solely on the IPS, as estimates of TIM are not available prior to 1991. TIM is the measure of long term international migration introduced from 1991 and which is based mainly on data from the IPS supplemented with other data and adjustments for people not counted by the IPS.

No comparable estimates are available for 1987 as prior to 1992 the LFS was not conducted throughout the year, and thus it is not possible to provide an average over four quarters for 1987. No projection has been made of future trends in the proportion of the population to have been born abroad. (205790)</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.0/13" class="indent">Between 1997 and 2007 there was an increase of 2,323,000 UK residents who were born abroad. Table D gives the ten most common countries of birth of foreign born UK residents in 1997 and 2007. No comparable estimates are available for 1987. (205791)</p>

	<p pid="b.571W.6/2">I am not able to provide figures for the cost of running the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) because we estimate that to locate, retrieve and extract such information would involve disproportionate cost. The UK employs a broad range of staff in support of the government of Afghanistan to help develop a stable and secure Afghanistan. Over 100 civilian staff in Kabul and over 40 staff in Helmand are employed from across the Government, including the Stabilisation Unit, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Afghanistan Drugs Inter-Departmental Unit. Their roles include work in governance, stabilisation, reconstruction and development, security sector reform and counter narcotics.</p>
	<p pid="b.571W.6/3">The PRT in Helmand is focused on developing Afghan local capacity in development, security and governance, and is helping administer over &pound;36 million the UK plans to spend towards the province's reconstruction this financial year. Since the UK took over the PRT in May 2006 we have seen early progress on these three fronts, with PRT officials delivering valuable assistance in a challenging environment. Since May 2006, the PRT has implemented 247 quick-impact projects valued at &pound;18 million. This has supported a number of building projects (including schools, parks and police stations), police training and women's rights projects. DFID has also committed &pound;10 million per year over three years (2006-09) to support the government of Afghanistan's long-term development programmes in Helmand.</p>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  2. <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  3. <i> Data Quality</i><i> </i>Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  4. <i> Finished admission episodes</i><i> (FAEs)</i><i> </i>A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.  5. <i> Consultant main specialty</i><i> </i>This defines the specialty under which the consultant responsible is contracted. Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

The figures from 2003-04 include changes in relation to the retail prices indexation for existing pensioners for which funding was devolved from HM Treasury to the Department in 2003-04, and which was fully devolved to scheme employers from 2004-05. It has been agreed as part of the review of the NHS Pension Scheme that there will be a cap on employers' contributions in relation to increases in costs relating from improvements in the value of the scheme to members of 14.2 per cent. from 2012, when the 2008 valuation is expected to be implemented, and of 14 per cent. from 2016.</p>

	<p pid="b.582W.5/1">Under section 90A of the Water Industry Act 1991, strategic health authorities (SHAs) are required to monitor the effects of fluoridation schemes on the health of persons living in the fluoridated area and publish reports containing an analysis of the effects on health at four-yearly intervals. The West Midland Public Health Observatory is leading on the compilation of a set of standard indicators which can be used by SHAs in fulfilling this responsibility. This approach would use information on concentrations of fluoride in drinking water and intakes from dietary studies to estimate ingestion of fluoride. We understand that in compiling proposals the observatory is considering whether thyroid disease could be monitored using such routine data sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.582W.5/2">A review &quot;Water fluoridation and health&quot; undertaken by the Medical Research Council of the need for research on the effects of fluoridation and published in 2002 ascribed a low priority to further research on thyroid disorders. We will consider the need for further research on thyroid disorders in the light of any recommendations which may be made by the observatory.</p>

The figures show those currently under 18 or 16, not those who were that age at the time they were sampled. The fact that someone is sampled by a particular police force does not mean that the person lives in the force area. The number of profiles held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is not the same as the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.

	<p pid="b.605W.10/1">The Research Councils support research and related training in nanotechnology. For example, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) has spent over &pound;132 million since 2003 on nanotechnology, and is currently investing about &pound;40 million per annum in research grants and supporting 40 new PhD studentships per annum in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.10/2">A new &pound;50 million cross-Council programme covering NanoScience through Engineering to Application was announced in December 2007 as one of six strategic priorities over the CSR period (2008-09 to 2010-11). From this, &pound;6.5 million has been committed to explore new methods of harvesting solar energy, for example by developing new types of solar cells.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.10/3">In addition, the Technology Strategy Board (an Executive NDPB of DIUS) currently provides funding of &pound;19.5 million to projects at the nanoscale and a further &pound;15 million on microscale engineering projects incorporating elements of nanotechnology. The Nanotechnology Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN), established in 2007, works with the network of KTNs funded by the Technology Strategy Board and has a role in coordinating the UK network of 23 Micro-Nano Technology (MNT) Centres, including two centres offering services on the characterisation of micro and nano-scale materials. &pound;54 million has been provided to establish and maintain the MNT centres, jointly funded with the regional development agencies and devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.10/4">In April this year the National Measurement System (NMS) Unit in DIUS approved several new projects to be delivered within the NMS Chemical and Biological Metrology Programme. Two thirds of the work, worth more than &pound;5 million over three years, addresses the field of nanotechnology. The projects aim to develop measurement standards and will be led by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). NPL will involve several partners in the research.</p>

We believe it is important for all of Africa's partners, including China, to act in ways that support the principles for sustainable development outlined in Africa's own New Partnership for Africa's Development agenda, including good governance and sound economic management.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.3/3">The UK and China have initiated a dialogue covering a range of issues important to conflict prevention and development in Africa. Governance and human rights issues are discussed as part of this dialogue. There have been positive outcomes. During my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's visit to Beijing in January, Premier Wen signed up to the Millennium Development Goals Call to Action. Ministers regularly discuss African issues, such as Darfur, with their Chinese counterparts. Through the dialogue and our other bilateral contacts with China we are also working to encourage the Chinese Government to endorse the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.</p>

This of itself precludes any lump-sum tax levied specifically on entry to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.9/3">The Government along with industry representatives looked at foreign activity as part of the industry study undertaken by the 2006 Haulage Industry Task Group. The conclusions showed that cabotage activity (foreign operators picking up and dropping off the same load within the UK) accounted for around 1 per cent. of domestic road freight movements.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.9/4">Following the conclusion of the recent Freight Data Feasibility Study, the Government decided against taking forward a vignette scheme due to the limited benefits achievable when compared to the costs. It was decided that greater benefits are achievable through other measures, and to this extent the Department for Transport recently announced an additional &pound;24.3 million on enforcement spending, targeting those on international trips&mdash;those less likely to comply with UK road safety law.</p>

	<p pid="b.622W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-04">4 February 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.622W.2/2">I apologise for the delay in replying; the information is not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.2/3">Section 126 of the Pensions Act 2004 and regulations made under it set out the eligibility criteria for pension protection fund levies; in broad terms, occupational pension schemes which are not money purchase schemes or otherwise exempted by legislation are eligible schemes as long as they had not begun to wind up when the PPF opened for business in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.2/4">In the 2007 update of the Purple Book&mdash;defined benefit pensions universe risk profile, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-18">18 December 2007</phrase>, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) estimates that its eligible defined-benefit (DB) universe was around 7,800 schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.2/5">Pension schemes may become ineligible for Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levies for a number of reasons. For example, a scheme would become ineligible if its trustees entered into a compromise with the sponsoring employer to reduce the debt the employer owed the scheme, without the Board of the PPF's agreement. A scheme could also become ineligible if it only had two members and one of those died&mdash;as schemes with fewer than two members are not eligible schemes. A scheme would also cease to be an eligible scheme if it completed winding up.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.2/6">The Board of the PPF only holds data on the eligible scheme universe; if a scheme is ineligible it will be recorded only with the pensions regulator. Provision of the correct information by schemes is of course essential, and the two organisations work closely together to ensure consistent data. However, if a scheme is invoiced for the pension protection levy and later demonstrates that it was ineligible, the Board will refund any sums paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.2/7">Between <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> a total of 9,084 schemes notified the pensions regulator that the scheme had completed wind-up. Of these, 675 were defined benefit schemes and 139 were hybrid schemes, and the balance (8,270) were defined contribution schemes. 814 of these schemes (the DB and hybrid ones) would until that point have been eligible for PPF levies, providing they had not begun winding up before the PPF opened for business in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.2/8">Similar information for 2006-07 could not be provided without disproportionate cost. However, improvements in the way scheme data is collected will mean that similar information for 2007-08 and beyond will be available.</p>

	<p pid="b.624W.2/1">As a result of our successful policies, youth claimant unemployment is at a historic low. The New Deal for Young People has helped to virtually eradicate youth long-term claimant unemployment, with the numbers of young job seekers unemployed for a year or more down from 91,000 in March 1997 to 5,900 in March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.2/2">The Department for Work and Pensions is working closely with the Department for Children, Schools and Families to support young people to make the transition from education and training into work and to engage with 18-year-olds with a previous history of being not in education, employment or training. From April this year 18-year-olds with any past history of being not in education, employment or training can, by agreement with their personal adviser, be fast tracked on a voluntary basis to the Gateway stage of the New Deal for Young People.</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.2/3">From April 2009, we will take this approach further by making fast tracking to the more intensive, adviser-led support stage of the flexible New Deal mandatory for 18-year-olds who have spent at least six months not in education, employment or training. The flexible New Deal and refreshed Jobseeker's Allowance programme will be a key element in a welfare system in which, increasingly, claimants are not passive recipients of benefits, but instead active job seekers preparing for a return to work in which they will be better off.</p>

Following recent interest, I asked departmental lawyers and officials to fully re-examine the reasons for paying winter fuel payments to former UK residents now living elsewhere in the European economic area. Under European Union law, some benefits acquired in one member state must be paid to people who live outside that state but within the European economic area. Winter fuel payments are one of these benefits and the UK is bound by European Union law. To comply with European law we must continue to pay winter fuel payments to former UK residents living elsewhere in the European economic area if they qualified for a payment before leaving the UK.</p>
