	<p pid="b.1257W.6/2">For example: the report highlighted how UN agencies handled co-ordination in each sector.

	<p pid="b.1258W.6/1">The increasing violence and communal tension is a major barrier to recovery in the north and east. In the southern districts, not contested by the LTTE and not directly affected by the fighting, recovery is proceeding swiftly, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1258W.6/2">The increase in direct fighting between the Sri Lankan military, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and militia's associated with each side has been accompanied by an increase in communal tension. Development agencies and non governmental organisations have evacuated staff for their security and protection and recovery programmes have been suspended. In addition, regular economic activities and recovery work undertaken in communities without external assistance has also been affected by military activity. Able bodied men are being mobilised for LTTE service, and people are being displaced by fighting, or the fear of fighting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1258W.6/3">The situation continues to deteriorate, as evidenced by the recent suicide bombing in Colombo and the subsequent air strikes and naval shelling in the east. Without a considerable improvement in the security situation it is unlikely that much recovery can be undertaken. The international community, including the United Kingdom, are working hard to encourage the Government and the (LTTE) to curtail violence and to return to the negotiating table. Once the security environment improves we will renew efforts to help ensure delivery of development assistance to communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1259W.2/1">The UK Government's approach to promoting reproductive health is set out in the DFID position paper, &quot;Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights&quot;. Our approach to achieving the fifth Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health is outlined in the DFID strategy paper, &quot;Reducing Maternal Deaths: Evidence and Action&quot;. Both were published in 2004 after extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community, NGOs, parliamentarians and civil society groups. A web-based consultation was also held as part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.2/2">Our understanding of the so-called &quot;Mexico City Policy&quot; is that it requires non-US NGOs to agree that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in order to receive US funding. This means, for example, that non-US NGOs who accept US funding are not allowed to use their own funds to provide information or counselling for abortion care, or to promote awareness of the benefits of legal reform. As the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) &quot;Death and Denial: Unsafe Abortion and Poverty&quot; report makes clear, the policy forces NGOs to choose between carrying on work to protect the health and rights of women or lose funds. No reproductive or maternal health NGOs affected by the policy work to &quot;promote abortion as a method of family planning&quot;, and indeed this would be contrary to the global consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). What they try to do is to provide a comprehensive range of information and services that can help save women's lives, and reduce the need for abortion. The US policy means that the work of such organisations is compromised, and that is why my Department is opposed to it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1259W.5/1">The Government of Iraq, supported by the UK and other donors, has made significant progress with reconstruction since 2003. But there is still a long way to go. Once a relatively wealthy country with high levels of education and health care, by 2003 Iraq had suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic under-investment from a brutal regime. Continued violence, especially sabotage directed at key infrastructure, and low (but growing) levels of management capacity in Iraq's national and local government have slowed progress. The UK and international community are committed to helping the new Iraqi Government tackle these challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/2">One challenge is the lack of data, especially at the regional and provincial level. The following information therefore covers the progress that has been made across Iraq, including regional detail only where this is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/3">Electricity generation is more equitably distributed across Iraq than before 2003. Nearly 5,000 megawatts (MW) have been added to the national grid since 2003, but Iraq's average electricity generation has not improved over that period. This is because at the same time as capacity is being added through reconstruction projects, breakdowns of the pre-existing dilapidated systems, shortages of fuel supplies and sabotage are reducing capacity. So Iraqis are not getting the full benefit of those extra megawatts. Demand for electricity also continues to rise dramatically, as the economy grows and more people own and use electrical goods such as fridges and air-conditioning units. The new Iraqi Government will be starting work on a long-term power sector strategy, with DFID's support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/4">In the south, average electricity generation levels have increased from approximately 750 MW in January 2004 to over 1,000 MW in December 2005. The south now receives its fair share of national power&mdash;whereas under Saddam's regime, power was often diverted from the south to Baghdad.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/5">To improve power supply in the south, DFID has:</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/6" class="indent">Repaired transmission lines from Hartha power station to Basra city&mdash;securing electricity supplies for 1.5 million residents;</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/7" class="indent">Improved power distribution to 13 areas of Basra.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/8">By the end of 2006, we will have:</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/9" class="indent">Established point power generators to provide 15 MW of back-up supplies in Dhi Qar and Maysan;</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/10" class="indent">Added or secured a further 190 MW of electricity in the south, through our &pound;40 million Iraq Infrastructure and Services Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/11">Water supplies have improved across the south since the end of the conflict, and sewage systems and water treatment plants are now operating again. Before the conflict, no major sewage systems were operating. Immediate post-conflict work improved efficiency of water treatment plants and pumping stations. DFID has:</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/12" class="indent">provided technical advice for a major sewage installation in Al Amarah, providing up to half the city's population with access to a piped system and replacing open sewage channels;</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/13" class="indent">improved the water supply to 60,000 people in Al Amtahiyah;</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/14" class="indent">started construction of reservoirs and water towers to benefit a further 200,000 people;</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/15" class="indent">constructed a water training centre which will train water engineers from Maysan, Muthanna, Basra and Dhi Qar provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/16">Health services are gradually being restored throughout Iraq. Hundreds of health care facilities have been rehabilitated and 240 hospitals and 1,200 primary health centres are now functioning. Through extensive disease control programmes, there has been a decline in the prevalence of leishmaniasis, malaria, measles, mumps, and polio. Japan and the US have rehabilitated a number of health care facilities in the south, as well as supplying essential equipment, ambulances and drugs. The US is constructing a new paediatric hospital in Basra, which will offer improved treatment to children with acute conditions across the south.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.5/17">5,168 schools have been rehabilitated throughout Iraq, with a further 450 in progress. By the end of 2006, more than 133,000 primary school teachers and 47,500 secondary school teachers and administrators will have received training and technical support. In southern Iraq, the UN has rehabilitated schools and supplied textbooks, and is also rehabilitating vocational training institutes. Japan has provided textbooks to all primary schools in Muthanna. There are 465 schools operating in Maysan, and 348 in Muthanna.</p>

	<p pid="b.1262W.0/1">DFID is the only major bilateral donor to already have a specific strategy focusing on maternal health: &quot;Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action&quot;, which was launched in 2004. We have disseminated this comprehensive maternal health strategy throughout the international system, with other donors, the UN, and most importantly, with the developing partners we support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262W.0/2">The strategy provides the basis for DFID support to improve maternal health at country level, which we do through a combination of programmes to strengthen health services and improve overall reproductive and child health, along with specific maternal health programmes and HIV interventions. Long-term support for maternal health in Nepal, for example, is demonstrating significant increases in women's access to emergency obstetric care in remote areas and in a fragile state. This work highlights the importance of support for community level action to overcome cultural and socio-economic barriers to accessing care, as well as the importance of addressing infrastructure (roads, bridges) and communications issues to ensure an effective referral system. In Malawi, DFID is supporting an Emergency Human Resource Programme to address the acute shortages of health workers, an issue which has been compounded by the AIDS epidemic. Overall investments for maternal health (including reproductive health services) have increased by over 40 per cent. over the past three years, to &pound;242.9 million in 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262W.0/3">The maternal health strategy also provides the platform for DFID's regular policy discussions with other donors, such as the EU, G8 and the UN, on the actions needed to improve maternal health in developing countries and the importance of doing more on maternal health. We are seeking to highlight the importance of maternal health within the current G8 process, although the prime health theme at present is infectious disease. We are also working to ensure that the new Partnership for Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health can play a useful role in advocating for more action on maternal health, and to improve the way UN agencies work together on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262W.0/4">Importantly, good advocacy is based upon good data. Getting reliable information on maternal deaths is difficult in most developing countries where maternal deaths are not recorded and where more than half of all births take place at home, without a skilled attendant but either with relatives or alone. This is why DFID, along with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation, supports IMMPACT, the only global research initiative which is successfully identifying effective ways in which maternal deaths can be measured and the statistics used for high level advocacy. DFID further supports a recent global partnership, Health Metrics Network, which aims to provide country level support to governments to get better data.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.0/3">Indigenous peoples (holders of traditional knowledge) play an important role in the World Intellectual Property Organisation Inter-Governmental Committee on Traditional Knowledge, Folklore and Genetic Resources (IGC) where these matters are discussed. A voluntary fund has recently been set up to help ensure their participation and attendance to this committee. The IGC has done important work on traditional knowledge databases and also on amending the international classification system for patents to include traditional knowledge and hence make it easier for holders of traditional knowledge to access patent applications based on traditional knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.0/4">The assessment of intellectual property applications is done by patent examiners and trademark examiners in the relevant country or jurisdiction. In the UK anyone can file observations on patentability with regard to patent applications, including the holders of traditional knowledge. This will then be taken into account when the patent is examined. In a similar manner, anyone can make observations about the registrability of a trademark. Further, trademarks applications can be opposed or subsequently invalidated if the mark designates a characteristic of those goods or services, or is otherwise non-distinctive. Similar arrangements are in place in most countries and jurisdictions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.3/1">The Government supports the principle of developing countries' demands to disclose country of origin or source of genetic material within patent applications. This could assist these countries to keep track of patent applications linked to the use of their resources and check whether appropriate benefit sharing agreements are in place. The Government therefore supported the EU proposal submitted to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee (IGC) in December 2004 which suggests that disclosure of country of origin or source in patent applications could be introduced on a global basis in national, regional and international patent applicants. We judged that this proposal strikes a good balance between achieving the objective of supporting developing countries' request to include disclosure of origin provisions into international patent law whilst ensuring that patents are not undermined and patent applicants are not overly burdened.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.3/2">We must however, ensure that the system is workable in practice and achieves the desired outcome (i.e. benefits are generated and shared appropriately). Therefore, we have so far focused our efforts on discussions in the WIPO IGC, where the technical expertise resides.</p>

	<p pid="b.1265W.5/1">DFID provides Trade Related Capacity Building (TRCB) support to sub-Saharan African countries through its bilateral programmes and multilateral institutions. It does not have a stand alone TRCB Fund to which sub-Saharan African countries can bid. Therefore, we are unable to provide information on bids and their success.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.5/2">Our support for Trade Related Capacity Building for sub-Saharan African countries is allocated according to their TRCB needs as identified in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers or national development plans and in fulfilment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) criteria for TRCB.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.5/3">For the period 1997-2005, DFID's financial records show that countries in sub-Saharan Africa received &pound;16.2 million in support for trade and investment activities, through bilateral programmes and DFID supported multilateral institutions. Trade and investment activities are one aspect only of DFID's complete TRCB programme which includes private sector development, agricultural development, compliance with standards etc. Therefore, DFID's overall support to TRCB in sub-Saharan Africa is larger than the figure given. The difficulty in isolating the TRCB elements within large economic growth or regional programmes prevents us from providing further financial details on TRCB expenditure. Annex A provides details per sub-Saharan African country of the DFID trade and investment expenditure for the period 1997-2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.5/4">In terms of specific TRCB programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, DFID currently runs an &pound;11 million Regional Trade Facilitation Programme. The programme supports two regional economic communities, the Southern African Development Community and Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa, and their members in negotiations with the WTO and European Commission and implementing regional integration.</p>

We are financing the Government's public service reform programme which is improving the Government effectiveness, and the public financial management and accountability programme which is strengthening public financial management systems in both central and local government.

	<p pid="b.1266W.5/1">In December 2004, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, proposed a package of six key reforms to improve the effectiveness of emergency response, with a particular focus on the UN as the global lead. The six reforms are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/2" class="indent">Establishment of a new global humanitarian fund;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/3" class="indent">Strengthen the UN Humanitarian Coordinator system;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/4" class="indent">Common donor funding for the Humanitarian Coordinator to deploy on the most urgent unmet needs;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/5" class="indent">Development of global benchmarks to measure humanitarian response performance;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/6" class="indent">Increased donor focus on &quot;forgotten&quot;, or under-funded, emergencies;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/7" class="indent">Increased donor funding for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/8">The United Nations is taking forward these reforms with the support and participation of the wider donor community, including DFID, NGOs and the Red Cross movement. In December 2005, a new UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was approved by the UN General Assembly. It was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March 2006</phrase> with $254 million from 38 donors, including $70 million from DFID. Under the direction of the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator, the CERF is now enabling UN humanitarian agencies to respond rapidly to sudden disasters, such as earthquakes; time-critical responses in slow-onset disasters, such as drought; and essential life-saving actions in ongoing but under-funded crises such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chad.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/9">A number of proposals for strengthening the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator system are being taken forward, including developing a pool of suitable candidates and associated training. Currently there are 21 trained humanitarian co-ordinators, including some from NGO or Red Cross backgrounds. Alongside this, DFID is leading seven other donors in piloting pooled country level funding, to be used as directed by the resident humanitarian co-ordinator, in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo during 2006. DFID is also providing support to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in developing performance benchmarks for mortality, nutrition, and health. DFID has supported progress over the last 12 months in reforming the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and in March this year we launched our new Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/10">In September 2005, the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which deals with humanitarian issues, established a new 'cluster' system to deliver more accountable and predictable humanitarian responses. Named agencies have responsibility for coordinating responses in key sectors such as water and sanitation (UNICEF), protection (the United Nations High Commissioner fro Refugees (UNHCR), Logistics (the World Food Programme (WFP), and Health (the WHO), and developing networks or clusters of other agencies and NGOs to work together to improve capacity, performance, and effectiveness. DFID is currently considering, along with other donors, how best to support this initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.5/11">In January 2006, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, called for further reform of the international humanitarian system by improving the quality and focus of UN Flash Appeals. This involves developing agreements for the use of military assets; and for better accountability in humanitarian funding, performance, and outcomes for beneficiary communities. We are working along with other donors, the UN, and other humanitarian organisations to develop these initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268W.5/1">In 2005, DFID committed over &pound;1.2 million of humanitarian assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). &pound;1 million was channelled through UNICEF for water, sanitation and health care, and a further &pound;200,000 through the International Federation of the Red Cross for disaster risk deduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.5/2">In late 2005, the DPRK said that it would no longer accept international humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, it has increased the already significant restrictions it places on the humanitarian community, with the consequence that DFID can no longer feel confident that programmes of assistance are appropriate and are reaching those who most need it most. All World Food Programme (WFP) operations are funded solely from voluntary contributions and the UK is not contributing to the one in the DPRK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.5/3">The UK has no plans to conduct a survey of malnutrition in the DPRK. Obtaining nutritional information is hampered by the constraints placed on the operations of international humanitarian agencies. The last international survey was carried out in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March 2006</phrase> there were wide-spread changes to the civil aeronautical route structure over the West of England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/2">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March 2006</phrase> the air route in the vicinity of West Somerset and Sedgmoor was Airway N864 with an axis 190&deg;/010&deg;, a lateral extent of 10 nautical miles and with the centreline approximately over Blue Anchor Bay. The vertical limits of the route extend from FL55 (5,500 feet above mean sea level) to the north of the coastline and FL65 (6,500 feet amsl) over land to an upper limit of FL245 (24,500 feet amsl). The volume of airspace within the airway is defined as controlled airspace. Above FL245 is the Upper Airspace Control Area, which covers the whole of the United Kingdom. Within the Upper Airspace Control Area above West Somerset and Sedgmoor existed the routes UN864, UN862, UM140, UM17 and UW501.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/3">The changes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March</phrase> did not affect N864, UN864, UM140, UM17 and UW501. However, a new route called N90 was introduced to the east of N864 for use between Friday evenings and Monday mornings. The lateral extent of the new controlled airspace is 12 nautical miles from the eastern boundary of N864 and with a lower limit of FL105 (10,500 feet amsl). In the Upper Control Area UN90 was introduced above N90 and UN862 was moved two nautical miles to the east to be above N862. A new Upper Air Route called UN22 was introduced parallel to and 12 nautical miles west of UN864.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/4">Additionally, there are proposed changes to controlled airspace associated with Bristol and Cardiff airports, which are intended to introduce new controlled airspace over part of West Somerset and Sedgmoor. It should be noted that aircraft operations associated with these airports occur today and the proposed new controlled airspace is designed to provide additional protection to these flights. The proposals have been the subject of public consultation, which included Members of Parliament, local authorities, AONB representatives and other interested parties within the areas affected. These changes are currently subject to regulatory consideration by the CAA.</p>

	<p pid="b.1275W.0/2">However, in the absence of a regulatory regime, DSA developed an agreed set of minimum core competencies for drivers of emergency vehicles. These were published in 2001 as the &quot;Blue Light Users Working Party Expectations Document&quot;. DSA had worked together with the ambulance and fire services, police and the Ministry of Defence to develop this document. It was agreed that each service should tailor any training based on these competencies to the needs of their own drivers and vehicles. The expectation document is available on the DSA website:</p>

	<p pid="b.1276W.5/1">Section 161 of the Highways Act 1980 deals with penalties for causing certain kinds of danger or annoyance to users of the highway. If a person without lawful authority or excuse deposits anything whatsoever on a highway in consequence of which a user of the highway is injured or endangered, that person is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.5/2">In the last 12 months the Department has dealt with two representations from members of the public concerning this section.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.5/3">The Highways Act 1980 contains more than 300 sections and 25 schedules. A large number of amendments have been made to the Highways Act in the last 26 years and the cost of collating a list would be disproportionate. As there is no central record of representations received by the Department that would enable officials to identify those about the operation of the whole Act, it would also incur disproportionate cost to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.5/4">However, section 161 sub sections (1), (3) and (4) of the Highways Act 1980 were amended by sections 38 and 46 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982. These amendments raised the level of the fines. Section 161 sub section (2) was substituted by the Highways (Amendment) Act 1986 and relates to creating criminal offences in relation to lighting fires or discharging firearms or fireworks in the vicinity of the highway.</p>

	<p pid="b.1282W.2/1">The Government already support the use of bioethanol as a transport fuel by means of a 20 pence per litre fuel duty incentive. Since this was introduced in January 2005, sales of bioethanol in the UK have increased from zero to a monthly average of some 7 million litres. We have also announced that we will introduce a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation in 2008, which will require all transport fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels account for a certain percentage of their total fuel sales. In 2010, the level of the Obligation will reach 5 per cent., which should mean that annual sales of bioethanol reach over a billion litres a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.2/2">European Union fuel quality standards currently allow 5 per cent. ethanol to be blended into petrol, and all petrol vehicles are already capable of running on these blends. Above that level, a number of technical modifications are required to vehicles and to refuelling points. We introduced a new grant programme in 2005 to support the installation of alternative refuelling infrastructure, and through this we are supporting the installation of a small number of high level ethanol pumps. In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the March 2006 Budget that cars manufactured to run on high level ethanol blends will qualify for the reduced rate of Vehicle Excise Duty for alternatively fuelled cars. Beyond that, the Government have no current plans for other incentives.</p>

	<p pid="b.1291W.0/1">I have received veterinary advice that ventilation shutdown (VSD) is unlikely to deliver welfare standards equal to other recognised culling methods available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1291W.0/2">The use of ventilation shutdown would therefore only be authorised as a last resort where no other method, as outlined in Schedule 9 of the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, could be practicably employed for the killing of large numbers of birds on a specific farm for disease control purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1291W.0/3">The priority in dealing with a notifiable animal disease is to ensure that public health and safety of poultry workers is protected, particularly where, like with some strains of the avian influenza virus, there is a risk of human infection. Disease outbreaks must be dealt with quickly and effectively to reduce the likelihood of further spread of disease and it remains our intention to kill birds by the most humane method possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1291W.0/4">We must however be prepared for all eventualities including extreme circumstances where catchers are unavailable, logistical capabilities are stretched and where a grave threat to public health exists. The risk of that may be very small but it is right that we provide for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1291W.0/5">To enhance our capability to kill large numbers of birds through humane means, we have developed, and continue to develop, the use of gas or gas mixtures. Such techniques have been endorsed by the Humane Slaughter Association and were used successfully in the recent disease incidence in Norfolk. We expect that such techniques will be useable in the great majority of circumstances where an outbreak occurs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1291W.3/1">Since September 2005 approximately 5,000 blood samples, from 435 domestic poultry premises, have been tested. In October, samples taken from a number of geese on a premises in Somerset tested positive for antibodies to H5N2 and H5N7. Movement restrictions were served on the premises and a veterinary inquiry was initiated. Clinical examination revealed that the geese were healthy. Further sampling and laboratory tests did not isolate avian influenza viruses. The presence of infection with avian influenza viruses was ruled out. It is likely that the positive antibody result was due to previous exposure to low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Disease was not confirmed on the premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1291W.3/2">In April 2006, H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in a sample from the partially decomposed body of a swan found in Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland. Movement restrictions were put in place and a 2,500 sq km wild bird risk area was established. No further cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 where found, restrictions in the wild bird surveillance zone were lifted on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-01">1 May</phrase> and the wild bird risk area was ended.</p>
	<p pid="b.1291W.3/3">H7N3 low pathogenicity avian influenza was confirmed on three poultry farms near Dereham, Norfolk in late April 2006. A low pathogenic avian influenza restricted zone with a radius of 1km was imposed around the infected premises. Movement restrictions were served on the premises and the three flocks were culled. Surveillance and testing was carried out on all additional premises belonging to the owner of the infected premises.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.2/1">To help address the legacy of land contamination, the Government brought into force part IIA (&quot;contaminated land&quot;) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This places local authorities under a statutory duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act, and to secure its remediation, in accordance with the detailed provisions of the regime. They are required to take a strategic and prioritised approach to the duty of inspection. A local authority must designate contaminated land as a &quot;special site&quot; if it meets specific legal definitions. Where a local authority designates a site as a special site, the Environment Agency will become the enforcing authority for the site.

Assumptions for a long haul flight refer to a 5,000 km journey on a typical 450 seat capacity aircraft, with a 70 per cent. load factor. Assumptions for a short haul flight refer to a 500 km journey on a typical 128-seat capacity aircraft, with a 65 per cent. load factor.</p>

Work done for the Environment Agency suggested the figure could be as high as 94 per cent.

An estimate of the level of diversion will also be made and published at that time, taking account of the survey and other quantitative evidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313W.8/1">The Government examined the effects of metering in its review of water charging in 1997-99. The findings informed the development of the Water Industry Act 1999, which provides domestic customers with the option of a measured water bill or to remain on an unmeasured charging basis for water used only for normal household purposes in their present home.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313W.8/2">DEFRA is currently leading work on metering in the context of the Water Saving Group. This involves targeted action to increase metering in water stressed areas, and to improve the understanding and delivery of metering generally. As part of this work, DEFRA is assessing how the balance between company discretion and customer choice should be struck.</p>

In the south, authority and the rule of law have yet to be firmly established and, at present, insurgents, drug traffickers and a range of illegally armed groups all pose a threat to security, as they did in January 2006. As anticipated, there has been an increase in attacks in the south as the numbers and profile of NATO troops has increased with the deployment of forces for stage 3. We remain committed to the expansion of the international security assistance force (ISAF) across all of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1329W.2/3">Operational medical support required by UK troops deployed on operations is designed to be the most appropriate and robust to enable the commander to complete his mission. This is determined by a rigorous medical estimate of the military tasks to be undertaken. DMS manning requirements are regularly assessed with the aim of ensuring that we have sufficient medical staff to meet these key military requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.2/4">Manning levels in the DMS vary across different specialities and Services. In some areas we are very well manned, whilst in others we are experiencing shortfalls. However, there is no question of British forces being deployed on military operations without appropriate medical support. Manning shortfalls are being continually addressed through a package of remunerative and non-remunerative measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1329W.8/1">The UK is fully committed to its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, including those on disarmament under Article VI, and has made significant disarmament steps since 1992. For example, the UK has given up both the nuclear Lance missile and artillery roles we undertook previously with US nuclear weapons held under dual-key arrangements, along with our maritime tactical nuclear capability, so that Royal Navy surface ships no longer have any capability to carry or deploy nuclear weapons. In 1998, the UK withdrew and dismantled the last air-launched nuclear weapon, the Royal Air Force's WE117 nuclear bombs. The dismantlement of the last remaining Chevaline (Polaris) warheads occurred in April 2002, so that Trident is now our only nuclear weapons system;</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/2">In all, there has been a reduction of the UK's operationally available stockpile of nuclear weapons to fewer than 200 warheads, representing a reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. Only one Trident submarine is on deterrent patrol at any one time and that submarine is normally on several days 'notice to fire' and its missiles are not targeted at any specific country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/3">In addition, the UK announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and we continually press for negotiations to begin on a fissile material cut-off treaty at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. We have also been more transparent about our nuclear and fissile material stockpiles, publishing an historical account of plutonium stockpiles, along with an account of our highly enriched uranium earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/4">We are the only nuclear power that has so far been prepared to take such important steps on the route to nuclear disarmament.</p>

	<p pid="b.1331W.8/1">The United Kingdom Government would be prepared to use nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances of self-defence. We would not use our weapons, whether conventional or nuclear, contrary to international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.8/2">A policy of no first use of nuclear weapons would be incompatible with our and NATO's doctrine of deterrence. We have made clear, as have our NATO allies, that the circumstances in which any use of nuclear weapons might have to be contemplated are extremely remote. Our overall strategy is to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any aggressor about the exact nature of our response, and thus to maintain effective deterrence.</p>

The Ministry of Defence has no plans to change that policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.0/2">The armed forces occupational pension schemes pay death benefits regardless of whether the death was caused by service. This standard level of widows pension is not reduced by any common law compensation award.</p>

Where the cause of death was on or before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>, this would be by way of a War Widow's Pension under the War Pensions Scheme (WPS). This pension is paid in full. In addition, an enhanced rate of widows pension under the occupational pension scheme may be paid, which includes an element for loss of earnings and support. It is only this final element that may be affected by a common law compensation settlement, where that settlement also includes an element for loss of earnings and support.</p>

Because the AFCS benefits will normally be paid before any common law compensation settlement, arrangements are in place to reduce the common law compensation instead of seeking to claw back the AFCS benefit that would already be in payment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1343W.3/1">Valuable experience has been gained over the first year of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and overall the Cabinet Office is performing well and in line with other departments. It is, however, often necessary to extend the time for responding to a request where a qualified exemption applies to the information being sought and the public interest is engaged. The Cabinet Office is seeking to improve its performance wherever possible and this is reflected in the quarterly statistics published by the Department for Constitutional Affairs that show the 'in time' figure for the Cabinet Office rising from 80 per cent. in Q1 (January-March 2005) to 94 per cent. in Q4 (October-December 2005).</p>

	<p pid="b.1345W.0/1">On the <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>, I made an announcement, setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for 2006/07 and 2007/08. The main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years. In addition, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published 'Priorities for Success'&mdash;a document that sets out the funding strategy for the next two years in more detail. This document is available on the LSC's website. These clear messages develop priorities further outlined in my Department's Grant letters to the LSC for 2004-05 and 2005-06 and in the White Paper 'Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances' published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/2">Although more public funding will be going into the sector, we will focus funding even more strongly on key priorities of raising participation and achievement 14-19 and driving down the skills deficit in the adult workforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/3">I reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard the funding for Personal and Community Development Learning in mainstream Further Education and Local Authority funding adult education (Adult and Community Learning) with a budget of &pound;210 million in 2006/07, including family learning, family literacy, language and numeracy and neighbourhood learning in deprived communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/4">In addition in the White Paper 'Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances' we set out our intention to reinvigorate this type of learning to improve its planning, its quality and to gear it more to the needs of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/5">The Department allocates funds for the post-16 education and training sector to the' Learning and Skills Council (LSC) working through 47 local offices. As this is a matter for the Learning and Skills Council, Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, has written to the hon. Member with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/6" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/7" class="indent">Derbyshire Adult Learning Service's Funding Allocation 2006/07</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/8" class="indent">I am writing in response to the four Parliamentary Questions which you raised recently regarding the funding allocation made to Derbyshire County Council's Adult Learning Service (ALS) for 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/9" class="indent">Before answering the specific questions in detail, may I first assure you that the formula by which both the Further Education (FE) and the Personal and Community Development Learning (PCDL) budgets for Derbyshire ALS have been allocated has been consistently applied to all FE and ALS providers across the East Midlands region. Colleagues at Derbyshire ALS accept that this is the case. You will also be aware that whilst overall funding is increasing, resources to fund the FE sector are finite and priorities have to be set. In our allocations for 2006/07, we have therefore asked providers to concentrate core funding on four key priorities that make the biggest impact towards delivering the Government's Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/10" class="indent">These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/11" class="indent">Education and training for 16 to 18 year olds;</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/12" class="indent">Young people taking Apprenticeships;</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/13" class="indent">People who need to improve their basic skills of literacy and numeracy;</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/14" class="indent">People undertaking their first level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/15" class="indent">Learning and Skills Council National Office</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/16" class="indent">The Personal &amp; Community Development Learning (PCDL), including Family Learning and Family Literacy &amp; Numeracy funding allocation for 2005/06 is &pound;4.140 million (this comprises Adult &amp; Community Learning, Family Learning and Family Literacy &amp; Numeracy). The PCDL indicative allocation for 2006-07 is &pound;3.758 million. Whilst the PCDL budget for 06/07 has been safeguarded nationally at 05/06 rates (&pound;210 million) this obviously does not mean that each individual provider will receive the same allocation as in 05/06, particularly since &pound;33 million of this &pound;210 million is within FE colleges and not in Adult Learning Services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/17" class="indent">Derbyshire Adult Learning Service also receives FE funding. In 2005/06 the FE funding allocation is &pound;4.1 million, including &pound;230,000 for Additional Learner Support. The Indicative allocation for 2006/07 is &pound;3.516 million, including &pound;236,000 for Additional Learner Support. In addition, the LSC will be allocating &pound;582,000 growth funding for adult delivery within FE across Derbyshire and the Derbyshire Adult Learning Service, alongside the other deliverers of adult learning across the county, are able to bid for these funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/18" class="indent">In addition to these figures, the LSC is currently discussing with Derbyshire Adult Learning Service the possibility of additional transitionary funding for 2006/07 in order to help manage the impact of the reduced allocations. Furthermore, the LSC has also agreed to support the investment of &pound;405,000 to create a new Adult &amp; Community Education Centre in Bolsover in partnership with the Derbyshire Adult Learning Service, which is contributing &pound;255,000. In the last four years the LSC has also invested over &pound;4 million in capital improvements in the learning infrastructure for Derbyshire Adult Learning Service, including money to adapt community premises so that they are more accessible for disabled learners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/19" class="indent">As outlined above, it is too early to say how many courses and venues will form part of the offer from September 2006 for the 2006/07 academic year - the LSC is currently in dialogue with Derbyshire Adult Learning Service around funding allocations and the proposed mix and location of the adult learning offer for 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/20" class="indent">The following table shows the number of adult community education courses and venues from 1997 to 2005/06. The number of outreach centres increased significantly in 2003/04 owing to the development of several family learning centres, including those within school premises. However the reduction of external funding such as Single Regeneration and ESF budgets in 2004/05 saw a reduction in some outreach work that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/21" class="indent">In terms of 2006-07 and 2007-08, it is too early to say how many courses and venues will form part of the offer from September 2006; the LSC is currently in dialogue with Derbyshire Adult Learning Service around funding allocations and the proposed mix and location of the adult learning offer from September 2006. Although indicative funding allocations have been outlined to the Derbyshire Adult Learning Service, the published timescale for confirmation of final allocations is by the end of May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/22" class="indent">The funding allocations for the Derbyshire Adult Learning Service since 1997 are detailed below. Prior to 2000, Adult &amp; Community Learning allocations to the ALS were determined by the Local Education Authority and we have no details of these. The NDTC allocation relates to provision transferred to the Adult Learning Service when North Derbyshire Tertiary College was closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/23" class="indent">Areas of education and training outside these priority areas - such as part-time courses for adults that do not lead to basic skills or first level 2 qualifications - will inevitably feel the funding pressure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/24" class="indent">This dialogue will consider very carefully the impact of the reduced allocations on service delivery and will be reviewing what transitionary funding may be available to alleviate the same. As part of this review, the LSC will also consider the progress made byerbyshire Adult Learning Service in its ongoing efforts to review the relevance, appropriateness and fit with key government targets of its overall adult offer. This is in he context of significant increases in funding for adult learning across Derbyshire during the 2006-07 period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/25" class="indent">There will also be fee income opportunities which Derbyshire Adult Learning Service will want to pursue to reflect the appropriate balance of contributions between the individual and the state for some of this provision - such as part-time courses for adults that do not lead to basic skills or first level 2 qualifications - and in the light of the increasing fee assumption that will apply for 2006/07</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/26" class="indent">Unfortunately we do not hold information on the number of men and women attending adult courses broken down by parliamentary constituencies within Derbyshire. However, the number of learners accessing adult community education across the whole of Derbyshire in 2004/05 totalled 11,955, comprising 9,577 female learners and 2,378 male.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/27" class="indent">Clearly this is only part of the overall picture, with a further 87,247 adult learners funded via FE across Derbyshire, an additional 4,673 through work-based learning programmes, 6,584 through the Employer Training Pilot and a further 20,303 engaged on ESF-funded projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/28" class="indent">Naturally I am concerned about the impact of the 2006/07 allocation on Derbyshire's Adult Learning Service, and as I mentioned we will be looking to help ameliorate the effects via the provision of transitionary funding. Verity Bullough, the LSC's Regional Director for the East Midlands and Peter Brammall, Executive Director for Derbyshire, are meeting with colleagues from the ALS to discuss this issue more fully.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.0/29" class="indent">I trust that this answers the questions you raised in Parliament but if you require any further detail or explanation please do not hesitate to contact me again.</p>

	<p pid="b.1348W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/2">Our strategic priorities for adult learning outlined in Priorities for Success are to: support adults who lack basic skills or the platform of skills for employability; ensure a wide range of opportunities at Level 3; and, ensure the continued availability of a wide range of opportunities for personal and community development. Our investment in adult learning will remain broadly stable and focused on these key priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/3">The funding allocated by my Department for the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) major education and training programmes for adults for 2005-06 is &pound;2,851 million, an increase of &pound;183million or 7 per cent. on the comparable figure for 2004-05. My Department does not hold details of funding at local level. Mark Haysom, the LSC's Chief Executive has written to my hon. Friend with the information requested and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/4" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-19">19 May 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/5" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding the budget for adult further education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/6" class="indent">As requested please find attached data showing the movement between the academic years 2004-05 and 2005-06 for further education adult learning, broken down by local LSC area. I have also included data which shows the movement in funding for both youth learning and additional learning support, some of which will apply to adult learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/7" class="indent">These three elements comprise the totality of further education funding allocations which are made to further education colleges and other further education providers. These figures do not however include funding paid to these providers under other programmes which benefit adult learners, for example adult and community learning, and employer training pilots/train to gain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/8" class="indent">Each provider's funding allocation will have been determined individually in discussion with the provider concerned, taking account of the provider's performance data and the LSC's national, regional and local priorities. The differing levels of movement in funding allocations will be due to a number of factors, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/9" class="indent">Demographic changes creating greater demand for youth learning in the locality;</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/10" class="indent">Providers' prior performance, in terms of delivering both numbers of learners and the quality of the learning;</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/11" class="indent">Historic levels of adult learning and youth participation; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/12" class="indent">The type of learning being delivered, for example, whether it contributes towards Government priorities or supports learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/13" class="indent">Although funding for adult learning has decreased within further education, within the reduced total significantly more funding is now concentrated on priority adult learning. Further education providers should also now receive more funding from the collection of increased fees and from other funding streams, notably train to gain, subject to their ability to provide training which meets the needs of employers. In 2006-07 alone this new adult learning programme has a budget of 230 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.2/14" class="indent">I trust this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1350W.2/1">Our White Paper 'Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances' sets out a comprehensive programme of change that will transform our FE system and achieve its potential as a powerhouse of economic prosperity and social mobility. Its central purpose is to equip both young people and adults with the skills for productive and rewarding employment in a modern economy. In England we will continue to spend between &pound;2.8 billion and &pound;2.9 billion a year of taxpayers' money on support for adult learning. The broad volumes of publicly funded education and training will be maintained; however the balance will shift. We believe that it is right to focus help more on those who need it most, thatis, those without the basic skills or a full level 2 qualification needed if individuals are to become effective and fulfilled members of the work force, their families and local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/2">This does mean that those outside our priority areas may have to pay more for their courses. It does not mean that courses which are valued by learners and providers should close because public funding is reduced. The experience of many colleges, for example the City college, Brighton and Hove, is that it is possible to increase fees and the number of enrolments at the same time as providing safeguards for those adults on benefits. I would look to providers in other areas, including Bath, to follow these examples.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/3">In the White Paper 'Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances' we reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard funding for Personal and Community Development Learning with a budget of &pound;210 million in 2006/07, including family learning, family literacy, language and numeracy and neighbourhood learning in deprived communities. In addition we set out our intention to reinvigorate this type of learning to improve its planning, its quality and to gear it more to the needs of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/4">As to the specific questions of funding in each area, the Department allocates funds for the post-16 education and training sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) working through 47 local offices. As this is a matter for the Learning and Skills Council Mark Haysom, the council's chief executive, has written to the hon. Member with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/5" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/6" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding adult Education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/7" class="indent">Firstly, I provide a breakdown of the information you requested on adult education courses in Bath and North East Somerset (B&amp;NES) and the reallocation of funding priorities towards 16 to 19 year olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/8" class="indentitalic"> Personal and Community Development Learning (PCDL) allocations in B&amp;NES 2005/06 and 2006/07</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/9" class="indent">Adult and Community Learning (ACL) funding to B&amp;NES for 2005/6 was &pound;378,715. This can be broken down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/10" class="indent">In 2006/07 the decision has been taken nationally to protect FLLN&amp;WFL and NLDC activities by supporting them at 100% of the cash value for 2005/06 and to reduce the total budget available to PCDL and first steps' to approximately 90% of its 2005/06 cash value.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/11" class="indent">This approach has been applied to all providers receiving these funding streams throughout the South West region. It delivers the safeguards on these learning activities laid out in &quot;Priorities for Success&quot; (page 14, paragraph 50) and fully consumes the regional budget for these activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/12" class="indent">Total funding for B&amp;NES in 2006/07 is currently set at &pound;354,897 - please note that this figure is indicative at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/13" class="indent">Broken down into:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/14" class="indent">For comparison the four Unitary Authorities within the West of England LSC area received the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/15" class="indentitalic"> Further Education (FE) Allocations in BaNES</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/16" class="indent">FE funding information is shown for BaNES and then separately identified for City of Bath College and Norton Radstock College.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/17" class="indent">We have provided the funding levels for the adult budget for 2004/5, 2005/6 and 2006/07 but please note that 2006/07 is indicative at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/18" class="indent">The main reasons for the decrease in 2006/07 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/19" class="indent">a) Impact of &quot;Priorities for Success&quot; in that the LSC is no longer funding certain adult courses e.g. courses under nine hours and employer mandatory qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/20" class="indent">b) The amount of funding is decided upon a number of factors including historical levels of funding, the potential for providing priority provision i.e. Skills for Life and full level 2 qualifications, provider performance and of course affordability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/21" class="indent">c) The amounts of funding do vary by Unitary Authority, but this is to be expected as factors outlined in paragraph b) above, also vary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/22" class="indent">Secondly, you asked about the activity and funding allocated to adult education in Bath in each year since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/23" class="indent">Prior to the establishment of the LSC in 2001 funding for further education in England was provided by the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC).</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/24" class="indent">The FEFC allocated funding to a different cohort of providers using a different funding methodology to the LSC and therefore it is not possible for us to provide the information you require for adult education between 1997 and 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/25" class="indent">The funding of adult and community learning was passed to the LSC in 2002/03. Prior to that the planning and funding of this activity was subsumed within local authorities. It is therefore also not possible to supply you with the data you request for between 1997 and 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/26" class="indent">I attach therefore a breakdown of the information requested for the Bath and North East Somerset area from 2002/03 to 2006/07. The figures show the number of enrolments taken up, the number of distinct learners who accessed learning and the total funds earned. The figures for 2005/06 are an estimate based on current activity and the figures for 2006/07 are still under negotiation.</p>

In 10 of the 13 cases the individuals concerned had been assessed and, where necessary, additional information has been sought from the police. None of these 10 individuals is considered to pose a risk to children and no further action is now being taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.1353W.2/2">In the remaining three cases Sir Roger Singleton advised considering the possible barring of the individuals concerned. On the basis of the most recent information Sir Roger Singleton has advised that in two of the cases there is no reason to proceed further, and the cases are closed. One case has been reopened and additional information will enable us to consider whether this individual should be barred. Police know the whereabouts of this individual and have assured us that the individual is not working with children or in our schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1356W.2/1">It is for schools to determine what arrangements they make to staff classes when teachers may be out of the classroom having their planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) time. A number of options are available to them, including using other teachers and support staff (such as teaching assistants). We and the other signatories to the National Agreement on Raising Standards and Tackling Workload, believe that well-trained and experienced support staff (such as higher level teaching assistants), can, under the direction and supervision of a teacher, play a valuable role in taking whole classes, while teachers are undertaking PPA activities. However, we are absolutely clear that teachers and support staff are not interchangeable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356W.2/2">Where support staff do take whole classes, they will be able to help pupils progress with their learning, based on their knowledge of the learning outcomes planned by the classroom/subject teacher. We have made clear, through the regulations and guidance that we have published, that head teachers must satisfy themselves that support staff carrying out this role are suitably trained, and have the relevant skills, expertise and experience.</p>

	<p pid="b.1362W.14/1">There are a range of mechanisms in place for the Department to monitor payment of external consultants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.14/2">The Department has a number of contract managers and budget officers who are delegated the responsibility for monitoring the payment of external consultants and the cost-effectiveness of using consultants, both individually and across their budgets as a whole. In addition, the Department holds a set of consultancy framework agreements which are monitored both individually and centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.14/3">Contract managers and budget officers have access to web-based guidance and practical support on relevant Government policy and regulations and, specifically, on how to identify and establish the need for consultancy support, how to appoint a consultant and how to get the best from consultancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.14/4">Following a review in March 2005 on the engagement and use of consultants by the Department's internal audit division and the National Audit Office (NAO), a good practice guide was published by the NAO. This also forms a part of the Department's internal guidance on consultancy. A copy has already been placed in the House Library.</p>

The information released on these websites complies with the National Statistics Code of Practice and is objective and politically neutral. The political neutrality of data is guarded by the Department's chief statistician who reports to the Office for National Statistics on such matters. On the recommendation of the National Audit Office the Department has introduced template driven commentaries to ensure that information about local areas is accompanied by consistent and objective commentary that complies with the National Statistics Code of Practice. Additional steps have also been taken to make it clear to users of the information that the commentary accompanying statistics about local areas refers to the national picture.</p>

Customers include members of the public, academics, practitioners, local authorities, other front line organisations and other government departments. In this regard the Department is continually looking to improve its range of statistical products by reviewing the relevance, quality, timeliness, content and presentation of its statistical products. The content of much of the local information released to data has been developed in response to demand from customers and many of the statistics and geographies displayed are relevant to the information requirements and priorities of the Neighbourhood Statistics and Neighbourhood Renewal programmes.

The average redundancy was calculated by taking the greater cost for each individual of the Civil Service Compensation Scheme or four weeks salary for every year of service (actual sample of size of over 3,500 current staff), totalling these for each band and dividing by the number of cases in the sample.</p>

She made clear at the time of her statement that an expert panel would review all cases involving a sexual offence or allegation which resulted in a decision not to include on List 99, or which resulted in a restriction or partial bar. Sir Roger Singleton's panel, the membership of which she announced in her statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March</phrase>, will conduct a review of all cases resulting in a partial bar or restriction and will be reporting back in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369W.5/3">Broadly speaking there are three categories of behaviour which cover the 210 individuals on List 99 with restrictions on their employment; 204 are on the list on grounds of misconduct, which may relate to sexual or non sexual impropriety and 6 for health reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369W.5/4">I should add that under previous legislation an individual identified as a risk to a particular age group or gender could have a restriction imposed preventing them from working with that particular group, but not with others outside of that group. However, under current legislation (introduced in October 2000) if an individual is perceived to be a risk to children they are barred on the grounds of unsuitably.

	<p pid="b.1370W.5/5" class="indent">The LSC has always used socio-economic data, through snapshot reports for each LSC region and local area. These reports, which are at a set point in time limit how the data can be used and currently does not allow a direct interface with out large datasets, such as the Individualised Learner Record (ILR). The pilot was initiated by the increased interest of local LSCs, providers and policy makers in the use of postcode analysis as a means of better understanding educational markets. Mosaic software is one such tool that provides this detailed integration and analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/6" class="indentitalic"> Mosaic Pilot</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/7" class="indent">The Mosaic pilot project is being delivered by the Learning and Skills Network (LSN), previously the Learning and skills development Agency (LSDA) on behalf of the Learning and Skills Council. The project is trialling the use of the standard Mosaic UK package in adding value to analysis of learning and skills sector datasets, to help inform strategic planning. The research question being explored in this pilot project is;</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/8" class="indent">&quot;How can the application of the Mosaic UK postcode classification system assist understanding of patterns of post-16 participation, retention and achievement, so as to assist local LSC planning?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/9" class="indent">The project objectives that have been agreed are set out below:</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/10" class="indent">To link the time series data from the post-16 education sector with Mosaic UK thereby deriving a breakdown of postcodes according to their patterns of participation, retention and achievement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/11" class="indent">To develop a database that enables the national, regional and local profiles to be updated annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/12" class="indent">To pilot the use of Mosaic UK analysis with four local and one Regional LSC and consult on the provision of other information to provide more effective support for their respective remits, in particular those aspects relating to widening participation and raising achievement. The piloting exercise will involve support to Regional and local LSC staff from LSDA and Experian (the suppliers of Mosaic UK).</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/13" class="indent">For one local LSC already familiar with Mosaic UK, there is also an equivalent pilot exercise using Education Mosaic.</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/14" class="indentitalic"> Potential of Mosaic within the Sector</p>
	<p pid="b.1370W.5/15" class="indent">The application of Mosaic UK segments to learner databases, along with the development of detailed summary tables at the regional LSC level, should enable more useful intelligence to be available to providers. The potential of this work is especially promising for initiatives aimed at widening participation in a more focused and cost effective manner.</p>

	<p pid="b.1370W.5/17" class="indent">Detailed tables for each LSC area will be produced, alongwith a database that allows yearly updating with new LSC information. In addition a report will be produced on the impact of the analysis in the pilot LSCs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1372W.8/2">Following the recommendations of the SEU report on Young Runaways (2002), six development projects have tested how best to provide safe, flexible and responsive community-based services to young runaways that can be easily incorporated into mainstream children's services. We are currently analysing the evaluations from the projects in order to disseminate the lessons learned to local authorities.</p>

This project will run until 2008, and lessons from this will also be disseminated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372W.8/4">More widely, all local authorities have responsibilities to minimise and respond to 'missing from care' incidents as part of their wider duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their care. They are also required to appoint a senior manager to monitor missing from care incidents, so that local trends in children being absent from care can be identified and any necessary action to respond to these can be taken, to identify and address any patterns of young people going missing.</p>

Where it is not feasible to use low and zero carbon energy sources Part L requires an increased energy efficiency to deliver the same carbon target as would have resulted from 10 per cent. of the energy being provided by on-site renewable energy sources.

	<p pid="b.1384W.2/1">It is a matter for higher education institutions (HEIs) to consider how best they can minimise the adverse effects on students of the current dispute, including making contingency arrangements for examinations and other assessments. HEIs, as autonomous bodies, are responsible for determining their own academic and administrative affairs, including deciding what to pay their own staff. Pay and conditions of service are subject to negotiations between employers, their staff and their representative trade union bodies. The Government plays no part in this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1384W.2/2">While this is a matter for unions and employers, I am disappointed that this has come to industrial action and that students' progress is being threatened by this dispute.

	<p pid="b.1386W.10/1">Areas of Great Landscape Value are local designations established by local authorities. Government policy on such designations is set out in Planning Policy Statement 7 (PPS7) Sustainable Development in Rural Areas (2004). While recognising the value of local landscapes, the Government believe that carefully drafted criteria based policies in development plans provide sufficient protection for such areas without the need for rigid local designations that may unduly restrict acceptable sustainable development and economic activity that underpins the vitality of rural areas. Such designations should therefore only be maintained or, exceptionally extended, where it can clearly shown that criteria based policies cannot provide the necessary protection. PPS7 indicates that the Government expect planning authorities to consider rigorously the justification for retaining such designations when preparing local development documents, and to ensure that such designations are based on a formal and robust assessment of the qualities of the landscape concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.1387W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1387W.5/2">The estimates given in the statement were based on information from Land Use Change Statistics (LUCS). The latest LUCS show that in 2004 72 per cent. of new dwellings, including conversions, were built on brownfield land (technically known as 'previously-developed' land). Claims that two-thirds of new dwellings built on brownfield land are on gardens are contradicted by the statistics in LUCS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1387W.5/3">Of the dwellings built on brownfield land in 2004,22 per cent. were on land that was previously used for residential purposes (which includes buildings and the land associated with those buildings). This is 15 per cent. of all new dwellings built.</p>
	<p pid="b.1387W.5/4">There are no statistics on how much of this residential previously-developed land comprises the footprint of the previous homes on the site and how much is the surrounding area. Nor are there detailed statistics on what area of the land is covered by new buildings and what is surrounding open space and garden. It is therefore incorrect to suggest that even15 per cent. of new homes are built on gardens.</p>
	<p pid="b.1387W.5/5">LUCS are derived from information on individual sites recorded by Ordnance Survey during their map revision work and supplied to the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1387W.5/6">Information relating to the percentages of new dwellings, including conversions, built on all brownfield land and on land that was previously used for residential purposes is set out in the following table for 1986 onwards.</p>

Home Inspectors will need to be members of a certification scheme and to have professional indemnity insurance. We are currently discussing with industry and others the detail of how best to ensure that both sellers and buyers can action redress arrangements as quickly and simply as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1409W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.5/2">I take the recent increases in energy prices very seriously and the Government is very concerned about the impact on all sectors in the UK. In the past year global fossil fuel prices have increased and this has fed through to the UK. Over the past decade energy prices in the UK have been amongst the cheapest in the EU, but I do recognise the serious recent difficulties for all sectors. However, I remain optimistic about investment by local authorities in sports facilities, which will amount to some &pound;1 billion over the next 3 years. In addition, since 1997 Government and lottery distributing bodies between them have invested over&pound;3 billion in physical activity and sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.5/3">The DTI and Ofgem have been holding a number of seminars to educate energy buyers of all types about the options for purchasing gas and electricity in these times of high prices. In addition, Energywatch has set up a Business Services Team to provide information and guidance to small and medium sized enterprises, and runs a joint campaign with the Federation for Small Businesses called &quot;Make the Connection&quot;. For the public sector, the Office for Government Commerce has been developing advice and models for energy purchasing for both local authorities and central government, and these are being rolled out nationally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1410W.6/2">My Department's sponsored bodies and agencies, in common with those across Government, are made fully aware of the need to assess the possible effects of changes in policy on businesses in their sectors. This includes formal Regulatory Impact Assessments where appropriate, as well as wider cross-Government work on Better Regulation. The tourism sector is also represented on my Department's Better Regulations Task Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.6/3">The Quality Assurance Schemes operated by VisitBritain, the Automobile Association, VisitScotland, and the Wales Tourist Board, are voluntary in nature. Participating businesses pay to be quality inspected, and derive marketing and other benefits from inclusion in the Schemes. The Schemes have, from May 2005, been improved and standardised following work commissioned by VisitBritain and led by Alan Britten CBE. Both inbound and domestic visitors now have confidence in a standardised inspection regime across Britain. This has led to some changes in classification as it affects the descriptions used by hotels and guest houses in their own signage and promotional material.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.6/4">The changes to the Quality Schemes followed wide industry consultation, and assessments of the cost and benefits to affected businesses. My Department is satisfied that the consultation carried out was more than adequate to reflect the views of affected businesses. The general consensus across the industry was that the changes in classification were highly beneficial in terms of improved consumer certainty when booking accommodation. In addition, my Department considers that the resulting changes to the VisitBritain Quality Scheme (which is funded through grant-in-aid) were primarily operational in nature. It was not, therefore, considered necessary to conduct a formal Regulatory Impact Assessment in these circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1413W.3/1">The Government have been in the forefront of international efforts to strengthen the regulation of the arms trade and to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We were instrumental in securing an EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, and are leading the way towards revision of the code, and we regularly urge other countries to adopt stricter and more transparent arms export policies. We are active members of all the key multilateral regimes that work to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the Australia Group (which deals with chemical and biological weapons), and of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which promotes transparency in conventional arms transfers. The UK is also a member of key arms control treaties, such as the Ottawa Convention on Landmines, the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.1413W.3/2">The Review Conference of the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) is to be held this June, and the UK, in co-operation with a wide range of other partners, has made positive progress in building support for agreement there to minimum common criteria to underpin controls on transfers of SALW.</p>
	<p pid="b.1413W.3/3">The Government are committed to pursuing an international arms trade treaty that includes all conventional arms. We believe that such a treaty needs to include a wide range of signatories, including the world's major arms exporters. We are engaging on this with other countries at various levels, including through ministerial contacts, specific events, direct expert-level talks and using our network of overseas posts. This work will continue with the aim of building the consensus needed for the start of a formal process at the UN later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1417W.6/1">The Government have been participating in the UN Working Group elaborating a draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples for the past 11 years. It is likely that the international community will seek action on this text at the first session of the new Human Rights Council in June 2006. The UK had a number of concerns with the original draft of the Declaration, including on the issue of collective rights, but have participated fully in negotiations and worked with partners to seek solutions to the real and difficult issues in the text for both states and indigenous peoples. We believe that the concerns of parties on both sides of this debate have now been accommodated in the draft Declaration. If the Declaration is put forward for adoption at the forthcoming session of the Council, the UK will support it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1418W.8/1">The United Nations Security Council reaffirmed in Resolution 1540 that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as their means of delivery constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East would be deeply damaging for stability and security in the region and beyond, and for the multilateral non-proliferation system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1418W.8/2">We have serious concerns about the nature of Iran's nuclear activities, its history of concealment and inadequate co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and its failure to take the steps that the IAEA Board and the Security Council have deemed essential. These have all contributed to the international community's lack of confidence that the aims of the Iranian nuclear programme are, as Iran claims, exclusively peaceful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1418W.8/3">These concerns are only heightened by Iran's ballistic missile programme, threatening rhetoric towards Israel, and its links to Lebanese Hizballah and Palestinian rejectionist groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1418W.8/4">We are working, with our partners, to ensure that Iran meets in full the requirements of the IAEA Board and the Security Council, including reinstating a full suspension of all enrichment related and reprocessing activities, and returns to a negotiation on long-term arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1421W.2/1">We welcome the important democratic changes that the Government of the Maldives have already introduced, including the legalisation of political parties in June 2005 and a recently published 'Roadmap' for reform, which usefully set out some clear timescales. But we remain concerned about the pace of this and about the human rights situation in the Maldives, including freedom of expression and association and the right to fair trials conducted with due legal process. Some recent trials of political activists appear to have political motivations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1421W.2/2">We monitor developments in the Maldives closely, regularly making clear both bilaterally (most recently Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials met the Maldivian Minister of State on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase>) and with EU partners to the Government of the Maldives, the need for progress with existing reforms and concerns about the need for further reform and improved human rights. We also maintain regular contact with the opposition parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.1421W.2/3">Agreement on, and implementation of, further major democratic and constitutional changes will require an inclusive process reflecting the views of political parties, civil society and the general public in the Maldives.

	<p pid="b.1421W.8/1">The UK has had regular discussions with the Nepalese Government at all levels on human rights, including with the King after he took direct power of the country last year. We have also made repeated public statements deploring human rights violations by both the Nepalese security forces and the Maoists. Most recently, senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials met the Nepalese ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March</phrase> and raised our concerns about the continued detention of political leaders and activists, and the restrictions on the media. We also registered our ongoing concerns about the democratic deficit in Nepal with the absence of consultations between the parties for a full return to democracy, including through elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1421W.8/2">In October 2005, as EU Presidency, the UK led an EU directors level Troika delegation to Nepal. The aim of the Troika visit was to encourage reconciliation and dialogue between the King and the political parties. They discussed human rights and the return to democracy with both the Government of Nepal and the political party leaders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1421W.8/3">We have had several discussions with the Government of Nepal including the King, calling on them to restore democracy and pursue a negotiated political settlement to the conflict involving all of the main actors. In February 2006 a parliamentary delegation led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> visited Nepal and called on party leaders and government officials to discuss the return of democracy in Nepal. The aim of the visit was to support the democratic movement and encourage the return of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1421W.8/4">Following three weeks of violent pro democracy demonstrations the King announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April</phrase>, that he will hand power to the parties and reinstate the Parliament. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April 2006</phrase> the first session of the reinstated Parliament took place. We welcome the King's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April</phrase> and the appointment of the new Prime Minister, G. P. Koirala. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April</phrase> G. P. Koirala was sworn in to office and the Parliament agreed his proposals to reciprocate the Maoist cease-fire and for a constituent assembly. This represents a genuine opportunity for the restoration of peace, democracy and human rights in Nepal. The UK stands ready, with international partners, to work with the new government and the people of Nepal.</p>

We set out our well-known opposition to the use of the death penalty and urged the DPRK not to apply it if it was in question in Mr. Son's case. We are deeply concerned about reports of serious human rights violations, in the DPRK, but the lack of access for independent monitors makes it difficult to verify these reports.</p>

	<p pid="b.1429W.9/2">This assumes a flat rate of tax on earnings only but that the rates for savings and dividends income remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="b.1429W.9/3">This revenue neutral estimate has been obtained from the Survey of Personal incomes 2003-04 and projected forward to 2005-06 and 2006-07 in line with March 2006 Budget assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1429W.9/4">The revenue neutral estimate excludes any behavioural response to the tax changes, which could be significant given the scale of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1429W.9/5">An estimated 17 million households would lose out under this system, while only 2 million would gain. Of the households gaining, around three-quarters would be in the richest 10 per cent. of households.</p>

	<p pid="b.1435W.0/1">Under reforms to the public spending framework introduced in 2000 the UK Government are one of the few in the world that has a statutory obligation to report liabilities in the same way as private companies, and whose accounts are subject to independent audit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.0/2">Contingent liabilities, such as those referred to in the question, are reported in departmental accounts on the same basis as UKGAAP, as well as to Parliament. They are defined as being contingent on an event, or a set of events, whose likelihood of occurring has been accepted by independent auditors as being remote. They are not, by their definition, actual liabilities, and so it would not be right to include them in measures of public sector net debt.</p>

	<p pid="b.1441W.3/1">The following table is an extension of table 4.3 in Tax credits: reforming financial support for families (March 2005).</p>
	<p pid="b.1441W.3/2">Figures for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 system of taxes and benefits are consistent with the analysis presented in Table 4.2 of the 2005 pre Budget report and 2006 Budget report separately.</p>
	<p pid="b.1441W.3/3">Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for heads of working households in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week, where the head of the household is not disabled, and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of tax credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1441W.3/4">This analysis does not take into account the way in which tax credits respond to rises in income. Since April 2006, tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &pound;25,000, disregarding the first &pound;25,000 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1441W.3/5">As a result of the Government's reforms, around half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children.</p>

	<p pid="b.1450W.8/2" class="italic"> Nuclear Generators</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/3">British Nuclear Fuels' annual report and accounts state that decommissioning expenditure charged against provisions since financial year 1993-94 was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/4">Prior to this date no decommissioning expenditure charged against provisions was disclosed in BNFL's annual report and accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/5">Between 1994-95 and 2000-01 the cost of decommissioning UKAEA's nuclear power plants amounted to &pound;119.3 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1450W.8/8">The DTI-UKOOA Activity Survey conducted in autumn 2005 indicates gross (pre-tax) annual spend on decommissioning costs related to offshore oil andgas production activities as follows. All figures are in&pound; billion in constant 2005 prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/9">The actual extent of decommissioning costs and the timing of decommissioning of individual fields is inherently uncertain and these figures can at best be only broadly indicative.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/10" class="italic"> Renewables Generators</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/11">For offshore renewables I understand that no decommissioning of major, commercial-scale installations is expected in the next 10 years, so costs would be limited to any decommissioning of small-scale demonstration devices that takes place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/12">For onshore wind farms, we do include for decommissioning in our consents. This currently works out at between &pound;3,500 and &pound;5,000 per turbine depending on the status of the land.</p>

These interviews are recorded for quality monitoring purposes and claimant's solicitors receive a copy of the interview if so requested.

This programme takes over from the Clear Skies and Major photovoltaics programmes, which finished in March 2006. The LCBP initially had &pound;30 million to allocate&mdash;&pound;1.5 million was used to ease the transition from the previous programmes and the remaining &pound;28.5 million is dedicated to projects proposed by householders, communities and businesses.

The TPS scheme provides protection to consumers from cold-calling if they have previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or have been registered with the TPS for at least 28 days. Those making cold calls from within the UK or on behalf of UK companies from outside the European Union are legally required not to call a number that has registered on the TPS list. However, cold calls from non-UK companies marketing a service or product are not covered by the TSP scheme, as the companies and products have no link with the UK. The Information Commissioner has responsibility for the enforcement of the TPS scheme and considers complaints about breaches.</p>

	<p pid="b.1465W.6/1">DTI provided guidance in 2004 to LACORS, which coordinates advice to the regulatory services of local authorities, on the use of switchable metric/imperial weighing machines. There is no other relevant guidance from Government specifically directed to local authority trading standards services, but DTI has issued more general guidance to the public and private sectors on the use of metric units.</p>

	<p pid="b.1466W.2/1">The Government have been and remain fully committed to securing an ambitious, pro-development outcome to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). In support of this objective, and to press the case for an agreement that facilitates world trade and meets the needs of developing nations, my predecessors were in regular contact with the EU Trade Commissioner, their counterparts in other EU member states, with the Director General of the WTO and with the Trade Ministers of other WTO member countries. They also remained in regular contact with business, NGOs and other interested parties in the UK and internationally, in order to help build a consensus of support for an ambitious outcome to the round. I expect to do the same.</p>
