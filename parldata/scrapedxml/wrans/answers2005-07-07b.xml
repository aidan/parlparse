	<p pid="b.551W.3/1">The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) was set up in 2001 to improve the UK's resilience against disruptive challenges, working in partnership with others at the national, regional and local levels to enhance arrangements for anticipating, assessing, preventing, preparing for, responding to and recovering from all types of disruptive challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.551W.3/2">The CCS drives the delivery of improved resilience across the government and the public sector by making sure that the Government can continue to function and deliver public services during a crisis. It achieves this through risk assessment and horizon-scanning activity to identify and assess potential and imminent disruptive challenges to the domestic UK, and by working with others to improve the capability of all levels of government, the wider public sector and the private and voluntary sectors to manage potential challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.551W.3/3">A key focus of the CCS's work over the last year has been the Civil Contingencies Act which received Royal Assent in November 2004. The Act and supporting regulations, guidance and non-legislative measures will deliver a single framework for civil protection in the United Kingdom. Part 1 of the Act establishes a clear set of roles and responsibilities for organisations with a role in emergency planning and response at the local level. As enabling legislation, this part of the Act is heavily reliant on supporting regulations and guidance, which are currently under development. Part 2 of the Act modernises the United Kingdom's emergency powers framework and is already in force.</p>

	<p pid="b.568W.2/1">As set out in the &quot;pathfinders prospectus&quot; published in March 2005, a copy of which has been made available in the Library of the House, the overall aim of the rural delivery pathfinders is to explore and test opportunities for more joined up, flexible and effective approaches to rural delivery at a local level. This includes innovation in rural development and delivery of services in rural areas, and better prioritisation of existing resources, in line with local priorities, towards areas, communities and people with the greatest needs. The prospectus sets out in more detail the overarching framework within which all pathfinders, including the one in the Peak District Rural Action Zone, are operating.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/2">In the Peak District RAZ pathfinder, the focus is on access to services with particular emphasis on access to support a sustainable rural economy and community regeneration. Local priorities for action include affordable housing, sustainable tourism, promoting local distinctiveness, learning and skills, and enhancing and sustaining a high quality environment. More detail can be found in the outline business plan published at the pathfinders launch on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March 2005</phrase> (and to be found at <a href="http://wwwdefra.gov.uk/rural/ruraldelivery/pathfinders/default.htm">http://wwwdefra.gov.uk/rural/ruraldelivery/pathfinders/default.htm</a>)</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/3">From the outset the pathfinder has aimed for an inclusive approach; the cross-border nature of the area makes this imperative. The steering group formed to oversee the preparatory work for the pathfinder involves two Local Strategic Partnerships (Derbyshire and Staffordshire), six local authorities, a National Park Authority, a sub-regional Strategic Partnership, the voluntary and community sector, representation from the Natural England confederation, a Rural Community Council, a Government Office and RDA. further linkages are being developed with other partners within the East and West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/4">The pathfinders represent a key element of DEFRA's agenda to ensure that decisions on service delivery can be taken closer to the customer. We have allowed local areas to set the agenda for what they tackle. This is critical because we are embarked on a radical process of improving the way in which we support rural delivery, as outlined in Rural Strategy 2004. The pathfinders provide us and our delivery partners with an opportunity to recognise and respond to difficulties and opportunities and better meet rural needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.581W.2/2">These conditions are all very closely related and represent one of the most important conditions in the United Kingdom and one of the commonest reasons for admission to hospital. The principle cause is smoking. The national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease already has a reduction in cigarette smoking as one of its major targets. We have also banned tobacco advertising and made smoking reduction aids available on national health service prescription. Less important contributory factors are atmospheric pollution and recurrent chest infections.</p>
	<p pid="b.581W.2/3">Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts have all received the NSF for long-term conditions. While the NSF is principally concerned with improving health and social care services for people with a long-term neurological condition, it will address some of the generic issues that are important to people living with a disability that is not necessarily neurological in origin. The principles in the NSF apply equally to improving quality of life and promoting independent living for anyone living with a long-term condition.</p>

	<p pid="b.582W.3/2">The proposed change in the status of NHS Direct is a natural progression of its development to provide and develop responsive health information and advice to the public. It is part of the wider review of arm's length bodies (ALBs) by the Department, which was published in July 2004 by the then Secretary of State for Health. The review set out an overall strategy to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ALB sector, resulting in a reduction in their number. In the ALB review, a commitment was made to work with NHS Direct to change its governance arrangements.</p>

The Government believe this is a proportionate measure, a view shared by the Joint Committee on Human Rights who, in their report on the proposed measures published in March 2005, accepted the existence of a serious, albeit limited, problem of incitement to hatred on religious grounds.

Following the report of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House on &quot;Connecting Parliament with the Public&quot; last year, the House of Commons Commission agreed to a significant expansion of the services of the Parliamentary Education Unit. Two Communications and Outreach Officers have now been appointed in order to further promote the work of Parliament in schools and through local education authorities. Two additional Visits Officers will be recruited shortly to increase the range and number of visits programmes available to schools wanting to visit Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.593W.0/1">The draft EU Directive on Services in the Internal Market is currently under negotiation in both the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The Government see this dossier as a priority and wishes to progress negotiations during their Presidency of the Council of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/2" class="italic">Barriers to trade</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/3">Since the publication of the Commission's proposal in 2004, the Government have been identifying areas of regulation to which the Directive would apply and those which might be considered to constitute a barrier to trade of services. Although this work is ongoing its current status is reflected in the partial Regulatory Impact Assessment published on the DTI's website <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics2/pdf2/servicesria/pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics2/pdf2/servicesria/pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/4"><i>Definition of remote provision of</i> services</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/5">The Directive does not define &quot;remote&quot; provision of a service, however, the Treaty itself does make clear the freedom to provide services applies both to a situation where a provider physically moves to another member state and where he remains in a member state and provides his service cross-border. Remote provision of a service then is where the provider remains in one member state while providing his service to a recipient in another member state; it would include services provided over the internet or telephone and also mail order services.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/6">Definition of Services of General Economic Interest and Services of General Interest. The term &quot;Services of General Interest&quot; is not found in the Treaty (which only refers to services of general economic interest), but it is often used to mean both economic services and non-economic services in which there is a public service element. While the term &quot;Service of General Economic Interest&quot; is referred to in the EC Treaty it is not defined. The Services Directive only covers economic services where there is economic consideration provided by or on behalf of the recipient.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/7" class="italic">Process for justifying regulation in the public interest</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/8">The Directive obliges member states to report on their authorisation schemes. They will have to justify their schemes as being non-discriminatory, based on a strong public interest reason, and proportionate. The reports will go to the Commission and to other member states. There will be a peer review of member states' regulations. Following that the Commission will prepare a summary report.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/9">What is a strong public interest reason? The Directive refers to</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/10" class="indent">&quot;overriding reasons relating to the public interest&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/11">these are strong reasons recognised by the European Court of Justice, and its definition has been, and may continue to be, developed by the ECJ. The protection of workers and protection of consumers are two reasons that have been recognised by the ECJ as constituting overriding reasons relating to the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/12" class="italic">Public and private sector services</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/13">Only services which are economic in nature are covered by the Services Directive. Economic services in this sense can be provided by either the private or public sectors. Many public sector services are not economic in nature, for example, the ECJ held there was no economic consideration in relation to state education which is therefore not economic in nature. The Directive does not apply the country of origin principle to certain services which in some countries will be provided by the public sector, namely, gas, electricity, post and water services.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/14" class="italic">Definition of temporary</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/15">The Directive does not have a definition of &quot;temporary&quot;, which is also the case for a number of other European Directives; instead it uses the case-law of the European Court of Justice to define &quot;establishment&quot; as</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/16" class="indent">&quot;the actual pursuit of an economic activity, as referred to in Article 43 of the Treaty, through a fixed establishment of the provider for an indefinite period&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/17">Whether a provider is temporary or not defends on looking at the circumstances of each case. The ECJ has said that the criteria to be applied to this assessment are not limited to the duration of the provision of services, but should also include its regularity, periodical nature and continuity.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/18" class="italic">Service sectors excluded from the Directive</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.0/19">The service sectors that are excluded from the scope of the Directive are listed in Article 2. The country of origin principle has derogations listed in Article 17 for specific service sectors, namely, postal services and the distribution of electricity, gas and water.</p>

	<p pid="b.598W.5/1">The Highway Code and road traffic law apply to cyclists as much as to anyone else. It is common knowledge among road users that there is a requirement to stop at red traffic lights. The Department has run frequent publicity campaigns educating cyclists to cycle safely and one third of children receive some form of cycle training, which teaches the rules of the road.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.5/2">It is an offence under section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to fail to comply with a traffic sign and the maximum fine is &pound;1,000. The police can also prosecute cyclists who ride carelessly or dangerously and these offences carry maximum fines of &pound;1,000 and &pound;2,500 respectively. Enforcement of the law is a matter for the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.5/3">We disapprove strongly of the behaviour of those cyclists who ride through red lights. It is a danger to others, who might be vulnerable pedestrians such as the elderly or children, and it brings cycling into disrepute with other road users.</p>

	<p pid="b.601W.3/1">New measures are not necessary. It is for the courts to provide an authoritative interpretation of the law, but the Department's view is that it is already illegal to use vehicles which are not compliant with road traffic law on public highways. Powered vehicles (whether internal combustion or electric) are motor vehicles within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1988 as amended. Any powered vehicle used on the public highway must comply with all aspects of road traffic law, including construction requirements, registration, road tax, insurance etc. The rider/driver should hold an appropriate licence and, where required, wear a suitable helmet.</p>
	<p pid="b.601W.3/2">Enforcement is a matter for individual Chief Officers of Police. Powers under the Police Reform Act 2002 allow a constable in uniform, after giving a warning, to stop and seize a motor vehicle if he/she has grounds for believing that it is being used in a careless and inconsiderate manner, or being driven illegally off-road, or being used (or is likely to be used) in an antisocial manner causing harassment, alarm or distress.</p>
	<p pid="b.601W.3/3">I understand that that the packaging on powered items such as miniature motorcycles generally includes a warning that they are not for highway use. However it may be that, once such packaging is discarded, this is overlooked or ignored. My Department is working with the Home Office to consider how advice reminding purchasers and others of this issue might usefully be disseminated.</p>

Current and historic duty rates for all road fuels are published on the website of HM Revenue and Customs. The current duty rates for biofuels and road fuel gases are as set out in table 1.</p>

	<p pid="b.612W.11/1">Transport in London is primarily the responsibility of the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL). In October 2004, TfL published a five year, &pound;10 billion investment programme designed to delivery infrastructure improvements through to 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.11/2">For Kent and Surrey, the county councils and the unitary authority for the Medway area assessed local transport infrastructure needs in the Local Transport Plans (LTPs) that they produced in 2000. Over the past five years, the Department has allocated &pound;150 million for expenditure in Kent and &pound;124 million for Surrey to support delivery of local schemes. These figures cover local authority capital expenditure on major projects (costing over &pound;5 million) and on programmes of smaller schemes, but they exclude expenditure on rail schemes and on Highways Agency schemes on its motorway and trunk road network.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.11/3">Local transport authorities outside London are due to submit new provisional LTPs, covering the 2006&ndash;2011 period, to the department by the end of July 2005, with final versions following by the end of March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.613W.2/1">The Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science estimated that, in 2004, there were some 0.5m vehicles in use that, while taxed, were not registered to their current keepers. DVLA's own database of vehicles for which there is no current keeper contains some 2.9m records, both taxed and untaxed. Whilst the majority of these vehicles will no longer be on the road (but DVLA has not been notified that they have been scrapped), DVLA makes the database available to police forces for use in conjunction with their Automatic Number Plate Reader system.</p>

Therefore, it would not be meaningful to base the costs of financing the Government's borrowing needs on Eurozone interest rates. In particular, the UK economy is growing more rapidly than the Eurozone and is, therefore, at a different point in the interest rate cycle. It would also be misleading to compare debt-servicing costs based on financing borrowing through 10-year bonds only because this would not take account of the range of maturities and yields at which governments issue bonds.</p>

	<p pid="b.619W.2/1">Poverty and social exclusion are complex and multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives&mdash;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of their environment and not just low income. The Department for Work and Pensions &quot;Opportunity for all&quot; report sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and reports progress against a range of measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.2/2">However, 2003&ndash;04 data show nearly 2 million pensioners have been lifted out of absolute low income since 1997. Compared with the 1997 system, in 2005&ndash;06, as a result of the Government's measures including the pension credit, pensioner households will be on average &pound;29 a week better off while the poorest third of pensioner households will be on average &pound;39 a week better off.</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.2/3">Alongside a 7 per cent. real increase in the basic state pension, winter fuel payments and free television licences, pension credit has been key to this increase in income. Pension credit which now pays over &pound;6 billion a year to our poorest pensioners, guaranteeing a minimum income of &pound;109.45 a week for single pensioners and &pound;167.05 couples (over age 60). 2.7 million pensioner households (3.3 million individuals) were receiving pension credit at end March 2005. The Government are committed to increasing the guarantee credit element of pension credit by earnings next year and in the next spending round 2006&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="b.623W.12/1">In the last year a small number of letters from charitable organisations and hon. Members have been received by Treasury Ministers about the VAT zero rate for the construction of certain charity buildings. Zero-rating applies to the construction and sale of new buildings intended to be used by charities solely for a qualifying purpose. This qualifying purpose must be either use for non-business purposes or use as a village hall or similar.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.12/2">If the building is put to a non-qualifying use within 10 years of completion of the building, the VAT originally saved must be repaid to HM Revenue and Customs. However, the full amount of VAT saved will only be repayable if the use changes in the first year following completion. Otherwise, the VAT repayable is adjusted according to the number of complete years of qualifying use that have elapsed.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.12/3">As a concession, minor non-qualifying use of a building can be disregarded.</p>
