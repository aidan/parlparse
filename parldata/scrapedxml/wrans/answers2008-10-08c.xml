	<p pid="c.611W.3/1">Ministers and officials in the Department for Work and Pensions have met and received representations on numerous occasions in the last five years from a wide range of stakeholders on insurance and liability arrangements with regard to asbestos-related deaths and ill health due to industrial activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/2">Among the changes made as a result of these representations the Government provided more information and guidance to claimants and practitioners. More precisely, we published improved guidance on mesothelioma explaining the help available and where to find it, we provided best practice advice to industrial injuries disablement benefits claims handlers and we undertook public awareness activity to encourage claimants to use qualified, experienced legal practitioners when making a claim.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/3">We also introduced standardised approaches to claiming civil damages by introducing a Standard Claim Letter. To facilitate the speeding up of payment of claims to people with mesothelioma, changes were introduced in the Compensation Act 2006 to enable defendant employers/insurers to claim money back from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/4">We have worked extensively with partners. We have conducted annual reviews of the Code of Practice for tracing Employers' Liability Insurance policies to ensure the Code is comprehensive and has user confidence. HM Revenue and Customs now trace employer records for people with mesothelioma within 10 working days (previously 25-30 days). The Association of British Insurers (ABI ) has issued a claims handling best practice guide within the industry, and has introduced a Code of Practice phone enquiries helpline and issued guidance on getting the best out of the Code. Working with the Department for Business, we have now removed the need to resurrect insolvent companies in order to access ELCI policies, and working with the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, we have helped make it easier for them to compensate people with mesothelioma more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/5">We have introduced a new scheme for making payments to people with diffuse mesothelioma. The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 introduced a lump-sum payment scheme for people with diffuse mesothelioma who can receive a payment of an average of &pound;10,000 within 6 weeks of claiming (the payment is recovered if any subsequent civil damages are awarded). The scheme started on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/6">We have reduced the compliance costs of regulations relating to the display of Employers' Liability Compulsory Insurance certificates. The Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 (which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>) allowed companies to display certificates electronically when employees have reasonable access to the certificate in that form, and removed the requirement for employers to retain certificates for 40 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/7">We have asked questions about the possible reform of the current Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB) scheme in the consultation document, &quot;No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility&quot;. The consultation asks questions on IIDB: How might we reform Bereavement Benefit and IIDB to provide better support to help people adjust to their new circumstances while maintaining the work focus of the modern welfare state? Are lump sum payments a good way of meeting people's needs? Do they give people more choice and control? Could we make more use of them? The consultation ends on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-22">22 October 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/8">We continue to have discussions with insurers, employers, trades unions, lawyers and other interested parties.</p>

	<p pid="c.612W.5/45" class="indent">Over the last few months increases in the number of births in the general population have led through to an increase in Maternity Allowance applications by a fifth. This increase coincided with centralisation into the four units and a temporary dip in productivity associated with retraining existing members of staff. This has led to a backlog of around 7000 claims.</p>
	<p pid="c.612W.5/46" class="indent">We are responding to these difficulties by increasing the staffing in the centralised sites by a fifth, so they can cope with the increase in new applications. The 7000 backlog cases are being dealt with separately by sharing the cases across our wider network of Benefit Delivery Centres. We are making progress now on clearing these cases. This action has seen immediate improvements in clearance numbers and we expect to have fully cleared the backlog by this autumn.</p>

	<p pid="c.634W.3/2">We are aware of recent reports of forced returns of Karen refugees from Thailand. Our embassy in Bangkok frequently raises refugee welfare issues with the Royal Thai government. Recent discussions have covered the need for measures to mitigate the impact of the increase in the price of rice, refugees' access to jobs and education and the impact of Cyclone Nargis on the camps.</p>
	<p pid="c.634W.3/3">The Government have increased support for Burmese refugees in Thailand. It has recently allocated a further &pound;1 million to the Thailand Burma Border Consortium for its work supporting Burmese refugees in Thailand and internally displaced persons inside Burma. In 2007-08, the Department for International Development provided &pound;400,000 for assistance to internally displaced persons through community-based organisations inside Burma. This reached more than 100,000 displaced persons, mostly in Karen communities, living near Burma's border with Thailand.</p>
	<p pid="c.634W.3/4">The UK condemns the continuing human rights abuses and the political, social and economic restrictions from which the ethnic groups of Burma&mdash;including the Karen group&mdash;have suffered under the current regime. Acceptable agreement for the ethnic nationalities is key to a durable solution to Burma's problems. We continue to bring reports of human rights abuses to the attention of the international community, the UN and the UN Human Rights Council.</p>

	<p pid="c.634W.6/2">We are aware that The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) is in discussion with its counterparts in China about conservation collaboration, of which the proposed loan of pandas is only one element. At the request of the Scottish Executive, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised this with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi when he visited China in February. The Government regard this primarily as an arrangement between the RZSS and the Chinese authorities, but are supportive of the underlying objective of promoting collaboration in the area of animal conservation.</p>

	<p pid="c.639W.3/1">Under the MOD single food supply contract, 100 per cent. of pork and gammon, and 55 per cent. of beef is sourced from the UK. Of the poultry requirement, up to 15 per cent. is sourced from the UK, although 100 per cent. of turkeys are British, and an initiative has been launched to increase the number of British chickens procured. Recently the amount of British lamb procured has increased from 9 per cent. to 19 per cent., and the MOD continues to look for opportunities to increase this further while still achieving best value for money. Figures for food procured under the Pay as You Dine project, which now accounts for more than 50 per cent. of troops fed, are not held centrally, although these contractors are also required, wherever competitive, to give full consideration to procuring British products.</p>

Nottinghamshire has in total received &pound;786,621 from the Restoration Fund.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-08c.221886.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-08c.645W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="645W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/text/81008w0007.htm#081008117007527">
	<p pid="c.645W.0/1">Universities are required to pay a minimum bursary to all students receiving the maximum maintenance grant. Most institutions are offering more than the minimum. The typical bursary in 2008-09 is around &pound;1,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.0/2">The great majority of those entitled to bursaries are either applying to their university for funding, or are the subject of an automatic notification of eligibility from the Student Loans Company to their university because they had given consent to the sharing of financial data.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.0/3">To further improve take-up, Department officials have worked closely with the Student Loans Company and other stakeholders to improve the bursary consent arrangements on the 2008-09 student finance application form.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.0/4">The introduction of an 'opt out' clause, giving both the student and their sponsor an opportunity to opt out of consenting to their personal information being shared with universities for bursary purposes, is expected to increase the numbers of students assessed for and receiving bursaries. Clear guidance states that a decision to opt out of sharing data with universities does not affect entitlement to other forms of support.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.0/5">Promotional materials have been issued to raise awareness of the availability of bursaries and encourage students to seek further information from institutions. The Government-sponsored directgov website also provides students with a bursary map, permitting them to carry out an online search of institutional bursaries.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.0/6">In addition, students in financial difficulty during their course can apply for additional help through the Government-funded Access to Learning Fund (ALF). ALF is a discretionary fund administered directly by individual higher education institutions which are best placed to assess their students' circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.0/7">The latest figures show that acceptances to universities for England are at an all-time high, with the proportion of applicants from lower socio-economic groups also up. The current package of student support means that anyone who can benefit from higher education has the opportunity to do so. This Government have brought back non-repayable grants and greatly expanded the numbers who get them. This autumn, around two-thirds of full-time eligible students will qualify for non-repayable grants of up to &pound;2,835 a year. Full-time students can also apply for loans to meet their tuition fees and to help with living costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.645W.4/1">Appropriate measures exist to ensure the safety of very light jets (VLJs) and private helicopters.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.4/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-28">28 September 2003</phrase>, the regulation and airworthiness approval of the type design of the majority of aircraft on the UK register has been the responsibility of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). This includes the approval of both VLJs and helicopters.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.4/3">The specific airworthiness requirements regulating the structure, engines, systems and equipment, and performance for very light jet aeroplanes are being drawn from a combination of the EASA airworthiness certification specification codes CS-23 (&quot;Normal, utility, aerobatic and commuter category aeroplanes&quot;) and CS-25 (&quot;Large aeroplanes&quot;), as appropriate to the design under consideration. The regulatory and industrial processes of taking design concepts through to final production is well established and it is not envisaged that there will be any difference on how VLJs would be expected to comply with the appropriate requirements. Where the use of new technologies is involved, the existing requirements are supplemented by additional conditions to define the regulatory basis for their acceptance.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.4/4">Helicopter design and airworthiness requirements are contained in the EASA certification specifications codes CS-27 (&quot;Small rotorcraft&quot;) and CS-29 (&quot;Large rotorcraft&quot;). In recent years, there have been a considerable number of new helicopter designs introduced to the market place, many employing of new technologies and product improvements over their predecessors.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.4/5">The operational requirements in place to regulate privately owned and operated helicopters and VLJs being flown for purposes other than commercial air transport are those of the United Kingdom Air Navigation Order 2005 and its regulations. The operational requirements for VLJ being flown for commercial air transport are those of Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No. 3922/9, commonly known as EU-OPS.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.4/6">Regulation (EC) No. 216/2008 requires the European Aviation Safety Agency to develop implementing rules, which will, by not later than <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-08">8 April 2012</phrase>, apply to all aircraft whether operated commercially or non-commercially. These implementing rules will replace existing operational requirements. In addition, operators engaged in the non-commercial operation of VLJs and helicopters with a maximum take-off mass exceeding 3,175 kg or with a maximum seating configuration of more than nine, will have to declare to the Civil Aviation Authority their capability and means of discharging the responsibilities associated with the operation of their aircraft. The detailed draft implementing rules have not yet been published for consultation but it can be expected that they will enable member states to clearly identify the operators of such aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.4/7">The Air Navigation Order 2005 requires that the name and address of the registered owner or charterer by demise of any aircraft, including VLJs and privately owned helicopters, shall be included on the details held in the UK Register of Civil Aircraft. The CAA Regulations stipulate that the UK Register of Civil Aircraft is available for inspection by any person and the CAA makes the register available via the CAA website at</p>

	<p pid="c.648W.11/1">According to the 2003 Strategic Rail Authority report on high-speed rail, the average cost for the channel tunnel rail link (CTRL) section one was &pound;19 million per route-kilometre, although this excludes some major cost items associated with station works and sunk costs. The report considered that section of the CTRL characteristic of a high-speed line extending north from London. If costs for CTRL sections one and two are included, the average cost of the CTRL was &pound;48 million per route-kilometre including tunnelling.</p>

Costs of operation and maintenance must also be considered.

	<p pid="c.649W.5/2">If objections are raised and not resolved, the TSA provides for an arbitration process to be followed. This can include referral by the train operating company to the Secretary of State for Transport for a decision.

However, the Home Office (UK Border Agency) may acquire communications data, use directed surveillance and deploy covert human intelligence sources in connection with its work. Figures on public authority use of covert techniques controlled by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ('RIPA') are published annually by the Interception of Communications Commissioner, the Chief Surveillance Commissioner and the Intelligence Services Commissioner who each have particular inspection and oversight responsibilities under RIPA. The latest reports were laid before Parliament and copies placed in the House Library on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase>. The figures provided in the reports are not broken down by individual public authority use of specific covert technique as, depending on the particular technique and authority using it, this could either reveal sensitivities or be misleading.

The Department leads on five cross-governmental PSAs for children and young people which were announced in CSR07. They are:</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.8/2" class="indent">PSA 10: Raise the educational achievement of all children and young people;</p>

	<p pid="c.672W.8/6" class="indent">PSA 14: Increase the number of children and young people on the path to success.</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.8/7">A series of indicators underpin each PSA, a number of which make up part of the local government National Indicator Set. All the indicators are brought together through the Every Child Matters (ECM) outcomes framework. The 2008 autumn performance report due to be published later in the year, will for the first time, include reporting against the 2007 comprehensive spending review PSAs which the Department leads on. PSA Delivery Agreements are available on the HM Treasury website at:</p>

The external marking and data collection contract was let by NAA to ETS Europe for the 2008 tests. Following ETS' failure to deliver all test results by the contractual milestone of 8th July, the NAA has taken a number of steps to deliver outstanding results to schools as speedily as possible. These measures have been applied equally across all schools in England with missing results, including those in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.5/6" class="indent">The NAA took over direct responsibility for all outstanding marking, and for the reviews process from mid-August following termination of the contract with ETS. Markers were required to input marks into ETS' systems to allow pupils' results to be viewed via a secure website. Ongoing technical issues with ETS' systems prevented marks for some schools from being posted on the website. NAA is working with the remaining schools which are missing pupils' results to resolve the issues. In addition the NAA has increased its helpdesk capacity to respond to and make telephone calls to schools with any residual results issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.690W.5/1">The Department does not collect data on GCSE enrolments by young people in young offender institutions (YOIs) broken down by length of stay in custody. However, the roll-out of the Offender Learning and Skills Service (OLASS) through the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) from <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase>, means that some data on young offender enrolment within YOIs is now collected. Data are only available for 2006/07, during which 95 young people were enrolled on one or more GCSE course.</p>
	<p pid="c.690W.5/2">However, many young people in custody are still enrolled at learning providers in the community and therefore their enrolments are not included in the figure provided. Also, many young people stay in custody only for a very short time, and therefore it is not always realistic for them to enrol on and achieve long-term qualifications (e.g. GCSEs), in custody. Therefore, the LSC figure quoted in this answer does not provide records of all of the enrolments of all young people in YOIs. Data are not available for GCSE achievements for young people in Secure Children's Homes, Secure Training Centres, or privately run YOIs.</p>

	<p pid="c.690W.12/2"><i> </i>English Heritage is aware of several studies which have attempted to estimate the contribution of a particular element of the heritage sector to the national economy, but these have not enabled an aggregated figure to be prepared.</p>
	<p pid="c.690W.12/3">Significant figures are, however, available. For example, privately owned historic houses generate an economic contribution of over &pound;1.6 billion; England's cathedrals generate around &pound;150 million per annum of benefits for the local and national economies; and a report into traditional building skills estimated that &pound;3.5 billion was invested in historic buildings in 2005, a significant proportion of which paid for skilled craftsmen in the building trades.</p>
	<p pid="c.690W.12/4">Tourism, one of the largest industries in the UK, was estimated to be worth approximately &pound;85.6 billion in 2006. England's historic buildings are a key motivator for those considering a visit to the country and top the table of activities undertaken by those who actually do visit. It is therefore clear that a considerable proportion of the &pound;85.6 billion is generated indirectly by the historic environment.</p>
