	<p pid="a.780W.2/1">Prisons are asked to send mobile phones and SIM cards they find to a central unit for analysis. The numbers analysed are set out in the tables for each prison for each of the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.2/2">The figures include items discovered within the prison perimeter and on entry to establishments. However, we believe that these figures may understate the actual number of finds, because they do not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes, and because in some instances prisons have not sent the items for analysis. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to ensure that we have a more comprehensive picture in future. While the numbers of phones detected indicates the scale of the challenge in tackling illicit mobile phones, it is also a reflection of prisons' increasing success in finding them and better reporting. NOMS is developing new procedures to ensure that we have a comprehensive picture of mobile phones found in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.2/3">NOMS is implementing a strategy to minimise the number of phones entering prisons, and to find or disrupt those that do enter. As part of the strategy, prisons are being provided with technologies to strengthen local security and searching strategies, in line with the recommendations in the Blakey report. &quot;Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons&quot;, published in July 2008. This includes the roll out of &quot;BOSS&quot; chairs to all prisons, and the deployment of other detection and disruption technologies, including mobile phone signal blockers.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.2/4">We have also strengthened the law, through the Offender Management Act 2007 (implemented in April 2008), which makes it a criminal offence with a punishment of up to two years' imprisonment to bring an unauthorised mobile phone or component part into a prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.791W.3/1">The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) created the Inspire programme to support non-commercial projects specifically inspired by the 2012 Games. The Inspire Mark, the badge of the Inspire programme, is the first of its kind and will be a legacy for future Olympic and Paralympic Games. As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, a total of 112 projects have been considered by LOCOG. To date 90 per cent. have been approved with the rest having received feedback so that they can resubmit in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.3/2">So far, no projects solely within Sutton have applied to use the Mark, but Sutton's Olympic and Paralympic Forum are looking at ways to build awareness of the benefits available from the Games. National Inspire Programme projects are however being delivered in the constituency, such as Young Ambassadors in Sutton School Sport Partnerships, Make Your Mark in three Sutton schools, and free swimming for the over 60s in the borough, as well as the Get Set Education programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.792W.2/2">18 National Olympic Committees (NOC) and one National Paralympic Committee (NPC) have signed agreements for Pre Games Training Camps (PGTC) in the UK. They include agreements between the Kenyan Olympic Committee and Bristol, the National Olympic Committee of Thailand and Manchester, 15 of the Pacific Island National Olympic Committees and the North West and the Australian Olympic Swim Team with Manchester. Also the Australian Paralympic Committee have signed up to utilise such facilities as the Wales National Pool in Swansea, the National Whitewater Centre in Bala and the National Velodrome in Swansea.</p>
	<p pid="a.792W.2/3">Three years out from the Games the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), the nine English regions and the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are undertaking promotional activity to attract PGTCs ahead of 2012. LOCOG will be developing the London 2012 website to indicate when NOCs and NPCs have agreed to utilise a PGTC for their athlete preparations.</p>

	<p pid="a.792W.5/2">Visit London has recently completed an initial scoping exercise to determine the necessary size, scope and cost of a non-accredited media centre in London. They have also begun working with their tourism partners on an audit of potential studio spaces, attractions and stand-up points with iconic views for broadcasters outside of the Olympic Park. Pre-registration for the media centre is likely to be announced in 2010, once funding and a detailed budget have been agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.800W.20/1">The Department for Transport allocates integrated transport block and highways maintenance funding to local transport authorities for general capital investment in transport. This funding is not ring-fenced and local authorities have discretion to spend their allocations in line with their priorities. The total allocation provided to Staffordshire (which covers Tamworth) in 2008-09 is &pound;21.522 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.20/2">The &quot;Access for All&quot; programme is part of the &quot;Railways for AH&quot; strategy, and was launched by the Department in 2006 to address the issues faced by disabled passengers using railway stations in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.20/3">The Department has awarded just under &pound;300,000 of Access for All Small Schemes funding towards accessibility improvements worth almost &pound;615,000 at seven stations in Staffordshire. These are Blythe Bridge, Cannock, Hednesford, Kidsgrove, Landywood, Rugeley Town, and Tutbury and Hatton.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.20/4">To ensure that disabled people are able to use public transport, by law all new trains, buses and coaches used on scheduled services now have to be physically accessible, including to wheelchair users. We have set deadlines for all trains to be accessible by 2020 and all buses used on local or scheduled services will be required to meet accessibility standards by 2017.</p>

	<p pid="a.802W.10/1">The formal justice system in Afghanistan is weak, often corrupt and typically inaccessible to women, children and rural communities. Furthermore, there is a shortage of trained judges and legal representation. For the majority of Afghans, justice and dispute resolution is dispensed through informal, traditional systems. We estimate that over 80 per cent. of justice/dispute resolution is dispensed through informal systems and in Helmand we believe this to be even higher. Aspects of these systems have been used for hundreds of years and tend to have a high level of acceptance and legitimacy among the public. This includes Taliban courts in Taliban controlled areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.10/2">The UK is supporting the strengthening of the justice sector in Afghanistan: at the national level we are building the capacity of the Criminal Justice Task Force and the Central Narcotics Tribunal to tackle narcotics related crimes. Through the Department for International Development, we have supported the World Bank's Justice Sector Reform Project focused on improving the formal justice system. In Helmand, we have prioritised support for informal justice systems by promoting and strengthening traditional dispute resolution mechanisms as a viable alternative to those provided by the Taliban. This includes legal education, promoting access to justice for women and children and improving linkages with the formal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.2/18">The UNODC figures are derived from their estimates that 60 per cent. of opium is converted into heroin in Afghanistan and 40 per cent. is exported. From 2000 to 2004, UNODC used a 10:1 ratio for the conversion of opium into heroin. This was revised to 7:1 in 2005 to reflect the higher morphine content of Afghan opium. The figures for opium production are adjusted to take into account the impact of seizures and local consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.2/19">Estimates of the potential opium and heroin production in Afghanistan for 2009 will be made after the harvesting of opium is complete in July.

The investigation into the cause of the One Two Go airline crash at Phuket airport on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-16">16 September 2007</phrase> is still going on. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) have passed the official technical investigation report to the Thai Government. The Thai technical sub-committee is reviewing the report and it is due to be finalised and endorsed by the Thai Minister for Transport in mid May 2009. However, this time frame could slip, depending on decisions by the technical sub-committee. Once the report is finalised it will need to be translated into several languages, including English, and then checked by the ICAO. The Thai authorities have 30 days to produce the translation and the ICAO have a further 60 days to check and verify the technical details of the translation. This would mean that the verified English translation of the report will be released by mid August 2009 at the earliest.</p>

	<p pid="a.814W.5/14">The demand of international peacekeeping and stabilisation operations continues to increase. While the UK supports these efforts, in the case of the United Nations paying a significant share (7.8 per cent.) of the rising costs, the increased costs have forced the UK Government to review its funding of discretionary activity, in conflict prevention, management and resolution, and post-conflict stabilisation. The finite funding available has been prioritised and effort focused on those countries or regions where the risk and impact of conflict is greatest. Ghana has shown with its successful elections and transfer of power that it has developed a stability lacked by many others in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.5/15">It has always been our Government's long-term goal to enable the Staff College and Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana to become self-supporting with a commensurate reduction in the UK's direct assistance. Prioritisation of effort has required this process to be accelerated.</p>

	<p pid="a.826W.5/1">Anaerobic digestion is our preferred option for treating food waste&mdash;it has significant environmental benefits over other options for treating food waste, with the energy generated also offsetting fossil fuel power generation, and counting towards our renewable energy targets. Anaerobic digestion may be particularly cost-effective for food waste if separately collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.826W.5/2">Anaerobic digestion is a key component of the Government's Renewable Energy Strategy, to be published in June. It will significantly help the UK to meet its binding targets in respect of renewable energy generation, reductions in carbon emissions and diversion of biodegradable municipal waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.826W.5/3">We now need to drive forward the development of practical ways to achieve a major increase in the use of anaerobic digestion. A new Anaerobic Digestion Task Group has been set up, drawn from a broad range of stakeholders to develop an Implementation Plan, which will set out the practical measures that Government and stakeholders can individually and collectively take to increase use of anaerobic digestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.826W.5/4">Government financial support already available to encourage greater uptake of anaerobic digestion includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.826W.5/5" class="indent">Electricity from anaerobic digestion being now eligible for two ROCs (Renewable Obligation Certificates) per megawatt hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.826W.5/6" class="indent">Providing around &pound;10 million over the next three years for the anaerobic digestion demonstration programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.826W.5/7">We wish to see a much greater uptake of anaerobic digestion by local authorities, businesses and farmers, but It is local authorities, rather than DEFRA, who are responsible for deciding how waste is managed, as part of their local waste management strategies.</p>

Unlike Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling, which the UK supports, coastal whaling is essentially commercial, with distribution throughout Japan.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.8/2">We are also concerned that if one country is allowed to carry out coastal whaling, then other countries would argue that they should be allowed similar provisions, ultimately outside direct control of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). We have voiced these concerns in the context of recent discussions on reform of the IWC and shared them fully with our European partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.835W.9/2">It is for clinicians to decide on the most appropriate products for decolonisation and we do not collect information on the products used. However, the Department will be issuing guidance on products for decontamination later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.9/3">The current policy is to screen all elective patients, except for those in certain groups for whom the risk of MRSA infection is very low. We estimated that this would require around 6.3 million tests in 2009-10. Elective patients found to be positive for MRSA will receive decolonisation treatment. The total cost of screening those patients, and decolonising those with a positive screen, is estimated at &pound;44 million, an average of &pound;7.02 per patient.</p>

In accordance with our international obligations, trained case owners will consider any claim that is made on its individual merits consistent with the established refugee and human rights criteria, referring to the latest available country of origin information. The UK Border Agency provides country specific guidance to case owners on common types of asylum claim from countries which generate significant numbers of such claims. Because there are no common types of Bahraini asylum claim, reflecting very low numbers of applications, no such country specific guidance is produced for Bahrain.</p>

	<p pid="a.853W.0/2">When an application for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) is refused, any subsequent appeals dismissed, and the applicant has no other grounds for leave, the UK Border Agency will seek to enforce compliance with the immigration decision. Those who refuse to leave voluntarily are classed as overstayers and are liable for enforced removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.0/3">In 2008, we introduced case ownership for all in-country cases. Disallowed applications for ILR are owned by a case owner, based in the region where the applicant lives, who is responsible for pursuing the case to conclusion and giving priority to cases according to the harm they may potentially cause to the public. In addition to this, work is being undertaken on the development of electronic embarkation controls (e-Borders) to record departures, allowing us to monitor compliance and focus enforcement resource on those who do not comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.0/4">Further information on the UK Border Agency's enforcement strategy is available to view at:</p>

	<p pid="a.853W.0/6">The efficacy of this approach is assessed by measuring the number of voluntary departures and removals. In 2008, 66,275 people were removed or departed voluntarily from the UK (which will include overstayers)&mdash;a 5 per cent. increase on 2007. This includes a 10 per cent. increase in non-asylum cases from 49,660 in 2007 to 54,635 in 2008. These figures (not percentages) are rounded to the nearest five and are provisional.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.0/7">The Home Office publishes statistics on the number of persons removed and departed voluntarily from the UK on a quarterly and annual basis. National Statistics on immigration and asylum are placed in the Library of the House and are available from the Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.856W.5/2">The UK Border Agency does not assess whether students have made sufficient academic progress under the requirements of tier 4 of the points based system (PBS). The education provider, as a licensed sponsor, will be relied upon to make this assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.5/3">The phased implementation of tier 4 of the points based system commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-28">28 July 2008</phrase>, when the UK Border Agency started accepting sponsor licence applications from educational institutions that wish to bring students from outside the European economic area to the UK for study. The Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules (HC 314) laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-09">9 March 2009</phrase> marks the start of the second phase: from <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, only UK Border Agency licensed institutions will be able to bring students to the UK, and student applicants will need to meet the tier 4 points test before being granted leave to enter or remain. No student has yet been assessed under tier 4 of the PBS.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.5/4">UK Border Agency officers are not best-placed to make academic judgments about the ability for a student to carry out a course, that is why under tier 4 we are replacing the current subjective criteria with clear and objective tests. Under tier 4, the education provider, as a licensed sponsor, will be relied upon to make the assessment as to whether a student has made sufficient academic progress. The sponsor may only issue a visa letter to the student if it is satisfied that the student both intends and is able to follow the course of study concerned.</p>

However, it did find that the policy guidance relating to the treatment of Gurkhas discharged before 1997 was not sufficiently clear and did not cover service-related factors.

	<p pid="a.859W.8/3">Checks are conducted through the Police national computer, criminal history system, criminal information system, counter terrorism databases and local intelligence as well as military and police professional standards databases where necessary. There is no national requirement for Criminal Records Bureau checks.

	<p pid="a.869W.3/2">Training is a devolved responsibility. Each country in the UK makes provision to support business in their own way.

The scheme includes a salary replacement element for employees of companies benefiting from the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.869W.3/3">In England we have the Train to Gain scheme delivered by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. One element of Train to Gain enables small and medium sized enterprises in England with fewer than 50 employees to access compensation for wages where employees are released for training: This contribution is &pound;5 per hour or un-capped actual hourly wage (employer choice) up to a maximum of 70 hours over a period of time.</p>

	<p pid="a.890W.2/1">Rents of business premises are set in the market by agreement between the parties. The Government do not plan to limit increases. However, when business tenancies expire, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 gives the tenant the right to a new tenancy and restricts the rent to the market value. The new rent will be fixed by the courts if the parties cannot agree. This protection is not available in cases where the tenant agrees to 'contract out' of the protection of the Act before the grant of the original lease.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/2">More generally, the Government are keen to promote more flexible leasing arrangements in the commercial sector, along with greater awareness among small businesses about the implications of lease terms. It is important that, subject to market conditions, tenants should be able to negotiate terms reflecting their business needs. The Government remain committed to lease reform and, dependent upon the impact of the 'Code for Leasing Business Premises in England and Wales 2007', has not ruled out legislation as an option in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid="a.894W.0/1">The Children and Young People Plan (CYPP) is a local plan which should meet the specific, assessed, needs of all children and young people in the area including children with autism. Children's planning stems from the principle that every child matters and only by developing services to address the particular needs of all children and young people as individuals will services for vulnerable children improve. The needs assessment is an essential part of good planning by the Children's Trust and we have not made an assessment of the costs involved for different groups of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.0/2">The needs assessment for the CYPP should result in a comprehensive profile of all children, young people and families in the area. It will be undertaken in partnership with all those involved in the planning process including the third sector, draw on analysis carried out by partners, in particular the statutory Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA), and in direct consultation with children and young people. Data should be analysed on a number of different levels&mdash;regional, community, and neighbourhood and at the level of a single agency or service.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.0/3">Data should include published or unpublished research papers, major surveys such as epidemiological surveys, participation data and as appropriate, draw on aggregated and anonymised data collected through one-to-one interviews, focus groups and individual assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.0/4">Subject to Parliamentary approval of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, we are planning to fully consult, in the autumn, with stakeholders and partners on further guidance on Children's Trust Boards and the development of the CYPP, including the needs assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.895W.8/2">Major refurbishments carried out under the Building Schools for the Future programme normally include removal of all asbestos in areas in which it would be disturbed by the work undertaken. Asbestos is also removed when buildings are demolished. Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) that are likely to deteriorate are identified by an asbestos survey for each refurbishment and are normally then removed. Where minor refurbishment work takes place, an asbestos survey is done and, depending on the condition of the ACMs, they are either removed or managed in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.8/3">Asbestos does not pose a serious risk if it is managed properly in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) does not recommend the routine removal of asbestos. Its advice remains that, providing that ACMs are maintained in good condition, they can be left where they are and managed until a building reaches the end of its life and asbestos can be removed without risk of exposing building users to risks arising from significant disturbance.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.8/4">The risks created by removal need to be borne in mind; unless the removal is carried out perfectly, the process may leave contamination. If the asbestos is in good condition and is not likely to be damaged or disturbed, it is usually safer to leave it in place and manage it until the building has reached the end of its useful life.</p>

	<p pid="a.896W.2/2">In April each year the pensions of some 500,000 former teachers and their dependants are increased in line with inflation (i.e. pensions increase), consequently all teacher pensioners received increases in their pensions of 5 per cent. this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/3">The teachers' pension scheme is a statutory scheme and pensions are reduced where there has been an overpayment, i.e. where the pension in payment exceeds the statutory entitlement. There are a number of reasons why overpayments can arise, for example, from this April some 20,000 former teachers had their pensions adjusted because an element of their pension known as the guaranteed minimum pension had previously been overpaid. However, it should be noted that only around a half of those pensioners had a reduction in the level of their pension payments as the adjustment was timed to coincide with the annual pensions increase uplift.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/4">Details of each and every adjustment to former teachers' pensions are not collated centrally, and the records of over half a million former teachers who are in receipt of a teacher's pension would need to be individually investigated in order to do so. This could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
