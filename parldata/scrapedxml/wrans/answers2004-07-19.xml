	<p pid=".2W.5/3" class="indent">One Judicial Review heard by the High Court, brought by a company against English Nature as co-defendant with the Secretary of State, was successfully defended (2001).

	<p pid=".2W.5/5" class="indent">One was brought by an individual against English Nature. The action was successfully defended. However the individual concerned appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was granted in 2003, but the case was not heard until 2004. English Nature won that case. English Nature incurred costs of &pound;250,000 (ex VAT). In reaching its decision the Court awarded costs to English Nature. It is still possible for the aggrieved to petition the House of Lords.</p>

The company concerned has now appealed to the Court of Appeal and the case will be heard later this year. Costs are, therefore, still accruing and the outcome of the case will determine the costs issue.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.6/1">The policy of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;as set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (PPG3)&mdash;is not to set region-wide targets or quotas for affordable housing. Targets are more appropriately set at the local level as they are, necessarily, derived from local circumstances and assessments. The figures set out in Regional Planning Guidance for the South West (RPG10) are, therefore, not a target but an indicator against which the provision of affordable housing can be monitored. Although better quality information than currently available is needed to assess how we are progressing against this indicator, we do know that we are not yet providing sufficient affordable homes. That is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has accepted Kate Barker's recommendation that there should be a step-change in housing supply. Over the coming months, we will be consulting on a package of proposals designed to achieve this, including the provision of independent advice to the Regions, which should improve significantly our ability to deliver and monitor the provision of affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.6/2">The office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also committing more resources to the delivery of affordable homes&mdash;the 2004 Spending Review will allow us to increase new social house building by 50 per cent. The Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme (ADP) for the financial years 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 is worth &pound;188.2 million and will deliver approximately 6,000 affordable homes in the South West. However, the ADP is not the only means available to deliver affordable housing. The planning system also provides local authorities with other tools to deliver affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.6/3">PPG3 requires that Local Planning authorities should plan to meet the housing requirements of the whole community, including those in need of affordable and special needs housing. The provision of affordable housing is a local authority responsibility and should be made on the basis of robust local assessments of needs. Where need is clearly demonstrated for affordable housing, this should be taken into account in formulating development plan policies and in deciding planning applications involving housing.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.5/1">The Mayor of London introduced a scheme to reduce congestion in central London in February 2003. Early indications suggest that congestion charging has resulted in a significant reduction in road traffic in central London. The First Annual Monitoring Report by Transport for London (TfL) considered the direct effect of the congestion charge on air quality would be relatively modest. TfL's Second Annual Report estimated small decreases in both PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> particles and nitrogen oxides in the charging zone. It is too early, however, to assess fully the air quality changes and thus to calculate the implied impact on health. GLA/TfL estimated that congestion charging would result in between 150 and 250 fewer reported accidents, involving injury, per year within Greater London. TfL's Second Annual Report highlighted that the recent pattern of decreasing levels of accidents within the charging zone is continuing, and there is no evidence of detrimental change in road traffic accidents within or around the zone.</p>

When a licence is revoked, the driver is always offered the opportunity to provide fresh evidence, which in such cases would normally be in the form of further visual field charts. If the new fields satisfy the standard, a licence will be re-issued. No information is readily available on how many drivers have their licences returned on this basis.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.2/2">Since 2001, 18 drivers revoked because of diabetic retinopathy have formally appealed to a magistrates court in England and Wales or to a Sheriff Court in Scotland. Three went to a full hearing and of these two were dismissed and one was upheld and a new licence was issued. The other 15 appeals were withdrawn and eight have subsequently been issued with licences following the submission of fresh visual fields which met the required standard.</p>

We also work with the Department for International Development on numerous reconstruction projects in the South under the auspices of the Emergency Infrastructure Programme, with United Kingdom soldiers rebuilding and offering advice.

	<p pid=".24W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence, in common with other Government Departments, publishes expenditure data on an annual basis in its Resource Accounts following audit by the National Audit Office. Details of costs of operations in Iraq for the Financial Year 2003&ndash;04 will be published in the MOD's Annual Report and Accounts following audit in September. Total costs are expected to be within the &pound;1,539 million voted by Parliament which represents 3.6 per cent. of the total resource and capital expenditure limits voted to my Department in the Spring Supplementary Estimates.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.6/2">Audited figures for the cost of operations in Iraq in this financial year will be published in the MOD's Resource Accounts in 2005. It is too early to provide any estimate for the total costs that will be incurred this year, but we will ask the House to vote the necessary funds in Supplementary Estimates in due course.</p>

The transfer of control of our Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Mazar-e Sharif and Meymanek together with associated support forces, was a major step in implementing the first stage of ISAF's expansion across Afghanistan; a process we see as playing a vital role in helping the Afghans create a secure and stable country. Together with our forces in Kabul, we now contribute around 580 personnel to the ISAF, and are also engaged in providing wider support to security sector reform in Afghanistan. Looking ahead, and as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>, we have offered to deploy the Headquarters of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps to lead ISAF in 2006.

	<p pid=".27W.6/2">The training objectives of each of the cadet forces are broadly similar, differing only to reflect the traditions and ethos of the parent Service. They support the key themes of the Government youth policies by providing training aimed at capacity building, maximising personal potential and social inclusion. Training is undertaken by cadets under two broad headings: military training and adventurous training in the approximate proportions of 60 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively. The military training functions are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".27W.6/3" class="indent">a. To provide the opportunity for young people to exercise responsibility and leadership, and to learn from the Services how they can be best developed.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.6/4" class="indent">b. To impart a basic knowledge and understanding of the role of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.6/5" class="indent">c. To encourage those who have an interest in the Services to be aware of the career opportunities the armed forces have to offer.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.6/6">The adventurous training includes activities that are arduous and include an element of risk to test the courage and endurance of cadets and develop their qualities of character.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.6/7">The military training syllabi contain such topics as turnout and drill, skill at arms, shooting, map and compass, fieldcraft, and first aid. Rock climbing, mountain walking, canoeing, caving, offshore sailing, sub aqua diving and parachuting are just some of the approved adventurous training activities undertaken by cadets with the view to making them better citizens.</p>

Secondary care for Service personnel is usually provided through routine treatment within the NHS unless there are operational reasons to do otherwise. In the UK, medical services for families of Servicemen and women are usually provided within the NHS.

The ONS and DfES data sets are not directly comparable due to differences in geographical coverage, and the fact that ONS estimates are headcounts while DfES estimates are calculated in terms of full-time equivalents. Additionally, DfES publishes information on teachers' pay, for both England and Wales, in a document &quot;School Workforce in England&quot;. Information on teachers' pay is given in tables 32 to 38 in the most recent edition, which relates to 2003. It can be accessed via the DfES website at: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/VOL/v000443/index.shtml">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/VOL/v000443/index.shtml</a>.</p>

It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.2/1">In their report on the STEPS deal, the NAO estimated that the Departments would pay Mapeley STEPS Contractor Ltd. some &pound;1,500 million over the 20 years of the contract. This relates to the major contract price element (the facility price) for serviced accommodation. The NAO noted that this cost reflected the Departments anticipated requirements which may vary over time.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.2/2">Taking this uncertainty into account, the figure contained in the NAOs report remains a reasonable estimate of the likely total Facility Price payments due to Mapeley over 20 years.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.2/3">In addition to this the contract provides a flexible framework in which we are able to transact with Mapeley to provide a range of services including, utilities, business rates, and major and minor building works. Under the contract the cost of these additional services are charged on to the departments separately and will vary according to demand.</p>

Section 303 applies to all digital terrestrial, digital satellite and digital cable channels except the BBC, which is instead brought within the scope of the code by way of the BBC Agreement. Exclusions from the application of the code are a matter for Ofcom, taking into account in particular certain matters specified in the Act designed to balance the costs and difficulty of provision with the extent of the benefit to those with sensory impairments. Ofcom have consulted on their code, including proposed exemptions, and I understand that they propose to announce their conclusions shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.6/1">We continue to be concerned by the situation in Chechnya. The assassination of Chechen President Kadyrov in May, and the <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June</phrase> raids into neighbouring Ingushetia underline the fragility of the situation in the Russian North Caucasus.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.6/2">We recognise the genuine security problems Russia faces in Chechnya and the North Caucasus. We support Russia's territorial integrity. Separatist forces carry out many human rights abuses in Chechnya. We have been clear in our condemnation of the appalling terrorist attacks across Russia, which have killed many innocent victims.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.6/3">However, these problems can only be resolved through a political rather than military solution. Continuing human rights abuses in Chechnya by federal and local forces can only undermine attempts to advance a genuine political process and reconciliation. Our policy is to regularly raise our concerns over Chechnya with the Russian authorities. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary did so recently with Foreign Minister Lavrov, during his visit to Moscow on 6&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>. I raised similar concerns during my visit to Russia on 6&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April</phrase>. In addition, we raise these concerns multilaterally through the EU, OSCE, Council of Europe and UN. We also give significant funding to international organisations and NGOs that provide humanitarian aid in the region.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.6/4">The new Chechen presidential elections planned for August will be a fresh opportunity to build up the political process and aid efforts to bring stability to the Republic. We therefore hope the election will be genuinely open and inclusive, a hope we have expressed repeatedly to the Russians.</p>

Furthermore, direct trade will reduce the economic disparity between the north and south of the island and will help to bring the Turkish Cypriots in to line with the EU acquis.

	<p pid=".61W.5/3">TSO does not divulge its sales revenues, which depend on the extent to which it chooses to sell copies at a discount. Nor does TSO provide the total number of copies printed in previous years. However, the number of copies sold by TSO, and the number supplied to the FCO for internal use, is listed in the table. Statistics for the 1997 edition are not available.</p>

	<p pid=".63W.11/1">Terrorism has not derailed the transition of power to the new Iraqi Interim Government which took office on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June</phrase>, although attacks have continued. The most significant of these in recent days was on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July</phrase> when a terrorist car bomb killed nine Iraqis queuing to enter the international zone, and there has also been an increase in terrorist activity in Samarra. Internal security is now the responsibility of the IIG supported by the Multinational Force (MNF) in accordance with UNSCR 1546. The IIG is determined to tackle terrorism, and Iraqi security forces have been engaged in a number of successful operations in Baghdad and elsewhere. The Iraqi authorities are also committed to building up its counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency forces. We continue to be engaged in supporting these efforts.</p>

The EU has said the same; so has the UN General Assembly. We continue to call upon the Israeli Government to re-route the barrier away from Occupied Territory. Similarly we call on the Palestinian Authority to meet their commitments on security. A draft resolution is being considered by the UN General Assembly. If it is put to a vote we shall vote according to the merits of the resolution.</p>

We view this as a serious potential threat to international security. We also remain very concerned at the threat to international security posed by DPRK's willingness to transfer ballistic missile technology and systems to other states. We support the objective of the continuing six-party talks: a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons, and believe that the comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons programmes is necessary to assure this objective.</p>

These crucially include how the UK can support the Palestinian Authority in meeting its obligations under the Roadmap; work with the Palestinian Authority to build its capacity on security is one such example. My noble Friend Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean last visited the Palestinian Authority in January 2004. The Consulate-General offers a full visa and consular service in Jerusalem and the Occupied Territories.</p>

	<p pid=".72W.2/1">There is close co-operation across Government to tackle the crime of human trafficking. For example, Reflex the multi-agency task force set up to co-ordinate intelligence and law enforcement in a response to organised immigration crime, including human trafficking, brings together all the key agencies and Departments. The Government Departments represented on Reflex include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.2/2">The Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills work closely on the subject of child trafficking. We are jointly considering the results from the Reflex funded multi-agency operation, Paladin Child. This involved the Metropolitan police, the Immigration Service, social workers from Hillingdon Social Services and secondees from NSPCC. The operation risk assessed children arriving at Heathrow airport without their parents or legal guardians and social services followed up those considered to be at risk. The operation did not uncover any evidence of child trafficking. However, the report did make a number of recommendations related to child protection.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.2/3">This issue of human trafficking is currently within the remit of a number of ministerial groups. Ministers are currently considering whether a ministerial group focussing specifically on human trafficking would be of benefit in taking forward the agenda in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.0/2">The Immigration Service does not routinely collect data on children arriving in the United Kingdom. But it has recently introduced a number of measures aimed at ensuring that children at risk are identified on arrival and, where appropriate, other agencies informed.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.0/3">Child Protection Officers are based at Heathrow Airport and at the Croydon Asylum Screening Unit in order to strengthen the links between the police and the Immigration Service to counter child trafficking and problems associated with unaccompanied minors. In addition social services have recently placed staff at the Croydon Asylum Screening Unit to work alongside Immigration Service staff advising them on child welfare issues. A scoping study is also being undertaken to examine the feasibility of social work teams being based at the major ports of entry.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.0/4">The Immigration Service also participated in Operation Paladin Child, initiated by the Metropolitan Police Child Protection Command to define the nature of child migration from non-EU countries to the UK via Heathrow, and which also involved the NSPCC and Hillingdon Social Services. The report into the operation's findings made a number of recommendations, including the creation of multi-agency partnership teams at major ports. The Immigration Service will work with the police and other agencies involved to help implement those recommendations.</p>

Their main objectives are to address the barriers that many refugee women face in doing so, for instance by obtaining relevant information, confidence building, arranging childcare, and enhancing language skills. It works in close partnership with a range of Government and non-government bodies across the West Midlands which share its commitment to the provision of services to refugee women.</p>

	<p pid=".77W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.11/2">The current scientific understanding of noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss is that it does not get worse on removal from the noise giving rise to the injury and that, in the context of the War Pensions Scheme, hearing loss due to noise and that due to subsequent effects of age are not more than additive. This is the basis on which the Department considers claims for hearing loss due to service in the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.11/3">In terms of specific assessments of the effects of hearing loss, in 1997 Baroness Hollis, the Minister then responsible for war pensions, asked the then Government Chief Medical Officer, Sir Kenneth Calman, to chair an independent expert review of the assessment of hearing loss in the War Pensions Scheme. Both that independent review and a further departmental review in February 1999 confirmed that the Department's approach to the assessment of hearing loss in war pensions was in line with current scientific and medical understanding. Since early 1999 emerging evidence on the matter has continued to be monitored.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.11/4">The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, an independent non-governmental body which advises the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on matters relating to the Industrial Injuries Scheme, published their review of occupational deafness in November 2002 (Cm 5672). This confirmed the War Pensions Scheme approach to assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".86W.11/2">The Government are committed to improving the position of disabled people in society and believe that public bodies should take the lead in promoting equal opportunities. That is why the draft Disability Discrimination Bill extends the DDA to the functions of public bodies and introduces a duty on public bodies to promote equality for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.11/3">Accordingly, my Department keeps the efficacy and efficiency of services provided to disabled people under constant review. The Sure Start Unit has published and disseminated guidance and training materials to Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs) in local authorities, which will guide and empower them to support early identification, intervention, develop inclusive early learning environments and existing service provision. These materials will help them to support children in removing barriers to learning wherever these exist.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.11/4">The Children Act Report 2002, published by DfES in June 2003, pulls together the latest information from statistical returns, inspections and research on social services support for children. This report includes a chapter on support for disabled children and their families. See the DfES website at <a href="http://www.dfes.qov.uk">http://www. dfes.qov.uk</a>.Ofsted inspections of schools and LEAs include a requirement to look at and report on the inclusion of children with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities. In addition, Ofsted also undertake reports on specific themes. It is due to report in September 2004 on the initial impact of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 and will also be reporting at regular intervals on progress being made as a result of the Government's Strategy for SEN: Removing Barriers to Achievement. Ofsted also has the lead responsibility for inspecting Connexions partnerships. All Ofsted inspections focus on the experience of young people and evaluate and report on quality and effectiveness of the partnership. Ofsted's framework for inspection states that they should report on how responsive the partnership is to the range and diversity of young people in the area. In making their judgments, Ofsted report on the relevance of programmes provided and whether they provide for the diverse needs of young people within the target age group, taking into account such features as sex, link ethnicity and disability and ensuring equality and equity.

	<p pid=".86W.11/5">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) provides funding to the higher education institutions and further education colleges it funds to widen access and improve provision for disabled students. It publishes an annual series of performance indicators that cover access, progression, retention, research, graduate employment and disability. The allocation of funds reflects the proportion of students that each institution recruits who are in receipt of the disabled students allowance (DSA).

	<p pid=".86W.11/6">HEFCE also distributes special initiative funding in support of students with learning difficulties and disabilities.

	<p pid=".86W.11/8">In May 2003 HEFCE published &quot;Project capital round three: invitation to apply for funds&quot;. Of the &pound;494 million allocated to improve capital and IT infrastructure to support learning and teaching, &pound;117 million is allocated to improve provision for disabled students, in line with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and its extension in the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001.

	<p pid=".96W.2/1">The London Schools Admissions System (LSAS) has been developed by the Local Education Authorities (LEAs) in London to create an infrastructure which will simplify the secondary school admissions process for London parents. From September 2005, all 33 London boroughs and eight adjoining LEAs will co-operate to process applications for secondary schools. Parents will be able to apply for up to six maintained secondary schools on a single application form. Individual admission authorities will continue to consider applications under their published arrangements, but where an applicant is eligible for a place at more than one school the LSAS will offer the applicant the available school ranked highest on their application form. This will ensure that no child gets more than one offer and that more children are offered a school place on the national offer date of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase>. We are confident that because fewer children will be left with no offer of a school place, the LSAS will help to reduce the anxiety and frustration which many parents, pupils and schools feel under the current application system.</p>

	<p pid=".97W.5/16">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".97W.5/17">1. The financial data are taken from Essex LEAs' Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. 2002&ndash;03 data are subject to change by the LEA. Section 52 is collected at local authority level, not constituency level, so the figures provided are for Essex LEA. 1997&ndash;98 figures are for Essex LEA prior to local government reorganisation. From 1998&ndash;99 onwards parts of Essex LEA became Southend and Thurrock LEAs. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.5/18">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. This change in calculation is identified by the use of italics. The 2002&ndash;03 figure is calculated by taking all the LEA expenditure, excluding CERA and Youth and Community, and dividing it by the FTE pupil numbers in maintained pre-primary, primary, secondary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.5/19">3. The figures shown are calculated by dividing the LEA expenditure by the number of pupils in maintained establishments, Essex has a large proportion of its pre-primary pupils educated outside mainstream establishments. If these are taken into account then the unit cost in 2001&ndash;02 reduces to approximately &pound;3,110 and in 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;3,300.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.5/20">4. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.5/21">5. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10.</p>

	<p pid=".98W.6/1">I refer the hon. Member to the written statement I laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-03">Tuesday 3 July</phrase> on school funding for 2005&ndash;06, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-07-03.55WS"><i>Official Report,</i> column 55WS</phrase>. On the same day there was also a press notice issued by the Department (DfES press notice 2004/0137) which included a statement welcoming the school funding settlement by the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group (made up of the majority of the school workforce unions and other partners).</p>
	<p pid=".98W.6/2">The written statement to the House sets out how we have considered, with our partner signatories, the costs of implementation of the National Agreement. It announces what funds will be available to schools to implement the Agreement in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.6/3">From 2006 we will provide guaranteed three-year budgets for every school, which will give head teachers and governors unprecedented financial security and confidence, and the ability to plan for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.6/4">Practical advice and support is available to assist successful implementation at school level, from the national network of LEA remodelling advisers and from the National Remodelling Team&mdash;NRT (part of National College for School Leadership). The NRT website, <a href="http://www.remodelling.org">www.remodelling.org</a>, contains a range of strategies and models based on real school level case studies on managing in the changes and will include shortly, a toolkit and resources pack specifically on guaranteeing planning, preparation and assessment time for teachers.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.6/5">In addition, from September, up to 10,000 schools will have access to workshops and consultancy as part of the second year of the Financial Management in Schools programme. This builds on the first year of this programme which saw thousands of schools benefit from the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.6/6">We will continue to monitor trends in the schools workforce through the Annual Schools Census each January. There are now 427,800 full-time equivalent teachers&mdash;28,600 more than in 1997 and the highest number since 1981&mdash;and the number of support staff has increased to 241,700, having more than doubled since 1997. These figures illustrate the trend of the significant increases in teachers and support staff since 1997. The next School Workforce Volume will be available in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".103W.11/1">Introduction of a comprehensive regional diabetic retinopathy screening programme with its different methodologies and complex IT and operational aspects is expected to take a number of years. Boards are developing local implementation plans which take account of local needs and existing arrangements. They are being guided by the Department's Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Working Group. The aim is to screen around 20,000 people with diabetes in the current year, subject to recruitment of appropriate staff.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.5/1">No such assessment has been completed to date in relation to services provided directly, or funded by, HSS boards and trusts. However, key preliminary research to inform the development of a regional strategy to address sexual abuse is now under way. This will include compiling baseline information on the current availability of services for victims and work on assessing the level of need. In co-operation with other Departments and agencies whose responsibilities also encompass matters relating to sexual abuse, it is the Department of Health, Social Service's and Public Safety's intention to develop and publish the draft strategy for consultation by late summer 2005. In terms of services provided by the PSNI, there are currently 11 Child Abuse and Rape Enquiry (CARE) units and four CARE suites. Each CARE unit is staffed by five to eight Detective Constables and one Detective Sergeant, with one Detective Inspector responsible for two to three CARE units.</p>

	<p pid=".112W.0/1">Last autumn, we asked Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer director, to report on the implementation of National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on drugs for cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/2">Professor Richards' report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-14">14 June</phrase>. It shows that NICE guidance has been effective in increasing the uptake of recommended new treatments and in reducing variations. Nevertheless, the report finds that there are still unacceptable variations in uptake. The reasons are complex but do not appear to be associated with restrictions in funding. A copy of the report is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/3">In parallel with the publication of this report, my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Warner) issued a statement setting out the responsibilities of the national health service in responding to guidance from NICE and a range of actions to support the NHS in these tasks. NICE can play a key part in promoting its guidance and in providing costing templates and other tools to help the NHS with implementation.</p>

	<p pid=".112W.3/1">It is not possible to make an estimate of this kind at either a national or strategic health authority level. Bed occupancy depends not only on the number of beds provided, but on the level of demand for those beds and the way flow through beds is managed.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.3/2">Average or snap shot weekly bed occupancy is often not the critical factor for bed availability: rather it is the hourly levels of bed occupancy and the temporary mis-match between admissions and discharges that influence the ability of trusts to admit emergency patients without delay and avoid the cancellation of electives. Much bed capacity can be released through simply reducing the current, often substantial, temporary peaks and troughs in bed occupancy.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.3/3">Trusts have identified improving the way they use their bed capacity as a top priority and significant support is being delivered through the national programme to improve throughput in accident and emergency. Improved use of beds is critical to delivering this priority alongside the priorities on electives.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.2/1">The responsibility for regulating medicines on the United Kingdom market lies with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an executive agency of the Department. The MHRA takes the view that internet and mail order sale and supply of medicines is acceptable, provided the legislative requirements are met. There are perfectly legitimate internet-based dispensing pharmacies, where patients can sign their prescriptions and post them to the pharmacist to be filled. Medicines are then sent back to the patient by post. The law allows for this.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.2/2">The MHRA is also responsible for the enforcement of these requirements and any website brought to its attention for breaching regulations regarding advertising, sale and supply of medicines will be investigated. Such sites will be contacted, initially in order to seek compliance and although the MHRA has no powers to force closures of websites, it seeks to achieve compliance through internet service providers (ISPs), which are advised on UK law.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.2/3">The MHRA recognises that, in order to deal with the risks posed by the internet, it is impossible to act unilaterally. To this end, the MHRA's enforcement group works closely with other Government Departments and law enforcement authorities, both in the European Community and elsewhere, in an effort to address possible courses of action.</p>

These negotiations started in February 2004 and are continuing. It remains the Government's preference to include another voluntary PPRS agreement with the research-based pharmaceutical industry and to do this as speedily as possible commensurate with a satisfactory outcome for the taxpayer and the national health service.</p>
