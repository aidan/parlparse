Data is not available on the amount of aggregate &quot;quarried&quot;, or &quot;extracted&quot; because producers keep no such records. Great Britain sales data, sometimes erroneously described as &quot;production&quot;, is available from the Annual Minerals Raised Inquiry (AMRI) undertaken by the Office for National Statistics under commission from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Trade and Industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.3/5">Data on the sales of aggregate in Northern Ireland comes from their Annual Minerals Statement that provides data on all mineral production. Because this data does not provide sufficient detail to enable clear identification of aggregates, the available figures exceed the amounts of aggregate that have been produced. Combining these sources produces the following table:</p>

One factor may be an increase in the number of quarries surveyed in the AMRI following a review of, and additions to, the list of quarries that were surveyed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1075W.6/1">Local authorities are responsible for deciding the most appropriate waste management facilities for their areas and currently recover energy from about 9 per cent. of municipal waste via incineration. Economic modelling undertaken to inform the Government's current waste strategy review suggests that this may increase to about 25 per cent. nationally by 2020. This is less than was forecast in Waste Strategy 2000 due to our expected better performance on recycling.</p>

Most drivers of school buses and commercial vans operate under the UK domestic drivers' hours legislation as opposed to the European Union (EU) Regulations which require the use of tachographs. This is because buses on routes less than 50 kilometres, and goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes, are specifically exempted from the EU Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.3/2">A new EU Regulation on drivers' hours has recently been adopted by the EU institutions. Although, during negotiations, consideration was given to extending the scope of the new regulation to include all buses on routes less than 50 kilometres and light vans between 2.8 and 3.5 tonnes, this change was not made.</p>

	<p pid="b.1088W.5/1">Whilst the main function of the driving licence is to convey entitlement to drive, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency recognises that driving licences are accepted as evidence of identity in a wide range of contexts. To prevent misuse of the licence in identity crime, the Agency operates stringent identity checking procedures so that driving licences are granted only after it is satisfied with the evidence of identity supplied.</p>
	<p pid="b.1088W.5/2">All staff handling driving licence applications have been trained in the detection of counterfeit and forged documents, using materials supplied by United Kingdom Passport Agency, Office for National Statistics and the Home Office National Document Fraud Unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1088W.5/3">DVLA is also engaged fully in the Home Office Identity Fraud Reduction Programme, which promotes collaborative working between the public and private sectors and identifies and co-ordinates a range of projects and initiatives to reduce identity crime generally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1089W.5/1">The Department for Transport's policy on the type, location and frequency of lay-bys on new all-purpose trunk roads is contained in the Highways Agency's Advice Note TA 69/96, The Location and Layout of Lay-Bys.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.5/2">The policy for the provision of new lay-bys on existing roads, including roads designated expressways, depends on the identification of a specific local need. The cost of a new lay-by has to be justified and prioritised against other safety related improvement work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.5/3">The desirable spacing of lay-bys on all, new, all-purpose dual carriageway trunk roads is between two and five kilometres. On all new single carriageway all-purpose trunk roads, the spacing of lay-bys is dependent on the traffic flow. The desirable frequency on these roads should be between two and 12 kilometres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.5/4">The cost of providing a new lay-by as part of a new road scheme or on an existing road varies considerably. It depends on the individual site conditions, availability of land and requirement for retaining structures etc. but the average cost is approximately &pound;200,000.</p>

In practice, some early indications suggest that the compliance cost may have been overestimated. At this stage, it is still too early to assess the full impact of the regulations, but a review scheduled for later this year, will consider the actual impact on industry since they came into force in April 2005.</p>

(56022).</p>
	<p pid="b.1099W.6/4" class="indent">The ethnic group classification in the 2001 Census was designed to allow the majority of people to use a tick box to answer the question. Since it would be impractical to list every ethnic group with a presence in the United Kingdom, the ethnic group categories shown are limited to those groups which have the largest presence in the population, for whom a substantial user need has been identified, and for whom other identifying information such as country of birth is not sufficient. Other criteria that are considered are continuity of categories over time and comparability across Censuses of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1099W.6/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics recognises that the ethnic groups named in the classification will not apply to all respondents. A tick box for 'Other, please specify' was included to allow respondents to identify their ethnic group if those listed did not apply to them. For your information, 65,318 people wrote in either Turkish (49,946) or Turkish Cypriot (15,372) in the United Kingdom in 2001. Of these, all but 418 were in England and Wales. The number of people who identify themselves using a write-in box, however, tends to be lower than the number who would give the same answer if a tick-box were provided.</p>

	<p pid="b.1101W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1101W.2/2">The consultation and analysis done by the human genetics commission jointly with the genetics and insurance committee (GAIC) has been used to inform the development of the Government's and insurer's &quot;Concordat and Moratorium on Genetics and Insurance&quot;, published in March 2005. This document ensures that the use of genetic information by insurance companies will be transparent, fair, and subject to independent oversight. It sets out a range of protections against the use of genetic information by insurers and puts in place until November 2011 a voluntary agreement banning the use by insurers of the results from predictive genetic tests, including tests on breast cancer genes, in deciding the premiums of insurance policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1101W.2/3">During the moratorium no one will be required to disclose the results of a predictive genetic test unless it has been approved by the GAIC and is for insurance of more than &pound;500,000 for life insurance or &pound;300,000 for other health insurance. To date, the only test that has been approved by GAIC is for Huntington's disease for life insurance polices over &pound;500,000, and no applications for any other tests will be submitted before 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1101W.2/4">The current agreement with the insurance industry is flexible enough to respond to fast moving technological and clinical developments in genetic testing. The Government has made clear that any failure of the agreement will lead to the reconsideration of the need for statutory control. Copies of the Concordat are available in the Library and are also available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/publications">www.dh.gov.uk/publications</a>.</p>

I am replying in her absence. (55882)</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/4" class="indent">The tables attached provide the information you have requested. Data for Lancashire constituencies are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Data for Ribble Valley wards are shown in Table 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/5" class="indent">Electoral rolls provide counts of the number of people registered to vote. Local/European electorate and Parliamentary electorate counts for Lancashire constituencies can be found in Table 1 The 2005 figures are the latest available data. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are a number of reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/6" class="indent">The number of people registered with a GP, living in each Lancashire constituency, in July 2004, can also be found in Table 1. It should also be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/7" class="indent">Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/8" class="indent">The projections in Table 2 for mid-2006 to mid-2010 are based on the mid-2003 population estimates and are the latest population projections available. They assume that trends in fertility, mortality and migration at the time of the mid-2003 population estimate will continue into the future. Population projections are not available for most of the Lancashire constituencies because projections are not routinely produced for constituencies. Local Authority population projections are however produced, and where constituency projections are shown, this reflects that these constituencies have common boundaries with local authority districts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/9" class="indent">Ward data are shown in Table 3; the points set out above also apply to wards. However, there are some further points to note for wards. The local government electorate is definitionally closer to the population estimates; however these data are not available at ward level. Hence, the Parliamentary electorate is shown, the most recent data available are for December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/10" class="indent">The ONS does not produce projections of population at ward level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1120W.9/1">A Commencement Order has to be made before the Dangerous Wild Animals (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 comes into force and it is expected that this will be made later in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1120W.9/2">Article 9 of the Order makes provision for a 'Surrender Period' during which a keeper of a Dangerous Wild Animal (DWA) can give up their ownership to the Department of the Environment. In such circumstances the Department must have safe holding facilities in place to accept and house such animals while attempts are made to re-home them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1120W.9/3">Article 6 will give the Department the powers to seize DWAs should the owners be in breach of licence conditions. Again holding facilities are required to hold DWAs in safety while attempts to re-home the animals are made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1120W.9/4">In the operation of this legislation the health and safety of the public is paramount while the welfare of the animals must be considered at all times. The Department is currently in an advanced stage of negotiations with a potential provider of a DWA holding service. The breadth of species listed in the Schedule of the Order requires a range of facilities to cater for the special needs of these creatures. It is expected that these negotiations will be completed shortly and the facilities will be developed to allow for the making of the Commencement Order.</p>

	<p pid="b.1131W.9/2">Seventeen animals died between observation periods in procedures of moderate severity out of over 500 non-human primates used in the Imutran studies between July 1994 and March 2000. Four of these animals died in the immediate post-surgical period before the effects of anaesthesia and sedation had worn off and are not thought to have experienced any suffering.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.9/3">Their reference numbers were: T405, V570, W265 and Y231M. Ten of the animals had welfare problems that had been diagnosed and were receiving appropriate symptomatic, supportive and specific treatment. Their reference numbers were: A168, A471, W264, W762, W741, W774, X535, X538, X540, and Y252F.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.9/4">Three of the animals had been in previously good health and died at five, seven, and 22 days post-surgery. Their reference numbers were: W14, W747, Y247M. Although the causes of death of these last three animals were not determined with absolute certainty, the evidence suggests that their deaths resulted from a combination of the immuno-suppression regimens and organ rejection, rather than surgical complications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.9/5">The evidence available at the time also suggested that death occurred quickly with little suffering being experienced by the individual animals. These judgments were drawn during the Home Office Chief Inspector's review of compliance with the licence authorities granted to Imutran staff for their xenotransplantation research following examination of all of the available documentary evidence, including clinical records, surgeon's notes and post mortem reports. None of the 17 deaths raised issues of non-compliance with the relevant licence authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1138W.3/2">I understand from the chief constable that the decline in BCU strength between March 2004 and March 2005 is due to the transfer of custody officers to a centrally managed criminal justice unit and the creation of operational support teams also centrally resourced. Although these officers continue to be based within each BCU they are not under its control. These changes have been cosmetic and do not reduce the number of officers available for front-line duties in each of the BCUs.</p>

This focuses on ensuring recovered vehicles are kept no longer than necessary, that the police action is fully explained in advance and that advice is provided to help owners protect their property. The Home Office, with other interested parties, is now beginning a wide-ranging review of the fees.</p>

	<p pid="b.1148W.0/41">The Actual Average Clearance Times (AACT) for JSA is measured from the date the customer first contacts Jobcentre Plus to the date the customer is sent a notice of entitlement. The performance of AACT for JSA has increased nationally from 11 days in April 04 to 15 days in December 05. Initial analysis showed that shortfalls in performance in the 'initial contact' part of the process were critical. Delays in contact centres and local service outlets were a contributory factor to the situation as well as the time it can take to gather evidence from third parties before claims can be processed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.0/42" class="indent">Some of our customers did experience problems getting through to our contact centres over the Summer months. Robust plans were put in place to address this, which resulted in week on week improvements. The most recent performance information for our contact centres shows that in the week ending 3rd February we answered over 94 percent of calls offered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.0/43" class="indent">To address the issue of fluctuating clearance times in benefit processing a taskforce has developed immediate recovery measures. Building on the taskforce's work, the Jobcentre Plus Chief Operating Officer launched a National Action Plan in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>. The Action Plan is built around a mandatory series of &quot;health checks&quot;, taking local managers through the whole end to end process, identifying key risk elements and, where a part of the process fails the health check, directing managers to appropriate good practice products and tool-kits. Regular reviews are undertaken to ensure areas of our business do not fall below expectation. We are already seeing improvements following the introduction of these measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1149W.5/1">It was always our intention to phase the introduction of the regulations needed to implement the Pensions Act 2004. The majority of these regulations have been or will be published broadly on the time scale envisaged&mdash;in some cases following consultation. They will come into force in time to ensure the measures in the Act come into effect as intended.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149W.5/2">A number of sets of regulations came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase> which related to the European Directive on Occupational Pensions (Directive 2003/41/EC). These regulations had initially been expected to be in place by <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-23">23 September 2005</phrase>, in line with the overall timetable for implementing the directive. The delay was necessary in order to take account of the issues raised following extensive consultation earlier in the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149W.5/3">There has also been a delay to our planned timetable for the introduction of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2006. Consultation on the regulations raised a large number of helpful technical comments that need to be carefully considered. Therefore, although these regulations were scheduled for April 2006, they will now come into effect in October 2006. The delay will not have any untoward effects on schemes, as the existing regulations will still apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149W.5/4">The Pension Regulator can only publish supporting codes of practice when the relevant regulations have been made and laid. I have no reason to believe that all the codes of practice will not be published as soon as practicable after the relevant regulations have appeared in final form.</p>

It was alleged that the BGS was negligent in not testing for the presence of arsenic during a pilot research study into groundwater movement in central and north eastern Bangladesh in 1992. The Court of Appeal decided that the relationship between the BGS and the claimants, who were not known to the BGS, was too remote for a duty of care towards the claimants to arise.

The employment rate for disabled people was 38.1 per cent. in spring 1998, rising to 46.6 per cent. by spring 2005; over the same period, the employment gap fell from 35.1 per cent. to 28 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1159W.0/1">The Offshore Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats) Regulations 2001 apply the European habitats directive and the wild birds directive in relation to oil and gas projects on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). For the purpose of the regulations, oil and gas activities are defined as those carried out under the Petroleum Act 1998 in connection with the exploration for or production of petroleum on the UKCS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.0/2">The Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971 was replaced last year by the Offshore Petroleum Activities (Oil Pollution, Prevention and Control) Regulations 2005 which introduce a permitting regime to the UK oil and gas industry in relation to any oil discharges to the marine environment. In addition the new regulations introduce more wide-ranging powers for the DTI's Offshore Environmental Inspectors and authorise the introduction of Trading Schemes.</p>

Major high street lenders have made significant steps towards full data sharing including data on current accounts. We will shortly be consulting on removing legislative barriers to the sharing of data on approximately 40 million accounts where the debtors did not give their permission for the data to be shared as part of the credit agreement. The Government are also taking steps to address responsible borrowing, such as improving financial education and the FSA's online debt test, as set out in the Government's Annual Report on Tackling Over-indebtedness.</p>

However, the European Wind Energy Association estimate that more than 72,000 people are currently employed in the wind sector across Europe, with the potential to employ 200,000 people by 2020.

	<p pid="b.1162W.2/1">The Department estimates that there are currently 8,000 people employed in the renewables industry in the UK, the majority of which work in the wind sector. Given the continued growth of the renewables industry in the UK, we estimate that this could rise to between 17,000 and 35,000 jobs by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.1162W.2/2">The Department has established a research advisory group to fund research into the impact of wind farms on the environment, including addressing concerns over seascape, birds and navigational safety. In addition, applications for consent to construct wind farms, submitted to the DTI, are accompanied by an environmental impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1162W.2/3">Indeed projects like the Black Law windfarm demonstrate that, if properly sited, such developments not only produce zero emissions, but can also have a positive impact on the environment. The RSPB make clear that the Black Law windfarm, on the site of an abandoned opencast coalmine, represents an exciting opportunity to deliver real biodiversity benefits through habitat management.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162W.6/1">Young children are particularly vulnerable to death and injury by fire and may also cause fire accidentally. Nearly all fire and rescue services provide fire safety education in schools, supported by materials from the National Community Fire Safety Centre. Most fire and rescue services also work with individual young firesetters and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published good practice guidance in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1162W.6/2">To ensure early and effective intervention and education, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recently published for public consultation a draft Fire and Rescue Service Strategy for Children and Young People.

	<p pid="b.1167W.2/2">However, figures on reported budgets at the beginning of each year and total service expenditure, which shows actual expenditure in the year are available. The figures provided are based on the total service expenditure. This is the only definition for which figures are available on a consistent basis from 2000&ndash;01 to 2005&ndash;06. This is because fire authorities in shire areas were financed largely by contributions from county councils and unitary authorities in their area before 2004&ndash;05, and these amounts were netted off under all the other definitions. Since 2005&ndash;06 fire authorities have been able to finance their budget directly. Year-on-year percentage change in real terms has been calculated using the HM Treasury's GDP deflators.</p>

	<p pid="b.1172W.5/1">The Government are committed to promoting human rights overseas, as set out in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's annual reports on human rights. Our most recent assessments of the situations in the countries listed in the question are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/2" class="italic">Uganda</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/3">There remains a great deal to do to secure full respect for human rights in Uganda. We are particularly concerned by the situation in northern Uganda. As a result of the long-running conflict, 1.7 million people are living in appalling conditions in internally displaced peoples' camps and over 20,000 children have been abducted by the rebel Lord's Resistance Army since 1988.</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/4">We continue to emphasise the importance of upholding human rights in our discussions with the Ugandan government. There have been some positive developments. In June 2005, the constitutional court ruled that mandatory death sentences were unconstitutional. Uganda benefits from an independent judiciary and a relatively free press but concerns do remain regarding restrictions on political freedom and reports of arbitrary detention and torture.</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/5" class="italic">Uzbekistan</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/6">We remain gravely concerned by the situation in Uzbekistan. There have been some welcome steps, albeit limited, by the government of Uzbekistan to implement their national action plan on torture based on international recommendations; and President Karimov has announced plans to abolish the death penalty by <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase>. However, overall there has been a clear deterioration in the human rights situation in Uzbekistan. The arbitrary arrest, detention and trials of eye-witnesses to the events in Andizhan of 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-05-13">13 May 2005</phrase> have been accompanied by increasing restrictions on freedom of expression, thought, conscience and religion, by a continuing refusal to register political parties, and by ongoing harassment, detention and trial of human rights defenders, journalists and others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/7" class="italic">The People's Republic of China</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/8">We have serious concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China. Although China has done much in recent years to reduce poverty and promote economic development, we believe China also needs to make substantive progress on human rights and implement serious political reforms to match its economic development. We continue to engage critically with China through the UK China Human Rights Dialogue, Ministerial contacts and EU mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/9" class="italic">Rwanda</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/10">The human rights situation in Rwanda still gives grounds for concern, but Rwanda is making progress. We regularly meet local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Rwandan National Human Rights Commission to discuss the human rights situation. We are monitoring Rwanda's implementation of its 5-year strategy on human rights, particularly freedom of expression and judicial independence. We have raised with the government issues such as alleged human rights abuses committed by the security services, and urged that perpetrators to be brought swiftly to trial. We have also raised our concerns on opening political space in Rwanda. There are some encouraging signs that are functioning, if not truly independent, civil society is emerging.</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/11" class="italic">The Maldives</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.5/12">We continue to have concerns about the human rights situation in the Maldives, particularly freedom of expression and association and the right to fair trials conducted with due legal process. We share concerns that recent trials of political activists appear to have political motivations. We regularly make clear our concerns to the government of the Maldives both bilaterally, and with EU partners. We promote improvements in human rights where we can and have supported the work of the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, NGOs concerned with fair trials and the training of journalists.</p>

The Government has also recently expressed disappointment at the hard line the Chinese Government takes on limiting freedom of expression and information. We believe both are essential to the development of a modern, stable and sustainable society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173W.2/2">The WSIS general preamble (&quot;The Tunis Commitment&quot;), to which all UN member States signed up, is a reaffirmation of human rights and freedom of expression. This explicitly recognises &quot;that freedom of expression and the free flow of information, ideas, and knowledge, are essential for the Information Society&quot;. Member States also agreed the more detailed &quot;Tunis Agenda&quot;, which reaffirms the freedom to seek, receive, impart and use information and the need to respect freedom of expression when taking measures to ensure Internet security.</p>

	<p pid="b.1178W.5/1">During his visit to the region in January, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary held meetings with the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan and Foreign Minister Gul. With both he discussed Turkey's application to join the EU and the prospects for a settlement in Cyprus. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary also reaffirmed the UK's commitment to Turkey's accession process, and urged Turkey to keep up its reform efforts to align itself with the EU acquis. On Cyprus, he stressed his desire for all parties to make progress towards a comprehensive settlement under UN auspices and a normalisation of relations in the region.</p>

The Commission presented its first screening reports, on Science and Research and Education and Culture, to Member States in February, concluding that Turkey is ready to open negotiations in both chapters. Following the presentation of the Commission's screening reports it is for Member States to consider whether to set benchmarks for Turkey to fulfil before the opening of chapters, and then decide whether any chapters are ready to be opened. The relevant Council Working Group has recently recommended the opening of the Science and Research Chapter and we expect this to happen during the Austrian Presidency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184W.6/1">Counter-drugs activities form part of the Royal Navy's deployments to the Caribbean and provide a visible presence as one element of the UK's broader counter-drugs engagement in the region. These activities are co-ordinated by HM Revenue and Customs, and involve agencies from a number of our international partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.6/2">As well as counter-drugs tasks, the primary purposes of the Caribbean deployment (Atlantic Patrol Task (North)) are to promote UK interests and provide security to UK Overseas Territories, including support to humanitarian operations and disaster relief. Traditionally, this support has been needed most during the hurricane season.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.6/3">The decision to reduce the length of the deployment in 2006 was taken following a review of the Royal Navy's standing tasks and commitments. This was explained in the Government's response to the House of Commons Defence Committee's Fourth Report of Session 2004&ndash;05 on the 'Future Capabilities' Command Paper. The shorter assignment period will apply for 2006 only, after which it is planned to resume year-round assignment of a frigate/destroyer to the region.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190W.8/1">Apportionment of Fleet vessels to standing tasks is decided on the basis of operational effects and capabilities required. Hence the most appropriate ships available are assigned to a given task. The Royal Navy is therefore ready, where appropriate, to deploy units other than destroyers or frigates to fulfil naval tasks traditionally fulfilled by them. An example of this is HMS current operational deployment East of Suez. On the same principle, it is perfectly possible that operations in the Caribbean will on occasion be undertaken by units other than frigates and destroyers.</p>

Our policy of offering and recommending an HIV test to every pregnant woman as part of their antenatal care, along with associated measures, including use of anti-retroviral drugs, has resulted in a significant reduction of mother-to-baby transmission of HIV infection. In 2004, approximately 92 per cent. of HIV infected pregnant women were diagnosed before delivery.

	<p pid="b.1195W.8/1">Information on the numbers of people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195W.8/2">The assessment and treatment of ADHD is usually undertaken by child psychiatrists. However, it is increasingly common for paediatricians to diagnose and manage ADHD in children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195W.8/3">A treatment programme should not rely on medication alone and psychological interventions which focus on the behaviour of the child, family interactions, classroom problems and learning difficulties should be offered. A comprehensive assessment involving more than one professional perspective will highlight the various problems that need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195W.8/4">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) appraisal on the use of methylphenidate, commonly known as Ritalin, recommended that methylphenidate should only be used as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for children with diagnosis of severe ADHD, Methylphenidate is not the only medication option with atomoxetine and dexamfetamine also available. NICE will be issuing guidance on the use of all three shortly. NICE will also be commencing work later this year on a guideline on the management and identification of ADHD in children, young people and adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195W.8/5">As part of the children's national service framework, we are publishing a series of exemplar patient journeys. This series will be an exemplar on ADHD. We anticipate this being published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1197W.2/32">Patient counts</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/33">Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier Hospital Episodes Statistics identification HESID. This identifier is derived based on the patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/34">All diagnoses count of patients</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/35">These figures represent a count of all patients where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/36">Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/37">The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 200203) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/38">Secondary diagnoses</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/39">As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&ndash;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/40">PCT, SHA data quality</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/41">PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002&ndash;03 boundaries, as a one off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on the PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&ndash;97, 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&ndash;87 and 1998&ndash;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.</p>

	<p pid="b.1198W.2/1">Since the announcement of the 8.5 million budget for developing new services for those with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), we have established 13 clinical network co-ordinating centres, 36 local multi-disciplinary teams, as well as 11 specialist children and young people's teams distributed across England. These new centres have been created to provide services for those with CFS/ME where there was no existing provision, each centre covers up to eight primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198W.2/2">The latest figures show that 8,646 adults and 439 children and young adults have been seen. The new centres are expected to see 21,000 patients annually when working at full capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198W.2/3">Applications for funding to establish CFS/ME services were assessed by an investment steering group consisting of health professionals, as well as patient and carer representatives. The criteria used by the steering group included strategy and partnership working, the proposed service organisation and staffing structure, as well as the need to ensure an even geographic distribution of centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198W.2/4">Future funding of CFS/ME services will be included within the resource allocations to primary care trusts to facilitate the continuation of the service once the ring-fenced period ends. CFS/ME services will therefore be considered as part of the future local planning of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198W.2/5">National Health Service organisations are expected to demonstrate that they are making progress towards achieving the level of service quality described in the national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions. The NSF sets out a clear vision of how health and social care organisations can improve the quality, consistency and responsiveness of their services and help improve the lives of people with neurological conditions, including CFS/ME. This may include taking steps to ensure the establishment of further CFS/ME centres, if there is a local need.</p>

	<p pid="b.1201W.2/2">All National Health Service trusts and primary care trusts should breakeven every year. NHS trusts have a financial breakeven duty to balance their income and expenditure over a three or, in exceptional circumstances, five-year period. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have the discretion to agree a recovery plan that will return them to balance over this period. However, as SHAs have the responsibility for ensuring the NHS organisations across their areas are in financial balance every year, if they agree to one organisation overspending, they require another NHS organisation within the health economy to underspend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1201W.8/2">There are a number of factors that affect levels of children's registrations. The published registration figures reflect those children who attend a national health service dentist at least once within the most recent 15-month period and therefore exclude some children who attend less regularly than every 15 months. The level of registrations will also be affected by parents' perception of whether their children need to have dental treatment, by the availability of NHS dentistry in some areas and by the decision of some parents to choose private treatment for their children. The registration rate for children has been broadly stable since 1998.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.6/2">DPB payment data shows that on average, a dentist with a reasonable National Health Service commitment in 2004&ndash;05 in the general dental services (CDS) received gross CDS income of about &pound;154,350. At 2005&ndash;06 remuneration levels, this would be a gross CDS income of around &pound;159,600. Dentists with a reasonable commitment are defined as those with gross fee earnings of &pound;59,100 or more. These averages covered some 7,640 CDS principal dentists who worked throughout the year 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.6/3">HM Revenue and Customs information from dentists1 tax returns show that the average ratio of expenses to gross earnings for a highly committed NHS dentist is around 52 per cent. (2003&ndash;04 tax year). The same source gives average net income of a highly committed NHS dentist from all sources as &pound;78,600 in the tax year 2003&ndash;04, which would equate to an average of about &pound;83,500 in 2005&ndash;06. This information is taken from the tax returns of 392 GDS principal dentists who were in non-associate business arrangements for whom the tax year ended between January and March 2004. Based on the data available from these sources, the Department estimates that a highly committed NHS dentist has an average income of around &pound;80,000 in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="b.1205W.0/1">Delayed transfers of care have been a priority area for action since 2001 when the health and social care change agent team was created specifically to help local health and social care communities tackle the problem. Delays in the acute sector have fallen since then by over 65 per cent. by December 2005, releasing about 1.5 million bed days a year. Delayed transfers of care are an issue for the whole health and social care system and require concerted action from all parties&mdash; acute sector, primary care trusts, local authorities and the voluntary and independent sector&mdash;to make sure people get the right care at the right time in the right place. They are expected to work together to agree how resources, such as the delayed discharges grant to local authorities, can be invested to develop services that enable people to be treated at home wherever possible or close to home in intermediate care or other rehabilitation services. The reimbursement scheme provides financial incentives to local authorities to complete their assessments quickly and enable people to move from acute hospital beds at the optimum time. The Government is currently considering an extension to reimbursement to non acute and mental health sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.0/2">Delays in accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments have been cut dramatically in recent years, including waits for admission. Alongside headline improvements in total time spent in A&amp;E for all patients, the percentage of patients waiting over four hours for admission following a decision to admit being made has fallen from 13 per cent. at the end of September 2001 to one per cent. as at the end of September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.1206W.0/3">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued guidance to hospital trusts that they should undertake a local risk assessment within their hospital to determine those areas where it is safe to permit mobile telephone usage and those areas where usage should be prohibited, due to the presence of electrically sensitive medical devices, for example. This risk assessment should cover not only the publics' use of mobile telephones and other radio equipment, but also the use of communication equipment by hospital staff and the emergency services.</p>

Restrictions in other areas of the hospital premises may be introduced for reasons other than their impact on the safety of medical equipment, such as the desire to reduce the disruption caused by the uncontrolled use of mobile phones and the possible invasion of patients' privacy from mobile telephones with built in cameras, for example.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207W.8/2">A high level review on options available to the NHS Business Services Authority for achieving the arms length body (ALB) sector target savings was concluded in September 2005. This report concluded that a business model that sought to gain synergies through merging the processes of the ALBs, and taking advantage of the private sector capabilities to deliver those processes, was most likely to meet the target savings. In relation to further outsourcing of the functions of the merging ALBs the following assessments are in hand:</p>

	<p pid="b.1207W.8/4">Within the original contract negotiated with Paymaster (1836) Limited is a provision to move at some point in the future to full outsourcing.

	<p pid="b.1207W.8/9">A business case for expanding the Astron contract demonstrated that better value could be obtained from it compared to performing the same activity in-house.

	<p pid="b.1211W.6/2">We are committed to a mixed economy in decontamination in the National Health Service. NHS trusts may choose to redevelop their own services to meet the national standards, they may obtain the service from private contractors by market testing, they may obtain the service as part of a larger private finance initiative project or they may join with other NHS bodies to redevelop the service by means of a joint venture with a private sector service provider.</p>

	<p pid="b.1211W.6/4">Each super centre will have a joint venture management board (JVMB) and an instrument review committee (IRG) made up of NHS personnel who will regularly review the performance of the service provider and work in partnership to discuss requirements and maintain innovation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211W.6/5">The IRC and JVMB will also be responsible for specifying requirements and benchmarking arrangements to ensure fair competition and best value in terms of both quality and price.</p>

It is our intention to support both markets by ensuring that agreements are in place that reflect the changing requirements of the NHS, whilst providing opportunities for innovation through competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211W.6/7">There are currently a number of national framework agreements in place for products associated with decontamination, some of which are provided through the NHS Logistics Authority.

	<p pid="b.1213W.3/1">The consultation and analysis done by the human genetics commission jointly with the genetics and insurance committee (GAIC) has been used to inform the development of the Government's and insurer's &quot;Concordat and Moratorium on Genetics and Insurance&quot;, published in March 2005. This document ensures that the use of genetic information by insurance companies will be transparent, fair, and subject to independent oversight. It sets out a range of protections against the use of genetic information by insurers and puts in place until November 2011 a voluntary agreement banning the use by insurers of the results from predictive genetic tests, including tests on breast cancer genes, in deciding the premiums of insurance policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213W.3/2">During the moratorium no one will be required to disclose the results of a predictive genetic test unless it has been approved by the GAIC and is for insurance of more than &pound;500,000 for life insurance or &pound;300,000 for other health insurance. To date, the only test that has been approved by GAIC is for Huntington's disease for life insurance polices over &pound;500,000, and no applications for any other tests will be submitted before 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213W.3/3">The current agreement with the insurance industry is flexible enough to respond to fast moving technological and clinical developments in genetic testing. The Government has made clear that any failure of the agreement will lead to the reconsideration of the need for statutory control. Copies of the Concordat are available in the Library and are also available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/publications">www.dh.gov.uk/publications</a>.</p>

These show that in England and Wales there were 792 deliberate fires in schools and 118 deliberate fires in further education establishments that year&mdash;910 such fires in total. ODPM's Cost of Fire Estimates for 2003 show that the average cost of property damage for public sector buildings, which includes educational premises, was &pound;45,410 in England and Wales.

	<p pid="b.1217W.2/1">Since it went live in April 2002, the Communication Aids Project has assisted some 4,000 children of school age experiencing significant difficulty in communicating with those around them. The project has been successful but we have always made it clear, through the referral process and otherwise, that CAP was there to supplement, and not replace, provision made locally. The present tranche of funding is time-limited and comes to an end in March 2006. With other pressures on funding arising from the Government's ambitious agenda for education, it has not been possible to extend the funding for CAP.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.2/2">Addressing severe communication difficulties is clearly an important part of meeting individual needs for local service providers. Where children are concerned, we would be looking to children's services, through children's trusts, to provide appropriate support and equipment to all disabled children. Adult needs would be met by local authorities and primary care trusts working together through their integrated community equipment services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218W.5/2">We will place a duty on local authorities to provide advice and assistance to parents when expressing preferences for schools. We are investing in a network of choice advisers to provide practical support to parents most likely to need extra help with the admissions process. This will ensure that ALL parents, including the most disadvantaged, will be able to make an informed choice of school for their child.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218W.5/3">We will make it easier for schools to adopt banding to ensure that the pupils admitted to the schools are representative of all levels of ability. This can give children living further away more chance of obtaining entry to schools than would have been the case if distance had been the main criterion. We also intend to reduce inequalities by giving disadvantaged parents easier access to a wider choice of schools. The White Paper proposals will extend school transport rights for low income groups to remove barriers to effective choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218W.5/4">School failure is more prevalent in deprived areas, so disadvantaged children may be more likely than their peers to attend a weak school. The Schools White Paper proposals contain firm measures to ensure that school failure and underperformance is addressed more rapidly and more decisively.</p>

	<p pid="b.1221W.5/1">We are concerned that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils are among the lowest achieving in our schools. In 2003 the Government launched a national strategy to tackle the underachievement of minority ethnic pupils. This included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting Gypsy, Roma and Traveller young people, including a national pilot project testing strategies to improve attendance and raise attainment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.5/2">The findings from this pilot have informed the development of a national programme of work to support local authorities and schools with large numbers of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils to better meet their needs. This will be launched in 12 local authorities in April 2006 and follows up a commitment we made in the Schools White Paper.</p>

Departmental guidance 'Child Protection: Preventing Unsuitable People from working with Children and Young Persons in the Education Service' gives comprehensive advice on the full range of pre-employment checks that need to be undertaken before employing an individual including obtaining CRB checks. Employers must make a judgment on the suitability of the applicant in hand. CRB checks are mandatory for all those working in regulated child care settings and for all newly appointed teachers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.8/3">Any individual who appears on list 99 or the POCA List (other than provisionally) on the grounds of unsuitability to work with children is barred from working in a &quot;regulated position&quot; within the meaning of section 36 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 which includes a position where normal duties include caring for, training, supervising or being in charge of children.</p>

Because this data is based on a relatively small number of projects, we have commissioned the Building Research Establishment (BRE) to carry out a cost benefit analysis of installing sprinklers in new school buildings.

The Education Act 2002 introduced the requirement that a local authority run a competition where it proposed to establish an additional secondary school as a community or foundation school. These measures came into force in June 2003 but there have been no competitions to date. The Education Act 2005 will extend the requirement for competitions to all proposals for new secondary schools, including replacement schools, but the provisions have not yet been commenced.

	<p pid="b.1232W.2/1">The Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture Media and Sport are jointly implementing the national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy in England. In the five years to 2008 over &pound;1.5 billion is being invested (including &pound;686 million lottery funding) to implement the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/2">The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/3">Spearheading this strategy is the creation of a national PE/sports infrastructure, by establishing a network of Sports Colleges and School Sport Partnerships (families of schools which work together). There are currently 411 live partnerships incorporating 80 per cent. of schools in England. The 2004/05 school sport survey results found that overall, 69 per cent. of pupils within a School Sport Partnership were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. In 2003/04 this figure was 62 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1233W.6/1">This annual volume brings together a range of data from various sources. A potential problem with one of the sources was found in January 2005 and since then analysis has been carried out to identify the underlying cause and to explore potential solutions. This analysis is continuing and this interim version of the volume was released in January so as not to hold up the release of the majority of the tables, which are unaffected. As a national statistics publication, the content and the timing of the release are determined by the Department's head of profession for statistics and are not influenced by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.6/2">The problem relates to the way that members of the leadership group are identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.6/3">Further work is required, but it is now clear that a number of head teachers have been mis-recorded as either deputy or assistant heads.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.6/4">The information in question is based on service details from the Teachers Pension Scheme. This is maintained primarily for pension administration purposes but is also used for statistical purposes. The grade issue does not affect pension administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.6/5">The on-going analysis shows that the problem appears to relate to the introduction of the leadership pay spine in September 2000. Consequently, some tables within previous editions of the volume are affected. A note explaining how each table is affected has been added as an annex to the explanatory notes on the Research and Statistics Gateway <sup>1</sup> . Statistical first releases on the school workforce don't use data from the pension scheme and are not affected in any way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.6/6">Further analysis is being carried out during February with a view to finalising the volume in March. If possible, updated or amended tables will be included. If the further work indicates that the problem is likely to take longer to resolve, any possible additions or amendments will be released on the Research and Statistics Gateway, alongside the volume, as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1234W.11/1">We are concerned that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils are amongst the lowest achieving in our schools. In 2003 the Government launched a national strategy to tackle the underachievement of minority ethnic pupils. This included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting Gypsy, Roma and Traveller young people, including a national pilot project testing strategies to improve attendance and raise attainment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234W.11/2">The findings from this pilot have informed the development of a national programme of work to support local authorities and schools with large numbers of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils to better meet their needs. This will be launched in April 2006 and follows up a commitment we made in the schools White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="b.1235W.5/1">Ministers and Officials have met a wide variety of schools and organisations, including some higher education institutions in the North West, to explore interest and discuss ideas for how the trust school model might be developed. We do not hold a comprehensive list of every organisation that has expressed interest or asked for information about forming a trust to support a school. I have placed in the Library of the House a list of a number of those organisations with whom we have discussed trust schools since publication of the White Paper. We are engaged in early discussions with a number of other organisations, including some hgher education ienstitutions in the North West and will release information about them once they have agreed to be involved in a pathfinder (except in cases where release might prejudice discussions with stakeholders in the project) or if they have agreed to be publicly named as working with the Government to develop the trust school model.</p>

	<p pid="b.1236W.2/1">It will be for individual school governing bodies to decide, following consultation with parents and other stakeholders, whether they want to acquire a Trust and choose whom they want to work with to support them. However there will be safeguards. All Trusts must be charities and the consultation will need to set out who the members of the charity will be. Local Authorities will be able to refer plans to acquire a Trust to the Schools Adjudicator if it is clear the school has not consulted properly, or if they are concerned that the acquisition of the trust would have a negative impact on school standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236W.2/2">Certain categories of people will not be allowed to be involved in a trust. These will include those disqualified under company or charity law and those who have been disqualified from working with children and young people. If enacted, the Education and Inspections Bill will also put into place other safeguards. It would give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations prescribing requirements as to persons to be disqualified from acting as charity Trustees. In addition, it would give the Secretary of State a reserve power, in prescribed cases, to remove any charity Trustee, even if the person is not otherwise disqualified, and to appoint charity Trustees.</p>
