	<p pid="b.2W.2/12" class="indent">2008-09: Four lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.2W.2/13">None of these items have been lost by the DCMS itself or stolen from DCMS buildings. At any one time approximately 70 per cent. of the Government art collection's holding of over 13,500 works of art is on display in over 400 buildings operated by different Government Departments in the UK and around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.2W.2/14">No insurance claim has been made for any of the lost items as none of them were commercially insured (HMG carries its own risk). The borrower's commercial insurance was in place for the two items stolen from Somerset House whilst on loan, in February 2008. DCMS did not take the payout because the two items were recovered by the police (in September 2008).</p>
	<p pid="b.2W.2/15">Estimated valuations have not been provided in this answer. In common with other national collections, the Government art collection is normally not commercially insured nor treated as a financial asset. Against a background of constant and volatile fluctuations in the art market, current valuations of every work of art in the collection are not maintained.</p>

However, the Nepal Defence Army (NDA), an extremist Hindu fundamentalist group, has carried out a number of attacks, including a bomb attack on a Catholic church in Kathmandu on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-23">23 May 2009</phrase> in which three people were killed, the murder of a Catholic priest at Dharan in July 2008, and a bomb attack on a Muslim mosque in Biratnagar in March 2008, in which two people were killed.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.6/2">The Nepalese Prime Minister and political leaders from across the political spectrum swiftly condemned the attack in May and visited the church and the victims. The Nepal police launched a prompt investigation into the incident and have arrested both the women responsible for placing the bomb and four leaders of the NDA, including its chairman, R. P. Mainali.</p>

	<p pid="b.18W.9/1">The in-service support solution for the Queen Elizabeth (QE) class aircraft carriers has yet to reach its main investment decision point, and so no decision has yet been taken on this issue. All options for QE class docking will be thoroughly examined; this will include potential location and commercial options for docking work. While overseas locations have not been ruled out, given the nature of these ships and security issues, it is unlikely that this would provide the best solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.22W.11/1">The original requirement was for a number of Sniper Thermal Imaging Capability (STIC) systems as an Urgent Operational Requirement. This was advertised in the Defence Contracts Bulletin and eight companies expressed an interest. Five companies were unable to meet the key requirement to provide a thermal device that would work in line with the in-service day sight, and a further two companies could not supply equipment in time for user trials. The remaining company's equipment was trialled, modified in the light of the trials results and a contract for the supply of STIC was agreed with Qioptiq Ltd. in March 2008. Since the initial contract further STIC units have been ordered from the company. The Sniper Thermal Imaging Capability was introduced into service in July 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.25W.8/1">Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to complications should they get swine flu and so the Department strongly recommends that pregnant women should have the vaccine. Health care staff have been given the extensive information to provide to their patients about the vaccine, how it will protect them and how it has been tested to ensure safety. This information is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/swinefluvaccinetools">www.dh.gov.uk/swinefluvaccinetools</a></p>
	<p pid="b.25W.8/3">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has recommended that pregnant women should be given Pandemrix since a one-dose schedule with this vaccine appears to give adequate levels of antibodies and thereby confers more rapid protection than would be afforded by a two-dose schedule. Expert scientific advice is clear that thiomersal-containing vaccines, such as Pandemrix, do not present a risk to pregnant women or their offspring. However, as it is better to be vaccinated than not at all, if a pregnant woman does not wish to receive Pandemrix despite receiving clear advice about the more rapid protection this would offer, we have advised that primary care trusts should ensure that there are arrangements in place for the woman to be able to receive Celvapan, and that general practitioners are aware of these.</p>

	<p pid="b.27W.10/1">We have made no such assessments. The foundry sector has reduced in size slightly in recent years as most basic iron casting work is now carried out by producers in low cost countries such as China. However, the UK does have a number of successful castings companies concentrating on higher value-added products for use in a wide range of technically-demanding applications including aerospace, oil, gas and power generation. The quality of these products is regarded as world-class and the UK also benefits from a leading R and D organisation, Castings Technology International.</p>

In June this year The Insolvency Service published the first Review of Insolvency Practitioner Regulation, which the service intends to publish annually.

	<p pid="b.33W.5/1">At present operation of The Insolvency Service is regulated through the requirement to produce, and lay in Parliament, an annual corporate plan, as well as annual fees orders, which sets the fees charged by official receivers for the work they carry out in dealing with bankruptcy and insolvency case administration. For The Services' work in company investigation and enforcement, and redundancy payments, funding is set through allocations made from BIS and HMRC respectively and the level of this allocation is made in response to submissions from The Service to each Department, as part of their wider budget setting.</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.5/2">For all areas of The Service, The Corporate Plan sets out its vision for delivering services for the next three years, with particular emphasis on its plans and targets for the coming year. The Plan is reviewed by BIS to ensure that its goals are realistic and that targets are achievable within the resources available, and yet are set at a level to stretch the organisation and not allow complacency. Performance against the targets and budgets thus set is reported to the Minister on a quarterly basis.</p>

In most insolvency cases it is for the liquidation or creditors' committee to determine the basis for fixing the remuneration or, in the absence of such a committee, the creditors decide the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.34W.2/3">Although the court can review fees charged by insolvency practitioners the proposed amendments to the insolvency rules, which are due to come into force in April next year, include provisions that will enable creditors to obtain further information and thereby make it easier for greater scrutiny of office-holders' remuneration and expenses. The amendments also make it clearer how to challenge such remuneration and expenses.</p>

	<p pid="b.35W.5/1">The Postcode Address File (PAF) dataset was designed and engineered by Royal Mail and is owned and managed by the company as a commercial asset of the business. Under Section 116 of the Postal Services Act 2000, Royal Mail must maintain the PAF and make it available to any person who wishes to use it on such terms as are reasonable. This requirement is replicated as a condition of Royal Mail's licence issued and monitored by the postal regulator, Postcomm. Provision exists for Royal Mail to recover a reasonable charge for the supply of PAF and it must not impose any term or condition other than reasonable restrictions to safeguard its intellectual property rights (IPR) and to ensure that the PAF and its updates are used to support effective addressing.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.5/2">Postcomm carried out a consultation on the PAF in 2006, which took all the diverse uses of the PAF into account before reaching its decision in 2007, announcing more safeguards for the management of the address information held in the PAF with the aim of making sure that the PAF is maintained properly and made available on fair and reasonable terms. The findings of the consultation can be found on Postcomm's website:</p>

	<p pid="b.36W.3/1">The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) is a GB-wide obligation on electricity and gas suppliers with more than 50,000 customers to achieve 185mt CO2 savings in the domestic sector. It runs from April 2008 to March 2011. The costs of the scheme fall to energy suppliers. The Government estimate that the cost to suppliers of meeting the obligation over the three years is &#163;3.2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.3/2">Energy suppliers contract with third party installers, primarily insulators, to source and supply these measures on their behalf. By March 2009 suppliers had achieved 55.3mt CO2 savings, reaching over one million households with insulation measures alone. CERT supports the full spectrum of energy efficiency measures and independent estimates from November 2008 (Element Energy: An Assessment of the size of the UK household energy efficiency market) showed that there are 50,000 people directly involved in the domestic energy efficiency products and services market (with a much larger number c.900,000 in supporting areas).</p>

	<p pid="b.46W.2/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) does not collect data by local authority area and the data provided are by Youth Offending Team (YOT) area. I have placed in the Libraries of the House a table that shows data on the number of times that under-18s have been placed in young offender institutions (YOIs), secure training centres (STCs) and secure children's homes (SCHs), since April 2001. Data prior to 2001 are not available in the format requested and cannot be provided without disproportionate costs. 18-year-olds are not placed in STCs or SCHs, and are placed in young adult (18-21) YOIs, separate from under-18s, and therefore data on 18-year-olds have not been included.</p>
	<p pid="b.46W.2/2">The data have been provided by the YJB and are drawn from administrative computer systems. As with any large scale recording system, the data are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing and may be subject to change over time.</p>
