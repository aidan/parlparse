For existing cases a mapping exercise was carried out which assigned disability care code to primary disabling condition and disability mobility code to secondary condition. Information Directorate has updated the methodology used to derive main disabling condition to reflect this change in the live system. The old category D08 (blindness) is now subdivided into a range of more specific condition codes. These are referred to by the over-arching title &quot;Visual Disorder&quot;.  3. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5 per cent. sample data are generally the preferred source for analysis on disabling condition as information is more complete for disabling condition on the 5 per cent. sample (some recipients of disability living allowance who transferred from the attendance allowance system may not have been allocated a specific disabling condition code. This problem can be corrected on the sample data but not on the WPLS data. The number of cases affected is decreasing over time). In this case the WPLS data have been used as some of the caseload figures produced are very small and so would have a high level of statistical variation should the sample data have been used.  <i> Source:</i>  DWP Information Directorate: Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.518W.2/1">The Pathways to Work programme was first introduced in pilot areas in October 2003. It has always been available to existing incapacity benefits claimants on a voluntary basis, as has our suite of specialist disability employment provision. In April 2008 Pathways to Work completed its national roll-out and is now accessible by everybody receiving incapacity benefits and Employment and Support Allowance in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/2">Conditionality regimes for existing incapacity benefits and Employment and Support Allowance claimants are set out in the White Paper 'Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future' (Cm 7506).</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/3">Upon transfer to Employment and Support Allowance, existing incapacity benefits claimants not in the &quot;invest to save&quot; pathfinder areas will receive:</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/4" class="indent">(i) three mandatory Work Focused Interviews and access to other elements of the Pathways to Work programme, for claimants aged under 50;</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/5" class="indent">(ii) one mandatory Work Focused Interview and access to other elements of Pathways to Work for claimants aged 50 and above; and</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/6" class="indent">(iii) pilots trialing new forms of support for claimants aged 50 and above.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/7">In addition to the above, claimants will continue to have access to the Jobcentre Plus Disability Employment Adviser who can offer advice on the range of specialist disability provision for those with complex disability related barriers to work. A new specialist disability programme will be introduced in October 2010 to replace some of the existing provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/8">Nationally, new Employment and Support Allowance claimants will continue to have access to back to work support through Pathways to Work. From late 2010 we will extend to two years the period during which new claimants are required to engage with us through work-focused interviews. In addition Employment and Support Allowance claimants in progression to work pathfinder areas, or personalised employment programme pilots, will be required to undertake work related activity in certain circumstances from 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/9">Claimants placed in the Support Group will not be required to undertake any mandatory activities, although they will be able to volunteer for back-to-work support.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.2/10">Once disabled people have secured a job or have a firm job offer they may also be eligible for the Access to Work programme which can assist with the costs of support to help them overcome work related obstacles resulting from disability.</p>

	<p pid="b.519W.2/1">Receipt of Disability Living Allowance at any level does not automatically mean that a person will be considered as having limited capability for work for the purposes of Employment and Support Allowance. Entitlement criteria for Employment and Support Allowance are based on functional ability, not on the benefits an individual receives or their diagnosis. Entitlement to Disability Living Allowance depends on a person's care and mobility needs, not their capability for work. Each person is assessed on an individual basis to determine whether their level of functional ability is such that it is unreasonable to require them to work.</p>

	<p pid="b.528W.9/2">Mid-term evaluation of FIFG shows that 40 harbour projects and 154 processing and marketing companies were assisted between 2001 and June 2005.<sup>(1)</sup> In addition, &pound;5.2 million was spent on launching 71 projects led by industry members, including 15 promotional and 11 market research schemes. As a direct measure to assist fishermen, &pound;900,000 was spent financing gear selectivity trials and vessel operational efficiencies.<sup>(2)</sup></p>

Ofwat sets the water companies targets to reduce their leakage to the economic level, the level of leakage at which it would cost more to make further reductions than to produce water from another source. Since 1997, total leakage has been reduced by 27 per cent. in England and Wales. All water companies met their leakage targets during 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.549W.3/2">It is not the practice of this Department to release personal information, such as the names of these two individuals. The individuals were initially held at a US detention facility in Baghdad before they were transferred to US detention facilities at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. As my predecessor made clear in his statement, when this information came to light officials immediately engaged with their US counterparts and were assured that the individuals are held in a humane, safe and secure environment that meets international standards that are consistent with applicable cultural and religious norms. I am satisfied that these assurances are reliable; although there is no formal legal power for the UK to demand access to the individuals, close relationships with the US satisfy me that this is not required. After <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase> the UK has no power of detention in Iraq so demanding the return of these two individuals would not be practical nor possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.3/3">The review examined the available historical records, which suggest that British officials became aware of an intention to transfer in March 2004, although this was some days after the initial capture had occurred. British officials had learned by mid-June 2004 that the individuals had been transferred to Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.552W.5/18" class="indent">From the way the data is held, it is not possible to identify the specific reasons why the longest repairs took the time they did to complete. In general, repairs can take longer based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the work, whether accommodation is occupied or the availability of parts and materials that are required to finalise repairs. In many cases the fault is temporarily repaired at the first visit, but additional work is required to complete it.</p>

	<p pid="b.555W.2/1">Since the end of World War II, the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals (known as the HD Committee) has maintained a policy that it will not consider the belated institution of awards and medals for service given many years earlier. The reason for this policy is that the present HD Committee cannot put itself in the place of the Committee which made the original decision and which would have been able to take account of the views of the Government and of other interested parties at the time of the decision. The HD Committee has made it clear on a number of occasions in response to requests for the institution of belated awards, that it will not reconsider this policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.2/2">It has never been the Government's policy to consider service of a particular specialist nature such as the British nuclear test programme as the sole justification for the institution of a medal. It would be divisive to offer service personnel a medal simply for being involved in this project, when those who have undertaken other specialist duties would be excluded from receiving any award. This does not imply that their contribution to the defence of the country has not been appreciated.</p>

	<p pid="b.557W.3/1">It is our policy that armed forces personnel should be recruited to be fully fit for deployment worldwide on operations. For this reason, the services do not recruit or commission personnel with existing medical conditions which require regular access to medication, such as diabetes. We currently have no plans to review this policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.557W.3/2">This policy is intended to protect sufferers of diabetes from military circumstances which may adversely impact upon their condition and to ensure the effectiveness of the armed forces. For example, a diabetic individual deployed on operations may experience difficulties in monitoring blood or urinary glucose levels; accessing medication; taking regular meals; maintaining a regular sleep pattern; accessing shared-care diabetic clinics; and accessing specialist services such as ophthalmology or chiropody. Such circumstances would adversely impact upon their diabetic control, thus increasing their risk of micro&mdash;and macro-vascular complications. Furthermore, an uncontrolled diabetic may constitute a risk not only to themselves, but also to others in a military or operational context.</p>
	<p pid="b.557W.3/3">Potential recruits are given details during the recruitment process of those medical conditions that make an individual unsuitable for entry into the services, of which diabetes is one. No centralised record is kept of the specific reasons why individuals are turned down on recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.557W.3/4">The single services manage individuals who develop diabetes during their service careers according to their specific operational requirements and each case will be considered on an individual basis. The total number and rank of individuals who were diagnosed with diabetes while serving in the armed forces and are currently still serving is not held centrally, and could be obtained only by examining the medical records of all personnel, which would incur disproportionate cost. While we will make every effort to retain in-service individuals who subsequently develop diabetes (provided that there are worthwhile military roles for them to fulfil), this will normally mean that they will have to be re-graded and will not be able to deploy on operations. This also applies to other disabilities which might arise while an individual is in service but the forces do not recruit individuals where they would only be able to serve from the outset in a medically restricted capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.557W.3/5">The following table presents the numbers of service personnel medically discharged each year between 2004 and 2008 with diabetes as the principal cause leading to discharge. Figures have been compiled using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems version 10 (ICD 10). Small totals of individuals (fewer than 5) are not shown, in line with Office for National Statistics Guidelines, in order to protect individual identities. Such numbers are represented as *.</p>

	<p pid="b.566W.6/2">Information is not held centrally on the number of cases in which a DNA sample has contributed to a conviction. The National DNA Database (NDNAD), which contains profiles obtained from DNA subject samples, does not hold any information indicating either innocence or guilt. It is used as an intelligence database to assist the police in the investigation of crime and detection of potential offenders. The Police National Computer (PNC) holds information on convictions and whether a record exists on the National DNA Database. However, a manual case by case examination would be required to determine whether the DNA profile contributed to the conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.6/3">The European Court of Human Rights in the case of S and Marper recognised that biometric data &quot;pursues the legitimate purpose of the detection, and therefore, prevention of crime&quot;. The National DNA Database contributes to public protection. Between April 1998 and September 2008, there were over 390,000 crimes with DNA matches, providing the police with a lead on the possible identity of the offender. In 2007-08, 17,614 crimes were detected in which a DNA match was available. They included 83 &quot;homicides&quot;, 184 rapes and a further 15,420 additional detections.</p>

	<p pid="b.584W.6/1">The Department and its two agencies (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency) are currently in a three-year pay settlement covered by the Pay Remit process. Discussions took place with trade unions in May 2009 about the possibility of recycling efficiency savings into the pay deal under the terms of the remit guidance but it was clear that the scale of efficiency savings required by the remit would not allow this. Hence, the decision was taken not to request money for 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.6/2">The Department has 10 executive non-departmental public bodies (ENDPBs). Of the eight ENDPBs covered by the Pay Remit process none has requested money saved from efficiency savings to be used for increased pay in their 2009, pay offers to staff. Two ENDPBs were granted leave by HM Treasury to apply the nationally agreed Agenda for Change three year pay settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.594W.6/1">The original Integrated Children's System (ICS) requirements were developed between 2001 and 2003, while children's social care services were the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Health. Ten consultation events were held in 2000 with over 500 representatives from organisations responsible for child welfare in England and Wales, including local authority social services departments, private and voluntary agencies, the then Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, pilot post-qualifying child care courses, software houses, and a number of other interested individuals. Following the Department's assumption of responsibility for ICS, my officials have maintained regular contact with local authority officers involved in implementation. Additional consultative events were held with local authorities in May 2008 to inform my Department's preparation of the specification of ICS Phase 1C.</p>

	<p pid="b.597W.8/2">We have given careful consideration to the issue of whether it would be possible to make an exception to this rule in the case of consumers who have taken over the registration of a vehicle which was previously registered to a spouse who has died, but have concluded that this will not be possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.597W.8/3">The rules of the scheme are that the registered keeper of the old and new vehicle must be the same person, and that the old vehicle must have been registered to the keeper continuously for 12 months before the order date of the new vehicle. This rule was put in place for two main reasons. First, the rule seeks to prevent the sorts of abuses that have taken place in other EU countries, for example where individuals bought a very old car for a token sum simply in order to take advantage of scrappage scheme. Secondly, given the need to provide urgent support to the industry it was imperative to launch the scheme quickly and to ensure the scheme was simple and that bureaucracy and costs for all parties were minimised.</p>
	<p pid="b.597W.8/4">It is a regrettable fact that we have had instances of less scrupulous individuals seeking to identify loopholes in the scheme in order to abuse it. It is clear that if we make an exception to the rules of this nature, unscrupulous individuals will seek to exploit what they will see as a loophole. It is also clear that to make an exception of this nature will very significantly add to the administrative burden and complexity of the scheme and require non-experts (dealers) to check facts and documentation which they are not equipped to verify, which in turn would raise further concerns about the capacity for abuse of the scheme. For example, dealers would need to verify whether the person who was the keeper of the car in question has in fact died and whether the car in question has in fact been left to the person proposing to scrap it (as opposed to another relative, friend, charity etc.). This in turn would raise issues in the case of those who had died intestate and of whether or not probate had been obtained, again adding to the complexity of the scheme and the capacity for abuse.</p>

	<p pid="b.600W.8/2">In April the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport jointly published &quot;Looking After Our Town Centres&quot;, which sets out the range of powers, guidance and approaches that can help local authorities and their partners promote the vitality and viability of town centres, and explains additional steps that the Government are taking to enable further positive action to be taken, particularly through the temporary use of empty shops. The guide can be downloaded from:</p>

	<p pid="b.600W.8/4">Small independent shops (and other businesses) occupying a sole property with a rateable value below &pound;15,000 may benefit from small business rate relief. For the businesses occupying the smallest properties, this can mean a saving of up to 50 per cent. of their business rates.</p>

	<p pid="b.605W.8/2">In the 2009 Budget the Chancellor announced a number of measures that will benefit pensioners, including those in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.8/3">In order to help those pensioners who receive income from savings and who may have been affected by lower interest rates, the Government will be increasing the threshold in pension credit (and housing and council tax benefit for those who have attained the qualifying age for pension credit) from &pound;6,000 to &pound;10,000 from November 2009, so that pensioners can have up to &pound;10,000 without it affecting their benefits; launching a tax back awareness campaign in autumn 2009 to encourage all those in receipt of pension credit to ensure they are not paying tax on their savings that they do not have to and to claim back overpaid tax; and from 2009-10, the amounts that people aged 50 and over can save in an Individual Savings Account (ISA) will be increased to &pound;10,200 of which &pound;5,100 can be saved in cash form (effective from <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-06">6 October 2009</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.8/4">In addition there will be a repeat of this years additional winter fuel payment of &pound;50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &pound;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over in winter 2009-10. This means the winter fuel payments will be &pound;250 and &pound;400 respectively for winter 2009-10 which provides a significant contribution towards an older person's winter fuel bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.8/5">The Government have also committed to maintain the standard interest rate applied in the support for mortgage interest scheme at 6.08 per cent. for a further six months until the end of December 2009, this will help those on pension credit who receive help with their mortgage.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.8/6">The Government also reconfirmed their commitment to uprate the basic state pension by a minimum of 2.5 per cent. should the retail prices index fall below 2.5 per cent. in September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.8/7">A further change announced in the 2009 Budget is for grandparents who stop work to care for their grandchildren before they reach state pension age. They will be eligible to receive national insurance credits that will top up their basic state pension. This change is due to come into effect in 2011 and will make it easier for grandparents who take on significant caring responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.2/1">HMRC has not made any staff compulsorily redundant and is committed to avoiding this where at all practical. Instead HMRC is actively seeking to redeploy as many staff as possible into suitable alternative posts, both within HMRC and to other government departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/2">Alongside this redeployment programme HMRC has also run a number of lower cost voluntary early release schemes and has offered these to eligible staff. Since April 2005 6,561 staff have left HMRC under these schemes at a cost of around &pound;299 million. The savings in salary costs from these releases are estimated at &pound;691 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.607W.3/1">A revised version of the award notice, reflecting comments from the voluntary and community sector has been in use since April 2006, giving the customer information about entitlement, overpayments and recovery arrangements. Additionally, claimants now receive a summary sheet that explains the most important aspects of their award. This summary highlights the key areas of their award that they need to check, for example, number of children, child care costs, income and account details.</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.3/2">HMRC seek to minimise the number of times it has to send notices to both couples in a household. For example, HMRC generally only issues one annual renewal pack per household if a reply is required. There are some instances where legislation means HMRC have to send out individual notices to each partner but HMRC constantly review their communications and are always exploring ways to improve the customer experience.</p>

	<p pid="b.608W.9/2">Complaints about professional misconduct of solicitors are matters for the SRA to investigate, as the legal profession is independent from the Government. As such, I cannot comment on individual cases. If consumers are unhappy with the way the SRA has conducted its investigation or the final decision reached, they should refer the matter to the Legal Services Ombudsman (LSO). The LSO protects the interests of the consumers of legal services by ensuring that the professional regulators conduct fair, thorough and efficient investigations of complaints about their members.</p>

	<p pid="b.613W.8/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) is currently analysing responses to its consultation on best value tendering (BVT) which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-19">19 June</phrase>. It will issue a response in the next few weeks. The consultation set out the LSC's intention to pilot BVT in Greater Manchester and Avon and Somerset and to evaluate the pilot tender exercise before making any decisions on wider rollout across England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.8/2">The LSC's consultation stated that any evaluation of the pilot tender exercise would address areas such as the operation of the tender mechanism; the prices and level of supply obtained; changes in the shape of the market; the ability of firms to adjust structures, where necessary to deliver work under the new contract; and an equalities impact assessment of the tender outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.8/3">Best value tendering has the potential to achieve savings in areas where there is strong competition by setting the local market price for services and allowing firms to realise efficiency savings. However, it is not possible to predict in advance the outcome of a competitive process and we recognise that prices may rise in some areas. Piloting the proposals will give us a much better understanding of the overall financial impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.8/4">A final impact assessment will be published alongside the LSC's response to the consultation, which will fully assess the impact of any decisions on implementing these proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.619W.8/1">There has been a sustained increase in probation service funding since 1997. Total funding for probation rose by 70 per cent. in real terms between 1997 and 2007, and the number of staff employed by the probation service over the same period rose by 7,000, or almost 50 per cent. This includes an increase of 54 per cent. of frontline staff; probation officers, senior probation officers, and probation service officers.</p>

	<p pid="b.619W.8/3">Following these estimates, Ministers have made clear their commitment to ensuring that front-line redundancies are avoided wherever possible. Directors of Offender Management are ensuring that probation areas focus their savings on reducing management layers, streamlining support services and cutting bureaucracy, in order to minimise the impact of budget reductions on frontline staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.8/4">However, responsibility for staffing levels ultimately lies with each probation board or trust as they are the employers of probation staff.
