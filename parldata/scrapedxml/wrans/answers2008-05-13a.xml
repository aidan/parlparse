Vehicles powered wholly by electric power are exempt from VED.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431W.3/2">The Government fund the running of an Infrastructure grant programme. The grants assist the building of refuelling stations for alternative fuels (natural gas/biogas, hydrogen and bio-ethanol). It is also funding research and development into battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles through a Low Carbon Vehicles Innovation Platform, which brings together funding from the Department for Transport, Technology Strategy Board and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Previously low carbon vehicle research and development funding was provided through the Energy Saving Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431W.3/3">The Government have also introduced the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). The RTFO, which came into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-15">15 April 2008</phrase> aims to ensure that sustainable biofuels make up an increasing percentage of total UK road transport fuels, and means that biofuels are starting to become available in low blends at the majority of forecourts in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431W.3/4">The Government previously provided grants through the Powershift and Clean Up programmes to encourage the purchase of low carbon vehicles. However it was clear that the funding levels available would not bring about the required market transformation so the funds were diverted to other environmental transport initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.1440W.0/1">Since January 2008, the House of Commons Catering Service has secured a supply of chicken produced under the RSPCA's Freedom Food scheme, and this now accounts for almost 40 per cent. of the Department's purchases of fresh chicken meat. The quality, reliability and relative affordability of this supply has enabled the Department to move forward from a position in 2007 when less than 10 per cent. of chicken supplied for the House of Commons restaurants met higher welfare standards consistent with those developed by the RSPCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.0/2">Subject to availability and affordability constraints, the Catering Service aspires to further increase the proportion of higher welfare chicken purchased, and met with representatives of Freedom Food earlier this month to discuss how this might be achieved.</p>

All pork is free range.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.3/2">Other than chicken, no meat currently served in the House of Commons restaurants is accredited under the RSPCA's Freedom Foods scheme. However, the director of Catering and Retail Services met with Freedom Food representatives earlier this month to discuss the supply of pork, beef and lamb and to identify ways of working together to establish a supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="a.1450W.2/1">Marine minerals dredging in English waters is carefully controlled through the Environmental Impact Assessment and Natural Habitats (Extraction of Minerals by Marine Dredging) (England and Northern Ireland) Regulations 2007. All marine mineral dredging applications are required to assess the physical effects of the proposed dredging operation and its implications for coastal erosion by way of a Coastal Impact Study (CIS). A permission to dredge will only be issued if the regulator (the Marine and Fisheries Agency (MFA) on behalf of the Secretary of State), their advisors, consultees and major stakeholders are content that the proposed dredging is environmentally acceptable. In making this judgment the precautionary principle is always adopted and should the CIS show a potential to contribute to coastal erosion a permission would not be issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.2/2">Modelling and field studies on the impact of both individual offshore dredging licences and of the cumulative impacts of such licences have concluded that UK offshore dredging has not contributed to coastal erosion. There may be a potential impact on the coastline in relation to estuary and near-shore dredging for navigation purposes. However, in these cases, there is a clear need to balance economic and social imperatives of continued port operations with any environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.2/3">Disposal of navigational dredgings in tidal waters is licensed under the Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) 1985. Before any licence can be issued for disposal, consideration must be made as to whether alternate waste management options are possible, including re-use. FEPA licences are not normally granted where practicable alternative means of recovery or disposal exist. We are working with the industry to secure ways to ensure the arisings of appropriate dredging spoil are more closely linked to suitable construction projects where re-use would not entail excessive costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.2/4">There have been a number of examples where materials that are to be dredged for navigational reasons have been diverted to alternative use, including for construction, land reclamation and for landscape bunding etc. For example, the Port of Southampton disposed of, for commercial use, a significant quantity of sand dredged from their navigational channels and the proposed London Gateway port development envisages using some 25 million tonnes of dredged materials for land-raising/landscaping works. It is not uncommon for port authorities to make available suitable dredged materials for use in maintaining beaches and inter-tidal areas. Harwich Haven Authority has previously entered into various agreements with local coast defence authorities to re-use suitable sand for beach replenishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.2/5">DEFRA continues to fund research into alternative uses of dredged material to improve understanding of how these can be used and, with its Marine and Fisheries Agency which regulates disposal of marine dredgings, are engaged with the Central Dredging Association (CEDA) to promote and increase beneficial use of materials.</p>

Some member states may not charge for IPPC permit applications, but may recover varying proportions of their costs from the regulated industry, while others bear the cost in general taxation. This is a political decision for each national Government. The differing practices which are in place make it difficult to make comparisons of the costs of PPC permits across the EU. In England and Wales regulators are required, in accordance with HMT guidance and the 'Polluter Pays Principle', to recover the costs of regulation from those they regulate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1456W.6/1">There is no legislation which specifically regulates competitive tendering in the construction industry. Construction is covered by generic procurement and competition legislation. In terms of procurement, construction is regulated by the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (Statutory Instrument 2006 No 5) which implements the EU public procurement directive. A further set of rules (Utilities Contracts Regulations 2006&mdash;SI 2006 No 6) applies to relevant operators (both public and private) in the utilities sector when they wish to procure works or services. For projects above certain financial thresholds, these set out procedures to be followed in setting out specifications, selection of candidates and the award of the contract. They are intended to enforce the EC treaty principles of transparency and free movement of goods and services.</p>

These powers will enable a roll out of advanced meters to medium sized businesses in the first instance (as announced in 2008 Budget). Subject to further ongoing analysis these powers would enable us to move forward with a roll out to small businesses and domestic consumers when we have the information to make these decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1460W.3/1">The Department has held discussions with a range of interested parties over about smart meters. The Office of Government Commerce has been in discussion with local authorities as part of its work to promote the provision of advanced metering in public buildings operated by both central and local government. The Government's consultation on metering and billing was open to all groups, including large energy users. The largest energy users will, however, already use half-hourly electricity, or daily-read gas, meters. Over 200,000 larger sites below these categories will receive advanced meters under the proposals that were confirmed in the Budget 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1470W.3/2">According to the latest estimates there are up to 500 million cases of malaria globally, and at least one million deaths annually. Around 90 per cent. of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly in young children. The UK Government's support for malaria control is provided through international organisations and partnerships, bilateral programmes and research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.3/3">In April the Prime Minister announced that the UK will provide 20 million insecticide treated bed nets which are vital for preventing malaria. This is one of the first pledges made to &quot;Cover The Bed Net Gap&quot; launched by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBMP) to rally donor countries, multilateral institutions, the private sector, and the general public to achieve the goal of universal bed net coverage by 2010. This new RBMP initiative is a direct response to the UN Secretary-General's call for universal coverage of malaria control in Africa by the end of 2010 to mark World Malaria Day on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-25">25 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.3/4">The UK Government, through the Department for International Development (DFID) have committed &pound;1 billion by 2015 to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. To date the fund has disbursed US$ 5.5 billion; 25 per cent. of which goes to malaria programmes. DFID also provides funding contributions to the WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank's International Development Association as well as the RBMP which plays a central role in helping countries develop and secure finance for national malaria plans. DFID supported UNITAID, the international drug purchase facility with &euro;20 million in 2007 to purchase drugs for anti-malarial treatments as well as for TB and HIV/AIDS. Our contribution will rise to &euro;60 million by 2010.

In 2006 the FCO spent &pound;200,000 on carbon credits to offset the carbon dioxide, and other emissions, generated by the air travel of Ministers and officials based in the UK in 2004. These credits were bought through the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) carbon offset scheme from South African wind developer Genesis ECO-Energy (Pty) Ltd. A further &pound;812,608 has been paid to REEEP to offset the same category of travel undertaken in 2005 and 2006. This will be used to purchase credits in a scheme in a developing country which is also a key climate change partner.

We are introducing an entitlement to an apprenticeship for all suitably qualified young people and together with Remploy's modernisation programme I expect this will have a positive impact on the number of people with a disability accessing an apprenticeship.</p>

	<p pid="a.1494W.2/1">Since 1997, the total number of registered childcare places has more than doubled; and the number of places in out of school clubs has increased from 78,700 to 365,400 over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1494W.2/2">Childcare, including activity based provision that parents can use as childcare, is a key part of the extended schools core offer. Primary schools are expected to provide access to traditional childcare between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. in line with demand as well as a range of activities. Secondary schools are expected to deliver access to activities that provide a safe place for children and young people to be between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Over 10,500 schools are already delivering access to the full core offer and many more schools are delivering access to the childcare and activities elements of it. All schools will provide access to the core of extended services by 2010, with at least half of all primary schools and a third of secondary schools doing so by September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1494W.2/3">All local authorities were required to complete assessments of the sufficiency of childcare in their areas by <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase>, identifying supply, demand, and gaps between the two. Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>, local authorities have also been under a new duty to secure sufficient childcare for working parents, and that will help parents who are seeking childcare outside school hours to find the flexible, affordable, high quality provision that they want for their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1494W.2/4">We appreciate the impact that childcare costs can have on the family budget and are providing substantial help&mdash;over &pound;3.5 million a day&mdash;through the tax credits system to help working parents with the cost of childcare. Parents making use of childcare out of school hours are, like other parents, benefiting from this.</p>

	<p pid="a.1495W.8/1">The criteria for recruiting markers for 2008 are the same as in previous years. The new test operations contractor, ETS Europe requires markers to have an educational qualification and teaching experience in the relevant Key Stage and subject. All markers are also subject to a referee check by the Test Operations Agency. Markers are required to attend a full-day training meeting. If markers do not attend the relevant training meeting they are not allowed to mark. Following the training meeting, all markers are required to successfully pass &quot;standardisation&quot;, a process whereby markers are required to mark a set number of national standard scripts. Markers that do not pass the standardisation process are not permitted to mark pupils' scripts.</p>

Up to 2005-06 the UCAS tariff was used to calculate average point scores.

	<p pid="a.1502W.2/1">The Government have not made such an assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/2">However, the Government are taking forward a number of steps to help to keep down the price of school meals. We are investing over &pound;650 million between 2005-11 to help raise nutritional standards and keep school lunch prices down. This funding is also being used to help build kitchens in areas with no kitchen facilities; to better support the development of training centres for the school food workforce; and to improve overall take-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/3">The School Food Trust is working with manufacturers, caterers and schools to ensure the long term sustainability and efficiency of the country's school food service. They are working with food producers and manufacturers to ensure that the nutrient menus have a minimum effect on the price of school meals as well as working on kitchen efficiencies, including both skilling the workforce and looking at international business models. The Trust has produced guidance focusing on efficient and sustainable school food procurement. This guidance is being distributed to all schools in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/4">The Department is working in close alliance with the Trust and other Departments, to identify opportunities and develop initiatives to further improve efficiencies in procurement. These include price benchmark variance reporting, common food standards and terms and conditions to support local and national competitive tendering, as well as the use of shared contracts from other Departments, where they can be shown to meet the needs of schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/5">In response to a survey carried out in January 2008 by the School Food Trust 2008, 68 per cent. of local authorities (LAs) reported that, in principle, their catering service was expected to break even, with 9 per cent. expected to operate at a deficit, and 10 per cent. expected to make a surplus. For the 2007/08 financial year, 44 per cent. of LAs expected their catering service to break even or make a surplus, compared to the 41 per cent. of LAs who achieved this in 2006/07. Similar numbers of LAs expected their financial outcome to improve (15 LAs) as expected it to worsen (14 LAs). The results of the Trust's survey can be found on its website at:</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-05-13a.205237.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-05-13a.1503W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" speakername="Kevin Brennan" colnum="1503W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080513/text/80513w0016.htm#08051379003434">
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/1">The Department has not issued any advice to schools on procuring food from small, local producers. However, it asked the School Food Trust to provide advice on food procurement issues to local authorities and schools and the trust has recently published &quot;A fresh look at school food procurement: efficiency and sustainability&quot;&mdash;guidance for schools and local authorities on how efficient and sustainable food procurement can be pursued in tandem. It can be viewed on the trust's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.schoolfoodtrust.org.uk/UploadDocs/Library/Documents/sft_fresh_look_procurement_print_friendly.pdf">http://www.schoolfoodtrust.org.uk/UploadDocs/Library/Documents/sft_fresh_look_procurement_print_friendly.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/3">The guidance actively promotes the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI), which aims to increase tenders from small and local producers and improve their ability to do business. The guide encourages buyers to identify and reduce barriers to small and medium-sized local enterprises (which may prevent them from tendering) and recognises that smaller suppliers can compete with larger businesses. It also recognises that their participation in the public sector supply chain can benefit local and regional economies. The trust's website also contains a number of case studies where local authorities and schools demonstrate how they have successfully tendered for local produce for their meals' service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/4">In addition, the National Governors Association has recently published a supplement to &quot;Food Policy in Schools&mdash;a strategic policy framework for school governing bodies&quot;. This advises governors on how to produce whole school policy statements to promote healthy food, and improve sustainability and efficiency in their procurement of food and catering services. Like the trust's guidance, it actively promotes the PSFPI.</p>

	<p pid="a.1505W.6/1">The current information systems used in the family courts do not require the applicant type to be recorded specifically. Consequently to extract this information would require a manual trawl of case files and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1505W.6/2">The most reliable data on public law Children Act applications, particularly at local level, relates to orders made rather than applications issued. The numbers of care and supervision orders made in the family courts in Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, Kent (including Medway) and Berkshire in the requested years are therefore provided in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1505W.6/3">National figures for 2006 suggest that between 70 per cent. and 75 per cent. of applications for care or supervision result in either a care order or a supervision order being made. Many of the remaining applications are likely to result in an order of a different type (e.g. 'Section 8' orders for residence or contact).</p>
	<p pid="a.1505W.6/4">The data are compiled based on the location of the order-making court, rather than the local authority making the application, as data on the applicant's identity is not held centrally for all cases. These figures may therefore count orders obtained by other applicants besides the local authorities specified in the question.</p>

	<p pid="a.1511W.2/1">In general, retention within the public sector Prison Service is comparatively high. Excluding retirements, the average leaving rate across all grades of staff between April 2007 and March 2008 was 6.3 per cent. This is consistent with the rates for the past seven years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511W.2/2">In areas where recruitment and retention are more difficult, higher starting salaries may be offered. Local pay allowances also operate across much of the south-east of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511W.2/3">Action has been taken recently to respond to the substantial increase in demand for prison officers, generated in particular by the National Offender Management Service's prison capacity building programme. A national prison officer recruitment campaign started on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January</phrase>. It employed a major national advertising campaign, aimed at attracting a much wider range of applicants than had been achieved previously. It also created a new recruitment process, which reducing the time between application and appointment, introduced online application and sifting; and enabled more comprehensive information to be generated, on which to base selection decisions. Over 40,000 applications have been received to date.</p>

During that period, seizures by HMRC of genuine cigarettes produced by UK manufacturers have fallen sharply and have made up a progressively smaller share of total seizures. The latest figures are contained in Section 4 Table 8 of the HMRC autumn performance report published in December last year. This decline is an indicator of the positive effect of the actions taken by HMRC under the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1516W.0/1">The handling of the CD recording in question is currently being investigated. I will write to the hon. Member when the investigation is complete and place a copy of the letter in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516W.0/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Des Browne to <i> Liam </i> Fox:</p>
	<p pid="a.1516W.0/3" class="indent">You will recall that I wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-31">31 August 2007</phrase> about the investigation into the handling of the US cockpit recording of an attack on a UK light tank in Iraq on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-28">28 March 2003</phrase>. We have now received the Joint Army/RAF investigation report on the unauthorised disclosure of the cockpit recording and I am therefore able to give you a substantive reply to your Parliamentary Question of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-20">20 February 2007</phrase> (Official Report, column 601W).</p>
	<p pid="a.1516W.0/4" class="indent">In preparation for the Board of Inquiry into the circumstances of the incident, material was requested from the US authorities including the CD recording. A CD of the cockpit recording was received by the Board of Inquiry from the US authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-23">23 April 2004</phrase> via the MOD's Permanent Joint Headquarters. The CD was classified &quot;SECRET- US Government Property - Protect from unauthorized disclosure.&quot; This classification is equivalent to the UK Secret protective marking and should have ensured that unauthorised access and disclosure did not occur. As the classification level required the recording of the item in Protective Document Registers this should also have ensured that a proper audit trail was maintained. I regret that the appropriate procedures were not followed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516W.0/5" class="indent">The investigation found that at least eight copies were made of the CD and used for various purposes including use by the Board of Inquiry, to help with briefing for deploying pilots and forward air controllers, and to assist studies into friendly fire incidents. The sections of the Department which received copies of the CD were HQ LAND, HQ Adjutant General, Air Command and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to identify how many individuals have had possession of a copy of the recording.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516W.0/6" class="indent">As a result of the failings identified, remedial action is being taken. A new security education programme is being introduced as part of a wider security awareness campaign to ensure that those involved in the handling of classified and sensitive material are aware of the rules and procedures to be followed. An instruction on the release of US (and other third country) material during legal proceedings has also been issued to all MOD personnel to remind them of their responsibilities in respect of the secure handling of protectively marked US material, and we are in the process of establishing new arrangements for the management of Boards of Inquiry and Inquests to ensure a more consistent approach across the Department. The US authorise have been informed of the investigation's findings and of the remedial action taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516W.0/7" class="indent">I can assure you that I take the protection of classified material, especially that entrusted to us by a close ally, very seriously, and the Permanent Secretary has asked the chain of command to consider whether administrative or disciplinary action against any individual is appropriate in light of the findings of the report.</p>

The Project has already successfully moved over 1,000 posts from Andover to Abbey Wood. The risks and potential impacts on staff are therefore well understood and mitigation strategies, which have been proven to be effective, will be put in place for the DC IPT relocation. This includes the provision of direct support to staff and their families, comprehensive and flexible allowance packages and the redeployment and re-training of existing staff in the new location. The impact upon staff of the onward move from Ensleigh to Abbey Wood is expected to be minimal as the Travel to Work areas of the two sites significantly overlap. Staff are therefore expected to move home only once to cover both office moves.</p>

	<p pid="a.1523W.5/1">The move of Defence Clothing IPT (DC IPT) from Caversfield is part of a wider DE and S Collocation Project, which aims to focus acquisition-related activities at Abbey Wood by 2012. The project has already successfully moved over 1,000 posts which directly support the front line from Andover to Abbey Wood. The change to the DC IPT move timetable is intended to mitigate the risks to business continuity associated with the original time scale; namely that key skills from the team would potentially have been lost in the run up to the relocation date in 2010. Moving posts sooner will assist in retention of staff and will also facilitate earlier recruitment of staff in the south west.</p>

	<p pid="a.1528W.2/2">Competition policy for refits and docking periods (upkeeps) for legacy complex warships was suspended in 2006. Since then, the Surface Ship Support Project has been exploring a wide range of support options to deliver sustainable, efficient and affordable support for these vessels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528W.2/3">For Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, one-off competed contracts are currently placed for upkeep work. However, in order to achieve greater value for money, a Through Life Support Strategy has been developed that will result in contracts being placed based on a five-year maintenance cycle. These contracts are being competed and are due to be placed by late summer 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528W.2/4">For HMS Scott's next docking period, a competition was initiated with the expectation that the tendering process would culminate in a reverse auction. Four companies were invited to tender in late 2007, but two subsequently withdrew. Following a full evaluation of the two remaining tenders, only one was compliant. Since at least two compliant tenders are required to proceed with a reverse auction, it is intended to complete the competition process with the remaining tenderer alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.1531W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice has published two annual reports containing statistical information on freedom of information requests received by monitored bodies (including central Government Departments) in 2005 and 2006. These reports can be found at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="a.1531W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dca.gov">http://www.dca.gov</a>.uklfoilreference/statisticsAndReports.htm</p>

	<p pid="a.1531W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.Justice.gov">http://www.Justice.gov</a>.uklpublications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm</p>
	<p pid="a.1531W.2/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531W.2/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of &quot;non-routine&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied, and where no initial response had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531W.2/7">The 2006 annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531W.2/8">Information requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however the proportion of resolvable requests the Department answered &quot;in time&quot; (i.e. meeting the deadline or with a permitted extension) in 2007 was 87 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1531W.2/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the Department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOI exemption or EIR exception was applied. For 2007, the number of such requests was 125, based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are dealt with as routine business.</p>

	<p pid="a.1536W.8/2">We are committed to tackling all aspects of disability poverty and have already made considerable progress. The number of disabled individuals in households with an income below 60 per cent. of median on an After Housing Cost basis fell by 500,000 in Great Britain between 1998-99 and 2005-06. On a Before Housing Cost basis the number of disabled individuals in households with an income below 60 per cent. of median fell by around 100,000 over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536W.8/3">In 2005 the Department's report 'Review of existing research on the extra costs of disability'<sup>(1)</sup> found that all studies conducted to date have concluded that there are extra costs incurred by disabled people. However, measuring these extra costs is conceptually and methodologically difficult and there is disagreement over what constitutes the extra costs disabled people face. As a result the existing evidence supporting estimates of the extra costs of disability varies widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536W.8/4">In light of these findings the Department has no further work planned in this area at present, but we will continue to keep abreast of developments.</p>

For 1998-99, available data exclude Northern Ireland, therefore changes across Great Britain between 1998-99 and 2005-06 have been presented.</p>

	<p pid="a.1543W.2/1">The Government have done a good deal to promote well-being among health care professionals and support staff since 1997. This includes: Improving Working Lives (2000) and Practice Plus (2001); NHS Plus (2001), providing occupational health to NHS staff; the NHS Employers' reference guide to staff well-being, the Healthy Workplaces Handbook (October 2007); NHS Health and Well-being pilots and 'Health for Health professionals' pilots (2008).

	<p pid="a.1543W.2/2">For the future, the Government will be responding later in the year to the proposals in Professor Dame Carol Black's, the National Director for Health and Work's Review of the health of the working age, &quot;Working for a healthier tomorrow&quot; (March 2008) to make all work places healthier.

	<p pid="a.1544W.5/1">The Government have listened to the issues that are important to the public in relation to health care services at night-time and delivered real improvements to availability and standards of services. Improvements have included:</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.5/2" class="indent">the introduction of NHS Direct giving people a means of accessing health advice at any time and where necessary being supported to access appropriate treatment;</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.5/3" class="indent">improved availability of out of hours pharmacy services. The Pharmacy White Paper, published in April, sets out ways in which urgent access to medicines can be further improved;</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.5/4" class="indent">allowing general practitioners to transfer responsibility for providing out of hours services to primary care trusts (PCTs).

	<p pid="a.1544W.5/5" class="indent">a guide to risk-assessing hospitals at night to help ensure that hospital at night solutions are designed and implemented to provide safer patient care was jointly published by the National Patient Safety Agency and Modernisation Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.5/6">In addition to the service improvements that have taken place over the last 10 years, there has been a focus on assessing performance which has looked not only at service availability but also the quality of those services. In 2004 the Department published, &quot;Standards for Better Health (National Standards Local Health and Social Care Standards and Planning Framework 2005-06&mdash;2007-08)&quot; setting out the level of quality all organisations providing national health service care are expected to meet or aspire to across the NHS in England. Copies of this publication are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.5/7">The current performance assessment model carried out by the independent regulator, the Healthcare Commission, includes the core standards i.e. the minimum level of quality that health care services are expected to meet. Each year, the Healthcare Commission produces the Annual Health Check detailing the outcome of this performance assessment. The Commission also regulates independent health care providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1547W.5/1">Currently, patients who do not want a summary care record (SCR) are advised to make their wishes known to their general practice. Guidance has been issued to all general practices entitled &quot;Guidance On Managing Requests For No Summary Care Record During The Period Of The Early Adopter Programme&quot; on how they should respond to patients' inquiries about their options in relation to SCR, including to those patients who have decided not to have a SCR. Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Library and are also available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1547W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/nhscrs/publications/staff/gpguidance.pdf">www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/nhscrs/publications/staff/gpguidance.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1547W.5/3">The essence of the guidance is that practices should ensure patients fully understand the implications of their decision, and that a record is kept to that effect, signed both by the patient, and on behalf of the practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1547W.5/4">SCRs cannot be created without the agreement and co-operation of general practitioners, who are currently the data controllers for the records from which the relevant data will be uploaded. The Department can only recommend that practices follow its advice in line with the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1547W.5/5">These and other practical aspects of how patients are able to exercise the choices they have in relation to the SCR will be among the key issues to be reviewed by the summary care record advisory group in light of the recently published independent evaluation of the SCR Early Adopters Programme in order to inform the future roll-out of the SCR.</p>

Local authorities (LAs), when asked when they expected to award a contract to a host organisation for the purpose of setting up a local involvement network (LINk) declared the following (as of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-23">23 April 2008</phrase>):</p>
	<p pid="a.1551W.2/2" class="indent">42 LAs had awarded a contract prior to <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>;</p>

	<p pid="a.1551W.2/9" class="indent">three LAs responded with an unspecified deadline but anticipated that they would award a contract by September.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551W.2/10">While, this data does not represent a definitive picture as only 137 of the 150 LAs with social services responsibilities responded to the informal poll, we think the findings are encouraging.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551W.2/11">The Department issued two guidance documents in August 2007, designed to help LAs get ready for LINks, one of these documents contained a 'model contract' for LAs to use as a reference. This guidance accompanied a one-off payment of &pound;10,000 to each LA to assist them in the procurement process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1551W.2/12">Since that time, LINk leads&mdash;who are based in Las&mdash;have received monthly bulletins updating them on LINks policy developments and giving them the practical information they need to set up a successful LINk. Further, as part of the programme of support the Department is offering for LINks, expert advisors from the NHS National Centre for Involvement (NCI) have visited LAs to provide help and advice and good practice has been shared more widely at workshops and seminars. The NCI has also produced a compendium of guidance to help support LINks implementation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1560W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-12">12 May 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/2">The Government take underage drinking very seriously. The National Alcohol Strategy 'Safe.Sensible.Social' published in June 2007, focuses action on three groups most at risk which are 18 to 24 year-old binge drinkers, young people under 18 who drink alcohol, and harmful drinkers whose drinking is damaging their health, often without them realising it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/3">In the Home Secretary's speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February 2008</phrase>, she said that a number of new measures and possible steps would be taken to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour which is fuelled by alcohol. This includes highlighting the message that it is not acceptable for young people to drink in public places. The Home Secretary also said that she is considering a number of options including making the possession of alcohol by a young person an offence, or possibly involving the parents if alcohol is confiscated from a child. We are currently considering the effectiveness of the current powers and what can be done to help the police use them more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/4">The Department for Children, Schools and Families will shortly be publishing a Youth Alcohol Action Plan which will build on the toughened enforcement of the underage drinking laws. It will set out the responsibilities of parents and the alcohol industry as well as sending a clear message that young people drinking in public is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/5">Additionally, two confiscation campaigns have taken place recently; one in October 2007 and one in February 2008. The results of the October campaign where 23 out of the 227 Basic Command Units (BCUs) took part, showed that nearly 3700 litres of alcohol were confiscated from young people during the four week period. The February 2008 campaign involved 165 BCUs where 21,000 litres of alcohol was confiscated during a two week period. Activity in both campaigns focussed on school holidays and weekends when young people were most likely to be engaged in this activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/6">Other campaigns include the tackling underage sales of alcohol campaign (TUSAC) which focused on shop keepers who sold alcohol to children. The TUSAC took place between May and July 2007 and demonstrated a new approach to test purchase campaigns by focusing on perceived problem premises identified locally. The results of the latest Tackling Underage Sales of Alcohol Campaign (TUSAC) show that it is increasingly difficult for under-18s to purchase alcohol. This is in large part thanks to tougher enforcement by police and trading standards in conjunction with the positive efforts of industry to clamp down on underage sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/7">The Government also support schemes that make it easier for retailers to verify, and young people to prove their age. That is why we are working with the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) which validates the variety of proof of age card schemes available. This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic logo. This is easily recognisable both to retailers and young people and helps them know that they have a proof of age document which should be accepted. The Government have recently given the Proof of Age Standards Scheme 50,000 in order to assist the PASS Board in raising awareness of the scheme amongst young people and retailers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1564W.0/1">UK officials attended an expert level seminar in Lisbon in October 2007 to debate with officials from other member states and the European Commission the future development of Eurojust. In December 2007, the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council, which I attended, adopted conclusions on the same subject. Subsequently, negotiations have begun on amendments to Eurojust's legal base with a view to improving its operation. This proposal was considered at the April JHA Council, attended by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, and is on the agenda for the June JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564W.0/2">The Government are a firm believer in the important role Eurojust plays in the increasingly complex, cross-border nature of serious and organised crime, which can only be fought effectively through improved judicial co-operation and co-ordination of cases across the EU. Eurojust is helping to break down the barriers to effective judicial co-operation by promoting greater understanding and trust between the different legal systems in member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564W.0/3">The Government have supported the general aim of the draft Council decision to improve the functioning of Eurojust. The Government have, however, argued against attempts to grant autonomous powers to Eurojust to oblige action at a national level in relation to investigations and prosecutions, which could be seen as paving the way towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor (EPP).</p>
