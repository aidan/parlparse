	<p pid="d.451W.3/2">In the six months April to September 2008, there were 65,978 visitors on Member-sponsored tours of the Palace of Westminster. In the equivalent six months in 2007, there were 67,358; and in the same period in 2006 there were 63,919.</p>
	<p pid="d.451W.3/3">The number of hon. Member-sponsored tours is adjusted up or down from time to time by the visitor services team in the light of experience. The most recent adjustment was a reduction in May for new bookings, when the morning maximum was reduced to ensure visitors could be securely accommodated without major overcrowding or delays.</p>
	<p pid="d.451W.3/4">The Commission has not conducted any assessment of the effects of the new visitor reception arrangements on the number of tours sponsored by hon. Members. The parliamentary visitor board (comprising senior officials in both Houses) is conducting a review of visitor handling, to include the operation of the new entrance. This will be taken to the relevant committees in each House in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="d.452W.5/1">During the summer opening programme, professionally qualified Blue Badge Guides are employed to conduct tours of the Palace of Westminster. Half-day and full-day rates are calculated on the basis of nationally agreed Blue Badge rates. A qualified London Blue Badge Guide delivering a standard parliamentary tour in English would earn &pound;38.30 per hour; in foreign languages &pound;43.30. The cost of the Blue Badge Guides is covered by the ticket price.</p>
	<p pid="d.452W.5/2">For Member-sponsored tours when Parliament is sitting, the current policy is that guides are drawn primarily from serving or retired House staff and that Parliament should bear the expense of the tours. The current rate for in-house guides is &pound;22.70 per hour.</p>
	<p pid="d.452W.5/3">The difference in pay reflects the higher level and formal nature of the training and qualification of Blue Badge Guides. The higher level of training includes the mechanics of guiding and detailed knowledge of London as a whole (which fits in with the requirements of summer opening visitors), as well as an independent parliamentary qualification.</p>

The court can authorise the publication of information on its own initiative or on an application made by one of the parties to proceedings.

	<p pid="d.462W.2/1">The courts do not record how many applications under section 55 of the Family Law Act 1986 are received, nor do they record the outcome of these cases. Anecdotal evidence from courts suggests that there are very few.</p>
	<p pid="d.462W.2/2">There are no provisions for judicial separation under the Family Law Act 1986. The provisions for judicial separation can be found within the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. There were 3,388 applications made for judicial separation during the five-year period 2003-07. Records show that for the same five-year period 1,953 decrees of judicial separation were pronounced (the following table sets out the number of cases per year). The courts do not keep records of the number of applications which were denied. For comparison 778,575 applications for divorce were received for the same period.</p>
	<p pid="d.462W.2/3">Not all applications for judicial separation result in a final order as many parties choose not to pursue the case. This is not always because the parties have reconciled. The law prohibits divorce during the first year of marriage and some applications for judicial separation issued during the first year of marriage are withdrawn on the first anniversary of the marriage, before a decree is granted, and a petition for divorce then is issued.</p>

	<p pid="d.480W.6/2"><i> </i>&quot;UK Air Passenger Demand and CO2 forecasts&quot; (November 2007) included an estimate of the share of UK emissions accounted for by aviation in 2050. This assumed the UK domestic target for CO2 reductions in 2050 was 60 per cent. below 1990 levels and that abatement effort to meet the target was predominantly in the rest of the economy, with aviation abatement taking the form of fuel efficiency (resulting from fleet renewal and technological development) and air traffic management improvements, in line with the assumptions underlying the forecasts.</p>
	<p pid="d.480W.6/3">On the basis of the same assumptions used in the November 2007 document, but taking an 80 per cent. reduction target, the share for aviation in 2050 would be around 35 per cent. To account for the non-CO2 climate change effects of aviation, consistent with the 2007 document, for simplicity a radiative forcing factor of 1.9 could be applied to aviation's CO2 emissions. On this basis, aviation's share would rise to around 41 per cent. The relativity between the CO2 and non-CO2 impacts may change over this time frame which would imply a different radiative forcing factor.</p>
	<p pid="d.480W.6/4">These estimates are based on central emissions forecasts. Forecasts over such a long term time frame are subject to significant uncertainty. Adopting alternative underlying assumptions to reflect these uncertainties would therefore change the estimate of aviation's share of emissions.</p>
	<p pid="d.480W.6/5">Under an 80 per cent. target, not all parts of the UK economy would be expected to contribute equally to the total emissions reductions required. Sectors that are more carbon intensive, or in which abatement options are expensive or particularly difficult, would be expected to make up an increasing share of total UK emissions over time.</p>
	<p pid="d.480W.6/6">It should be noted that the Department for Transport is currently updating its forecasts of aviation emissions for all years to 2050 and these are expected to be published before the end of the year. The estimate of aviation's share of emissions will therefore be updated in line with those new estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.480W.6/7">The basis of UK aviation CO2 forecasts is estimates of emissions from UK sales of aviation fuels. This is consistent with the UK's reporting of international aviation emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Estimates of emissions from fuel used for international aviation do not form part of the UK's national emissions inventory, as there has been no international agreement on how to allocate them to individual countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.481W.2/2"><i> </i>In our 2006 consultation document on the proposed new charging regime we estimated that revenues could increase by around &pound;7 million in the first year, or around 10 per cent., though this depends on how many users opt to pay by tag and therefore continue to pay &pound;1.00 for cars. Our 2008 consultation document on the local discount scheme gave an indicative estimate that the local resident discount scheme could reduce revenues by about &pound;2 million, depending on high levels of take-up by those eligible. On this basis the overall increase in revenues would be around &pound;5 million per year.</p>

	<p pid="d.487W.2/1">The deliberate targeting of civilians would represent a direct contravention of international law. A wide range of checks and balances exist within the UK military chain of command to ensure that this can never happen. These include provision of absolutely clear direction into theatre and the deployment of legal and other experts to ensure this direction is followed.</p>
	<p pid="d.487W.2/2">Sadly, on a very small number of occasions, civilian casualties inadvertently result from the use of air-launched weapons. The UK, along with our partners in the International Security Assistance Force, makes every effort possible to minimise the risks of this occurring. Release of air-launched weapons is coordinated by controllers on the ground, who are fully trained in the use of lethal force, law of armed conflict and the appropriate rules of engagement. Controllers and pilots communicate with each other to ensure that the target is accurately identified, using target designating equipment where appropriate, and the weapon and method of attack is selected so as to minimise any risk of civilian deaths or injury, or damage to civilian property.</p>
	<p pid="d.487W.2/3">The risk of civilians becoming involved in military operations is greatly exacerbated by the tactics employed by the insurgent forces, who frequently attack UK and ISAF forces from within civilian locations.</p>

	<p pid="d.488W.0/1">The time between an individual's date of injury and the date on which they make a claim for compensation under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) varies from person to person. For this reason, any figures produced on the time between the date of injury and the date of the decision that compensation is due will be misleading. The time between the date each claim was registered under the AFCS and the date of the decision that compensation is due, has been calculated for personnel that were seriously injured (SI) or very seriously injured (VSI) in Afghanistan during 2006 and 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.495W.0/1">The Duchess of Kent Psychiatric Hospital was closed in 2003 as part of the Defence Medical Services' move (in accordance with clinical best practice) towards providing treatment regionally, primarily through enhanced out-patient facilities and the contracting-out of in-patient treatment. The military community treatment capability was enhanced and the Defence Medical Services provide service personnel with speedy access to skilled and effective help and treatment that is flexible and based around their individual needs. A military Department of Community Mental Health (DCMH) is located a short distance from the old hospital ward.</p>
	<p pid="d.495W.0/2">Defence Medical Services mental health personnel undertake the same training, and obtain the same qualifications as their civilian counterparts. Psychologists and social workers who work for the defence mental health services are directly recruited fully trained, and all personnel engage in continuing professional development as recommended by the various professional bodies (such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists; Nursing and Midwifery Council and British Psychological Society). All training is conducted under the direction and administration of the Defence Postgraduate Medical Deanery and this organisation is advised by the Defence Consultant Advisor in Psychiatry.</p>
	<p pid="d.495W.0/3">The military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) assess all service personnel referred to them for risk in accordance with NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) Clinical Guidelines which include the identification of clinical and demographic features known to be associated with risk of further self harm and/or suicide. An appropriate care plan is agreed with the individual, in consultation with the unit medical officer and appropriately supervised treatment is implemented, and similar procedures take place where individuals are being discharged from in-patient care.</p>
	<p pid="d.495W.0/4">Mental health practitioners will also alert the chain of command where there is clear risk of death or serious harm to the patient or others, or where reasons underpinning the suicidal intent may also impact on others, balancing the issues of confidentiality and consent against the duty of care to the patient, as well as to others who might be harmed by a suicide attempt.</p>

	<p pid="d.505W.6/1">The guidance issued by the Audit Commission on the National Fraud Initiative (NFI) is limited to how to interpret and prioritise the data matches released through NFI. The Commission does not provide guidance on the investigation of the referrals. It is the responsibility of each participating body to investigate matches, where appropriate, in line with their own policies and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="d.505W.6/2">As part of its continued development programme, the Commission has introduced online training tutorials for NFI 2008-09. This training material is integrated into the NFI web application and as such cannot be provided separately. Brief guidance notes to supplement the online material will be made available before the launch of the NFI 2008-09 results on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-28">28 January 2009</phrase>. A copy of those notes will then be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="d.507W.2/1">Building on brownfield land is essential if we are going to develop the homes that the country needs. Communities and Local Government's policies and programmes play a key part in ensuring that this happens. Through 'Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 3: Housing', for example, local planning authorities are required to plan for the long term by identifying developable sites for housing. The policy guidance maintains a continuing focus on recycling land and retains the national target that at least 60 per cent. of new homes should be built on brownfield land. Current performance against this target is 77 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.507W.2/2">Policy guidance is also supported by priorities given to delivery bodies, such as the new Homes and Communities Agency which will be established later this year. Sustainability, including the reuse of brownfield land, will be at the heart of its work with a priority to bring about the most effective use of land and the ability to acquire derelict land for the provision of new housing.</p>
	<p pid="d.507W.2/3">Also, in March this year the Government published their response to English Partnerships' recommendations for a national brownfield strategy. The strategy considers brownfield land in the widest sense including all types of development and will help site owners, developers and regulators in the process of returning brownfield land to beneficial use. Work in developing the strategy has demonstrated the importance of a joined-up approach to developing brownfield policy. CLG and DEFRA have agreed to sponsor a new national body&mdash;the National Brownfield Forum&mdash;to secure better co-ordination at national level. The forum brings together key Whitehall Departments, agencies and industry stakeholders and promotes a more cohesive and inclusive approach to brownfield policy development and encourages knowledge sharing and best practice.</p>

	<p pid="d.511W.11/1">When taking the decisions, approved by Parliament, to hold the 2009 English local elections and European Parliament elections on the same date, we had regard to the evidence which showed that the turnout for the combined local and European elections in 2004, was significantly higher than the turnout for the previous equivalent elections which were not combined. For the European elections in 2004, the voter turnout was 38.5 per cent. compared to 24 per cent. in the previous European elections in 1999. For the 2004 district council elections, turnout was 41 per cent. compared to 30 per cent. for the previous equivalent district elections held in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="d.512W.0/1">While it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of such savings, the indications are that savings in the region of &pound;10 million could result from holding the English local elections and elections to the European Parliament on the same day. To the extent that the costs of the European elections are reduced, this will be reflected in a lower call on the Consolidated Fund, while any reduction in the costs of local elections will reduce the call on councils' own resources.</p>

It is also important that the PCT and trust figures are not added together, as the same FCEs may be counted under both organisations. This is because the trust data look at activity provided by the trust, whereas the PCT activity looks at activity commissioned by the PCT (which may then be provided at Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust).<br/> 6. Data Quality&mdash;HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.521W.0/1">The 2004 comprehensive spending review provided for an extra &pound;1,000 million and &pound;1,900 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively for extra outpatient and inpatient activity needed to cover demand growth, existing waiting time initiatives and progress towards the 18 week waiting time target.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.0/2">Achievement of the 18 week target has required the national health service to increase elective activity at a rate to meet both underlying demand and also clear the backlog of waiters. Achievement of the 18 week target will reduce the required rate of growth to just underlying activity. The Department has not made an estimate of the savings of meeting the 18 week target.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.0/3">There are no current plans centrally to estimate the cost to the NHS of reducing waiting times below the existing public service agreement 18 week target agreed with HM Treasury. However, primary care trusts may set and fund local stretch targets which include further reductions in maximum waiting times in some areas.</p>

	<p pid="d.530W.3/39">The table also shows the regions in which these consultants worked.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.3/40">In summer 2006, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) statisticians created an anonymised statistical dataset for research into the staff market forces factor (MFF) used in NHS resource allocation. The dataset was created by linking selected variables supplied by NHS Information Centre for health and social care from the 2003 NHS Medical and Dental Workforce Census with three income variables derived from HMRC records: total employment income, total self-employment income and the sum of these two variables. Any variables used to link the data were removed prior to access by the academic researcher contracted by Department. This deliberately partial data set contained only the information required by the researcher to carry out the statistical (regression) analysis used in the review of the MFF.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.3/41">The researcher had access to only this anonymised, statistical dataset. The statistical analyses were undertaken on HMRC premises. Having signed appropriate confidentiality undertakings, the researcher was allowed supervised access to the dataset in an isolated environment with no connection to either HMRC networks and administrative data systems or to external sites via internet or e-mail. HMRC reviewed all statistical output compiled by the researcher and released only aggregate non-disclosive summaries. No outputs based on single or small number of records were released. The smallest sample count in the published report was 30. This is well within the guidelines for dissemination of statistics in National Statistics protocols. The researcher was not allowed to return to the dataset once the agreed analysis had been completed.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.3/42">As will be clear from the table, it was impossible to link records in the statistical dataset with any data relating to an identifiable individual, so no permission was sought from NHS consultants for this research to take place.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.3/43">The total cost of the contract for research into the staff MFF was &pound;75,000. The analysis of private sector earnings of NHS consultants was a relatively small, but influential part of the review of the MFF. The final research report on the review of the staff MFF will be made available on the Department of Health website alongside the PCT revenue allocations, to be announced at the time of the Operating Framework for the NHS later this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.3/44">The correspondence files relating to securing access to the tax return data base do not exist, since no one was given access to a data base of tax returns. The process that was followed to give access to an anonymised data set is as described.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.3/45">In the last 11 years, HMRC has conducted surveys into consultants' earnings on behalf of the Department of Health for tax years 1998-99 to 2004-05 inclusive, using data from HMRC records. No outputs from this work have been provided to non-HM Revenue and Customs personnel in either pseudo-anonymised or non-anonymised form. HMRC released only anonymised outputs to the Department of Health or to the NHS Information Centre for health and Social care.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.3/46">In addition, at the request of the Department for 2003-04 only, HMRC created an anonymised statistical dataset relating to consultants' earnings. It contained only the pre-arranged data items for a sample of 24,407 cases that were necessary to enable researchers acting on behalf of the Department of Health to undertake statistical analysis. The researchers were allowed supervised access to the dataset on HMRC premises. HMRC reviewed the outputs from the statistical analysis to ensure that only non-disclosive summary and aggregate statistics were compiled and used in the report.</p>

The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which now advises the Government on nutrition issues, are about to embark on a review of the evidence on carbohydrates and health, including sugars and sources of sugar.

	<p pid="d.550W.3/2" class="indent">The Department for Work and Pensions proactively monitors and manages the cost of its mail services to ensure best value for money from the utilisation of public funds. Over the past 12 months, the Department has continued to work closely with Royal Mail to make improved use of new postal products/services (e.g. introducing Packet post and Clean Mail advance services to DWP sites). Since the introduction of online business accounts by Royal Mail in September 2007, the Department has used this service extensively to obtain clearer visibility of management information on the postal spend across the DWP network.</p>
	<p pid="d.550W.3/3" class="indent">The Department has made use of liberalisation within the postal market place for down stream access from our two service delivery centres with our provider UK Mail. The Department will continue to monitor the developing postal market place, and maximise the use of pan-Government opportunities to maximise costs and efficiencies for business delivery and taxpayers.</p>

	<p pid="d.552W.0/2" class="indent">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.0/3" class="indentitalic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.0/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what proportion of operational staff he estimates will be fully trained to operate the IT systems for the introduction of the Employment and Support Allowance on 27th October 2008; and how many Jobcentre Plus branches operate the Customer Account Management system in anticipation of the introduction of the Employment and Support Allowance. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.0/5" class="indent">For the introduction of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), we are introducing the Customer Account Management (CAM) system to capture new claim information and we have adapted the Jobseeker's Allowance Payment System to make payments to ESA customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.0/6" class="indent">CAM will not be deployed within Jobcentre Plus offices before the introduction of ESA. Jobcentre Plus is implementing ESA using a carefully phased approach. The CAM system will initially be deployed in one of the 64 Benefit Delivery Centres, its linked Jobcentres, and the 6 Contact Centres that will handle ESA claims from <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>. The rest of the Benefit Delivery Centre and Jobcentre network processing ESA will operate clerical data input processes, with CAM rolling out fully following an evaluation of the initial deployment of the system. Further roll out is currently planned, subject to evaluation for the first half of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.0/7" class="indent">We have put in place a rolling training plan to ensure that staff can confidently use these new programmes whilst maintaining a full service to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.0/8" class="indent">This phased approach to CAM will provide an opportunity to learn from the initial deployment to ensure that a fully optimised system rolls out nationally. We are confident that, with the plans we have in place, ESA will be successfully delivered in October 2008, but we do not underestimate the challenge for Jobcentre Plus that ESA represents. ESA is not simply a new benefit but a cultural shift to focus on customers' capability to improve their lives through finding and staying in work.</p>

Bodies such as the Strategic Forum for Construction and the Construction Plant-Hire Association are working to improve industry guidance on matters such as crane maintenance, crane operator competence and working conditions and better sharing of good practice. As well as giving substantial support to the work of industry, the Health and Safety Executive is taking action to improve safety through a mix of enforcement initiatives and the provision of guidance. Future work will also take account of the findings from the inquiries into recent accidents involving tower cranes that the Health and Safety Executive are currently undertaking.</p>

	<p pid="d.559W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.559W.2/2">Evidence from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) shows that a growing number of people are affected by the National Minimum Wage (NMW). BERR estimates using ASHE data that in 1999 around 1 million people in the UK were covered by the introduction of the NMW. This rises to around 1.1 million people covered by the October 2008 uprating of the NMW. This reflects an increasing importance of the NMW when determining the hourly wage of the low paid. The adult NMW has risen by around 59 per cent during this period from &pound;3.60 to &pound;5.73 per hour. The rise in the NMW has been greater than average earnings over this period.</p>
	<p pid="d.559W.2/3">Information for individual parliamentary constituencies is not readily available in the ASHE dataset. However, information is available on a government office region basis. In 1999 around 120,000 employees in North West and Mersey were covered by the introduction of the National Minimum Wage. This estimate is based on Spring 1998 ASHE data. Using Spring 2008 ASHE data we estimate that around 130,000 employees were covered by the latest October 2008 NMW upratings.</p>
	<p pid="d.559W.2/4">It is difficult to isolate the effect of the NMW on income as income is affected by hours worked and other sources of income such as tax credits. However, evidence suggests that since its introduction the NMW is affecting more people and the hourly wage is rising faster than average earnings benefiting the lowest paid in the economy.</p>

	<p pid="d.568W.3/3" class="indent">Claimants entitled to both income-related and contributory employment and support allowance will be permitted to earn up to &pound;88.50 a week and retain benefit. Where a person retains entitlement to income-related employment and support allowance they will continue to receive full housing benefit and council tax benefit. For people not entitled to income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit disregards the first &pound;20 of any earnings. We are currently looking at how the permitted work rules of employment and support allowance will interact with housing benefit as part of the housing benefit review announced in the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="d.569W.2/1">We propose introducing additional flexibilities and safeguards in regulations. These will meet the specific needs of parents, particularly lone parents, and further safeguard the welfare of children.</p>
	<p pid="d.569W.2/2">Jobseeker's allowance regulations will be amended to enable Jobcentre Plus staff to consider just cause and good cause so that a parent who is claiming or receiving jobseeker's allowance may not be penalised if they leave paid employment, or fail to take up paid employment, because appropriate or affordable child care is not available. The amendments will also give Jobcentre Plus staff additional flexibilities to treat parents as available for, or actively seeking, work in certain circumstances. For example, if a child is excluded from school or if there would be no reasonable prospects of a person with caring responsibilities obtaining suitable jobs in the area if they were to reduce their hours to a minimum of 16 hours a week. The existing jobseeker's allowance hardship regime will be extended to include lone parents as a vulnerable group, and Jobcentre Plus staff will be able to consider whether travel time to a job is reasonable, taking health or caring responsibilities into account.</p>
	<p pid="d.569W.2/3">We also propose to introduce operational safeguards which will ensure that lone parents affected by the introduction of these changes and making a new claim are aware of their obligations to attend quarterly work-focused interviews, and that voluntary interviews will be available to them six weeks before their entitlement to income support ends. Also, if they fail to attend a fortnightly job review, at least one attempt at contacting them will be made by telephone on the day the meeting was missed. If no contact is made, a letter will be sent to their home address telling them that if they do not make contact within five working days their entitlement to benefit will end.</p>

	<p pid="d.571W.8/1">The information requested on taxi travel expenditure is available only from 2005-06 and is recorded at departmental level (which includes the Department's Executive agencies) only. Details of the separate payments made by the Department's agencies could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.8/2">The Department's expenditure on taxis in the years for which information is available is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="d.571W.8/11">This amount of expenditure should be viewed in the context of the size of the DWP work force of over 100,000 employees and the nature of its business operations that cover an office network of over 1,000 locations across Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.8/12">The Department has clear policies in place which not only limit the circumstances under which officials can justify the use of taxis but also challenges the need to travel and strongly advocates the use of video and teleconferences wherever these facilities are practical alternatives.</p>

	<p pid="d.572W.2/1">Winter fuel payments are made to people aged 60 or over including those who are disabled or terminally ill.</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/2">The annual cost of extending winter fuel payments to people aged under 60 receiving disability living allowance under the special rules relating to a terminal illness is estimated to be approximately &pound;6.6 million. This is an estimate for 2008-09 and is based on a &pound;250 payment, which includes a one off additional payment of &pound;50 for this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/3">The extra heating needs of terminally ill people can arise at any time of year, not just in the winter months. Help is available for terminally ill people through disability living allowance, Attendance allowance and the disability premiums in the income-related benefits which have a substantially higher annual value and are spread over a 52 week period. In addition, where a disability premium is paid in an income-related benefit, a cold weather payment is payable in periods of very cold weather. Together, these payments are designed to meet the extra costs, including heating, of terminally ill people.</p>

	<p pid="d.573W.6/2">The Government's crime strategy builds upon the achievements of the last 10 years in reducing crime and disorder but moves away from centrally imposed targets instead making local agencies accountable and responsive to the needs and priorities of the local community. This means that local areas can focus greatest effort on reducing those crimes that matter most to people locally, whatever the crime.</p>
	<p pid="d.573W.6/3">Where the theft of agricultural machinery emerges as a pressing local issue we would encourage local police forces and their partners in Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to devote resources to tackling this crime. To this end the National Policing Improvement Agency has produced a practical guide specifically for those facing the challenges of policing rural areas, titled Neighbourhood Policing in Rural Communities (2008). This aims to support the police in tailoring their approach to the needs of the rural communities they serve.</p>
	<p pid="d.573W.6/4">The Home Office supports schemes such as Farm Watch and Countryside Watch, which are now operating across England and Wales, allowing farmers and those living in rural communities to share practical advice on crime prevention in order to look after their vehicles, property, families and animals.</p>

	<p pid="d.575W.2/1">Antisocial behaviour orders are one of many powerful tools we created to tackle antisocial behaviour. Three independent reports including the Home Affairs Select Committee report (2005), the Audit Commission report (May 2006) and the NAO report (December 2006) confirmed that they work.</p>
	<p pid="d.575W.2/2">Sefton antisocial behaviour unit uses the full range of interventions that deal with both prevention and enforcement in that they engage, educate and promote awareness among young people; engage with residents and tackle antisocial behaviour in families throughout the borough of Sefton, which includes Crosby. It operates the policy advocated by Home Office Guidance that the appropriate intervention should be used in the right way at the right time and incrementally. This means that a low-level intervention such as a warning letter or antisocial behaviour contract would be used before an ASBO unless the behaviour is sufficiently serious to warrant it.</p>

	<p pid="d.578W.2/1">Victim Support is an independent charity and is the main provider of services to victims and witnesses across England and Wales. In 2003, the Government increased the core grant for Victim Support to &pound;30 million, and has maintained annual funding at that level. Victim Support has received a further &pound;12.6 million from government (&pound;5.6 million in 2007-08 and &pound;7 million this financial year) to deliver enhanced services to victims.</p>
	<p pid="d.578W.2/2">Victim Support in Merseyside received &pound;1,134,000 as part of the national grant to Victim Support in this financial year. This covers the Victim Support community service (including additional funds for Victim Support Plus) and grants to the Witness Service, which provides support to witnesses giving evidence in criminal trials at both Crown and magistrates courts.</p>
	<p pid="d.578W.2/3">The Home Office directly meets the costs of providing public liability insurance for all police-registered Neighbourhood Watch schemes. Funding for local partners and statutory agencies to work together to tackle crime, drugs, and anti-social behaviour in their areas is provided to local authorities through the area-based grant. The Home Office does not keep detailed records giving a breakdown of payments to local schemes.</p>

For each of these procurements, an initial shortlist process has either happened or is planned and was announced in September. Further to this, a separate procurement is being conducted for replacement of a current passport production contract on expiry. This was advertised in the <i> Official Journal</i> of the EU in June 2008 and a shortlist of bidders from those expressing an interest was announced in September.</p>
	<p pid="d.589W.2/2">For all contracts yet to be awarded, no values have been agreed as they are subject to competitive procurement. However, as part of the procurement process, Identity and Passport Service has shared a current view on costs with bidders. This is to inform discussions while balancing the need to retain competition. Figures are derived from those published in the cost report to Parliament required under the Identity Cards Act 2006 and have recently been amended to reflect updates to bidders as part of the procurement process. They are subject to further refinement and discussion throughout the procurement process, so should be treated as indicative only.</p>

These include terms for ending the contract for poor performance or where a decision is made to terminate early (for 'convenience'). For termination for convenience where between 12 and 18 months notice is given, a supplier may recover costs incurred to the point of termination and those associated with terminating the contract. Where less notice is given, in addition to costs incurred, some anticipated profit lost as a result of the decision to terminate early may be claimed. As these provisions are based on formulae dependent on when any decision is taken, work incurred to date and what elements of services are being terminated, no 'value' can be calculated.</p>

	<p pid="d.591W.2/1">The UKBA has many years of experience of taking fingerprints from children aged five and upwards without difficulty. For example, we issued 39,401 application registration cards (ARC) to children aged from five to 16 from 2002 to 2006, and we collected biometric data as part of the visa application process between September 2006 and the end of April 2007 from 5,679 children aged from five to 16.</p>
	<p pid="d.591W.2/2">The benefits of taking children's fingerprints are wide-ranging from providing a more secure and reliable documentary evidence of a child's immigration status and identity to helping abate child trafficking, and fraudulent claims for public funds. In addition, it will allow the UK to comply with EU regulation 380/2008 (section 4b) which lays down a uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals.</p>
	<p pid="d.591W.2/3">When evaluating the pilot scheme for the identity cards for foreign nationals, children followed the same quick, easy and clean process that they saw their parent follow and there was no evidence to suggest that children were adversely affected by the process. To date, we have successfully enrolled the biometrics of over 13,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="d.592W.2/1">There is no direct equivalent to the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in other countries or EU member states. Each country operates its own arrangements for providing access to criminal record information and the CRB does not currently access overseas criminal records as part of its Disclosure Service.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/2">The Disclosure Service is only available for those positions and types of work included in the Exceptions Order (1975) to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The standard and enhanced disclosure process includes checks against the Police National Computer (PNC) and, if applicable, a search against Section 142 of the Education Act 2002, the Protection of Children Act and Protection of Vulnerable Adults (PoCA and PoVA) lists. Enhanced disclosures also contain a further check conducted by police forces for any relevant non-conviction information. All individuals who have received a successful offer of employment for a role which brings them into contact with children or vulnerable adults are subject to these checks irrespective of an applicant's nationality or length of residence in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/3">The CRB introduced an overseas service in February 2003 to provide details and guidance to employers and individuals on how to obtain a certificate of good conduct or a copy of a person's own criminal record from those countries included in the overseas service.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/4">This information can be used in conjunction with the full range of pre-appointment checks to ensure that the prospective employee is suitable for the post. These pre-appointment checks are the responsibility of the employer and a CRB disclosure is only one part of that process. Full details of this service are available on the CRB website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.592W.2/6">Some countries also have arrangements enabling their citizens to obtain certificates of good conduct or extracts from any existing criminal record to show to prospective employers. These may be obtained once the prospective employees have arrived in the UK but it may be advisable for them to obtain the document before leaving their home country.</p>

	<p pid="d.596W.3/1">Information provided by the Ministry of Justice showing the number of offenders cautioned is given in table 1. The number of penalty notices for disorder (on-the-spot fines) issued from 2004 (commencement of the scheme) to 2006 is given in table 2.

	<p pid="d.596W.3/2">Police forces can also issue 'on the spot fines' or fixed penalty notices (FPNs) for various motoring offences. Information on the number of FPNs issued, broken down by police force area for the years 1997 to 2007 are published in table 20(a) of the Home Office publication 'Offences Relating to Motor Vehicles'. Copies are available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.596W.3/3">The only formal warning statistics that are collected centrally are cannabis warnings.

The available data are given in table 3. Figures for 2004-05 cannot be shown at the police force area level.

	<p pid="d.602W.3/1">The National Police Improvement Agency (NPIA) has developed modules for training domestic abuse which are used by the police service. All new recruits and civilian staff receive this which equates to two days training and incorporates child protection training.</p>

This training has been forwarded to the NPIA product design for assessment with a view to informing the national training.</p>

The giving of a TEN does not overrule existing environmental health, planning and health and safety law, all of which must be complied with for a temporary event to occur legally.</p>
	<p pid="d.609W.5/3">Of course, if there were evidence that problems were frequently occurring at events authorised by a TEN then we could look at the legislation again. However, despite there being an estimated 119,000 TENs given in 2007-08, I am not aware of such evidence.</p>

The Gambling Commission has published a range of guidance documents on the implementation of the Gambling Act 2005, including Guidance on Prize Competitions and Free Draws, published in November 2007. A press release urging homeowners to be aware of the rules on 'house competitions' was published in October 2008.

	<p pid="d.617W.2/1">This far in advance of the games, the timetables operated by private sector train operators and airlines are indeterminate, therefore it would be misleading to give precise journey times this far ahead.</p>
	<p pid="d.617W.2/2">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) continues to work with a wide range of stakeholders to plan transport arrangements for the 2012 games. This work includes extensive transport demand forecasting and modelling, which draws on estimates of journey times from a range of sources. People will travel to the Olympic Park using a wide range of transport modes including National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), bus, coach, park and ride as well as walking and cycling. Journey times will vary by mode, or a combination of modes.</p>
	<p pid="d.617W.2/3">The ODA uses a range of data sources to predict journey times including the Department for Transport's (Transport Direct Portal) database, plus the most up-to-date data from train operating companies and Transport for London. The ODA also uses a range of computer modelling techniques to estimate total journey times and 'costs', which are widely used by transport practitioners, agencies and local authorities across the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.617W.2/4">Journey times from European cities will vary considerably depending on whether people are travelling by Eurostar, short-haul flights, or road-based transport. If travelling by Eurostar, people will be able to interchange at either Ebbsfleet or St. Pancras where they will have a train journey of either 10 minutes or seven minutes via the games-time 'Javelin' service to Stratford International for the Olympic Park.</p>

Sixth form and further education colleges are part of each area committee. In addition, Action on Access provides support for partnerships. The area partnership committee structure was introduced for Aimhigher for the 2008-11 phase of the programme.

	<p pid="d.620W.5/1">HEFCE uses formulae to determine how most of the money is allocated between HE institutions, helping to reduce the number of separate funding streams and minimise the accountability burden.

So far 2,276,000 adults have improved their literacy, language and numeracy skills and gained a first qualification, meaning the Government have met the 2010 Skills for Life target over two years early.

	<p pid="d.631W.5/1">The Government are committed to supporting a demonstration of the full chain of CCS technologies (capture, transport and storage) on a commercial scale coal fired power plant in the UK. The Government are keen to see progress made towards the construction and operation by 2015 of up to 12 demonstration plants of commercial power generation with carbon capture and storage, as agreed by the European Council in spring 2007. The Government hope that the UK's CCS demonstration will participate in the EU's knowledge-sharing demonstration programme, once it is established. The UK has been working hard to tackle the main barrier to progress on demonstrations, lack of funding, by seeking an EU funding mechanism for CCS projects. June European Council Conclusions called on the Commission &quot;to bring forward as soon as possible&quot; such a mechanism, but to date, no source of EU funding has been identified for CCS demonstrations. However, as part of the ongoing negotiations on the 2020 climate change and energy package, the European Parliament has proposed an amendment to the EU ETS Directive to allocate 500 million allowances from the new entrants reserve to support CCS demonstration projects. The UK Government support this amendment as the best opportunity of agreeing a funding mechanism this year. From DECC and European Commission analysis there are sufficient allowances (the Commission has proposed 5 per cent. of the total) in the new entrants reserve to support both new entrants and CCS demonstrations. The UK is working with other member states, the French presidency and the European Commission to try to reach agreement on this proposal.</p>

	<p pid="d.634W.0/2">The introduction of the Early Year Foundation Stage has generated some correspondence from child minders but the National Childminding Association (NCMA) has made clear that it sees it as a positive development, and as representing what good child minders already do. I recently met Liz Bayram, chief executive of the NCMA, to discuss the issues and challenges faced by child minders in their role as part of the wider child care work force. Child minding has, by its nature, always been a profession whose numbers have varied over time. The Government believe, however, that child minders have a vital role to play, and that they are used and valued by many parents for the unique type of child care they provide.</p>
	<p pid="d.634W.0/3">It is true that child minding numbers have fallen overall, but it's important to remember that by its nature child minding has always been a profession whose numbers vary over time, for a number of reasons. For instance, Ofsted has recently carried out an exercise to remove child minders who are no longer actively looking after children from its register, which will have reduced the numbers.</p>

	<p pid="d.636W.2/5" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="d.636W.2/6" class="indent">The numbers and proportions of full day-care settings, broken down by sector and divided by financial year between 2003 and 2008, are shown in the tables below. These figures are derived from the data available at the end of each financial year and include only providers that were active at those points. For each financial year our figures use the most recent inspection visits, where the reports have been quality assured or have not been withdrawn from publication.</p>
	<p pid="d.636W.2/7" class="indent">Please note that the change of inspection framework between the periods 2003-05 and 2005-08 means that inspection outcomes between these two periods are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.636W.2/8" class="indent">You should be aware that the selection of provision for inspection each year is not random. We select providers for inspection each year based on a number of factors, including the period since their last inspection and the grade awarded them at that inspection. Towards the end of each cycle we inspect a disproportionate number of providers who have not actively cared for children within that cycle. Therefore, these figures should not be used to make judgements about the standards of national provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.636W.2/9" class="indent">Where you have asked for private, voluntary and independent full day care, we have provided private and voluntary, as these are the only categories we hold on our database. You will also note that a proportion of full day-care providers are recorded as 'not specified'. This is because this information was not collected as part of our regulatory and inspection activities. We do not, as a matter of course, collect our data in line with the sector types specified in the question. In line with the National Standards, we used the categories of full day care, sessional day care, out of school care and cr&egrave;ches, rather than sector type. Consequently, I would advise caution when using these data since they do not represent the full picture within each sector.</p>

	<p pid="d.636W.2/79" class="indent">Ofsted does not possess data that allow us to identify whether inspection judgements are directly attributable to closure of childcare settings. Most of the providers that close choose to do so voluntarily and for a variety of reasons. We do not collect these reasons. I am therefore unable to provide data identifying the reasons for providers closing in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="d.636W.2/80" class="indent">Ofsted can only cancel registration where a person ceases to be qualified for registration, We would not normally take such action as a result of inspection, unless we believed that children were suffering or likely to suffer significant harm. The usual practice following an inspection judgement of inadequate is to require the setting to take action to improve. We have a number of enforcement options open to us to bring about such improvement, such as imposing conditions of registration or issuing a compliance notice requiring a setting to take certain actions by a particular date. It is an offence not to comply with such a notice. We only move towards cancelling registration when providers cannot or will not improve, As this is often much later than an inspection, we cannot attribute cancellation directly to the inspection judgement We must always give reasons for cancellation but these relate to the requirements a provider is failing to meet rattier than the immediate inspection outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="d.639W.2/13" class="indent">With regard to the regulation of childcare and early education, the period of the industrial action started after the end of the prescribed inspection period, completed by <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. The new inspection programme did not commence until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September 2008</phrase>. Our planned programme of work for the summer included registration visits, re-inspection of inadequate provision; short inspections of those providers who had no children on roll during the prescribed period; and first inspections of those who registered with us from December 2007. We completed all our planned inspection work during this period. We also met our targets for investigating complaints and for registering new day-care providers. Although we did not meet our registration target for new childminders, our evidence suggests the main reason for this was the delays caused by some police authorities in obtaining the CRB checks. As a consequence, I wrote to a number of police authorities about this issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.639W.2/14" class="indent">We also undertook a four-day training of all inspectors and an assessment of their learning during June and July 2008 in preparation for the Early Years Foundation Stage. All scheduled training took place with no reported absences of inspectors due to industrial action.</p>

	<p pid="d.646W.9/1">Although there are few official restrictions on humanitarian access, the recent suspension by the reserve bank of electronic banking transfers, cash shortages, and a lack of clarity around the legality of operating in foreign currency has been hindering humanitarian delivery. For some NGOs, logistical constraints have meant that it has become difficult to deliver services outside urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.646W.9/2">The UN has recently succeeded in securing commitments by the Reserve Bank to allow electronic banking access for some NGOs again, as well as arrangements whereby humanitarian NGOs can operate in foreign currency. This should remove some of the obstacles to humanitarian delivery, but we will continue to monitor the situation very closely.</p>

	<p pid="d.647W.5/1">Economic stabilisation, including currency reform, will be essential to recovery in Zimbabwe. If positive political change occurs and a new government embarks on a serious economic reform programme, it is expected that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide advice and support for stabilisation, with the backing of other financial institutions and donors. Establishing a currency board is one of the options likely to be under consideration for currency reform and halting inflation. The Department for International Development (DFID), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) are working closely together to prepare for economic stabilisation and reform in Zimbabwe should the political situation allow and are in regular contact with (among others) the IMF, World Bank and Africa Development Bank on these matters.</p>

	<p pid="d.647W.9/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not maintain a database of all cases containing references to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There are, however, relatively few cases in which the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has made substantive comments on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In case C-540/03 European Parliament v Council of the EU, the ECJ reaffirmed that the Charter is a non-legally binding instrument. The ECJ has also made reference to the Charter in the following cases of note: C-402/05P and C-415/05P Kadi, C-432/05 Unibet, C-303/05 Advocaten voor de Wereld, C-438/05 Viking Line, C-341/05 Laval, C-244/06 Dynamic Medien and C-450/06 Varec. All of these judgments confirm that the charter is not a source of rights but rather reflects existing rights, freedoms and principles that are already recognised in EU law or as they result from the international obligations and constitutional traditions common to the member states. The list of cases above is not comprehensive and does not, for example, include cases where a question on the charter may have been referred by a national court on which the ECJ did not need to adjudicate.</p>

	<p pid="d.654W.0/2">The UK continues to believe that it is important to keep the door to further enlargement open to those Eastern European countries that aspire to membership. In particular we believe that Ukraine should be able to become a member of the EU when it meets the criteria. The June Council, and the Extraordinary European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September</phrase>, asked the Commission to develop proposals for stepping up the EU's engagement with our Eastern neighbours, among them Ukraine and Georgia, including through an initiative for an Eastern Partnership. We want this to be ambitious, in support of the aspirations of each of our neighbours, and provide increased practical support for closer integration with the EU. This initiative will be one of the items on the agenda for the December European Council.</p>

	<p pid="d.657W.5/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office consular staff, whether working overseas or in London, have no powers to investigate deaths overseas. Therefore, no deaths of UK nationals abroad have been the subject of further investigation by UK consuls in the last five years. However, we do make appropriate representations to the local authorities if there are concerns that their investigation is not being carried out in line with local procedures, or if there are justified complaints about discrimination against the person who has died or their family. Each case receives individual consideration.</p>
