	<p pid="c.256W.5/29">However, as noted in superscript 5 to the table, it is difficult to make comparisons across different periods due to:</p>
	<p pid="c.256W.5/30" class="indent">Changes to accounting practice;</p>
	<p pid="c.256W.5/31" class="indent">Changes in functional responsibility leading to transfers of money between the NHS and other Government Departments</p>
	<p pid="c.256W.5/32">Such changes occur on a regular basis so calculations based on absolutes can quickly become out of date. Also, comparison based on absolutes does not take into account inflation.</p>
	<p pid="c.256W.5/33">Therefore, generally, in NHS publications, real growth in expenditure is quoted rather than changes to absolute expenditure. This is calculated by comparing consecutive year expenditure adjusted into the same currency (to adjust for accounting changes and transfers of function) and deflated by GDP.</p>
	<p pid="c.256W.5/34">Across the whole Labour administration, from 1997-98 to 2007-08, the cumulative real terms increase in expenditure will be 95.7 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.257W.3/2">As partner nation for counter-narcotics, the UK has supported the Afghan Government in developing and updating their National Drug Control strategy, launched at the London Conference on Afghanistan in January 2006. In developing their strategy, the Afghan Government considered the counter-narcotics efforts of regional partners, including Pakistan, as well as countries in the Golden Triangle. With respect to the Golden Triangle, I refer the right hon. Member to the reply I gave him today (UIN 96353). The Afghan Government have also drawn from the experience of Pakistan which achieved drug free status through a balanced strategy focused on development and law enforcement, including eradication where legal livelihoods exist.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.3/3">There have also been exchanges between the Governments of Afghanistan and Colombia in relation to Colombia's counter-narcotics experience, particularly in relation to coca production. This includes a recent visit from Colombian law enforcement officers to assist the Afghan Government develop their counter-narcotics law enforcement capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.3/4">The Afghan Government have also considered experiences of licit opium cultivation in India and Turkey. In doing so they have concluded that Afghanistan does not currently possess the necessary central government and law enforcement mechanisms to guard against the diversion of opium into illicit channels. They have therefore ruled out licit cultivation as a means of tackling the illicit trade.</p>

	<p pid="c.258W.2/1">The Department for International Development envisages capacity building support to the African Union (AU) in two main areas over the next 12 months: assistance to the African Union Commission (AUC) to build its own institutional capacity; and support for specific programmes with which the African Union is involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.258W.2/2">On the former, we are working closely with other donors and our support is likely to focus on helping to build the AUC's capacity for effective financial management, procurement and management of human resources. DFID is already providing support on procurement, which has been recognised by the AUC and the European Commission (EC) as a pre-requisite for the disbursal of funds from the EC's own Support Programme to the AUC. DFID is also considering support to help build the capacity of other African Union institutions, including the Pan-African Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.258W.2/3">On the latter, we are considering contributing to two major AU programmes to build African capacity in land policy, and in climate change adaptation. The Land Policy Initiative will be jointly managed by the AU, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA). This initiative aims to build consensus for land reform among AU member states and Regional Economic Communities and to establish a framework for common actions, partnerships and peer learning. The Climate Information for Development Needs in Africa programme (ClimDev Africa) will be led by the AU and jointly implemented by AfDB and ECA. It aims to strengthen the capacity of AU member states to obtain and use information on climate variability and change for development, eg by identifying services to help reduce rural poverty in semi-arid zones.</p>
	<p pid="c.258W.2/4">DFID continues to provide support to the African Union on peace and security issues, working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool.

	<p pid="c.259W.0/2">We have regular discussions with the African Union (AU) Commission on a range of environmental issues. Like many AU member states, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a signatory to international agreements on the protection of wildlife, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which lists the hippopotamus as a species requiring protection under Appendix II.</p>
	<p pid="c.259W.0/3">We have urged the DRC Government to do more to control the activities of militia groups who are reportedly killing these hippopotami. My hon. Friend the Minister for Schools, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, lobbied the Congolese Minister of the Environment on the need to protect vulnerable species when he visited Virunga National Park in September 2005. We will continue to raise with the DRC Government their duty to protect their wildlife.</p>

	<p pid="c.259W.3/1">The Government of Iraq, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its partners estimate there are now more than 1.5 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) within Iraq. Many of these people (between 700,000 and 1.1 million) left their homes under the previous regime. The UNHCR report that there are 424,000 newly displaced who have left their homes and communities since the bombing of the Samarra shrine in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.259W.3/2">The majority of internally displaced persons in Iraq are either living with relatives, friends or extended family, or renting accommodation in other neighbourhoods. However, thousands of displaced without family links or money, are living in public buildings and schools, improvised shelters and Government camps run by the International Federation of the Red Crescent.</p>
	<p pid="c.259W.3/3">UN agencies are delivering food and emergency assistance in central and southern Iraq together with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Organisation of Migration (IOM). Since February, the ICRC has distributed food and emergency relief to 150,000 people. EC member states have recently agreed to give 10 million euros to the UN for the provision of additional shelter and other basic needs for IDPs.</p>
	<p pid="c.259W.3/4">The UNHCR also estimate that there are up to 1.6 million Iraqis living outside their country, most of them in Jordan (500,000) and Syria (450,000). Some have been outside for a decade or more, but many have moved since 2003. The UN Assistance Mission Iraq is currently conducting an assessment of these people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.259W.3/5">Since 2003, DFID has contributed over &pound;100 million to humanitarian agencies working in Iraq, including &pound;85 million for the UN Humanitarian Appeal and &pound;32 million to the ICRC for emergency humanitarian assistance. This includes &pound;4 million for their 2006 Appeal. In 2004, DFID also provided &pound;70 million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). IRFFI has already spent over $18 million on supporting the return and reintegration of IDPs in Iraq. We are in close touch with UN humanitarian agencies so that we are able to respond quickly where unmet needs are identified.</p>

	<p pid="c.260W.5/3">The humanitarian situation in Darfur is of grave concern. As I saw during my recent visit to Sudan, the UN and non-governmental organisations are doing an excellent job, but they are severely stretched by the sheer scale of needs. Many tens of thousands cannot be reached because of banditry and insecurity. That is why in my meeting with President Bashir I urged him to do all he could to stop the fighting, implement fully the terms of the Darfur peace agreement, and accept the deployment of a multinational UN peacekeeping force.</p>

	<p pid="c.261W.3/2">The Government's strategy for tackling child poverty is set out in 'Opportunity for all' and the Child Poverty Review, published alongside the 2004 Spending Review White Paper. We plan to complete and publish our review of this strategy later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.3/3">In 1997 there were 4.2 million children living in poverty and almost 5.5 million people on benefits,3 million more than in 1979. Compared with 1979, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had risen by 50 per cent., while the number claiming incapacity benefits had more than tripled.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.3/4">Today we are achieving growth with fairness. Since 1997 incomes have grown strongly for all groups but the poorer two-fifths have seen greater proportional increases in incomes than the better off. As a result of this progress there were 800,000 fewer children living in low income households in 2004-05, after housing costs, than in 1997 and we have lifted 2 million children out of absolute poverty.</p>

	<p pid="c.262W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has two training products for equipping its staff with the skills and knowledge to deal effectively with disabled customers, including autistic spectrum disorders. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.5/5" class="indent">Working with Customers with a Health Condition and Disability [developed in consultation with external partners, including Mencap and Mind]; and</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.5/6" class="indent">Skills to Help Customers with a Health Condition and/or Disability.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.5/7" class="indent">To support their training, advisers have a number of templates they can refer to when dealing with customers, the Autistic Spectrum Disorders template provides details about autistic spectrum disorders; the effects they have on individuals, the implications for work and the possible types of support an individual might need in employment. This information was approved by the National Autistic Society.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.5/8" class="indent">In addition, all Jobcentre Plus staff have access to information about autistic spectrum disorders through guidance on our Intranet.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.5/9" class="indent">The Customer Management System (CMS) is part of the Jobcentre Plus modernisation programme. Jobcentre Plus prefers customers to claim benefits by telephone but CMS also supports face-to-face and postal contact.</p>

Customers can be represented by a third party (including an appointee) who would provide information on the customer's behalf either by phone, or whilst accompanying the customer to the office for a face-to-face meeting.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.5/11" class="indent">Alternatively, a claim form can be issued. Our Standard Operating Model, including the facility to use clerical claim forms, should be used by all staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.265W.6/2">The Department received representations from the Confederation of British Industry, Association of British Insurers and Institute of Directors in response to the Government's consultation on the directors' annual Business Review at the beginning of this year. The CBI and IOD did not support the introduction into the review of any additional reporting requirements from the former statutory Operating and Financial Review (schedule 7ZA of the Companies Act 1985), but made no particular comments about contractual and other relationships. The ABI thought that companies should in any case be reporting the matters included in the previous legislation to the extent relevant for an understanding of the company and its capacity to succeed in the creation of shareholder value. The more pressing concern that these organisations raised was in relation to liability in respect of reporting and I subsequently introduced amendments to the Companies Bill to clarify the liability regime. We also received a recent representation from the IOD expressing concern about the timing, intent and effect of the Government's amendment to the Business Review. As I made clear at Report, it remains for the directors' judgment to decide what is material to report. Furthermore, the Bill includes a confidentiality exception in relation to information about impending developments or matters in the course of negotiation. I am meeting representatives from the IOD, CBI and other industry organisations this week to discuss their concerns about amendments 821 and 822.</p>

	<p pid="c.267W.4/2">REACH will identify hazards and enable any risks to human health and the environment to be more effectively controlled. This is necessary as there are around 30,000 substances manufactured or imported in quantities above one tonne in the European Union, but we have adequate data on the environmental and health effects of only a small proportion of them.</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.4/3">However, within this context, one of the key objectives of REACH is a minimisation of animal testing. Where there is no suitable, validated alternative to animal tests, they will be kept to the minimum necessary to provide the information needed for the protection of human health and the environment. Several provisions are included in the Council Common Position to ensure that this is the case. For example:</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.4/4" class="indent">(i) there is an obligation for companies to work together through a system of &quot;one substance, one registration&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.4/5" class="indent">(ii) all available animal test data must be shared with other companies and tests must not be repeated;</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.4/6" class="indent">(iii) there is a requirement to use wherever possible alternative sources of information (for example, computer modelling tools or in vitro tests);</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.4/7" class="indent">(iv) any proposals for testing using animals will be subject to regulatory review by the European Chemicals Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.267W.4/8">Against this background of measures, it is not possible to estimate the number of animal tests that might be necessary as a result of REACH.</p>

	<p pid="c.268W.5/1">Council Directive 96/23/EC requires member states to monitor for the presence of certain substances and residues in food-producing animals and animal products. This included antibiotics in milk with effect from January 1998. Commission Decision 97/747/EC stipulated that raw bovine milk should be tested, and sets out other criteria, such as:</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.5/2" class="indent">the number of milk samples to be collected, based on forecast production;</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.5/3" class="indent">the proportion of those samples that must be tested for authorised antimicrobial substances, such as antibiotics; and</p>

	<p pid="c.268W.5/5">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate is the competent authority for the surveillance programme in the UK. Member states are required to send their annual plans for surveillance, containing the above information, to the Commission. Details of the validated analytical methods used in the UK, which in the case of milk screens for a wide range of antibiotics, are also included. The results are also sent to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.5/6">The results of the testing of UK cows' milk are given in table 1. This shows since 1997, in a total of some 18,000 analyses for antibiotics, that only 5 samples were found to contain residues of antibiotics above the relevant statutory limit. All of these were of authorised veterinary medicines.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.5/7">The VMD carries out additional testing of dairy products, such as cheese and cream, under its non-statutory surveillance scheme. The results are given in table 2. From a total of some 700 analyses since 1997, only one sample of imported cheese contained a detectable residue.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.5/8">The results of this surveillance have been published on the VMD's Annual Reports on Surveillance from 1998-2000, which can be found at <a href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk/publications/annreps/annreps.htm">http://www.vmd.gov.uk/publications/annreps/annreps.htm</a> and from 2001 onwards in the annual reports of the independent Veterinary Residues Committee which can be found at <a href="http://www.vet-residues-committee.gov.uk/">http:/www.vet-residues-committee.gov.uk/</a>.</p>

I understand that the trust has carefully considered an application for the inclusion of thermal mass and night time ventilation technologies. On the details provided to the Carbon Trust it appears that rather than comprising plant and machinery covered by the scheme, the primary components of these technologies are flooring and roofing. However, some equipment which is occasionally used with thermal mass or night time ventilation installation is included in the ECA scheme and can already qualify for the accelerated allowances.</p>

	<p pid="c.274W.2/2">The Environment Agency regulates the nuclear sites owned by the Nuclear Decomissioning Authority (NDA). The Environment Agency and the NDA have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU), accessible on the NDA website at <a href="http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/mou_nda_and_environment_agency.pdf">www.nda.gov.uk/documents/mou_nda_and_environment_agency.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.274W.2/3">The MOU commits the NDA to:</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.2/4" class="indent">(a) develop and maintain a constructive working relationship with the Environment Agency and respond positively to criticism and challenge;</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.2/5" class="indent">(b) engage as appropriate in joint working with the Environment Agency, other nuclear regulators, site licensees/operators and other stakeholders to resolve issues of substance;</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.2/6" class="indent">(c) do nothing which inhibits the Environment Agency or the other nuclear regulators in the exercise of their statutory powers, functions and duties (including taking enforcement action);</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.2/7" class="indent">(d) take appropriate action as and when it is made aware of any concerns the Environment Agency might have about the operation of any designated site, installation or facility.</p>
	<p pid="c.274W.2/8">By agreement, and through working in co-operation with Health and Safety Executive, the Environment Agency has exercised regulatory scrutiny over Nirex's arrangements for 'Letters of Compliance' in relation to proposals from nuclear site licensees for radioactive waste treatment, and scrutiny of Nirex's generic performance assessment for a phased geological repository concept which underpins the LoC system. The Environment Agency will continue to scrutinise nuclear site licensees' proposals for conditioning radioactive wastes, together with the underpinning technical work that will now be undertaken by NDA, as recently announced by the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="c.281W.12/1">The Government have no intention of seeking to regulate genuine prize competitions under gambling law. However, the Government are also firmly committed to maintaining the longstanding convention that lotteries should only be held for good causes and not for private gain.</p>
	<p pid="c.281W.12/2">The Gambling Act 2005, which will come into force in September 2007, will introduce a new definition of a lottery and a complex lottery.</p>
	<p pid="c.281W.12/3">Subsection 14(3) of the new Act provides that an arrangement is a complex lottery if:</p>

	<p pid="c.281W.12/8">Ultimately only the courts will be able to decide whether or not certain television phone-in quizzes constitute lotteries under the new Act.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-10-31c.96198.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-10-31c.283W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="283W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/text/61031w0006.htm#06103178002767">
	<p pid="c.283W.5/1">Higher Education Institutions and student unions operate money advice services. Most institutions provide a range of student services for their students, and specifically for those students from poorer backgrounds who need particular help, including advice on managing their finances.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.5/2">Advice and support on money and debt management is also offered by a wide range of other organisations. For example, as part of the Financial Services Authority's financial capability initiative, Roehampton university have piloted their money doctors scheme, helping students to become financially competent, to confront debt and take control of their own finances; and 18 other institutions will be developing the piloted approaches. UNIAID provide tools, including a new student calculator, to develop budgeting skills and increase understanding of finance. Graduates have access to the same debt advisory services as other adults including citizens advice bureaux, the Financial Services Association and the Consumer Credit Counselling Service; the Money Advice Liaison Group; and the Money Advice Association.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.5/3">It is important to recognise that the student loan debt incurred while at university or college is repaid by the student only after leaving the course and when they are earning &pound;15,000 or more; and then only at a rate of 9 per cent. on earnings above that threshold. The Government are providing more in upfront loan and grant support than ever before, particularly for low income students. Full-time eligible students are now entitled to maintenance grants of up to &pound;2,700, with HE institutions also providing bursaries of typically &pound;1,000. Managing debt has to be seen in that broader context.</p>

	<p pid="c.284W.2/1">The Increased Flexibility for 14 to 16-year-olds Programme (IFP) was introduced in 2002. The aim of the programme was to create enhanced vocational and work-related learning opportunities for 14 to 16-year-olds of all abilities who can benefit most&mdash;this included supporting provision of GCSEs in vocational subjects. A fifth cohort of students embarked on the programme this September.</p>
	<p pid="c.284W.2/2">The young apprenticeship programme for 14 to 16-year-olds offers pupils the opportunity to pursue, alongside their core curriculum, industry-specific courses of study involving extended work experience. Young apprentices combine the practical application of skills in a vocational context with studying for qualifications that relate to particular occupational sectors. There are currently 5,500 pupils on the young apprenticeship programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.284W.2/3">Apprenticeships are the main programme for young employed people seeking vocational qualifications at Level 2 and Level 3. Other opportunities are also being developed, including a pilot programme that started in April this year aimed at encouraging 16 to 18-year-olds in jobs without training to gain a Level 2 qualification, whether academic or vocational.</p>
	<p pid="c.284W.2/4">The first five specialised diplomas will be available from September 2008 and will offer young people a real alternative to traditional learning styles by offering a high quality, innovative blend of general education and applied, work-related learning.</p>

	<p pid="c.289W.6/1">The zebra mussel population in Lough Neagh has not yet reached the point where we would expect to see ecological impacts and it is too early to judge what the impact may be over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.6/2">The colonisation of Lough Erne was rapid, reaching maximum population levels within four years. It is not possible at this stage to predict exactly how quickly the colonisation in Lough Neagh will progress but it may be slower than in Lough Erne. Lough Neagh has a lower proportion of hard grounds such as rock and gravel, which are the areas initially favoured by zebra mussels, and more of the less suitable sand and mud which may remain zebra mussel free for longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.6/3">As population levels of zebra mussels increase the nature of the lake bottom will change and their filter feeding activity will reduce the amount of algae in the lake, increasing water clarity. This will have as yet uncertain implications for fish, birds, water abstraction, navigation and other interests. The Inter-Departmental Zebra Mussel Control Group will continue to work closely with the Lough Neagh Advisory Committee in relation to monitoring the spread of mussels, advising on mitigation measures and keeping the public aware of the issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.290W.9/1">Professional qualifications are sought where they are a pre-requisite for the post in question. Most Cabinet Office recruitment however is based on competence (skills and experience) rather than formal qualifications. Potential recruits are requested to provide details of their formal qualifications when they apply for a Cabinet Office vacancy as part of their background information on educational attainment. Applicants are therefore welcome to detail their International GCSEs. No vacancies in the Department have been specifically advertised requiring GCSEs in English and mathematics in the last 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.292W.5/2">The Social Exclusion Unit was set up in 1997 on a time-limited basis and was reviewed in 1999. This review was conducted by a small group of key stakeholders from inside and outside Government and chaired by the Head of the Economic and Domestic Secretariat within the Cabinet Office. The review concluded that the Unit had been a success and should continue until at least 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.292W.5/3">In 2004 the SEU carried out a major stocktake of the Government's approach to tackling social exclusion&mdash;published in the report, &quot;Breaking the Cycle&quot;. This brought together evidence from a range of national data sources, evaluation literature and the perspectives of service providers and users, and highlighted progress made by the Government's approach and remaining challenges.</p>

	<p pid="c.299W.5/2">In 1987 the British Railways Board (BRB) and the French national railway (SNCF) entered into a joint long-term usage contract (Channel Tunnel Usage Agreement) (also referred to as the Railways Usage Contract or RUC) with Eurotunnel.

	<p pid="c.299W.5/3">The UK Government's responsibilities with respect to the channel tunnel rail freight are principally derived from BRB's continuing obligations as formal signatory to the RUC, and from supplementary agreements to the RUC that were implemented to enable the privatisation of BRB's international freight (and passenger) businesses. These were legally transferred to the Strategic Rail Authority in 2001 and subsequently transferred to DfT Rail in August 2005.</p>

However, in the financial years 1996-97 and 1997-98 goods moved by rail freight in Great Britain totalled 15.1 and 16.9 billion tonne kilometres, respectively. And in 2005-06 the equivalent figure was 22.11 billion tonne kilometres.

	<p pid="c.302W.3/1">The event at Sunderland was a minor incident that did not endanger the flask, its contents, the public or the environment in any way. There were no nuclear safety implications and therefore no reason for any investigation over and above any which the organisations involved would routinely carry out following abnormal events.</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.3/2">The transport of radioactive material, including irradiated nuclear fuel, is governed by the stringent internationally-agreed standards recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an agency appointed by the United Nations to oversee all aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy worldwide. During the period of over 40 years that the IAEA Regulations have been in existence, there has been no instance of death or serious injury to persons, nor significant damage to the environment, from radiological effects caused during the transport of radioactive material worldwide by all modes of transport when properly packaged and transported in conformity with these Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.3/3">Irradiated nuclear fuel flasks are designed to withstand a very severe impact followed by severe fire. The safety of these movements is therefore secured by the design and build quality of the flasks used and not by the particular mode of transport used or route travelled.</p>

	<p pid="c.308W.5/2">The Government agree with Lord Justice Auld's finding in his review of the criminal courts that there is no compelling case for changing the present age limit of 70 for jury service. It would be unreasonable to require people above that age to serve, and having abolished in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the category of persons who are excusable as of right, we do not propose to reintroduce it for those over 70 in order to allow them to choose to serve as jurors.</p>

	<p pid="c.308W.8/1">The Government plan shortly to make transitional regulations that will require Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to obtain a signature and date of birth from existing postal voters to ensure that they will be subject to the new personal identifiers arrangements for absent voters. The regulations will require EROs to send a notice in writing to existing postal voters requesting the personal identifiers, which may be sent by the Royal Mail, a commercial delivery firm or any other way that the ERO thinks appropriate. EROs will be required to send a reminder to postal voters who have not responded after 21 days. Further, EROs will be required to provide information to existing postal voters about how the personal identifiers will be used, and to explain that failure to provide the personal identifiers will result in the person losing their entitlement to vote by post, though loss of entitlement will not prevent the person from making a fresh postal vote application.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.8/2">We do not consider it would be practical to set targets for the collection of the personal identifiers or to put in place formal monitoring arrangements. I understand that the independent Electoral Commission plans to issue guidance to electoral administrators about the collection of personal identifiers from existing postal voters, and to collect data about the number of notices issued by EROs and the percentage that are returned.</p>

	<p pid="c.321W.8/1">European agreements governing the application of VAT reliefs mean that while the UK can retain its existing VAT zero rates, such as those for approved works of alteration to certain listed buildings, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones. It is therefore not possible to zero-rate alteration or repair work carried out to unlisted church buildings. Furthermore, the same agreements do not allow for the application of reduced rates in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.321W.8/2">The Government recognise that listed places of worship are not just an essential part of our religious life but an important part of the history and fabric of our country, and that the need to use specialist craftsmen and costly materials means their upkeep can be a heavy burden, particularly on small congregations. That is why the Government have pressed the case at EU level for their repair and maintenance to be added to the supplies for which a reduced rate of VAT is available. However, while we recognise the importance of all places of worship within their communities, we also recognise that listed status means that the special architectural or historic interest in the church in question has been acknowledged and as such special tax treatment is justified on this basis.</p>

However, this Department places all surplus land on English Partnership's &quot;Register of Surplus Public Sector Assets&quot; to allow other Government Departments and agencies to express an interest, including regional development agencies. The MOD works closely with English Partnerships, regional development agencies, local authorities and other key stakeholders when considering its disposal strategy. This will normally include an assessment of development and regeneration opportunities through preparation of a planning brief which can be taken forward by prospective purchasers.</p>

	<p pid="c.331W.5/2">Service personnel who return with serious injuries from operational theatres are treated immediately. In addition, the MOD pays NHS Trusts to expedite elective secondary-care treatment ahead of typical NHS time scales where there is an operational benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.331W.5/3">On average, about 4,200 personnel across all three services will be in the process of being seen as either an in-patient or out-patient in the NHS Trusts which host Ministry of Defence Hospital Units, the majority of whom remain employed during this process. A small number of military personnel will receive treatment at other NHS hospitals, but this information is not held centrally and could only be obtained by examining all individual medical records.</p>
	<p pid="c.331W.5/4">The MOD runs its own rehabilitation units (for military patients with a range of musculo-skeletal conditions) and community-based psychiatric facilities, and has a contract with the Priory Group for the provision of in-patient psychiatric treatment. Such patients will therefore not need treatment in NHS facilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.336W.0/1">Reliability and safety problems with the previous Mine Protected Vehicle (MPV), Mamba, led the Department to consider refurbishment and modification of Mamba or its replacement. Replacement through a competitive Urgent Operational Requirement was chosen as the best option with bids assessed against the user's requirements of survivability (predominantly against mines), mobility, fightability and supportability. In November 2001 the bid from Supacat of the Tempest vehicle, based on an early version of the Force Protection Inc Cougar, was selected. Tempest was the name of the vehicle not the programme, but it is no longer used and the vehicle is now known in UK service simply as the MPV.</p>
	<p pid="c.336W.0/2">A &pound;2.7 million contract for eight MPVs was awarded to Supacat shortly afterwards with Technical Solutions Group Inc. (a subsidiary of Force Protection Inc.) supplying the base vehicle. The MPVs are supported under a contractor logistic support arrangement with Supacat Ltd. I am unable to provide the cost of the contract as this would, or would be likely to, prejudice commercial interests.</p>
	<p pid="c.336W.0/3">MPVs are used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams for specialist tasks such as EOD reconnaissance, rescue and recovery and route proving. MPVs were deployed to Bosnia from January to May 2004; and Iraq from July 2003 to November 2004. There are still eight MPVs in service including a number currently in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="c.336W.0/4">MPV was a commercial off the shelf equipment with some UK specific EOD modifications. Supacat Ltd. own the MPV intellectual property, although the MOD has free user rights for repair and maintenance. The majority of its specification is not classified but I am unable to comment on its detailed specifications and in particular its protection, as this would, or would be likely to prejudice the security of our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.337W.12/1">The increase in the numbers of procedures involving both mice and non-human primates is directly related to the size and maturity of the on-going medical countermeasures research programme. Mice are used mainly in studies to identify and assess candidate pre-treatments and therapies against biological warfare agents.</p>
	<p pid="c.337W.12/2">Non-human primates are involved in studies to develop advanced animal models for efficacy assessment of post exposure therapies for biological and chemical warfare agents, and studies to assess the visual effects resulting from exposure to very low levels of nerve agents.</p>
	<p pid="c.337W.12/3">Recent products from the Defence research programme include a therapy to treat those suffering from botulism. This is now available to treat UK servicemen, should botulinum toxin ever be used as a weapon against them, and has already been used to treat patients in both UK and Thailand who were subject to naturally occurring cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.338W.2/1">In the Naval Service, there are two schemes for entering the officer corps from the ranks:</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/2" class="indent">The Upper Yardman/Corps Commission (UY/CC) schemes for RN ratings and RM other ranks respectively who are under the age of 26 (for engineers&mdash;age 30) on the first day of the month that initial officer training begins.</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/3" class="indent">The Senior Upper Yardman/Senior Corps Commission (SUY/SCC) schemes for RN ratings and RM other ranks respectively who are over the age of 26 (for engineers&mdash;age 30) and would have a minimum of four years to serve (until their retirement date) on the first day of the month that initial officer training is expected to begin.</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/4">Individuals selected for the officer corps via the UY/CC schemes are treated in exactly the same way as individuals entering from outside the service and undertake the same initial training and are awarded the same rank and seniority on entry (currently based on age) as their civilian counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/5">Individuals selected for the officer corps via the SUY/SCC schemes undertake phase 1 training but thereafter receive bespoke training (where required) based on their experience and the nature of the post to which they are appointed. Given the greater relative experience of SUY/SCC officers over those selected by direct entry or via the UY/CC route, and in recognition of their likely employment (often as deep specialist officers), former ratings and other ranks (below the rank of Warrant Officer) gain a minimum one year's seniority advantage over their peers by passing out of phase 1 training as a Lieutenant RN or Captain RM.</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/6">In the Army there are two categories of personnel commissioned from the ranks: Late Entry (LE) Officers and those soldiers who attend the full Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS) Commissioning Course before the age of 29 and go on to be treated as Direct Entry (DE) Officers:</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/7" class="indent">Those who commission as LE Officers arrive on a level playing field as their civilian counterparts. They do exactly the same amount of training on commissioning and must attend the Late Entry Officer Course within their first year. There is then no difference in the speed with which they can be promoted up the rank structure.</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/8" class="indent">DE Officers from the Ranks attend the year long Commissioning Course at RMAS and will progress at different speeds depending on their reckonable service. They are allowed to carry forward half of their service in the ranks up to a maximum of four years. This allows those with more reckonable service to be promoted to Captain within 2.5 years of commissioning. This is on a par with graduate officers who can accumulate a maximum of 3.4 years reckonable service in recognition for their academic studies.</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/9">In the RAF, non-commissioned personnel who are selected for commissioned service in the general branches are made no allowance in terms of their initial training. If, however, they are entering as a nurse, they undertake the shorter SERE (Specialist Entrant&mdash;Re Entrant) course. This recognises their specialist skills and is tailored to the career pathways available to the specialist branches.</p>
	<p pid="c.338W.2/10">Non-commissioned airmen/women are commissioned under the terms set out in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.338W.2/13"> <td><i> Former rank</i><sup>(<i> 1,2</i>)</sup></td> <td><i> Rank on graduation from IOT</i></td> <td><i> Promotion to Flight Lieutenant after:</i><sup>(<i> 3,4,5</i>)</sup></td> </tr>

Time credits are set against the normal time-promotion progression to assess rank and seniority on entry. Subject to a maximum total of six years they are awarded in accordance with the following scale: (a) The first two years in full. (b) Officers who possess a Registered Nurse Tutors Certificate on entry; the first three years&mdash;in full.

There is no charge to members of HM Armed Forces for places at SCE schools. Where it is not possible or practical to provide a SCE school, arrangements are made for service parents to use local or international schools. Where there are no local English-speaking schools the full cost of attending fee-paying international schools is reimbursed.

	<p pid="c.341W.9/1">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 established the legislative framework for national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs). In doing so, it amended section 23 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to provide that NHSFTs could delegate their power to discharge patients detained under the 1983 Act to three or more of their non-executive directors. NHS trusts, by contrast, may delegate to three or more people who are not employees of the trust if they are (non-executive) directors (or the chairman) of the trust or members of one of its committees or subcommittees. It is this last group of individuals who are commonly referred to as &quot;associate hospital managers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.341W.9/2">The approach taken in the 2003 Act was the one considered appropriate at the time. However, the Government are now of the view that it would be better if NHSFTs had more flexibility to authorise people other than its non-executive directors to act on their behalf. It will therefore seek to amend the relevant primary legislation as soon as a suitable legislative opportunity arises.</p>
	<p pid="c.341W.9/3">In the interim, the obligation on NHSFTs to exercise their powers of discharge remains. Patients of NHSFT hospitals will therefore continue to be able to request the managers to consider their cases. Detained patients (in all hospitals) also have rights to apply to the mental health review tribunal, which is an independent judicial body with the power to discharge patients from liability to detention.</p>

The World Health Organization international programme on chemical safety global assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals, published in 2002, concluded that the additive effects of such chemicals would be very weak and the available data did not support a direct association.

Details of this discussion are available in a paper that has previously been placed in the Library of the House, and can be also found on the FSA website at: <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fsa050302.pdf">www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fsa050302.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/3">The main change for food businesses resulting from the new legislation is the requirement to have documented food safety management procedures in place that assure good hygiene standards so as to protect consumers. It is for businesses to make arrangements to comply with the new legislation and most larger businesses already had effective systems in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/4">In England, a support programme called &quot;Safer Food Better Business&quot; has been launched to help small catering and retail businesses. &pound;11.5 million has been allocated to this programme over three years starting in September 2005. The main elements of the programme are free guidance packs for businesses along with a special grants scheme that supports LAs to provide training and advice. Up to October 2006, 175,000 packs have been distributed free of charge to businesses and 86 projects involving 254 LAs, some two-thirds of the total number have been funded, directly supporting over 52,000 small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/5">Grants were awarded to projects run by LAs following appraisals of applications. Appraisals were carried out by the FSA assisted by stakeholders, including the British Hospitality Association (BHA), the Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) and an independent academic expert. Not all applications were successful. Between September 2005 and October 2006 just over &pound;3.5 million had actually been spent. All figures exclude value added tax (VAT).</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/6">Similar schemes to support businesses are in place in other countries in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/7">Details of the &quot;Safer Food Better Business&quot; grants can be found on the FSA website at: <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/sep/foodsafetycash">www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/sep/foodsafetycash</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/8">In addition, the new regulation applies to farmers and growers, in many cases for the first time. In England, the FSA has allocated &pound;1.2 million excluding VAT in 2006-07 to train local authority officers to undertake this new work and to directly support inspections. This funding is likely to remain in place until arrangements have been made to provide funding through the revenue support grant from 2008-09. Plans to deliver this activity are under way from late 2006. No money had actually been spent up to October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.351W.2/1">The provisional number of training places in England projected by the postgraduate deans to be available next year is slightly in excess of 30,000.

	<p pid="c.351W.2/2">These figures are indicative and are still subject to further discussions with postgraduate deans, medical Royal Colleges and the national health service and will be refined later in the year. Work on the distribution across individual specialties is now under way and the outcome will be published when the figures are confirmed. Foundation programmes are not specialty specific.</p>
	<p pid="c.351W.2/3">The number of training places in each training programme is planned over time to provide the number of specialists and general practitioners necessary to deliver patient care. Entry to training programmes will be by competition. Each applicant will be able to make up to four applications and can therefore choose to compete for both specialties and locations.</p>
	<p pid="c.351W.2/4">Selection and recruitment will be managed by postgraduate deans according to person specifications developed for each specialty. Shortlisted candidates will be interviewed by expert panels comprising specialists in the field and service representatives. This process will be supported by the Medical Training Application Service (MTAS), a UK-wide web-based system designed to support the efficient handling of applications. This new system went live on <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase> this year for the handling of foundation programme applications and goes live January 2007 for the start of specialty recruitment.</p>

	<p pid="c.365W.6/1">North Korea's claim of a nuclear test on <phrase class="date" code="">9 October</phrase> has only added to our concerns over its nuclear programme, which came to the fore following North Korea's expulsion of the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors in December 2002 and its statement of intention to withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in January 2003. Its actions jeopardise regional stability in North-East Asia and pose a clear threat to international peace and security.

	<p pid="c.365W.6/2">North Korea's test contravenes its commitments under the NPT, breaches the North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, and ignores UNSCR 1695.

However, the cultivation picture varies between, and within provinces, and in some areas where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved last year have been sustained and in some cases fallen. This is encouraging and shows that the strategy is working. Progress is also being made in other areas. Vital counter-narcotics legislation was passed last December; over 280 traffickers have been convicted to date; and a high security prison for serious drug offenders has been constructed in Kabul. To support alternative livelihoods over 12 million labour days have been provided; 8,800 km of roads rehabilitated, and US$187million in small grants and US$90 million in micro-finance loans have been disbursed.</p>

	<p pid="c.367W.2/1">Experience in the Golden Triangle demonstrates the need to adopt a comprehensive and long-term approach to counter narcotics in order to have a sustainable impact on the drugs trade. In developing its National Drug Control Strategy, the Afghan Government have had regular contact with the Thai authorities, whose holistic opium reduction strategy is considered to be one of the most successful in the world. The Thai strategy focuses on law enforcement, building infrastructure to support development, providing alternative livelihoods and demand reduction. Similarly the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which the UK supports, reflects these key priorities. However, sustainable drug elimination strategies take time, particularly when the challenges are as severe as they are in Afghanistan. In Thailand, where the problem was much less complex, cultivation increased before the strategy took effect and it took 30 years to achieve a sustainable solution.</p>

	<p pid="c.367W.5/1">The UK's Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Helmand is focused on developing Afghan local capacity in development, security and governance, and is helping administer the &pound;20 million the UK has pledged towards the province's reconstruction this financial year. Since the UK took over the PRT in May we have seen early progress on these three fronts, with PRT officials delivering valuable assistance in a challenging environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.367W.5/2">Development is necessarily a long-term activity. However, the PRT, in close co- ordination with local and national Government, is laying the foundations for lasting reconstruction. To this end, in the past six months the PRT has implemented a number of &quot;quick impact projects&quot;. These include construction of windmill powered wells in Lashkar Gah, Garmser and Nad-Ali; construction of schools in Nahri Sarj, Now Zad and Lashkar Gah; urgent water infrastructure works in Lashkar Gah; and emergency food distribution across southern Helmand. The Royal Engineer regiment based in the PRT is playing a key role in delivering this development assistance across the province.</p>
	<p pid="c.367W.5/3">On security, the PRT has undertaken projects to strengthen and reorganise the Helmand police force. In addition the Royal Engineers, at the request of the provincial Government, have undertaken projects aimed at strengthening the security infrastructure in Lashkar Gah. These include the construction of vehicle checkpoints and Afghan national police outposts around Lashkar Gah. On governance, PRT officials are working with Helmand's provincial Government to strengthen provincial-level democracy. The PRT have helped the Provincial Development Committee prioritise its efforts in line with national plans, enabling Afghan-led reconstruction efforts to get off the ground. The PRT continues to provide vital support to the Administration.</p>

The fund is managed by the UN Development Programme. By bringing funding onto the Afghan budget the CNTF will build Afghan counter narcotics capacity, planning and resource transparency. At present, expenditure on alternative livelihoods, implemented through existing national development programmes, is a top priority for the CNTF. However, CNTF funding can also be channelled into other counter narcotics activities including law enforcement and criminal justice activity. A total of US$83.6 million has so far been raised for the CNTF. The UK will channel &pound;30 million into the fund over a three-year period. Other contributors include Australia, Canada, Estonia, the European Commission, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Oman, Sweden and USA.</p>

	<p pid="c.371W.6/1">We believe all obstacles to trade in the region should be removed. The history of the EU demonstrates the power of trade to promote economic prosperity and political reconciliation. The preliminary findings of the World Bank report on the economy in northern Cyprus, are that the external constraints on access to EU markets for the Turkish Cypriot community are one of the two biggest constraints to economic development in northern Cyprus. I would endorse the conclusion that the long-term welfare of all Cypriots is in jeopardy if steps are not taken to ensure the convergence of living standards on the island. That is why we remain committed to supporting the Turkish Cypriots and the EU Commission in economic and regulatory reform, and to supporting the EU Presidency in its efforts to find a way for the Turkish Cypriots to trade directly with the EU.</p>

	<p pid="c.372W.2/1">The World Bank report is one of the first objective surveys of the Turkish Cypriot economy. The report usefully identifies its serious structural problems, together with the restrictive effect of the continuing economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and its continuing economic dependence on Turkey. It illustrates the importance of our continuing to support measures designed to promote the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and the economic reintegration of the island in fulfilment of the commitment of EU Foreign Ministers to lift their isolation, particularly through EU financial assistance and further regional trade liberalisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.378W.5/1">Since the London Meeting in March 2005, the UK has taken a number of steps to implement the International Community Commitments. The Palestinian Authority (PA) also had a number of Commitments to implement in parallel. These Commitments include action to address economic development, governance and security. The UK has been encouraging international partners to implement the International Community Commitments.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.5/2">With regards to economic development, in December 2005 the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee, co-chaired by the UK and Norway, met in London. Also in December 2005, HM Treasury held a private sector business/ investment event.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.5/3">Under the UK's Presidency of the EU, an international crossing point at Rafah was opened. The UK was closely involved in the negotiations. Our total financial contribution to the EU Border Assistance Mission at Rafah is &pound;913,000. This financial contribution includes personnel, equipment and financial contribution. Also, the UK seconded a member of staff to the UN Office for the Co-ordination for Humanitarian Affairs to identify physical obstacles to movement in the West Bank which can be removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.5/4">On governance, we provided over &pound;200,000-worth of assistance for the Palestinian elections which were held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-25">25 January</phrase>. In particular we worked with the electoral authorities to support work on media monitoring, training local journalists and funding the ballot papers. In addition, as well as supporting the official EU monitoring observation mission, we also separately funded a small parliamentary observation visit to the region organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.5/5">The Department for International Development provided long-term assistance to the PA for the design and implementation of its Public Administration and Civil Service Support Programme. This included work on strengthening Cabinet policy-making, reviewing the mandates and institutional structures of all PA agencies, and assisting with the Medium-Term Development Plan. Direct engagement with the PA has been suspended since the formation of the Hamas-led Government, although work is ongoing with a range of partner civil society organisations active in this field.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.5/6">On security, the EU expanded its police support mission, EU Co-ordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support (EU COPPS), in January 2006, to help transform the Palestinian police and make them more accountable to the Palestinian Ministry of the Interior. Through EU COPPS, the UK has helped to: support the PA in reforming its civil policing structures; improve the effectiveness, efficiency and image of 18,600 police officers; rebuild and modernise police facilities; purchase 54 police cars; provide training and equipment and co-ordinate better the international donor community's support for the Palestinian police.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.5/7">Since the Hamas-led PA came to power, there has been limited progress against both the International Community Commitments and the PA Commitments.</p>

The UK has been involved in much of the work that the International Community has done to make progress against these commitments. I refer the right hon. Member to the written answer I gave him today (UIN 95350).</p>
	<p pid="c.379W.2/2">In terms of economic development, in June 2005 G8 leaders supported the former Quartet Special Envoy James Wolfensohn's intention to stimulate a global financial contribution of up to US$3 billion per year over the coming three years. Also, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November 2005</phrase>, the EU High Representative Javier Solana, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and James Wolfensohn announced an Agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians on Movement and Access.</p>
	<p pid="c.379W.2/3">On security, United States Security Co-ordinator General Ward and his successor, General Dayton, have been working closely with the Palestinians on Security Sector Reform (SSR). Since March 2005 progress has been made including developing capacity within the Ministry of Interior, establishing international co-ordination mechanisms for SSR and developing consensus around an SSR approach, and facilitating an upgrade of the Palestinian security forces' capability. Following the election of Hamas, the international community suspended previous security sector work. Since then General Dayton has been developing a range of plans, which the international community can implement in the current political circumstances, and which will deliver tangible improvements in the day-to-day lives of Palestinians. We have been working closely with General Dayton's team on these plans. Donors, including ourselves, are looking at funding options.</p>
	<p pid="c.379W.2/4">With regards to governance, the EU, as well as other international partners, provided support to the Palestinian Legislative Council elections on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-25">25 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.379W.2/5">Since Hamas came to power, and failed to meet the three Quartet principles (renouncing violence; recognise Israel; and accept all previous agreements and obligations including the Roadmap), work on meeting the International Community Commitments has slowed. We, along with our international partners, want to see a Palestinian Government with whom we can engage and do business.</p>

	<p pid="c.381W.2/1">The UK is a leading supporter of the African Union Mission in Darfur (AMIS). We were its first donor, and have to date provided &pound;52 million of assistance. This has been used for budgetary support, vehicles and other equipment, and to airlift troops to and from Darfur. The African Union has now decided to increase the strength of AMIS by two battalions (approximately 1,200 men). We stand ready to assist them in this. Meanwhile, at our urging, the UN is helping to bolster AMIS prior to any transition to a UN force. The UN will provide much-needed planning and logistics capability with the deployment of 163 staff officers to assist the military and civilian police wings of AMIS as well as its senior management. The UN will provide a further 36 armoured personnel carriers and a range of other equipment to help improve AMIS effectiveness. We are looking at what personnel the United Kingdom can provide to the UN assistance package.</p>

	<p pid="c.381W.8/2">I applaud the work of the Zimbabwe Women campaign and wish them every success in their efforts and their fund-raising. DFID has not provided funds directly to this campaign. DFID's top priorities are to tackle HIV and AIDS, currently causing over 3,200 deaths per week; and assisting over a million people living in dire poverty. DFID recently contributed &pound;20 million to a behaviour change programme which is already showing results in reducing HIV infection rates in Zimbabwe. DFID has also committed &pound;25 million to assist the country's 1.3 million orphans and &pound;20 million to enable an additional 20,000 Zimbabweans with AIDS to access anti-retroviral therapy, treatment for opportunistic infections and other services including home based care. Last year we contributed &pound;10 million to the World Food Programme's work in Zimbabwe. DFID supports an ongoing Protracted Relief Programme, spending some &pound;10 million per year, which is providing food, seeds, fertilisers and other forms of practical assistance to over one million of the country's poorest and most vulnerable people. This has included giving access to clean drinking water to over 600,000 people in the last year. DFID is currently developing a new initiative to reduce the high mortality rates for mothers and newborn children, through support for reproductive health services including maintaining poor people's access to affordable contraceptives. All of DFID's assistance is delivered through NGOs and UN agencies&mdash;none of our funding is channelled through the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="c.384W.12/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) is a national victimisation survey covering crime in England and Wales since 1981. Estimates of victimisation by police force area have been available through the BCS only since 2001-02. Figures are reported annually in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 'Crime in England and Wales'.</p>
	<p pid="c.384W.12/2">There is no figure for the overall numbers of victims as certain crimes are against households (such as burglary or some forms of vandalism) and thus affect an undefined number of people. This is true both of police recorded crime and BCS figures. The best indicator is therefore given by the number of incidents of crime in England and Wales estimated by the BCS which are shown in the attached table going back to 1981. The estimates of prevalence for each police force area from 2001-02 to 2005-06 can be found within the web pages devoted to each of the annual Crime in England and Wales statistical bulletins (incident estimates are not available by police force area). The figures cannot be broken down by local authority area.</p>

	<p pid="c.387W.5/1">A person subject to an EU travel ban is excluded from the UK and details of all those individuals included on a travel ban are entered on the Home Office watch list. That watch list is used by staff overseas and at UK ports to identify those people who should not be admitted to the UK. A person who entered the UK by deception and so in breach of a travel ban would be treated as an illegal entrant and be subject to removal. We have no record of any individual who is subject to a travel ban being identified in the UK and being either arrested or deported.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/2">The UK is only party to EU and UN travel bans and the enabling immigration legislation only allows the Secretary of State to designate EU or UN travel bans. Such designation has the effect of making individuals subject to such bans automatically excluded from the UK under section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/3">There is no international immunity from the effects of an EU travel ban. I can also confirm that individuals subject to an EU travel ban are not permitted to transit the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.5/4">The Home Office has not received any representations from people subject to EU travel bans. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has received only one formal representation but does receive a number of informal, and not centrally recorded, representations from those who are subject to EU travel bans.</p>

	<p pid="c.393W.11/1">The Police Funding Formula is used to make an assessment of the relative demands placed on each police authority in England and Wales. The population of each authority is a key driver within this formula With the introduction of multi-year settlements in 2006-07, projections of population are used to ensure that the formula is forward looking. The population projections are constructed using information supplied by the National Assembly for Wales and the Registrar General.</p>

	<p pid="c.397W.2/2">Prison Service Order 2700 (current version issued in November 2002) sets out the procedures for suicide prevention and self-harm management in the Prison Service in England and Wales. This is available on the internet at <a href="http://pso.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/PSO_2700_suicide_and_self_harm_prevention.doc">http://pso.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/PSO_2700_suicide_and_self_harm_prevention.doc</a>. PSO 2700 is currently being revised to incorporate learning from the Safer Locals Programme (2001-05), learning from death in custody investigation reports, and recent safer custody initiatives, including the introduction of ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody &amp; Teamwork&mdash;the new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners). The revised PSO is planned to be issued in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.397W.2/3">Detention Services within immigration have traditionally adopted similar suicide/self-harm prevention strategies to the Prison Service, and are currently implementing a version of the ACCT system.</p>
	<p pid="c.397W.2/4">Each facility within the secure psychiatric services estate has its own self-harm and suicide prevention policies, which are informed by guidance issued by the National Institute for Mental Health in 2003, &quot;Preventing Suicide: A Toolkit for Mental Health Services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.397W.2/5">Youth Justice Board (YJB) contracts with Secure Children's Homes (SCHs) and Secure Training Centres (STCs) stipulate that risks of self-harm and suicide must be treated seriously and responded to. The YJB monitors Suicide and Self-Harm (SASH) plans and policies to ensure they are reviewed and updated. Custodial staff are expected to demonstrate an understanding of SASH policies and practices, that SASH review meetings are programmed and that risks of self-harm are considered during the initial assessment stage following admission and in every subsequent review and planning meeting. The Commission of Social Care Inspectorate (CSCI) carries out announced and unannounced inspections each year to monitor how SCHs and STCs are adhering to statutory regulations and national minimum standards issued by the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="c.397W.2/6">Guidance relating to the risk of self-harm and suicide posed by individuals detained in police custody is contained in the &quot;Guidance on the Safer Detention and Handling of Persons,&quot; which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-08">8 February 2006</phrase>.</p>
