The indicative allocation for each CSP has been determined using a funding formula which takes account of population, levels of recorded crime and deprivation in each locality. As part of these funding arrangements, CSPs are required to submit annual action plans supported by a strategic assessment of local needs and to agree to a set of terms and conditions. In addition, they have been directed to take cognisance of the NIO Safer Communities Public Service Agreement Key Performance Indicators around reducing antisocial behaviour incidents and violent crime and to contribute to a range of regional priorities for community safety.</p>

	<p pid="c.545W.8/1">Under the Northern Ireland Office's PSA target of Making Communities Safer, the Department is committed to reduce re-offending in Northern Ireland. While much is being done to address re-offending across the criminal justice system, a cross government strategic approach is essential to making significant inroads into level of re-offending. To achieve this joined-up approach:</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.8/2" class="indent">An Inter-Ministerial Group is being established&mdash;the NIO has secured agreement from OFMDFM to the establishment of a Ministerial Group on Reducing Offending to promote a cross departmental approach and ensure that a coherent, coordinated strategy is adopted to all aspects of offending;</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.8/3" class="indent">A women offenders strategy is under development&mdash;a specific approach to women offenders is being progressed through a women's strategy. As part of this initiative, a pilot women's centre has been established to develop appropriate assessment tools and programmes focused on sustaining and supporting women offenders in the community;</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.8/4" class="indent">Offenders learning and skills deficits are being addressed&mdash;the MO, in partnership with the Departments of Education and Employment and Learning, is establishing a Learning and Skills Forum. The forum will focus on making better use of existing education and skills training to provide a more joined up service for existing offenders and young people at risk of offending.</p>

	<p pid="c.551W.3/1">VisitBritain's marketing of England for tourism purposes includes the dissemination of material to people living on the Isle of Man. Any associated press activity is also shown in the Isle of Man. National campaigns taken forward by VisitBritain also target the Isle of Man.</p>
	<p pid="c.551W.3/2">A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for overseas marketing is in place between VisitBritain and the Isle of Man Government which sets out a framework, respective roles and responsibilities and working relationships for the benefit of promoting Britain and the Isle of Man effectively to overseas visitors. The Isle of Man Government pay VisitBritain an annual marketing fee in support of the MoU. This ensures that the Isle of Man has equivalent treatment to the other nations and regions of Britain.</p>

	<p pid="c.564W.5/1">We are aiming to put in place a significant number of marine plans over a 20 year period. We have not set out in the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, either the number of plans or the deadline for their production because this is a new system which needs to evolve.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.5/2">The figures in the impact assessment published alongside the Bill are based on 10 plans, although the eventual number of plans, and their size will depend on local ecological and regional characteristics and needs in the areas where planning is most needed. We envisage that plans will be created through a phased approach, with the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) prioritising resources to the areas where it is determined that early planning will be of most benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.5/3">We aim to start developing the first plans as soon as the MMO is established. We will be examining these issues during the course of the next year and will consult with stakeholders as part of developing our approach.</p>

The MMO will not be working alone but will be seeking to involve marine and planning expertise from the stakeholder community. Ultimately the numbers engaged in the planning process will be determined by the priority allocated to planning and the availability of resources, in essence the needs of the business.</p>

	<p pid="c.566W.9/1">In terms of key performance indicator 6, which deals with the proportion of small claims (claims up to &pound;5,000) that are dealt with other than by a hearing (settlement), Kent has increased from 52.4 per cent. at the end of 2007-08, to 55.1 per cent. for the first six months of this year. Increased administrative support is being given to the Kent small claims mediator to improve the throughput of civil cases where the parties believe that mediation outside the courtroom may lead to settlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.9/2">For key performance indicator 7, which measures the proportion of defended small claims that are completed (from issue to final hearing) within 30 weeks, there has been a decline in throughput of civil small claims cases in Kent in 2008-09 based on figures to the end of September 2008. Her Majesty's Courts Service, Kent has taken the following steps to improve the performance. On small claims cases, deputy district judge sittings have increased by an additional 66 days to improve performance. Greater use is being made of listing a block of cases before two or more district judges sitting on the same day at the same location, thus utilising judicial time more effectively. A pilot exercise is being undertaken whereby the Kent small claims mediator attends that same court to offer on-the-spot mediation to parties awaiting hearing who wish to take advantage of this free mediation service. Closer scrutiny of the reasons for cases not meeting target will be carried out by court managers from December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.9/3">In line with the key performance indicator to increase the amount of civil work initiated online, Kent has made progress and in October 2008, 67 per cent. of customers issued possession claims online as compared with 41.3 per cent. a year ago. Further work is planned to increase online take up.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.9/4">In relation to (the supporting indicator, for) large multi-track cases (over &pound;15,000), the system by which these cases are heard at each location at Kent within the same fortnight is being extended to three fortnights a year, rather than two, to improve performance against target. A review of all multi-track cases at Canterbury county court was recently carried out by the designated civil judge to ensure that cases were being dealt with in a timely manner and not incurring avoidable delay.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.9/5">Supporting management information is provided in relation to the proportion of administrative process completed within five days. Kent's performance is slightly below the South East region's figure of 92.9 per cent., at 91.2 per cent. for the first six months of this year. During the first part of the year in Kent, a number of county court manager roles were covered on a temporary basis at Canterbury (seven months), Medway (ongoing temporary promotion), and Tunbridge Wells (temporary promotion, four months), as well as at Maidstone county court. The majority of court manager vacancies are now filled and with the training of new staff that has taken place, improvement in the management of administrative process at these sites is anticipated.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.9/6">Kent has been included, as part of wider regional reviews including the Civil Listing Review, District Judge Complementing Review and Circuit Judge Complementing Review. These reviews have made recommendations on listing practices and the operation of concurrent jurisdiction for circuit and district judges and the requirement to hear civil work at the most appropriate level.

NI 35 is replicated in the Assessments of Policing and Community Safety (APACS) performance framework as a key diagnostic indicator.

	<p pid="c.583W.2/1">The Home Office has funded a number of projects. The National Offender Management Service is taking forward a multi-disciplinary programme of work to manage the risks of violent extremist offenders which contributes to both PREVENT and PURSUE objectives and spans work with offenders in prison establishments and on licence in the community. Central funding for this programme is provided through the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) Prevent budget. Since 2005, OSCT has provided HM Prison Service (HMPS) with the following funding: 2005-06&mdash;&pound;65,463, 2006-07&mdash;&pound;140,535 and 2007-08&mdash;&pound;822,542. &pound;2.7 million has been allocated in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="c.583W.2/2">&pound;2.6 million OSCT funding has been allocated to the Youth Justice Board in this financial year to a two-year programme of work under the work stream of the Prevent Strategy aimed at 'supporting vulnerable individuals'. A total of 40 Youth Offending Team/Youth Secure Estate projects have been funded so far with a further 10 project bids expected to be submitted for a one-year funding round in 2009-10. Projects cover a wide range of interventions and are aimed at vulnerable young people who have been involved in or who may be at risk of entering the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="c.589W.5/1">My Department is proposing to amend Part L of the Building Regulations to include, for the first time, standards for circulatory pumps from 2010. My officials have been working with the British Pump Manufacturers Association (BPMA) (which account for approximately 85 per cent. of the UK market for pumps) to develop agreed proposals. The BPMA have proposed that for 2010 the Regulations should, as a first step, introduce the Europump labelling scheme for circulators in domestic heating systems and variable speed drives for larger water pumps. The eventual proposals will be the subject of formal consultation in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.591W.8/1">It is the Government's policy that HIPs should be available on the first day of marketing. The temporary concession to the policy served a valuable role in smoothing the introduction of HIPs. However, evidence from our area trials, consumer focus groups and gathered through our on-going monitoring of HIPs indicates that consumers are not being shown the HIP and that is in part due to the temporary exemption from the policy. Our decision is also supported by research from Europe Economics, which shows that HIPs have no impact on house prices or transactions.</p>

	<p pid="c.595W.11/1">Ebbsfleet Valley will, in the main, be delivered through private sector investment and, in the short term, progress will largely be governed by what is possible for the private sector to achieve under current economic conditions. However, the Ebbsfleet Valley development has always been a long-term project and as the market improves we expect the overall targets to be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="c.595W.14/1">The Government are supporting the necessary infrastructure required to help private sector developers achieve their aspirations for Ebbsfleet. The Homes and Communities Agency is considering a contribution to the Homes and Roads project which will provide a series of transport initiatives to improve access and traffic flow to the area and fund public transport improvements. My Department has also funded the Fastrack rapid transit system, which will link Ebbsfleet Valley with the wider Kent Thameside regeneration area. Ebbsfleet is already connected to the European High Speed rail network. Domestic high speed services from Ebbsfleet to St. Pancras start in 2009, increasing the attractiveness of the location for development, investment and employers.</p>

	<p pid="c.604W.0/1">When the Department for International Development (DFID) funds multilateral partners for specific projects we subject them to regular mandatory project cycle management design and approval procedures to establish accounting and audit, in-year and end of project reporting standards and processes. To safeguard UK taxpayers' investment, these include detailed narrative and financial reports on project expenditure, progress achieved with resources used, and assurance that any problems identified are being addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.0/2">For grants to international organisations, we insist on evidence about the use of funds from the organisation's own audited accounts, or special audited statements. Our requirements are set out in standard (MOU) texts and are built into the funding agreement. It is mandatory for projects with an approved commitment of &pound;1 million and above and which are at least one year old to be reviewed and scored annually.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.0/3">For core funding, which is general support to the multilateral institution's overall budget, DFID uses institutional strategies (ISs) to set the framework for the funding relationship. ISs include a performance framework that contains measurable indicators and targets, with baselines and data sources that are clearly specified. IS objectives are scored annually. DFID uses the agency's own monitoring systems as far as possible supplemented by independent reviews as required on an annual basis. We insist on evidence about the use of funds from the organisation's own audited accounts, or special audited statements, as well as additional internal controls. For example, the World Bank provides us with an annual set of accounts that has been audited by an external, private sector audit firm, as well as an annual external audit of their financial risk controls. The World Bank also has a strong internal audit department and an independent evaluation arm that regularly tests the quality of the project portfolio and reports publicly. Similarly, the European Union's administrative structures include anti-fraud and internal audit units and the European Court of Auditors, as well as an Evaluation Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.0/4">It is rare for us to provide physical assets to an international organisation. Where we do, these typically remain the property of the UK Government. If the organisation wishes to dispose of the assets or use them for a different purpose to that originally intended, DFID must approve the decision.</p>

	<p pid="c.605W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-15">15 December 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.605W.6/2">In 2003, &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper set out a strategic framework for the development of airport capacity in the United Kingdom over the next 30 years. In it we said that our basic aim is to limit and where possible reduce the number of people in the UK significantly affected by aircraft noise.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.6/3">Prior to entry into service, the noise levels generated by any aircraft design are measured by the applicant/manufacturer and then approved by a certificating authority. With regard to the UK, the approving authority is the European Aviation Safety Organisation (EASA), except for light propeller aircraft and microlights where the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) retains responsibility. Certification noise limits are set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The most recent 'Chapter 4' noise limits for large aircraft were introduced on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.6/4">The Department for Transport is responsible for specific noise mitigation measures at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. These include noise preferential departure routes, noise departure limits for both day and night with, additionally, strict limits of movements and a quota system&mdash;to encourage use of quieter aircraft&mdash;at night.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.6/5">At other UK airports, noise restrictions may be imposed voluntarily by the airport operator or by local planning conditions/agreements and these will vary depending on local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.6/6">In terms of measuring noise, aircraft noise contours for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted using the Leq metric are produced annually for the Department by the CAA. Elsewhere in the UK, it is the responsibility of airports to produce aircraft noise contours as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.6/7">Under the European Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC, all major airports in the UK have been required to produce noise maps for 2006, based on the Lden metric. The directive also requires airports to publish action plans designed to manage noise issues and effects arising from aircraft departing from and arriving at their airport, including noise reduction if necessary. Implementation of the directive in England is a matter for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland it is the responsibility of the devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.6/8">Given the difference in parameters, caution should be exercised in attempting any comparison between Leq aircraft noise contour maps and aircraft noise contour maps produced in accordance with the Environmental Noise Directive.</p>

The first of these sets mandatory upper limits on permissible rolling resistance of tyres for passenger cars, light goods vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles in two stages. The Government fully support the Commission's proposed limit values and implementation dates which will reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions and contribute towards the UK meeting its carbon dioxide reduction targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.613W.6/3">The second proposal calls for tyre labelling, along the lines of the energy label on white goods, indicating the rolling resistance of the tyre within a set of defined bands from A (lowest rolling resistance) to G (highest rolling resistance).</p>
	<p pid="c.613W.6/4">This proposal has only just been published and EU negotiations on it have not yet begun.

	<p pid="c.614W.3/1">The level of carer's allowance and its conditions of entitlement, including the 21-hour full-time education rule, were considered by the income task force, created as part of the review of the National Carers Strategy. The new strategy was published in June 2008, and included the report from the taskforce, which gave options for changes to carer's allowance.

We will aim to design a system that is able to provide support where it is most needed and that can adapt to the wide range of needs that carers have, enabling carers to maintain a balance between their caring responsibilities and a life outside caring.</p>

Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br/> 3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately the job opportunities actually available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 4. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Jobcentre Plus Labour Market System</td> </tr>

Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br/> 3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately the job opportunities actually available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 4. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Jobcentre Plus Labour Market System.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.622W.2/1">The provider referrals and payments (PRaP) system will, using the secure Government Gateway, supply flexible new deal providers with the minimum personal data about the customer to enable them to fulfil their contractual obligations and trigger payment. As we are still developing the system, the data that will be transferred remain to be finalised.</p>

Other sources of information such as the Labour Market System will also be used. Once it is known which providers have been successful in their bids to operate flexible new deal, we will work with them to ensure that they are ready to operate PRaP to deliver the required services from October 2009 and provide management information as specified.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.2/4">As the project progresses through key stages in the design, development and implementation of PRaP, the work plan is revised and updated. The final plan, taking the project through to implementation, will be agreed in late April. A copy of this will be placed in the Library at that time. PRaP is being developed by the Department's IT suppliers EDS with their Oracle consultancy practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.624W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions has a substantial programme of research. Many of the Department's research projects have direct links to our understanding of child poverty and the development of our child poverty strategy (for example, evaluating the support provided for lone parents moving into work). While not their main focus, many other projects have implications for child poverty (for example, the evaluation of Pathways to Work). All our research is published and available on the Department's website. The 2009-10 research programme is currently being established.</p>
	<p pid="c.624W.2/2">Substantial progress has been made in tackling child poverty. Some 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty since 1998-99, reversing the upward trend that saw child poverty double in the 20 years from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="c.624W.2/3">The target to reduce child poverty by a quarter between 1998-99 and 2004-05 was established by Public Service Agreements in 2000 and 2002. The target was narrowly missed. Against the indicators used to assess the target, the percentage reduction in this period was 23 per cent. on the before housing costs measure of poverty and 17 per cent. on the after housing costs measure.</p>
	<p pid="c.624W.2/4">The increases since 2004-05, while regrettable, are small and statistically insignificant. The latest figures take us up to March 2007. Since that time, the Government have announced significant measures that will support considerable further progress.</p>

	<p pid="c.626W.0/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what her estimate is of the (a) employment and (b) unemployment rate of (i) men (ii) women and (iii) men and women with the equivalent of five GCSEs or fewer aged (A) 16 to 24, (B) 25 to 34, (C) 35 to 49 and (D) 50 to state retirement age was in each quarter of the last 10 years (241704)</p>
	<p pid="c.626W.0/5" class="indent">The available information requested is provided in the attached tables. Comparable estimates are not available for the periods prior to April 2001. In addition, estimates for Q1 2005 are not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.626W.0/6" class="indent">The estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="c.626W.0/7" class="indent">The figures have been derived from the LFS microdata which are weighted using the official population estimates published in autumn 2007. Consequently the estimates from Q3 onwards are not entirely consistent with the figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release which are weighted using more up-to-date population estimates.</p>

	<p pid="c.632W.12/1">Winter fuel payments are made to people aged 60 and over because they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather during the winter months. The structure of the scheme, which provides for an annual lump sum payment, is not appropriate for the needs of cancer patients whose extra heating needs can arise at any time of year, not just in the winter months.</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.12/2">Help is already available through the disability benefits and the disability premiums in the income-related benefits in recognition of the extra costs, including heating, which people with cancer may have. These are spread over a 52-week period and can have a substantial annual value, up to around &pound;8,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.12/3">The Government believe that the existing help currently provided is the best way to help meet individuals' needs and there are no plans to extend winter fuel payments to other vulnerable groups.</p>

In 2009-10 there will be 146-148 new awards and in 2010-11 there will be 121-123.</p>
	<p pid="c.633W.6/2">In 2008-09 it is anticipated that there will be 15 new Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Awards for doctoral students from Commonwealth countries. Funding for these awards also comes from private sponsors. On the basis of Research Council planning figures for 2009 scholar starts there may be up to 15 commonwealth new scholars supported per annum in future years, depending on securing sufficient private sponsors for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.633W.6/3">The Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme (ORSAS) is an independent HEFCE (Higher Education Funding Council for England) scheme. A block grant is given to universities and information on which countries the students come from is not available. HEFCE decided earlier this year that continued investment after 2010-11 could not be justified given other competing priorities for funding. PQ 233995 also refers.</p>
	<p pid="c.633W.6/4">We do not know how many scholarships will be available in 2012-13 as this is in the next spending review period.</p>

	<p pid="c.639W.11/4" class="indent">Our role as the Regulator of Charities is to offer general advice and support to trustees on their duty to control and manage a charity's finances and investments. We do not recommend, promote or endorse any banks or financial services to charities, and we have neither approved or issued a list of financial services where charities could place investments and deposits.</p>
	<p pid="c.639W.11/5" class="indent">We offer advice, guidance and support to charities but are not able to act in their administration except in certain cases involving misconduct or mismanagement.</p>

This may be the source of the misunderstanding which has arisen regarding the advice we have given. The main aim of this guidance was to help charities identify which were likely to be eligible to claim compensation for their lost deposits through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). The guidance will be updated with any new or additional information that might be of help to these charities.</p>

	<p pid="c.643W.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the Authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.643W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated December 2008:</p>
	<p pid="c.643W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your question, pursuant to the answer of 18th November 2008 (Official Report, column 408W) on immigration, regarding what the level of net immigration is at which the population of the UK would remain below 70 million on unchanged assumptions about birth rates, mortality and emigration levels on the basis of the most recent population projections. (243465)</p>
	<p pid="c.643W.3/4" class="indent">Migration assumptions for national population projections are conventionally expressed in terms of net migration (immigration less emigration) rather than for the gross flows separately. However, nominal immigration and emigration totals are used in the projection process mainly to enable plausible age distributions to be calculated for the assumed net migration totals.</p>
	<p pid="c.643W.3/5" class="indent">The 2006-based principal (or central) projection assumed a long-term annual net inflow to the UK of +190,000 persons a year. In this projection, the population of the UK is projected to reach 70 million in 2028. To answer your question, further population projections have been produced by reducing the nominal immigration totals applied in the 2006-based principal projection, but leaving the fertility, mortality and emigration assumptions unchanged. Based on these assumptions, with a long-term net migration inflow of +60,000 a year, the population would reach 70 million in the 2070s. However, with a net migration inflow of +50,000 a year the population would be just below 70 million in 2081, although it would still be continuing to rise.</p>
	<p pid="c.643W.3/6" class="indent">In practice, this may not be a realistic scenario. If immigration fell permanently to levels well below those experienced in recent years, it is likely that this would, in time, lead to a reduction in the level of emigration as well, it is possible to have a range of combinations of levels of immigration and emigration consistent with any particular level of net migration and these would lead to different projected population sizes.</p>

	<p pid="c.646W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated December 2008:</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.2/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions asking what the (a) employment and (b) unemployment rate for disabled ethnic minority (i) women, (ii) men and (iii) men and women aged (A) 16 to 24, (B) 25 to 34, (C) 34 to 49 and (D) 50 to state retirement age was in each quarter of the last 10 years. (241443); and what the (a) employment and (b) unemployment rate for disabled (i) women, (ii) men and (iii) men and women aged (A) 16 to 24, (B) 25 to 34, (C) 34 to 49 and (D) 50 to state retirement age was in each quarter of the last 10 years. (241442)</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.2/4">The available information requested is provided in the attached tables. Table 1 contains employment rates for people with disabilities and for people with disabilities who consider their ethnic group to be non-white. Table 2 contains unemployment rates for the same categories. Comparable data by ethnic group is not available prior to April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.2/5">The estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). In the LFS, people with disabilities are defined as those who have a long-term health problem or disability which either substantially limits their day-to-day activities or affects the kind or amount of work they might do, or both. As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty. The estimates for men and women with disabilities from a non-white ethnic group given in this answer should be treated with caution as they are not considered reliable for practical purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.2/6">The figures have been derived from the LFS microdata which are weighted using the official population estimates published in Autumn 2007. Consequently the estimates from Q3 2006 onwards are not entirely consistent with the figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release which are weighted using more up-to-date population estimates.</p>

Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) &quot;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions&quot;.<br/> Includes activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> 2. Finished admission episodes:<br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 3. Primary diagnosis:<br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/>  4. Secondary diagnoses:<br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> 5. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis:<br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.667W.0/16">The figures for prostate cancer relate to national research programmes. They do not include expenditure on prostate cancer research from the research and development allocations made over the period concerned to national health service organisations. That information is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.0/17">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the other main agency through which the Government support biomedical research. The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. It funds a large portfolio of cancer research. Since 2001, the major funders of cancer research in the UK, including the Department and the MRC, have worked in partnership to streamline cancer research in the UK for the benefit of cancer patients. This partnership, the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI), has the role of maintaining strategic oversight of cancer research in the UK, identifying gaps and opportunities, and co-ordinating the funding activities of the partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.0/18">The NHS Prostate Cancer Programme published in September 2000 confirmed a substantial increase in Departmental funding for directly commissioned prostate cancer research. The annual levels of funding subsequently achieved represent a twenty-fold increase since 1999-2000. At the same time, a small number of centres of research excellence were established specifically to address the lack of critical mass in prostate cancer research. The work of these NCRI prostate cancer collaboratives is kept under regular review.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.0/19">The usual practice of the Department's National Institute for Health Research and of the MRC is not to ring-fence funds for expenditure on particular topics: research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. Future levels of expenditure on cancer research will be determined by the success of relevant bids for funding.</p>

	<p pid="c.684W.11/1">No recent assessment has been made. Although there is no officially recognised data on prisoners with severe mental illness, we are aware that there are a number of people in custody suffering from serious mental illness. In 1997, the Office for National Statistics survey indicated that as many as 58 per cent. of male and 75 per cent. of female remand prisoners, and 39 per cent. of male and 62 per cent. of female sentenced prisoners met criteria for a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression. Rates of psychotic illness were also higher than in the general population.</p>
	<p pid="c.684W.11/2">Accurate identification of people needing mental health treatment and care is important at all stages in the care and offender pathway. This is why all prisoners are screened at reception for risks of mental ill health and previous psychiatric treatment. The Offender Assessment System (OASys) helps to ensure that any person judged to be at risk and/or of needing mental health treatment and care can be identified and referred, where appropriate, to the Mental Health In-Reach Teams.</p>

	<p pid="c.685W.5/5">Further progress on the implementation of the recommendations in 2008 includes, the publication of &quot;Connect and Include&mdash;an exploratory study of community development and mental health&quot;, which includes a brief review of literature relating to relevant policy and practice, a survey and interviews including community development practitioners, people with experience of mental health problems, and staff from mental health services.</p>
	<p pid="c.685W.5/6">NSIP have also published the review &quot;From segregation to inclusion: Where are we now?&quot; which review identifies the modernisation progress to date and highlights common issues, approaches to address them and examples of good practice and has revised the &quot;Really Useful Book of Learning and Earning&quot;. 80,000 copies of which have been distributed to care services, Jobcentre Plus, employment programme learning and training providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.685W.5/7">The implementation of the SEU report actions continues through the Community Participation work stream&mdash;which concentrates on developing the local level impact of the social inclusion agenda.

	<p pid="c.686W.5/2">The evaluation of the individual budgets pilots found that mental health service users receiving individual budgets reported significantly higher quality of life than those receiving traditional services. A number of these service users had not found the services available under conventional arrangements to their liking, and saw an individual budget as an opportunity to access more appropriate support. Although not significant statistically, the data also suggest some tendency for psychological well-being to be better for those mental health service users receiving an individual budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.687W.2/2">The work in employment is aimed at improving the recruitment and retention of people with mental health problems. For example, Shift has distributed to public and private sector employers more than 30,000 copies of the Shift Line Managers Resource, giving guidance to managers on handling mental health problems in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.2/3">An independent expert panel, the Shift review panel, has been set up to review guidance on mental health and employment and help guide employers through the wealth of existing advice. A website signposts employers to the most appropriate resource. The panel, hosted by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, includes experts from academia, business and the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.2/4">The work with the media is aimed at improving media coverage of mental health and in particular challenging the link made between severe mental illness and violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.2/5">Guidance on best practice for reporting mental health has been distributed to more than 10,000 journalists. It focuses on covering violence and suicide.</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.2/6">Training on reporting mental illness and suicide is being delivered to postgraduate students at journalism training colleges and the Shift Speakers Bureau, a bank of people willing to talk about their real life experiences of mental illness, has become an essential resource for journalists and a way of ensuring that people's voices are heard.</p>

There is no equivalent provision for meetings of the board of directors. This would be a matter for each trust. Monitor (the statutory name of which is the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts) has however issued a Code of Governance for National Health Service foundation trusts which advises directors to follow a policy of openness and transparency in their proceedings and decision making, unless this conflicts with a need to protect the wider interests of the public or the trust, including commercial-in-confidence matters.</p>

A FCE is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> <i> *Primary diagnosis</i><br/> 2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> E66&mdash;Obesity.<br/> <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis</i><br/> 3. These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a HES record.<br/> <i> **Main procedure</i><br/> 4. The main procedure is the first recorded procedure or intervention in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedure.<br/> <i> Data Quality</i><br/> 5. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> 6. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br/> 7. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br/> <i> Primary Care Trust (PCT)/Strategic Health Authority (SHA) data quality</i><br/> 8. PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.696W.2/1">The Department launched a national tuberculosis (TB) toolkit in June 2007 to support commissioning of TB services best suited to local needs, and recommended that TB services follow the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on tuberculosis. The NICE guidelines make specific recommendations about active screening for TB among homeless people and prisoners and to ensure that people working with these groups have high awareness of the risk and symptoms of TB.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.2/2">London TB services are funded by the Department to run a pilot study using a mobile X-ray unit (MXU) to screen homeless hostels and prisons. Evaluation of the pilot showed the MXU to be an effective case-finding tool among these populations. In addition, since October 2007, the Department has funded Find &amp; Treat, a small multidisciplinary team of tuberculosis nurse specialists, social and outreach workers, to provide practical support and advice to TB services across London for around 300 patients with complex and challenging needs. Support includes: locating and re-engaging patients who have been lost to follow-up care; providing links between prison health and the MXU to NHS tuberculosis services; organising case conferences and directly observed therapy (DOT) partnerships and engaging relevant allied support services in the community to help patients complete treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.2/3">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) runs the National Knowledge Service for TB, which provides information resources including cartoon leaflets for prisoners and material targeted at staff working with the homeless, prisoners and problem drug users. Evaluation shows that these have been well received.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.2/4">The HPA collects data nationally to monitor rates of tuberculosis among the homeless, prisoners and problem drug users, because it recognises the high rates of disease in these populations.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.2/5">The HPA is undertaking a programme of research, in collaboration with University College London and the Royal Free NHS Trust, to provide the evidence base for interventions to control TB among the homeless, prisoners and problem drug users.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.2/6">All these initiatives will inform future policy on tackling TB in these groups.</p>

	<p pid="c.702W.5/1">Romania has come a long way in its treatment of disabled children in the 20 years since the fall of Ceausescu. But problems do remain. EU funds are being used to help accelerate reforms. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister launched an initiative with the Romanian Prime Minister a year ago, sharing best practice on treatment of disabled children in Romania. Our embassy in Bucharest is in regular contact with the Romanian authorities and non governmental organisations and takes every opportunity to help raise public awareness of disability issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.5/2">We have not made an assessment of the treatment of disabled people in the Philippines and have no current plans to do so. The Philippine government has declared its commitment to improve the situation of persons with disabilities and declared 2003-12 the Decade of Persons with Disabilities. Legislation exists to protect the rights of people with disabilities and ensure equal opportunities, including the Accessibility Law and the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons. However, overall levels of poverty and limited government resources mean that the majority of people with disabilities, particularly in rural areas, lack access to programmes and benefits designed to support them.</p>

	<p pid="c.705W.6/1">Modelling undertaken by DECC suggests that, when commercially available, the incentive required to install CCS, either as retrofit or on new power stations, is a carbon price of &euro;40-60/tCO2, although there is significant uncertainty surrounding this range. The commercial availability of CCS is not expected to be achieved before 2020 following successful full-scale demonstration.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.6/2">Retrofitting carbon capture and storage in 2010 or 2015 would mean deploying the technology before it has been demonstrated at full-scale, and therefore the cost and performance of the technology will be uncertain. Moreover, energy companies are likely to require a significant risk premium for investing in unproven technology.</p>

	<p pid="c.709W.11/1">Department officials are aware of a number of proposals such as the Mid Atlantic Renewable Energy Initiative (MARE), to use solar and other renewable energy sources, coupled with high voltage DC power networks, to supply renewable electricity. Many of these projects are at a very early stage of development, and their likely scale and potential to contribute to reductions in carbon dioxide emissions cannot yet be reliably determined.</p>
	<p pid="c.709W.11/2">The UK supports Article 5(9) of the draft EU renewable energy directive, which allows renewable energy generated by new installations outside the EU to count towards the EU renewable energy targets if it is consumed within the EU. We also accept that the energy directive should incentivise deployment of renewable technologies outside the EU, as well as inside. Projects such as MARE may be a way of doing this, although issues such as the high cost of developing offshore platforms and long distance sub-sea connections would need to be addressed.</p>

HMG is currently running a competition to appoint a management contractor to manage the NNL and we expect that process to be completed next spring. Until then the NNL is operating very much as Nexia Solutions did and its results are included in the consolidated accounts of BNFL plc. The NNL is a commercial entity and as such derives revenues from its customers for contracted work. In 2006-07, Nexia Solutions (now the NNL) made an operating profit of &pound;7 million before exceptional items on a turnover of &pound;77 million. Once appointed, the managing contractor is expected to deliver growth and efficiencies, obtaining its fee from turnover with no requirement for separate funding from Government.</p>

Following the report by the CC on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-29">29 June 2006</phrase> on this market the CC made the first of two orders to remedy detrimental effects on customers so far as they have resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the adverse effects on competition specified in the report. From <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-13">13 April 2009</phrase>, the first order will apply to all suppliers of bulk LPG for domestic use. A second order, which will apply to all suppliers of bulk LPG for domestic use on metered estates, is currently the subject of consultation and is expected to be published in early 2009.

The numbers have been increasing as the network companies seek to improve the resilience of their system. The applications are predominantly for upgrading, minor diversions or rationalisations/re-routing of existing lower voltage lines rather than for completely new high voltage lines. Experience is that the vast majority of these applications would have been consented, with only a few refused or withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid="c.716W.11/1">The Home Office, Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Ministry of Justice are all jointly committed to tackling the problem of youth crime, and July's Youth Crime Action Plan demonstrates this tri-lateral approach to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.716W.11/2">It sets out a triple track approach of enforcement and punishment where behaviour is unacceptable, non-negotiable support and challenge where it is most needed, and better and earlier prevention.</p>
	<p pid="c.716W.11/3">Clearly the three Departments set out above have different responsibilities within the youth crime agenda and lead on different strands of the work, however all are jointly signed up to this approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.716W.11/4">Generally, the Home Office, with overall responsibility for reducing crime, leads on enforcement and policing strands of work, the Ministry of Justice on the youth justice system, custody and resettlement, and the Department for Children, Schools and Families on early intervention and prevention. However these responsibilities are not absolute and very effective partnership working has been developed to ensure focus on delivery and to reduce any negative effects of possible silo working.</p>
	<p pid="c.716W.11/5">A very significant contribution to the youth crime agenda is also made by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform which is leading on issues of youth victimisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.717W.2/1">The Home Office has sponsored the following youth crime prevention programmes in the last five years:</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/2">Youth Inclusion Programmes (YIPs), established in 2000, are tailor-made programmes for eight to 17-year-olds, who are identified as being at high risk of involvement in offending or antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/3">YIPs are also open to other young people in the local area. The programme operates in 110 of the most deprived/high crime estates in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/4">YIPs aim to reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour in neighbourhoods where they work. Young people on the YIP are identified through a number of different agencies including youth offending teams (YOTs), police, social services, local education authorities or schools, and other local agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/5">The programme gives young people somewhere safe to go where they can learn new skills, take part in activities with others and get help with their education and careers guidance. Positive role models&mdash;the workers and volunteer mentors&mdash;help to change young people's attitudes to education and crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/6">Each project has the following aims:</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/7" class="indent">to engage with a high proportion of the target group of young people (as identified by the agencies above), especially those members deemed most at risk;</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/8" class="indent">to address the risks identified by assessment;</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/9" class="indent">to increase access to mainstream and specialist services, especially in relation to education, training and employment, for the young people involved;</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/10" class="indent">to prevent young people in the programme from entering the Criminal Justice System, and to reduce offending of young people already in the system;</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/11" class="indent">to intervene, not just on an individual level, but with communities and families (especially the parents of the core group).</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/12">Each YIP receives an annual grant from the YJB through its YOT and is required to find matched funding from local agencies to add to this. In many areas, programmes also obtain resources from other organisations (such as new deal for communities), which share the aim of supporting communities in relation to crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/13">There are now 120 YIPs across England and Wales, based in some of the most deprived and high-crime areas. YIPs work with eight to 17-year-olds carefully targeted according to their risk of involvement in offending or antisocial behaviour. This targeting is based on many factors, such as exclusion from school, and involves many different agencies working together including youth offending teams (YOTs), police, schools and social services.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/14">A total of 25,287 young people were engaged by phase two of YIP. This includes 82 per cent. of the 'Core 50'&mdash;the 50 young people in each neighbourhood deemed most to be at risk of crime. The purpose of phase two of YIP is to 'reduce youth crime within the neighbourhood'.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/15">The YJB announced in September that it had exceeded its 5 per cent. target to reduce the number of first-time entrants to the youth justice system; 10.2 per cent. fewer young people have become involved with crime since 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/16">Youth Inclusion and Support Panels (YISPs) aim to prevent antisocial behaviour and offending by eight to 13-year-olds who are considered to be at high risk of offending.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/17">They have been designed to help the YJB meet its target of putting in place, in each YOT in England and Wales, programmes that will identify and reduce the likelihood of young people committing offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/18">Panels are made up of a number of representatives of different agencies (e.g. police, schools, health and social services). The main emphasis of a panel's work is to ensure that children and their families, at the earliest possible opportunity, can access mainstream public services.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/19">Following a successful pilot scheme that began in April 2003, the YJB and the Children's Fund now fund 122 YISPs. Of these, 13 pilot areas have received additional support to develop procedures and innovative practice, which will then provide a framework of best practice for all other YISPs.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/20">The Positive Futures programme is a national sports based social inclusion programme which is funded by the Home Office in partnership with the Football Foundation. The programme aims to have a positive influence on young people's lives through widening their horizons and providing access to new opportunities by using sport, art and leisure activities as a catalyst to encourage project participation and steering young people towards education, training and employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/21">The programme helps the Home Office deliver its ambitions around reducing drug use and drug harms, but also helps us achieve other aims relating to crime, antisocial behaviour and guns, gangs and knives. The programme achieves these outcomes by tackling risk factors such as vulnerability and social exclusion as well as by doing more direct work, for example, by putting young people in touch with drugs workers</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/22">The programme has been in operation since 2001 and the number of projects has grown to over 120 projects. The projects operate in each of the 30 areas worst affected by drug-related crime in the country. They are delivered locally by a range of agencies including local authorities, charities, sports clubs and crime reduction agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/23">Between <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September 2007</phrase> over 48,000 young people attended projects across the country, and nearly 1.1 million contact hours were invested with young people. 76 per cent. of those engaged in the programme had been in contact for periods in excess of 12 weeks.</p>

Home Office labelled expenditure for the current financial year is &pound;160.39 million.

	<p pid="c.726W.2/3">The latest estimate is that at any one time in 2003 there were up to 4,000 women in the UK who were possibly victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. There is no estimate available at this time on the numbers of possible victims of trafficking for the purpose of forced labour.</p>

These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the School Census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.743W.5/1">Assessing the economic impact of EMA is not simple but our analysis of the education maintenance allowance shows that the expected economic benefits far outweigh the costs. For the first cohort of recipients in the national rollout in 2004-05, evaluation evidence suggests that an extra 18,000 more 16-year-olds participated in full-time education than would have done so without EMA and an extra 16,000 participated at age 17. This is estimated to have generated an additional 10,100 Level 2 and 11,900 Level 3 qualifications being gained by the age of 18. Based on these benefits, our best estimate of the net benefit to the economy from supporting this cohort is around &pound;880 million over the lifetime of these individuals. Given the range of assumptions that are necessary in carrying out such as assessment, our estimate should be seen as indicative.</p>

	<p pid="c.743W.8/1">The education maintenance allowance (EMA) has had the biggest impact on participation of any policy initiative in over a decade. From 2003-04 to 2004-05 the national participation rate for 16-year-olds in full-time education increased by 3.7 percentage points exceeding expectations. EMA was one of the key policies aimed at increasing participation and has been a major contributor to this increase. One of the factors that has contributed to the success of EMA has been its simplicity. There are a range of alternatives to using gross income to assess eligibility for EMA, including using net income. All of these have various advantages and disadvantages. We currently believe that out of the available options for assessing eligibility for EMA, the simplicity of using gross income is preferable.</p>

	<p pid="c.744W.2/1">The new arrangements are designed to more closely follow learner choice and ensure that the outcomes for young people are delivered in a more integrated manner with local authorities acting as the strategic commissioners for children's services for children aged 0 to 19. They will need to work collaboratively with other local authorities, schools and colleges to shape the offer to young people across the country and to deliver these commissioning decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.2/2">As now, there will be a dialogue between commissioners and those to be commissioned about what can be delivered for young people, informed by the previous year's performance.

Although the LSC and local partners have identified a need for some additional FE provision in Sittingbourne, there is insufficient demand for a new FE college.</p>
	<p pid="c.745W.8/3">Canterbury College, together with Swale borough council, is investigating whether there is scope for the college to have an additional presence in the area as part of the town's regeneration plans. If the college concludes this to be appropriate, it will consult locally before putting a case to the LSC for consideration. In the event of a proposal for an existing college to locate a new site in Sittingbourne, the Secretary of State has no role in the decision.</p>

	<p pid="c.751W.5/1">In 1998 the Government published Desirable Learning Outcomes that included goals for learning (including on early literacy, numeracy and the development of personal and social skills) for children by the time they entered compulsory education. In 2000, the Qualification and Curriculum Authority published Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage, which contains six areas of learning, 69 Early Learning Goals, and stepping stones to achieve them for children aged three to five year. For younger children Birth to three matters was published in 2002. It focuses on child development, and includes four themes: a Strong Child, a Skilful Communicator, a Competent Learner and a Healthy Child.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.5/2">In September this year the Government published the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage, which brought together the previous early learning frameworks and sets quality standards for learning (including cognitive development) and care for all settings caring for children aged birth to five.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.5/3">In the north east the National Strategies has provided support to local authorities and developed a set of materials to help practitioners to support children's social development through &quot;Social and Emotional Aspects of Development&quot; (SEAD) programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.5/4">The Government have also introduced the &quot;Every Child a Talker (ECAT)&quot; programme&mdash;which will give practitioners easier access to training and materials so that they are better equipped to identify and support children's early language needs and development. In addition we have introduced the &quot;Communication, Language and Literacy Development&quot; (CLLD) programme which aims to support practitioners with children's early reading, development of speaking and listening skills and to embed phonic work within a broad and rich language curriculum. The NE region has eight out of 12 local authorities in the first wave of the ECAT programme and 12 are in the CLLD programme.</p>

Likewise, it details the financial resources that the Department expects to make available this year to schools or LAs (in part or in full) to support partnership working, or the expected cost of contracts the Department will make available (in part or in full) to support schools or LAs to work in partnership.</p>

Schools partnerships are voluntary, typically comprising 6-10 secondary schools, although primary and middle schools can join.
