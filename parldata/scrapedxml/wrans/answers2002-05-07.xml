The total cash outturn for this objective is shown in the Appropriation Accounts 2000&ndash;01 (HC 335-IX), and the resource outturn in the Consolidated Resource Accounts 2000&ndash;01 (HC503). Further breakdowns will shortly be published in the Department's Expenditure Plans Report for 2002&ndash;03, and also in the Treasury's Supplementary Budgetary Information (SBI) tables. I regret that a breakdown between manufacturing and service sectors is not available. However, a good proportion of this money, though not all, will have benefited manufacturing directly or indirectly.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.2/1">My hon. Friend the Minister with responsbility for energy and construction announced his decision to roll out the scheme across the country over a three to four year period, in his answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/791" name="Ben Chapman">the question from the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-03-12.891W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 891W</phrase>. A Quality Mark Shadow Ownership Group has since been set up and, at its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-19">19 April</phrase>, it began developing a comprehensive implementation strategy and detailed business plan. The group is finalising decisions about the next stages of the roll out.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/2">Following recommendations in the pilot review, the scheme is developing recruitment mechanisms to accelerate achievement of a critical mass of members. So far 175 builders have been awarded the Quality Mark and 247 are in the assessment pipeline, with more firms expected to apply shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/3">The DTI is also working with local authorities, financial services groups, consumer groups and others to promote the scheme to tradesmen and encourage their participation.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/4">The national launch of the Quality Mark at the Ideal Home Show produced extensive television and radio coverage and articles in regional newspapers. The scheme is already being marketed successfully to consumers in Birmingham and Somerset through a variety of media, including Yellow Pages and Thomsons directories, household leaflet distribution with advertising and editorial coverage in a number of local papers and radio stations. Further targeted marketing will follow in new areas once sufficient numbers of builders and tradesmen are registered, to satisfy consumer demand.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/5">The DTI is working with a number of trade bodies to fast-track members into the Quality Mark scheme through use of trade association vetting procedures adapted as necessary. The DTI is also examining the scope for developing closer links between the Quality Mark and Constructionline, looking for some form of passporting system between the two schemes that might allow fee reductions and reduce duplication of assessments. However, the schemes do have different client targets and operating systems and a number of issues need to be considered carefully. In addition, the DTI has been liaising closely with DTLR on self-certification schemes and extension of non-notification of building work under amendments to Part L of the Building Regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".8W.8/2">The Attorney receives requests to refer a sentence to the Court of Appeal on the grounds of undue lenience from two sources.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/3">The first source is the prosecuting authority (such as the Crown Prosecution Service, the Serious Fraud Office etc.), which conducted the case against the offender. The written request is accompanied by various documents. These invariably include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/4" class="indent">1. Relevant case papers, including material obtained for the purpose of the sentence, such as pre-sentence reports, the offender's antecedents, if any, etc.;</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/5" class="indent">2. A summary of the prosecution's case, the defence mitigation and the learned Judge's sentencing remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/6" class="indent">3. Relevant authorities, that is decisions in previous cases.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/7" class="indent">4. Advice from Treasury Counsel, not involved in the prosecution of the case.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/8">The Attorney gives due consideration to the information and takes into account Counsel's advice. He is however not bound to follow the advice Counsel offers.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/9">The Attorney also receives requests for referral to the Court of Appeal from members of the public and also Members of this House. In such circumstances the relevant prosecutorial authority is approached and is required to provide the above stated documents.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.0/2">From the research that has been possible in the time available, I am aware of three cases in which a claim of sovereign immunity has been made or intimated in Northern Ireland conflict-related cases.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.0/3">The cases are:</p>
	<p pid=".10W.0/4" class="indent">ILRM 275, and the Court explains in detail the basis of sovereign immunity upon which it upheld the order striking out the claim.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.0/5" class="indent">Bridget McGovern <i>v</i>. Ministry of Defence (in the early 1990s, unreported), in which the claimant claimed in the Republic in respect of damage to her property caused by an explosion at the border. Her claim was struck out by the Irish Court on grounds of sovereign immunity. Ms McGovern subsequently issued proceedings in the Courts of Northern Ireland and recovered damage for her loss.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.0/6" class="indent">Adams <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and George Mitchell (1998 unreported). Mr. Gerry Adams sought judicial review in the Court of the Republic in respect of the decision of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to exclude Sinn Fein at that stage from the peace negotiations. A claim for sovereign immunity was to be made but the claim was not pursued to a substantive hearing, probably because the negotiations returned to Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.0/7">Sovereign immunity is an elementary principle of international law which states that in general an independent sovereign state may not be sued in the courts of a foreign state against its will and without its consent. One factor of relevance is which is the most convenient forum for the claim to be heard, and it is noteworthy from the McGovern case that Ms McGovern was able successfully to pursue her claim in the Courts of Northern Ireland.</p>

We hope that, by autumn, Cote d'lvoire will be added to the list of countries benefiting from the Initiative. In 2003, three countries (Comoros, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo) may qualify for HIPC relief. The prospects for the remaining eight unsustainable countries are not good. Six&mdash;Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia and Sudan&mdash;are still affected by conflict; Togo has governance problems; and Lao PDR is undecided as to whether to opt for HIPC relief.

	<p pid=".15W.5/1">Latest forecasts from the World Bank suggest that globally, meeting the 2015 target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty is attainable. There has been progress. During the 1990s, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day in the developing world fell from 29 per cent. in 1990, to 23 per cent. in 1999. This was mainly due to the substantial progress made during the 1990s in east Asia, and in particular China.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.5/2">In the developing world, progress has also been made during the 1990s against almost all the other 2015 Millennium Development targets. The proportion of children completing a full course of primary school increased from 68 per cent. to 73 per cent.; the under-five mortality rate decreased from 88 to 84 deaths per 1,000 births; and the proportion of people with access to an improved water source increased from 73 per cent. to 79 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.5/3">However, to meet all of the 2015 targets progress must be improved. The sub-Saharan African region presents the biggest challenge to meeting the 2015 targets. We need an enormous effort internationally to accelerate progress in Africa. My Department is dedicated to do all in its power to accelerate progress towards the targets.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.5/4">A detailed description of progress towards all the 2015 targets is contained in a recent World bank publication: World Development Indicators 2002, which can be found at the following website: <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/ata/wdi2002/worldview.pdf">http://www.worldbank.org/ata/ wdi2002/worldview.pdf</a>.</p>

The team reported on these discussions to the St. Helena Government at the beginning of April. Further discussions on the issue of air access will take place over the coming months.</p>

	<p pid=".16W.5/1">My Department has been working closely with HM Treasury, Inland Revenue and other Departments on a range of measures to improve access to medicines for the developing world, including tax relief on donations of medical supplies.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/2">The tax measure is intended to be supportive of health strategies in developing countries. The Inland Revenue will be issuing guidance to its tax inspectors on interpreting what constitutes a donation for &quot;humanitarian purposes&quot;. The Inland Revenue guidance will include appropriate reference to elements of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/3">The WHO guidelines clearly set out that drug donations should: constitute a sustainable contribution to government health strategies in developing countries; be based on need and relevant to the disease pattern of recipient countries; have at least one year remaining shelf life; be of a quality which complies with the standards of donor and recipient countries; and only provided after consultation and at the request of the recipient.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.0/1">The local government White Paper&mdash;&quot;Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot;&mdash;set out our intention to pool a proportion of housing capital receipts arising in debt free authorities to finance new housing investment in areas where it is most needed. The change will put the treatment of housing capital receipts in debt free authorities on an equal footing with their treatment in other authorities. It also removes a real disincentive to authorities to take up the new borrowing freedoms planned as part of the simplification of the local authority capital finance system described in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.0/2">The change will be introduced alongside the wider changes to the local authority capital finance system which require primary legislation; the timing of this is still to be decided. The detailed arrangements for pooling, including the proportion of receipts to be pooled, and the allocation of resources from the pool are currently being considered. The new arrangements will not apply to receipts already realised. We will be consulting on detailed proposals and will report on the outcome of the consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.0/3">The number of authorities that will be affected by the change will depend on what happens to debt levels and on housing stock transfers between now and the introduction of the pooling arrangement. A list of the authorities that were debt free at <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> was given in reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1192" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon.

Housing capital receipts are mainly generated from the sale of dwellings and around 30 of these authorities own council housing. The amount of additional resources for allocation from the pool to fund new housing investment will depend on the proportion of receipts to be pooled and future levels or receipts for debt free authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".23W.0/2">Although it was considered that the publication of the planning Green Paper would raise uncertainties in respect of local authorities preparing plans, this report gives a clear indication that local authorities are continuing with development plan work. We have yet to achieve 100 per cent. national coverage and there are still 13 per cent. of LPAs who have not produced an adopted development plan. The continuing delays in adopting local plans and, subsequently, altering or replacing those plans adds weight to the recommendations in the planning Green Paper on the need for reform of the planning system to introduce faster and more flexible arrangements.</p>

Among them the proposals to abolish structure plans, local plans and unitary development plans and replace them with the new Local Development Framework, and introducing statutory Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) to replace Regional Planning Guidance. Powers would need to be introduced for major infrastructure projects to be referred to Parliament and any changes to the current system of planning obligations.

In particular those development control measures designed to speed up and made the process more transparent such as the proposals to enable electronic submission of planning applications and appeals, and the requirement on local authorities to make copies of plans and planning applications publicly available at low or no cost. A number of the proposals will requires amendments to be made to the General Development Procedure Order.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.8/1">The Department is very concerned about the number of public transport workers who are assaulted at work. The Department is raising awareness and addressing the issue through research programmes and good practice guidance for public transport operators.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.8/2">Work-related violence is a health and safety issue, and employers have a legal duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 to protect their staff from the risk of violence in the course of their work. The specific assistance given to public transport workers who are assaulted at work is a matter for the individual transport operator. For example, London Underground staff receive support from their managers in the form of sympathetic treatment, home visits, hospital visits (if applicable), gradual reintroduction to the work place (including move of location if appropriate), assistance in legal proceedings (support at court) and assistance with CICA claims. They may also receive support from in-house Employee Assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.0/1">The Railway Safety Regulations 1999 require automatic train protection (ATP), where reasonably practical, or otherwise the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), to be fitted on all trains and throughout the network by the end of 2003. The rail industry estimates that TPWS should mitigate over 80 per cent. of ATP-preventable risk. Mandatory common technical specifications (TSIs) developed under the European rail interoperability directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC will mean that a European form of ATP, known as the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), should be fitted to all high speed and many conventional rail lines in Great Britain when they are constructed, upgraded or (conventional lines only) renewed.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.0/2">The public inquiry report into train protection systems, chaired by Professor Uff and Lord Cullen, recommended that ERTMS be adopted as the standard form of train protection in this country. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-25">25 April</phrase> the rail industry published a report setting out what it considered a feasible timetable for fitting ERTMS to Britain's railways. I have asked the Health and Safety Commission, as the independent rail safety regulator, to review the industry report. They will want to have a constructive debate on all the issues raised including costs and timing before they report back to me with formal recommendations. I look forward to receiving the Health and Safety Commission's recommendations and then deciding the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.0/3">The report from the Commission for Integrated Transport argued that level 1 of ERTMS would reduce capacity on high speed, high capacity lines, causing travellers to switch to roads, with a much worse safety record than rail, leading to more fatalities overall. The industry report on ERTMS makes a similar point. I would expect the HSC to consider these points when reviewing the report and making their recommendations.</p>

However, in 2001 foreign-born people accounted for around 8 per cent. of total UK employment, and the average gross weekly pay of foreign-born employees was about 16 per cent. above the average for all employees. On this basis, and assuming that relative wage rates proxy relative labour productivity, it can be estimated that the foreign-born population accounted for around 10 per cent. of UK GDP in 2001.</p>

All pensioners aged 75 or over have also been entitled to a free TV licence since November 2000&mdash;including around 6,400 in Stalybridge and Hyde. 3,500 pensioners are also benefiting from the minimum income guarantee being increased in line with earnings for the rest of this Parliament. 15,700 pensioners in Stalybridge are benefiting from &pound;200 a year winter fuel payments for the rest of this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".40W.9/2">Financial Close, originally planned for December 2000, is now planned for late 2004. This is due to a number of issues, including planning considerations and problems associated with necessary diversions of footpaths. Consequently the completion of construction work has also been delayed from 1st quarter 2004 to Autumn 2008. The financial impact of this delay is under review but I have every reasonable expectation that the project will remain within budget.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.9/3">Essential work in many areas of the Project Agreement is nearly complete. We are now in the process of negotiating a risk and cost sharing plan to take the project forward, to ensure that these new timescales are not delayed further. Part of these negotiations will review the current proposed construction programme to ascertain if it is possible to reconfigure the programme to minimise the impact of delay on the provision of Single Living Accommodation.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.3/1">Gurkhas are recruited into the Army in accordance with the 1947 Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA) between the Governments of India, Nepal and the UK. This is the basic instrument that enables both the UK and India to raise and maintain formed Gurkha Regiments and aims to ensure that both Armies are able to recruit on an equal basis. As a result Gurkhas Terms and Conditions of Service, including basic pay and pensions, remain linked to those of the Indian Army. We have no plans to review these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/2">There have, however, been significant enhancements to Gurkha conditions of service in recent years. Gurkhas are now paid a cost of living allowance known as Universal Addition for service in all theatres outside Nepal. This allowance is uplifted annually to ensure that the combination of Gurkha basic pay at Indian Army rates and Universal Addition brings their remuneration broadly into line with the net pay of comparable British Service personnel. These arrangements have been in place since 1997. The approximate cost to the Ministry of Defence of the pensions paid to former Gurkha soldiers in each of the last five financial years is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/3" class="indent">1997&ndash;98: &pound;5.3 million</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/4" class="indent">1998&ndash;99: &pound;6 million</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/5" class="indent">1999&ndash;2000: &pound;8.2 million</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/6" class="indent">2000&ndash;01: &pound;23.9 million</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/7" class="indent">2001&ndash;02: &pound;26 million (includes forecasted expenditure).</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/8">The significant increase in expenditure for the financial year 2000&ndash;01 reflects the outcome of a comprehensive examination of Gurkha pensions conducted by the Ministry of Defence at that time. This led to all Gurkha pensions being at least doubled and they now compare favourably to professional salaries in Nepal, where all Gurkhas are discharged. The vast majority of Gurkha pensioners, who continue to be entitled to an immediate pension after only 15 year's service, welcomed the outcome of the examination. British service personnel discharged at this point of service would receive no pension until they reached the age of 60. We remain of the view that the arguments for an immediate pension on discharge in Nepal are compelling.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.3/9">Because of the different terms of service and career structures that apply, it is very difficult to make the direct comparisons that are sought. The cost of transposing British service personnel pay and conditions of service to Gurkhas cannot be computed accurately, and not without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid=".46W.7/1">The Government has published today the draft Communications Bill and an accompanying policy document on a number of matters, including Gaelic broadcasting. We plan to secure improvements in the current delivery of service in various ways. We propose to build on the strengths of the Gaelic Broadcasting Committee by extending its representative base and by giving it a new statutory power to plan strategically for development of the service. The policy document indicates also our intention that I will assume a power of approval for appointments to the new committee as part of improved accountability procedures. We are considering within the Spending Review the scope for some additional investment to support these and other changes. Urgent talks convened by my Department will now begin on the detail of the proposed committee role and on the possibility of creating a more unified structure in the oversight and transmission of Gaelic programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".46W.7/2">The Milne Committee recommendations have helped to focus on the need for overhaul of the current structures but we do not agree that the scale of change and extra resourcing they proposed is feasible or justified. I believe our policy intentions represent a constructive response to meeting some of the Gaelic speaking community's aspirations for a better co-ordinated service. We look forward to working with the community's representatives and with the broadcasting interests to make it happen.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.3/2">Because of the difficulties of collecting sheep brain material that is in a suitable condition for strain typing by conventional bioassay in mice, and because of the length of time it takes to get the results from such studies, work is in hand to develop and evaluate molecular methods of distinguishing BSE from scrapie. SEAC has recently endorsed a programme of work at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency which includes a statistical analysis of the robustness of molecular approaches, retrospective testing of 1,400 sheep brains which were positive for a TSE in the VLA archive and prospective sampling of the brains from all clinically reported suspects which prove to be positive for a TSE.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.0/1">The Department suffered severe disruption last year due to allocating top priority to defeating the Foot and Mouth epidemic. Furthermore the sheer volume of correspondence following the creation of DEFRA had a major impact on the Department's performance, resulting in a large backlog of letters. Mechanisms are now in place to prevent any further recurrence of the problems experienced, and a range of work is in hand to tighten both quality and the speed of our response to Member's letters. The events of last year were exceptional, and their impact is still being felt across a range of Departmental activity.</p>

	<p pid=".50W.6/2">TB in cattle is one of the most difficult animal health problems we face and the increase in its incidence is continuing to give considerable concern. The Government have, with advice from the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG), put in place a wide-ranging research programme to tackle the disease. An important element of the programme is vaccine research on which the Government are spending &pound;1.4 million annually. Although the sequencing of the &quot;M. bovis&quot; genome announced recently is an important step forward, the ISG has cautioned that it is likely to be 10 years or so before a successful vaccine is found.</p>

	<p pid=".51W.2/2">The Government have, with advice from the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG), put in place a wide-ranging research programme into bovine TB. The programme is described in the ISG's reports which are available on DEFRA's website at <a href="http://defraweb/animal/tb/">http://defraweb/ animal/tb/</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.2/3">An important part of the research programme is the badger field trial which recommenced from <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-01">1 May 2002</phrase>. The trial is designed to evaluate, once and for all, the extent to which badgers contribute to cattle TB and the effects of badger culling on the incidence of the disease. It will provide data on the prevalence of TB in badgers and the spatial distribution of infected badgers and social groups, its relationship to population density, social group size and structure, geographical and physical environmental factors and, most importantly, the spatial relationship between TB in cattle and badgers.</p>

	<p pid=".51W.5/2">The information requested is not available except at undue cost.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.5/3">Routine bovine TB test frequencies for cattle herds are set at the parish level. Parishes with historically higher numbers of confirmed incidents of bovine TB are placed on annual or biennial test regimes. Parishes with low or no disclosed incidents of bovine TB have a test frequency set at once every three or four years. Dairy herds in England and Wales retailing raw milk or supplying raw milk for the manufacture of unpasteurised dairy products are subjected to annual TB testing regardless of the default testing interval for the parish in which they are located.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.5/4">In addition herds disclosed as having incidents of bovine TB undergo more frequent testing to check that infection has been cleared so that movement restrictions can be lifted. Further tests are carried out at 6 and 12 months after the removal of movement restrictions to check for recrudescence. If no further TB incidents are reported during this period, the herds return to the default frequency of testing set for the parish.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.5/5">TB testing was heavily disrupted during the foot and mouth disease outbreak and a significant backlog of overdue tests has built up, equivalent to a quarter of all GB herds. This is being tackled by the state veterinary service.</p>

	<p pid=".53W.5/2">The exemption from the climate change levy for fuel used in dual-use purposes has been part of the design of the levy since it was launched in April 2001. Consequently this exemption has been taken into account in all estimates made of carbon savings from the levy.</p>
	<p pid=".53W.5/3">The proposal to extend relief to certain processes which compete with those benefiting from the dual-use or non-fuel use exemptions is not expected to have a significant effect on carbon savings. Most of the processes eligible for this further relief are covered by a negotiated agreement with DEFRA, under which the operators have agreed to energy efficiency targets. However, the exemption will give a further incentive to recycling processes which are more environmentally friendly than the alternative primary production processes.</p>

	<p pid=".53W.8/2">As set out in table 7.2 of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, the reduced rate of VAT on the installation of energy-saving materials is expected to save around 0.1 million tonnes carbon by 2010. The extension of the reduced rate in Budget 2002 will lead to further small savings of carbon. The reduced rate will enable further installations of the qualifying measures to be made under grant-funded programmes in homes of the less well-off. By improving energy efficiency, the measures will enable householders to improve comfort levels for the same expenditure on energy as well as to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.2/1">Methane vented from working coal mines is included in the UK National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. For 2000, methane emissions from working coal mines was 5.04 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, less than one per cent. of the UK's total Greenhouse Gas Emissions. At current atmospheric levels methane does not have adverse air quality impacts.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/2">Deliberate drilling of undisturbed seams, fracturing the coal and pumping can be used to produce methane. Using this gas would be similar to using natural gas, though not absolutely identical because the composition differs slightly. The emissions consequences of natural gas burning are well-understood.</p>

	<p pid=".68W.2/14">The commission's systems do not record expenditure according to the stage a case has reached, so figures cannot be provided for expenditure on initial applications or fighting appeals. Neither can figures be split between asylum immigration work and non-asylum immigration work. However, it is known that asylum currently accounts for over 90 per cent. of expenditure in the immigration and asylum category.</p>
	<p pid=".68W.2/15">Since August 2000, the commission has recorded the number of matters started in asylum immigration as distinct from non-asylum immigration. In the 18 month period from August 2000 to January 2002 132,800 asylum matters were started. Each matter is an act of assistance not a client assisted so the figure is not necessarily reflective of the number of individuals involved.</p>

The payment model chosen for the online sensus in Scotland imposes an initial &pound;6 charge for access to the site and units of &pound;6 thereafter. The 1901 Census for England and Wales has an entirely free index search facility, which can be used without any restriction; the minimum fee for access to transcriptions or record images is &pound;5, in return for which the user can obtain between six and ten copies. The PRO undertook extensive consultations with users who indicated that, out of a range of possible payment models, their preference was for a payment system based on the delivery of record images.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.11/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/3">Schedule 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 is a list of cruelty, violent and sexual offences against children. This list has been used by various agencies as a way of identifying those committing these offences as posing a risk to children, although not all necessarily do so or do so currently. Some of those guilty of offences on the list, for example, may have committed the offence many years previously, may themselves have been children at the time and the offence may have, for example, involved a fight with another child of a similar age. Others convicted of offences on the list may have been engaged in mutually agreed sexual activity, albeit with someone under the age of legal consent, to whom they were relatively close in age. There are no specified requirements flowing from commission of an offence on Schedule 1 of this Act that prohibit offenders from having unsupervised contact with children. There are, however, other more recent means of achieving this and of protecting children from the risk that violent and sexual offenders pose.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/4">Those offenders sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment are released subject to a licence which can include, in relevant cases, a requirement not to have unsupervised contact with children. Breach of these conditions can result in a return to prison. Moreover, a similar prohibition can be included in a Sex Offender Order, for which the police can apply to magistrates' court with respect to a convicted sex offender whose current behaviour indicates they pose a risk of serious harm. Breaching the terms of the order may result in a maximum sentence of up to five years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/5">Part 2 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 provides for certain of those convicted of offences against children to be disqualified from seeking or taking employment, whether paid or unpaid, with children in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/6">The Criminal Justice and Court Services Act also placed a statutory duty jointly on the policy and probation services to put arrangements in place for assessing and managing the risk posed by sexual and violent offenders. These arrangements enable a risk assessment to be undertaken and plans to be devised for managing the risk that such offenders pose.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/7">Despite these measures, it nonetheless remains important for parents to be vigilant about those to whom they entrust the care of their children, particularly when they are not present to ensure their safety.</p>

	<p pid=".76W.3/1">The most recent figures available date from 1994&ndash;95 (except those for Italy where they are from 1993&ndash;94). They do not take account of the fact that since 1997 this Department has taken a number of measures to improve the income of pensioners, particularly the poorest of this group. Over 2 million pensioners benefit from the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), currently &pound;98.15 for a single pensioner and over 10 million pensioners benefited from the above inflation increases in basic Retirement Pension. Over 11 million Winter Fuel Payments, at a cost of around &pound;1.7 billion, were sent out last winter.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.3/2">Since 1997 single pensioners in receipt of MIG, Winter Fuel Payments and free TV licences are at least &pound;18.00 a week better off and pensioner couples have gained by more than &pound;27.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.3/3">A further step is the Government's intention to introduce Pension Credit in October 2003. Around half of all pensioner households will be eligible for the Pension Credit&mdash;5.1 million individual pensioners or 3.9 million pensioner households stand to gain (excludes those living in residential care and nursing homes). On average, they will gain &pound;400 a year, with some getting up to &pound;1,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.3/4">It will get more money into pensioner's pockets and ensure that no single pensioner need live on less than &pound;100 a week (&pound;154 a week for couples).</p>

	<p pid=".77W.6/1">Annual upratings have never been generally paid abroad. Exceptions apply under the EC's Social Security Regulations, which apply to pensioners who have a UK pension living in the European Economic Area, and under reciprocal social security agreements with other countries, which allow for increases to be paid there. The countries with which the UK has reciprocal agreements which allow pension upratings to be paid are: Barbados, Bermuda, the Channel Islands, Cyprus, Israel, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, the Philippines, Switzerland, Turkey, the USA and the now separate republics of the former Federal Peoples Republic of Yugoslavia (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia Montenegro, Bosnia Herzegovina), Croatia, Slovenia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).

	<p pid=".77W.6/2">To bring everyone up to the current rate they would receive if they had remained in the UK, but not to pay arrears, would cost around &pound;400 million in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.6/3">Uprating is paid in some countries because the Government are either legally required to do so or have previously entered into reciprocal agreements to do so. However, the underlying intention of uprating is that it is meant to cover increases in the cost of living in this country.</p>

	<p pid=".81W.5/1">The benefit system has undergone radical changes in the last 30 years. For this reason, it is not possible to compare like with like. From 1972 until 1988, supplementary benefit was in payment. The assessment of entitlement for supplementary benefit was complex, and the introduction of income support addressed and simplified this assessment. Income support continues to be paid through the minimum income guarantee. There were considerable differences between the benefits, for example, on some occasions, supplementary benefit was uprated twice a year. The figures quoted are based on benefit years (April to March) rather than calendar years&mdash;rates may be different to published rates as they represent an average over the benefit year, eg in 2002 MIG was uprated on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-09">9 April</phrase> therefore we have assumed there were eight days when MIG was still at the old rate.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.5/2">For the purposes of this question, all figures quoted are in nominal terms for the appropriate year, eg 1972 rates are quoted in 1972 price terms and reflect the basic entitlement of a single pensioner aged 65 to 75.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.6/1">The main changes to requirements on head teachers made during 2001&ndash;02 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".83W.6/2">During 2001&ndash;02, the right to mainstream education for children with special educational needs was strengthened. Where particular mainstream schools do not wish to educate children with statements of SEN, they will have to show that the education of such children is incompatible with the provision of efficient education for other children, and that there are no reasonable steps they can take to prevent this incompatibility. The revised SEN Code of Practice has been designed to decrease bureaucracy while improving the SEN framework. The Code includes guidance on the new duty for head teachers to ensure that a Transition Plan is drawn up for pupils with statements of SEN in year nine of their schooling.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.6/3">In 2001&ndash;02, head teachers prepared for the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting, which will benefit all schools by improving the framework for benchmarking, as well as streamlining financial administration. Head teachers had to implement modest changes to target setting for Key Stage 4. They also had to process claims for the Welcome Back Bonus, an incentive to encourage teachers returning to the profession.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.6/4">Administration of the Standards Fund was considerably simplified last year, so that head teachers and others had much less paperwork to contend with in securing additional funds for their schools. Moreover, for the first time it was possible to merge schools' annual reports with prospectuses, again freeing up valuable head teacher time.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.8/1">The LSC calculated two figures for each school sixth form&mdash;what it would receive under the real terms guarantee which protects funding relative to the baseline year of 2000&ndash;01, depending on changes in pupil numbers; and what it would receive under the LSC's own funding formula, which reflects the nature and number of programmes being studied. The LSC allocation for the school is the higher of these two figures. Almost two thirds of schools are being funded under the LSC's formula in 2002&ndash;03, so are receiving more than they would under the real terms guarantee.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.8/2">The LSC notified LEAs of the sixth form funding allocations for their schools in early March. It was for LEAs to set overall budgets for all their schools by the end of March, incorporating the LSC allocations. Schools receive the funds from the LEA as one pot of money and are not required to account separately for the LSC allocation. However, LEAs are required under the rules of fair funding to ensure that schools receive for their sixth forms at least the real terms guarantee and one third of any difference between that and the LSC formula allocation, rising to the full amount by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.8/1">The LSC's budget for 2002&ndash;03 is &pound;7.3 billion, a 5.9 per cent. real terms increase on the previous year. This will enable the LSC to make progress towards its key targets. These include increasing the participation and achievement of young people in learning (including work based learning) and increasing the demand for learning by adults and employers. We have also increased the flexibility available to the LSC to meet its priorities by simplifying the budget structure and removing unnecessary restrictions on how the grant is spent. We have worked with the LSC to agree clear outcomes which include promoting equality by highlighting outcomes for under-represented groups in work-based learning.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.8/2">The Government have contributed substantial financial support for Modern Apprenticeships (MAs). Between 1997 and 2002 over &pound;3.7 billion has been allocated to Government-supported work-based learning, of which it is estimated that in excess of &pound;1 billion has been used to support MAs. As a result of this investment, the number of young people on MAs has risen from 75,000 in 1997 to over 220,000 today. We are investing an additional &pound;180 million over three years 2001&ndash;04 to support and further develop MAs, a clear sign of the importance we attach to their role in raising skills levels in the workplace, and in offering young people high quality vocational and work-related options for post-16 learning. The Government and the LSC recently agreed a target of over a quarter of young people between the age of 16 and 21 entering MAs by 2004 and the LSC will have sufficient funds to meet this target.</p>

	<p pid=".86W.2/1">There have been no discussions between the Secretary of State and the Adult Learning Inspectorate (the ALI) about benchmarks. In her January 2002 grant letter to the chair of the ALI the Secretary of State expressed concern about the downward trend in inspection grades awarded to providers for work-based learning. To investigate the reasons the Department commissioned the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA) to carry out a research study. When finalised, we will consider the evidence and take appropriate action. This will include reviewing how we measure achievement in work based learning.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.3/1">The criteria governing entitlement to ill health retirement benefits were amended in 1997 to require that, despite appropriate treatment, applicants have a medical condition that would render them permanently incapable of undertaking any further teaching. In this context, permanent is defined as lasting at least up to the scheme's normal retirement age of 60. This replaced the previous less stringent criteria that required the presence of a medical condition that would prevent teaching only for the foreseeable future (defined as lasting at least 3&ndash;4 years).</p>
	<p pid=".89W.3/2">The Department also commissioned the Faculty of Occupational Medicine to produce occupational health guidance specifically aimed at the employers of teachers. This guidance was published in December 2000. The reduction in the number of ill health retirements since 1997 is therefore a consequence of a greater awareness among teachers' employers of the benefits of effective occupational health provision, including consideration of alternatives to ill-health retirement such as part-time working or redeployment to less demanding duties, and the more rigorous criteria governing entitlement to ill health retirement benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".99W.3/1">The Department is funding the personal social services research unit to examine the reasons behind home closures. The most commonly cited cause was found to be business failure. Among the other factors identified was the high value of property, making it attractive for care home owners to cash in their investments.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.3/2">As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-17">17 April</phrase> by my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we are increasing the resources for personal social services by an annual average of 6 per cent. in real terms from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. Local authorities will be able to use these substantial extra resources to stabilise the care home market and to enable them to pay fair and realistic fee levels.</p>

	<p pid=".101W.8/1">The NHS Plan recognises that we live in a diverse society and sets out as core principles that the national health service will shape its services around the needs of the patient, be responsive to the needs of different groups and individuals within society and challenge discrimination on the grounds of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability and sexuality.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.8/2">The NHS Plan sets out a target of having translation and interpreting services available throughout the country by 2003. The Department has designated NHS Direct as the gateway to the whole NHS for those whose first language is not English by 2003. These services will be a pivotal building block in achieving the patient-centred services envisaged in the NHS Plan and the targets set in the national service frameworks. The development of telephone based support via NHS Direct and organisations such as language line (used in the NHS walk-in centres) offer alternatives to help with the delivery of languages needed in a co-ordinated way.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.8/3">The vital connection also sets out the need for local health and other organisations to develop integrated communication strategies as part of the health improvement and modernisation plans.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.8/4">Also, the NHS Plan includes a commitment that from 2002 it will be a pre-condition of qualification to delivering care in the NHS, that an individual has demonstrated competence in communications with patients. Plans to deliver on this target include the development of core curriculum in communication skills.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.8/5">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts to ensure that the local health service reflects the needs of local communities.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.3/2">We expect a climate of openness and dialogue in the national health service and a culture and environment that encourages staff to feel able to raise concerns about healthcare matters sensibly and responsibly without fear of victimisation.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.3/3">Guidance issued in Health Service Circular (HSC) 1999/198 on <phrase class="date" code="1999-08-27">27 August 1999</phrase> reinforced the above message. The HSC stated that all NHS trusts and health authorities are expected to issue guidance to staff so that they know how to raise concerns in a reasonable and responsible way. The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) gives significant statutory protection to employees who disclose information reasonably and responsibly in the public interest and are victimised as a result.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.3/4">All employees would be protected for raising concerns with their employees under PIDA. District general nurses who may be employed either by the NHS, a local authority or the private sector can now raise concerns with the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) who is responsible for inspecting the quality of service provided in a variety of care establishments.</p>

	<p pid=".119W.0/2">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.0/3">Implementation of all the remaining action points is under way. It is expected that action points 10, 11, and 20 will be completed by the end of 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.0/4">Action point 13 was to deliver guidance on the circumstances in which different health professionals may prescribe, supply and administer contraceptives to under 16s. Research is being commissioned to identify the extent and nature of confusion among health professionals to inform whether further guidance is needed.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.0/5">The target completion date for action point 29 is 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.0/6">While the bulk of the original action plan has now been implemented, considerable further work is needed to ensure that activity is sustained and monitored, and to assess the impact of pilot programmes. Our focus remains delivery of the headline goals of halving under 18 conception rates by 2010 and increasing the participation of teenage parents in education, training and employment. The Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy published their first annual report in November 2001 which set out 49 recommendations of further action to underpin delivery of these goals. The Government will publish its response to this report later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".119W.3/1">Chapter 10 of the NHS Plan states that Patient Advice and Liaison Services (PALS) will be available in all NHS trusts from April 2002. To underpin this commitment &pound;10 million has been made available to health authorities for PALS development this year. A large number of trusts already have PALS in operation and others are actively developing their service, appointing staff and are expecting to be operational in the near future. A number of primary care trusts are in the process of being set up, and therefore will need to look at incorporating PALS as part of their establishment. At this stage, therefore, there is no full list of those trusts which do not currently have PALS. However, we are in the process of setting up a system for monitoring PALS implementation.</p>

It is not possible to say how many of these applications are from care homes since the commission is still assessing from which service areas the applications originated and the associated documentation sent with them. It is probable that once the commission has processed all of the applications sent to it prior to <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> there will be significantly more than 2,500 applications.</p>

New care homes seeking registration and those previously exempt providers required to apply before the <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase> should attach their statement of purpose with their application for registration. The NCSC has indicated that it will work with providers during the registration process to ensure that statements are drawn up appropriately by providers.</p>
	<p pid=".122W.5/4">Providers required to apply for registration by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase> are given protection from section 11(1) of the Care Standards Act as long as they have submitted their application forms and until a decision to grant or refuse registration is made by the commission. When registration is granted by the commission a provider is automatically deemed as complying with section 11(1). Where a provider deliberately seeks to evade registration under the Act the commission will take appropriate enforcement action.</p>

In civil cases, an unrepresented appellant in poor financial state can request that the cost of the transcript be borne at public expense. It is for the judge to decide whether to grant that request. In criminal cases, where the appellant has a representation order, the cost of the transcript will also be borne at public expense. The cost of the transcript depends on its length as transcribers charge per folio (72 words) and will therefore vary from case to case.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.0/1">The VASCAR vehicle speed detection device relies in part on the operator accurately and consistently operating switches. These start and stop a clock and, where necessary, a distance measurement from the vehicle's odometer. The instrument can, alternatively, be pre-fed with the distance between two selected marker points.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/2">Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) requires operators to be trained and to pass a test as to their performance. They must demonstrate in a sequence of five measurements that none has an error greater than two miles per hour and that the average error across all five is less than 0.75 miles per hour. They are also trained on the selection, for pre-fed operation, of road marks, in order to minimise parallax errors.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/3">VASCAR also relies on frequent distance calibration checks. ACPO guidance requires these to be carried out at the start and, where VASCAR has been used, at the end of shifts. There are minimum distances over which measurements are made. The clock in the device is crystal controlled and its errors are insignificant.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/4">Where the operator is fully trained and the ACPO guidance followed, I am satisfied that the VASCAR device is accurate.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.3/2">Under the National Crime Recording Standard, introduced in all forces in England and Wales from April 2002, all reports of incidents, whether from victims, witnesses or third parties, and whether crime-related or not, will result in the registration of an incident report by the police. Following the initial registration, an incident will be recorded as a crime (notifiable offence) if the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law and if there is no credible evidence to the contrary.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.3/3">Police officers will determine, on the balance of probabilities, whether an incident amounts to a crime, based on their knowledge of the law and of Home Office counting rules. In most cases, a belief by the victim (or person reasonably assumed to be acting on behalf of the victim) that a crime has occurred will be sufficient to justify its recording as a crime. Once recorded, a crime would remain recorded unless there was credible evidence to disprove that a crime had occurred. A complainant could be requested to attend a police station in the normal course of police inquiries, but this would not be a pre-condition of an incident being recorded as a crime.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.3/4">In several forces &quot;assault clinics&quot; have been set up in order to improve the level of service provided to victims of minor assault and/or harassment. An initial report of an incident leads to a victim being given an appointment at the clinic, where the victim's statement is taken and the crime is recorded. A review by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) of the system in one force found that in some cases the victim did not subsequently attend the assaults clinic, leading to the incident not being recorded as a crime. The force is now changing its processes to ensure that this no longer occurs, and other forces have been advised accordingly.</p>

It is the Government's belief that, where appropriate, the chief officer of police should be able to give community support officers the power to detain someone for up to 30 minutes, pending the arrival of a constable, and, as a last resort, to use reasonable force to enforce this.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.2/2">The Government would also like to allow the chief officer of police and the person's employer, to give members of community safety accreditation schemes, (which could include warden schemes) the power of detention, but without the use of reasonable force.</p>

We have already stated our intention to re-introduce these provisions during consideration of the Bill in this House. The provisions in Chapter 1 of Part 4 are enabling, not prescriptive. It will be for each chief officer of police to decide whether and how to use community support officers and community safety accreditation schemes to combat crime and disorder and increase public reassurance.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.5/2">The measures set out in the White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&quot; published in February 2002, and in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill are designed to accelerate the asylum process. The introduction of a managed system of induction, accommodation, reporting and removal centres will secure a seamless asylum process and maintain contact with applicants. The appeals system will be streamlined to minimise delay and cut down barriers to removal.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.8/2">The terms &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;xenophobia&quot; are not defined in the United Kingdom's domestic law. Our law deals with those who act on racism through, for example, racial discrimination or inciting racial hatred, behaviours which are defined in our legislation. Where these terms appear and are not defined, such as in Article 29 of the Treaty of European Union, in the view of United Kingdom Government the terms should be given their ordinary accepted meaning having regard to the context in which they are used. This is also the approach taken within the Home Office.</p>
