	<p pid=".357W.0/1">All primary pupils have to study design and technology, including work with food and textiles within the national curriculum. Typically primary pupils learn food preparation and cooking skills, including food hygiene, and are encouraged to develop positive attitudes to healthy eating and food choice. The Government strongly encourage secondary schools to offer pupils the opportunity to study food technology, and around 90 per cent. do so. Food, nutrition and healthy eating are also taught within science and personal, social and health education (PSHE) at both primary and secondary level. Many secondary pupils also have the opportunity to study textiles through both design and technology and art and design. Home economics is still available as a GCSE title and includes food and nutrition, textiles and child development. Both food technology and textiles technology GCSE courses have proved extremely popular and more young people now take these courses, than previously entered for home economics before the introduction of the national curriculum.</p>

	<p pid=".357W.6/2">No target for the licensing of Sector Skills Councils has ever been set. My Department has told the Sector Skills Development Agency from the outset that they should work to a standard, not a deadline. It is more important that they take the time to ensure that applicants develop their proposals properly, with full involvement of sector employers, and so have the ability to deliver our ambitions for the new network. Good progress is being made in developing the network. Five trailblazer Sector Skills Councils were announced in December 2001 and nine further sectors are in the final phase of developing Sector Skills Council proposals for consideration by the Sector Skills Development Agency. We expect the first SSCs to be licensed early in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".369W.2/2">I understand from London Underground that they first became aware of problems on the Central line train fleet on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-03">3 September 2001</phrase> during a routine maintenance check at Hainault depot, when a train was found to have a dislodged motor. London Underground carried out an immediate ultrasonic examination of the relevant area on other motors, which revealed no further instance of failure.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/3">An independent investigation commissioned by London Underground concluded that the problem was loose bolts. A check of motor bolts on all Central and Waterloo &amp; City line trains was immediately carried out and revealed one instance of a motor with fractured bolts, where the motor was held in place by its safety bracket.The whole fleet was initially fully checked twice, after which a regime of checking all bolts at least once every 3 months was instigated.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-20">20 September 2002</phrase>, a train which was not in service but was entering Loughton sidings was derailed when a motor dropped off. An investigation revealed that the motor bolts had fractured and the safety bracket had failed to retain the detached motor as it was designed to do.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/5">Because of this, the most stringent checking regime possible was introduced with each train being checked every 5 days as a rolling programme across the fleet.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/6">Further independent investigation was also undertaken as a result of the Loughton incident. This highlighted a new concern over the safety bracket bolts and these were specifically included within the 5-daily check regime.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/7">The HSE are also conducting a full investigation.</p>

	<p pid=".374W.2/3">The European Commission did propose as part of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy that 32 million Euro of new money from the EC Budget should be made available during 2003 for an emergency vessel scrapping fund. The UK supported the proposal for this fund, provided that the Community financing could be found within the limits of the Berlin Financial Perspective. The Commission has yet to come forward with a fund that meets this condition.</p>

The Commission noted that funds would be freed in some member states if the Council curtailed aid paid for building new vessels. Unlike some member states, the UK does not use EC aid towards building new vessels, so this was not an avenue which freed financing for the UK.</p>

Our combined conclusions resulted in the substantial packages of aid announced by my right hon.

	<p pid=".388W.2/2">The Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment Act) 1985 provides protection to members of the reserve forces who are called out for permanent service. In general, it places an obligation on an employer to re-instate reservists who apply to them for this following a period of called-out service. The obligation is to reinstate in the occupation in which they were last employed before call out and on terms and conditions not less favourable than those which would have been applicable had they not been called out. Where this is not reasonable and practicable, they must be taken into employment in the most favourable occupation and on the most favourable terms and conditions as are reasonable and practicable in the particular case.</p>
	<p pid=".388W.2/3">In addition, section 217 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that, where those individuals resume employment with their previous employer within six months of the end period of service with the armed forces of the Crown, the period of service does not break their continuity of employment as far as the statutory provisions of the 1996 Act are concerned. The Ministry of Defence also has powers to make payment to individuals and their employers to maintain membership of an employer's pension scheme while the individual is called out.</p>
	<p pid=".388W.2/4">Together these provide robust and practicable safeguards for the employment rights of individuals who are reservists when they are called out.</p>

A number of practical ways forward were identified and the Minister of State for Pensions has re-affirmed his commitment to meet with members of the ASW Action Group. The protection that people receive if their pension schemes are wound up is important, and we need to do more to protect the rights of members in schemes that are winding up. That is why we are consulting on proposals within the Pensions Green Paper.</p>

	<p pid=".390W.2/1">The Department of Trade and Industry is working with a number of other public sector bodies to promote the use of and extend access to broadband services in pursuit of the Government target for the UK to have the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005. These include: the nine English Regional Development Agencies, the Office of Government Commerce and the Office of the e-Envoy. We are also working with the three devolved Administrations, which have their own broadband strategies based on their (devolved) economic development remits.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/2">The programmes to which DTI is contributing include: The UK Broadband Fund&mdash;&pound;30 million distributed through RDAs and devolved Administrations to support them in taking forward innovative schemes to meet local requirements for extending broadband networks to a wider range of customers than those who would appear immediately to be commercially attractive. The UK Broadband Taskforce&mdash;this is a joint initiative between DTI and OGC. The DTI contribution places a Regional Broadband Coordinator in each devolved Administration and RDA to support and promote the aggregation of public sector demand for broadband and to ensure that through such aggregation there is an extension of broadband availability, particularly in rural areas and for small and medium enterprises. The budget for the Taskforce is about &pound;3 million.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/3">The OGC contribution to the UK Broadband Taskforce is to make public sector procurement of broadband more effective by:</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/4" class="indent">Publishing non-chargeable advice and guidance</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/5" class="indent">Offering chargeable hands-on support to assist public sector purchasing authorities with specific broadband projects</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/6">Framework Agreements for Broadband Services&mdash;OGCbuying.solutions (the trading arm of OGC) is in the process of letting Frameworks which will provide customers with a 'one-stop-shop' for the procurement of broadband managed services. These agreements will be awarded in early spring 2003, and enable any UK public sector contracting organisation to obtain best value when buying broadband services without requiring a full and separate procurement for each purchase.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/7">OGCbuying.solutions' costs in letting and managing the frameworks will be defrayed in a small percentage management charge levied on suppliers who conduct business through the frameworks.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/8">UK online for business&mdash;This DTI programme supports business in the take up and effective use of ICT to improve productivity and competitiveness. As such it supports the broadband agenda through raising awareness of the business benefits to be gained through the use of broadband and other enabling technologies, backed by the provision of independent and impartial advice and information, delivered through publications, the UK online for business website and UK online for business advisers. Estimated spend this financial year is &pound;15 million of which &pound;1.5 million is specific to promotion of broadband.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/9">In addition to these programmes many local and regional bodies have broadband-related campaigns. Other Government Departments have their own programmes to extend broadband services to public buildings. For example, under the Department for Education and Skills the importance of broadband has been reflected by right hon. Friend the Prime Minister who announced in November 2002 that all schools should be connected to broadband by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/10">By the end December 2002, 26 per cent. of schools in England were connected to broadband at 2 mbps or faster.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.5/1">The Government are committed to tackling fraud and closing loopholes in the tax system which allow some people to avoid paying their fair share of tax, increasing the burden on other taxpayers and giving those who use avoidance schemes an unfair advantage. The Government have acted every year since 1997 to close unfair loopholes. For example, the 2002 pre-Budget report included measures to counter the avoidance of tax and national insurance through the abuse of Employee Benefit Trusts, legislation to prevent businesses unfairly claiming accelerated capital allowances, changes to the controlled foreign companies rules to prevent avoidance of UK tax on profits from extended warranties, and action to prevent companies avoiding the payment of VAT on the sale of freehold buildings. In addition the pre-Budget report launched a strategy to tackle losses in the VAT system, which is designed to produce &pound;2 billion a year in additional revenues by 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.2/16">No abatement is made for subsequent recoveries. The figures relate to a combination of suspected and proven non-procurement and procurement frauds and thefts with estimated values refined from time to time as investigations, sometimes lasting a year or more, reach a conclusion. A major element of estimated cost relates to 'at risk' estimates applied to suspected procurement fraud cases, incorporated here in reported totals from 1999&ndash;2000, and are often resolved as 'no crime' or have a proven value lower than original estimates.</p>

	<p pid=".400W.6/1">International Military Services Limited (IMS) is in dispute with the Government of Iran over the termination terms of contracts let in the 1970s for the supply of tanks and armoured recovery vehicles. The contracts were repudiated by Iran during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Attempts to negotiate a settlement have so far failed and the case has been referred to the International Chamber of Commerce for arbitration. The arbitration tribunal reached a decision on IMS's liability to the Iranian Ministry of Defence in 2001, but IMS is challenging the outcome in the Dutch courts. The amount of the Ministry of Defence's potential liability will be influenced by the result of the appeals process. Until that process is concluded we will not know the size of any liability. The details of the case are commercially confidential.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.0/1">We are currently exploring with the United States authorities and with British industry the possibility of working together in areas of direct relevance to missile defence, including participation in the US programme. Our aim is to conclude a technical Memorandum of Understanding with the US, covering Government and industrial co-operation. The creation of a Missile Defence Technical Centre (MDTC), jointly funded by United Kingdom Government and industry, is being considered to provide a focus for this future technical work. Companies consulted include BAE SYSTEMS, QinetiQ, MBDA (UK), AMS and InSys.</p>

	<p pid=".402W.15/1">Shelter was selected as the specialist housing adviser to the Armed Forces Project (AFP) established at the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC), Colchester in April 2001. The project was aimed at identifying the small minority of service leavers who are vulnerable to social exclusion and helping them to avoid homelessness. It was originally funded as a pilot scheme by the Homelessness Directorate (previously known as the Rough Sleepers Unit) of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and has been funded by the Ministry of Defence since April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".402W.15/2">The AFP was established to help those service personnel who are assessed to be at risk of homeless on discharge from the armed forces after a period of detention in MCTC. The Shelter Housing Adviser provides service personnel and the families of Service personnel in detention with the best possible housing information, advice on their housing rights, and representation. The Housing Adviser, where necessary, makes referrals to local support services in the region to which personnel are moving after they leave the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".402W.15/3">AFP also works in partnership with other MOD housing organisations such as the Joint Services Housing Advice Office (JSHAO) and the Single Persons Accommodation Centre for Ex-Service personnel (SPACES).</p>
	<p pid=".402W.15/4">The Shelter AFP has to date helped over 156 service personnel and 27 service families, who were assessed to be at risk of homelessness.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.2/1">The Skill Force initiative is part of Ministry of Defence's work in the wider community as a force for good. The objective is to reduce the number of pupils not in employment, education or training on completion of mandatory education at 16. More immediately, the aim is to reduce truancy, school exclusion and juvenile crime. This is done by using the skills and experience of ex-Service instructors to deliver a vocational alternative for one day a week in school time. The course develops Wider and Key skills through a range of awards and qualifications ranging from St. John's Ambulance young lifesaver to Duke of Edinburgh and Key Skills qualifications. The course is structured around the ASDAN modular vocational award studied at Bronze/Silver level. Pupils gain self-confidence and team skills while working with strong positive role models from the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.2/2">As a result of an independent evaluation of two of the more mature schemes carried out last year, it was agreed that DfES would fund a further 12 schemes as part of its Behaviour Improvement Programme. 13 local education authorities were invited to include Skill Force in their range of behaviour improvement measures. I am pleased to say that Oldham was one of the authorities chosen and that the scheme there was formally opened on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-09">9 January 2003</phrase>. A total of some 54 young people are involved in Skill Force Oldham, the participating schools are, Breeze Hill School, Radclyffe School and South Chadderton School.</p>

A major element of estimated cost usually relates to &quot;at risk&quot; estimates applied to suspected procurement fraud cases which are often resolved as &quot;no crime&quot; or have a proven value lower than original estimates.

	<p pid=".404W.11/1">UNICOM, the Army's unit administrative IT system, is represented on several user-groups and fora that consider proposals for system improvements. Continuous improvement is achieved through 'Change Requests', submitted by users and sponsors; on average some three to four of these are actioned per month and a major upgrade takes place quarterly. UNICOM can also operate through a Windows emulation facility and some sites operate the software through a 'Graphical User Interface (GUI)', but large-scale deployment of this software is dependent on replacement of the user terminals currently in place. This is currently being considered as part of the wider Defence Communications Services Agency Defence Integration Infrastructure (DII) programme alongside the long-term future of the system.</p>

As yet no decis;ions on the outcomes of the cut in subsidy have been taken and the SRA have made it clear that they will not consider any proposals which suggest closure of routes in response to a possible reduction to the subsidy.</p>

	<p pid=".410W.0/1">In 2002 it is estimated that 'Total Income from Farming' in Northern Ireland fell to &pound;129 million. For full-time farm businesses the average net farm income is forecast to be &pound;4,600 for the year ending March 2003, some &pound;3,700 lower than in the previous year. These figures are disappointing but reflect lower producer prices in 2002, particularly for milk, and increased expenditure on purchased feedstuffs, a reflection of the poor weather experienced during the summer of 2002. At present there are some encouraging signs which, if maintained, should lead to an improvement in farm incomes. These include the firming of milk prices and the significant strengthening of the euro relative to sterling. In addition the Vision Action Plan, recently announced by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, addresses many of the challenges currently facing the industry and provides a clear strategy to work towards a viable and sustainable agriculture sector for the future.</p>

Progress against the White Paper's recommendations is monitored regularly across Government through an Implementation Plan, available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website. The Urban Summit, held last year, brought together Ministers from across Government to reaffirm our commitment to tackling urban issues in an integrated way.</p>

	<p pid=".419W.2/2">Although much of the new development in Thames Gateway will take place within the indicative flood plain defined by the Environment Agency, the defences on the River Thames provide a high level of protection from flooding. The indicative flood plain must not be confused with the functional flood plain where water needs to flow freely in time of flood. Development in this area should be wholly exceptional, and limited to essential transport and utility infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.2/3">Elsewhere in the indicative flood plain in Thames Gateway development proposals will still be subject to an appropriate flood-risk assessment and full consultation with the Environment Agency. The agency is a member of the Environment Sub-Group of the Thames Gateway Strategic Partnership, and has been working closely on the proposed developments for over a year. It has produced environmental constraint maps for each of the zones of change within Thames Gateway.</p>

	<p pid=".426W.2/1">It is a tragedy for any child to become involved in prostitution. Children involved in prostitution are primarily victims of abuse and adults who take advantage of them, whether by exploiting them as pimps or by buying sexual services from them, are child abusers.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/2">The Government issued guidance for agencies working with children entitled &quot;Safeguarding Children in Prostitution&quot; in May 2000. This was followed by the &quot;The National Plan for Safeguarding Children from Commercial Sexual Exploitation&quot;, which was published in September 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/3">The message of both documents is that those under 18 who engage in prostitution are almost invariably victims and must be treated as such. A further message is that wherever possible criminal justice action should be pursued against those who abuse children through prostitution or seek to exploit them as prostitutes.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/4">&quot;Setting the Boundaries: Reforming the law on sex offences&quot;, the report of the Review of Sex Offences published in July 2000, did not specifically review the law on prostitution but did consider matters relating to exploiting the prostitution of others, especially children. It made recommendations to clarify, and make more effective the legislation relating to sexual exploitation. The Government announced their response to this document in the command paper &quot;Protecting the Public&quot; in November 2002, and introduced the Sexual Offences Bill to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-28">28 January 2002</phrase>. This Bill proposes four new offences to directly tackle the commercial sexual exploitation of children, which will carry severe penalties. These new offences are:</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/5" class="indent">Paying for Sex with a Child to tackle the demand side of this terrible trade. It will be an offence to pay for sex with a child or promise such payment or have sex with a child in the knowledge that another person has paid for or promised payment for this. The maximum penalty ranges from seven years to life imprisonment depending upon the age of the child involved, and the nature of sexual activity engaged in.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/6" class="indent">Causing or Inciting Child Prostitution or Pornography tackles those who for their own or another's gain cause or encourage a child to become involved in prostitution or pornography. The maximum sentence for this offence is 14 years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/7" class="indent">Controlling a Child Prostitute or a Child involved in Pornography covers the extremely repugnant issue of pimping, where a person directs or controls the activities and movements of a child in the course of their sexual exploitation. A man who, for example, made a child stand on certain street corners, or instructed the child to participate in the making of a pornographic film would be guilty of this offence. The maximum sentence for this offence is 14 years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/8" class="indent">Arranging or Facilitating Child Prostitution or Pornography covers, for example, the landlord or parent who knowingly, and for their own, or another person's gain, arranges for or allows their house to be used for the filming of a pornographic video in which children are abused.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/9">These proposed new offences cover the sexual exploitation of children up until the age of 18.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/10">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 introduces a new offence of trafficking persons to control them in prostitution. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. The Sexual Offences Bill includes more comprehensive trafficking legislation, carrying the same penalties but covering a wider range of activities, which are intended to replace this provision.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.2/11">In addition, the Home Office continues to fund six prostitution initiatives as part of the &quot;What Works: Tackling Prostitution&quot; scheme, funded by the Crime Reduction Programme. These projects address the issues of child prostitution, policing and the process of exiting a lifestyle of prostitution and seek to better inform us of successful strategies for dealing with and managing the nuisance caused by the activities of prostitutes, the behaviour of those involved in the exploitation of others and ways of supporting those involved in prostitution who wish to exit the trade.</p>

	<p pid=".431W.8/1">It is a general principle of English law that one cannot be indemnified against one's own dishonesty. So in that regard it is not possible for a sole practitioner solicitor, or any other person, to have insurance cover against his/her own fraud. For this reason most professional indemnity insurance policies contain a dishonesty exclusion which excludes the liability of the insurer to indemnify any person involved in the dishonesty, or fraudulent act, giving rise to the claim. Any &quot;innocent&quot; partners or employees not involved in the dishonesty or fraud will still have the benefit of cover under the policy. The current position, whereby solicitors obtain indemnity insurance from commercial providers, does not differ from the previous arrangements under which indemnity cover was provided by the Solicitors Indemnity Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.8/2">However, the Law Society continues to maintain a Compensation Fund, under which it is possible to make a claim for loss arising out of the dishonesty of a Solicitor, including a sole practitioner, in circumstances where the claim is excluded from the practice's professional indemnity cover. Any payments from the fund are made on a discretionary basis by the Law Society, having regard to the statutory provisions, rules and guidelines pursuant to which the fund is maintained. The level of cover provided by the Compensation Fund is up to &pound;1 million per claim.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.2/1">None to date. I understand that the Electoral Commission is shortly to commence a review of the voting age, and its work will include the preparation of a paper which is expected to be issued widely for public consultation this summer. The Government welcome this review, which will help to inform the debate on the age that the right to vote should be set. It will give careful serious consideration to any recommendations the Electoral Commission may make following its review.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.6/1">The National School Fruit Scheme will entitle children aged four to six to a free piece of fruit each school day by 2004. The original pilots are now being expanded in selected regions in England with funding from the New Opportunities Fund.</p>

Free fruit is offered to whole classes and therefore some three and seven-year-olds also receive fruit if they are in these classes. Nursery schools that are not attached to infant, primary or special schools are not eligible and there are currently no plans to include them.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/3">These early stages of expansion are being carefully evaluated to learn lessons that will inform all aspects of the Scheme in 2004, including the practicalities of delivery to large numbers of schools.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/4">In the consultation document, &quot;Healthy Start&quot;, we put forward proposals to enable children in nurseries to have the choice of either a piece of fruit or milk via the Welfare Food Scheme.

	<p pid=".435W.5/1">Researchers have suggested that cooling the body may limit a chemical chain reaction in which injured brain cells release toxic chemicals that damage neighbouring cells. Clinical trials in rat populations with traumatic brain injuries suggest hypothermia does reduce permeability of the blood brain barrier, bruising and swelling of the brain, and neural cell death and injury. In recent years, there have been human clinical trials studying the connection between hypothermia and traumatic brain injury outcomes.</p>
	<p pid=".435W.5/2">Some of the trials showed promising results, while one showed no benefit and, in fact, indicated hypothermia may be harmful to patients over 45 years of age. It has now been recognised that larger trials are required that provide the statistical power necessary to give clear answers both in children and in adults.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.0/2">The HPC consulted about which titles should be protected by law and has undertaken extensive market research to understand the public's perception of titles currently in use by healthcare professionals. The HPC's decision to propose the protection of both chiropodist and podiatrist reflects the general perception that these titles are used interchangeably. The titles indicate that those registered have met HPC's standards of competence. All applicants for registration will be expected to meet standards of proficiency, whether they are applying through the transitional arrangements, as international applicants or as UK applicants who have completed an approved course.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.0/3">The HPC proposes using subsections of the register to distinguish between modalities of care but believes that to distinguish between skill levels would be confusing and unnecessary. The HPC has no plans to introduce a sub-register for those practitioners who do not meet the Council's standards of proficiency and who would not therefore be able to use the protected titles. Ultimately, it is for the Health Professions Council to propose and the Privy Council to determine the protected titles that will be associated with parts and subsections of the Health Professions Register.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.3/1">The Government has made no assessment of the effect on the self-esteem and recovery of long term patients in mental health in-patient units being reliant on the National Health Service for clothing. However, empowering patients to take an active role in their own care is a key theme in the NHS Plan. In addition, the National Institute for Mental Health for England (NIMHE) is in the process of gathering examples of positive practice in the provision of clothing needs for long term patients in mental health in-patient units. We hope to make such examples of positive practice available on the NIMHE website in the spring.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.0/1">Gender reassignment surgery consists of a series of different surgical procedures, for example, female to male gender reassignment may require a mastectomy and a hysterectomy and a series of operations to construct a phallus. The Department collects Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from national health service trusts on operations specifically for sexual transformation, but those procedures such as mastectomies or hysterectomies are collected separately and it is not possible to identify if these were carried out as part of a gender reassignment operation.

	<p pid=".443W.6/1">Unlicensed herbal remedies containing kava-kava on sale before The Medicines for Human Use (Kava-kava) (Prohibition) Order 2002 came into force could only lawfully have been sold without any written indications. Traditionally Kava-kava has been used to treat anxiety, tension, restlessness and bladder discomfort. However, consumers may use Kava-kava for many reasons. The test for making a prohibition order under section 62 of the Medicines Act 1968 is whether this is necessary in the interests of safety.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.6/2">Any website reported to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) that appears to be in breach of regulations regarding advertising, sale and supply of medicines is investigated. The MCA works closely with other Government Departments and law enforcement authorities, both in the United Kingdom and abroad, in an effort to identify and take action where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.6/3">There is evidence, both from the UK and internationally, that some unlicensed herbal remedies may be of poor quality and in some cases may pose a threat to public health. However, this problem is not restricted to products sold on the internet or via other direct marketing strategies. Subject to the successful conclusion of negotiations, the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products would provide a regulatory regime, which should allow the public to choose from a wide range of herbal remedies, made to assured standards of safety, quality and information. In turn this would make it possible for the public to be given much clearer advice than is currently possible about how to avoid unregulated herbal medicines which may pose a risk to health.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.6/4">A number of papers are available in the Library relating to the considerations which led to The Medicines for Human Use (Kava-kava) (Prohibition) Order 2002. Beyond these the MCA does not hold additional analyses covering the issues raised in this question.</p>

	<p pid=".449W.2/1">Full information on environmental tobacco smoke is published by the Department in the leaflet, &quot;Passive Smoking&mdash;What it is and what you can do&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.2/2">We are working closely with the hospitality trade to develop the Public Places Charter designed to provide customers with clear information on the type of smoking policy operating in a particular establishment and allow them to make an informed choice.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.2/3">We are also increasing the visibility of health messages highlighting to smokers the risks environmental tobacco smoke presents. This is through regulations to transpose into United Kingdom law the EU Directive on the Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco Products. These regulations require tobacco products to carry larger and starker health warnings, on both the front and back of the packet. The dangers of passive smoking are highlighted in two of the new warnings which include ''Smoking seriously harms you and others around you&quot; and &quot;Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke&quot; The contents of tobacco smoke are also highlighted in a warning saying, &quot;Smoke contains benzene, nitrosomines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.2/4">We are encouraging all employers to introduce smoke-free work places. This year the Department is funding local tobacco control alliances across England to carry out projects in close co-operation with local employers to tackle passive smoking and to increase the number of smoke-free environments. These projects vary in nature from the production of smoke-free guides to pubs and restaurants to the provision of advice and support to managers wishing to introduce policies. We hope that many will be suitable for national application.</p>

	<p pid=".450W.2/1">The Government's vision in the NHS Plan is to provide fast and convenient care, available when people require it and tailored to their individual needs.</p>
	<p pid=".450W.2/2">We are taking forward programmes of work to increase capacity and deliver a wider range of services in primary and community settings, using general practitioners and nurses with specialist skills, in a modern, efficient and integrated way, which is convenient for patients. This will involve, for example, millions more outpatient appointments taking place in the community rather than in hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".450W.2/3">In addition, the day surgery operational guide, published in August 2002 makes it clear that, where a patient requires a procedure that can be performed as a day case, it should be assumed that the procedure will take place as a day case, unless it is not possible or the patient asks to be admitted as an inpatient. Patients receive treatment that is suited to their needs and which allows them to recover in their own home. The risk of hospital acquired infection is also reduced.</p>
	<p pid=".450W.2/4">To support this, we are also creating additional capacity in diagnosis and treatment centres, which provide high quality, scheduled, booked care for a pre-defined range of elective treatments and diagnostics. These will be geared towards patient convenience.</p>

The quality element of the target will be assessed by comparing the estimated expenditure on increasing service effectiveness with data on quality. A key element of this will be the value that can be placed on the lives saved from reducing mortality following health care interventions.</p>

The key conclusion is that bans on advertising and promotion prove effective, but only if they are comprehensive, covering all media and all uses of brand names and logos&quot;.
