	<p pid="b.345W.6/2">Magilligan Point ferry terminal operates an international ferry route to the Republic of Ireland. The terminal facility is therefore subject to security requirements set by the Department for Transport consistent with all port facilities in the UK servicing international ferry routes as required by European Commission Regulation No. 725/2004. Limavady borough council is responsible for implementing security at the terminal. A recent Department for Transport security inspection of the terminal highlighted some areas for improvement. In response to the Department's observations the council has decided to implement enhanced security measures on a temporary basis to serve as a training measure for security staff at the port.

	<p pid="b.347W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/2">The interests of United Kingdom manufacturers of specialist food supplements are being represented as part of working group discussions and bilateral meetings between the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and their counterparts in other member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/3">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been running an extensive programme to manage the regulatory impact of the traditional herbal registration scheme. This programme, which includes individual company meetings held free of charge to help companies progress their plans to register products, is contributing to the steady expansion in the number of applications made and registrations granted under the scheme in the United Kingdom. Where companies have acquired successful experience of the scheme, they may wish to take up opportunities to submit applications to register products in other member states of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/4">There are no current plans for Health Ministers to meet with the food supplements industry. The FSA meets regularly with the food supplements industry to discuss issues relating to food supplements, including the work on setting maximum levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/5">We have been advised by the FSA that member states were not consulted by the European Commission before the commencement of the Commission's impact assessment exercise in summer 2008. The FSA has met with the contractor appointed by the European Commission to carry out the work and provided details of United Kingdom stakeholders who could provide the data on the food supplements which are currently being marketed.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/6">The FSA has not made an assessment of the options put forward in the European Commission's impact assessment exercise and their impact on specialist manufacturers and retailers and consumer choice. An assessment of the likely impact will be made when the specific levels being proposed by the European Commission are available. These will be set out in European Commission proposals, which are currently expected in January 2009, on which the FSA will consult fully.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/7">In advance of the Commission publishing its proposals, an ad hoc technical working group comprising a small number of member states has been established which met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-15">15 October 2008</phrase>. A further technical working group meeting has been suggested for late November 2008 and it is envisaged that the outputs of these meetings will then be reported back to all member states at a full working group meeting, a date for which is yet to be advised.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/8">A meeting was held on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-11">11 April 2008</phrase> between officials from the Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man Governments and those of the FSA, MHRA and Ministry of Justice. Officials representing the Government of Jersey indicated that a major update of food safety legislation was under way in Jersey and that both the Food Supplements Directive and the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation are to be implemented as part of this exercise. Discussions at official level regarding the implementation of the legislation in Guernsey are ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.5/9">The MHRA has written to the Government of Jersey to begin discussions with them on the implementation of the Medicines Directive 2001/83/EC. During 2007 and 2008, the MHRA has had written discussions and a series of meetings with the Government of Guernsey over the implementation of the Medicines Directive. The MHRA believes that Guernsey's proposed medicines law will receive Royal Assent in the near future. The MHRA will continue to assist the Government of Guernsey in the development of the additional legislation required for implementation of the Medicines Directive.</p>

	<p pid="b.356W.0/2">During 2007-08, the busy message was played to 29 per cent. of call attempts to the child benefit helpline.</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.0/3">Service levels on the child benefit helpline have been affected over the last 12 months by a variety of different factors. These include increased customer demand and longer call handling times following the introduction of enhanced security arrangements after HMRC's data loss in 2007. When the number of callers is high, as it has been on the child benefit helpline, calls are more likely to go unanswered with a higher number of busy messages played. Customers who cannot get through on their first attempt often use the rapid redial facility on their telephone to make numerous successive calls and this rapidly increases the number of unanswered calls and busy messages.</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.0/4">HMRC's latest contact centre customer survey, covering March to August 2008, shows that over 91 per cent. of callers were satisfied with the service they received from the child benefit helpline. The Department has, however, developed plans to further improve the service provided on the helpline.</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.0/5">These plans include allocation of an extra 50 advisers to the helpline by the end of the year; improving links between contact centres and the child benefit processing office to provide a better customer service; providing a set of automated messages on the helpline to enable callers to get basic relevant information about child benefit without needing to wait for or talk to an adviser and directing customers to the newly improved child benefit content on the HMRC website, which includes an improved payment date tracker. These measures will reduce the number of busy messages played to customers and enable more customers to speak to an adviser more quickly, should they need to.</p>

	<p pid="b.359W.10/1">It is not possible to give accurate figures for the incidence of TB caused by Mycobacterium bovis in non-bovine domestic animals in England and Wales. This is because there is no active surveillance programme in place and no systematic, random surveys of TB have ever been conducted in these species. Furthermore, the identification of <i> M. bovis</i> in tissues and clinical samples from all mammals (excepting man) and the detection of suspect TB lesions in farmed and companion mammals (other than cattle and farmed deer), became notifiable only in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.10/2">Data can be provided only on the number of <i> M. bovis</i> isolations from notified suspect clinical and post-mortem cases of TB arising in domestic animals other than cattle. For these reasons, and because these cases came from a small non-random sample of all the susceptible animals in England and Wales, these data are not an exact reflection of the true incidence of bovine TB in domestic animals.</p>

	<p pid="b.360W.5/1">Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is primarily a respiratory disease in most mammalian species, however, the relative importance of different routes of transmission (respiratory, oral, cutaneous) among and between species is unknown.</p>
	<p pid="b.360W.5/2">The principal species affected by bovine TB in Great Britain are cattle and badgers. While small numbers of companion animal species and many wild animal species have been shown to be infected with bovine TB, most are spill-over hosts. There is some indirect evidence of transmission from spillover hosts though it is uncertain how often this is occurring.</p>
	<p pid="b.360W.5/3">The Health Protection Agency has lead responsibility for tuberculosis in humans and works closely with DEFRA where human cases of Mycobacterium bovis (<i> M. bovis</i>) infection are identified. The risk posed by bovine TB to human health from cattle, pets or wildlife is considered very low and the number of cases is not increasing. In 2006 there were 33 cases in the UK. Most cases seen today are attributable to infection picked up abroad or reactivation of infection in older people who contracted the infection before the introduction of milk pasteurisation. Despite the low risk there are robust controls in place to protect public health. These include regular testing of cattle herds and early removal of test reactors; cattle movement controls; a cattle tracing system; slaughterhouse inspections; controls on meat and milk; and occupational health controls. DEFRA works in liaison with a number of Government Departments including the Health Protection Agency, Department of Health, Food Standards Agency and Health and Safety Executive, to help protect the public from contracting infection caused by <i> M. bovis</i>.</p>

	<p pid="b.363W.8/1">My Department does not currently compile annual estimates of the number of non-native species identified in UK waters. However, under the Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain, we are commissioning a dedicated directory of information about presence and spread of non-native species in Great Britain. This will aim to collate information from surveillance and monitoring activity both terrestrially and in the marine area. Records of non-native species are also being collated on an all-Ireland basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.363W.8/2">Within the UK, recent audits of non-native species have been commissioned in England and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.363W.8/3">In Scotland, an audit was conducted in 2001 and efforts since then have included co-ordination at the GB level and work by Scottish Natural Heritage on a Species Action Framework. This sets out a strategic approach to species management in Scotland and was based on a review of key priorities. The framework identified six invasive non-native species as the focus of new action for five years from 2007. Further details can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.363W.8/5">For England, a database of non-native species introductions was produced as part of an audit commissioned by Natural England; this extends up to 2005. It indicates that since 1997 two to three new species, on average, have been identified each year in marine and freshwater environments in England as shown in the following table. The majority of these new introductions have been animals and most have been found in the freshwater environment. Of these freshwater animals, three species have been identified as potentially invasive, while four of the marine animals have been similarly categorised.</p>

This involves a review of the 30 restricted areas in existence around the English coast to protect juvenile bass. The first stage of this process has just been completed, involving questionnaires being sent to Sea Fisheries Committees and the Marine Fisheries Agency in coastal regions of England, to identify whether amendments to the existing areas, or new areas, are needed. Full consultation with stakeholders will take place in the new year once the results of the first stage of the process have been assessed.</p>

	<p pid="b.365W.10/1">The information is not available in the format requested. The Department of Health expects ambulance trusts and acute trusts to work together and to share information to manage periods of high or unexpected demand effectively to prevent delays in patient handovers from occurring.</p>
	<p pid="b.365W.10/2">It is clearly important that patients are handed over to A and E as soon as possible after the ambulance arrives, and the A and E clock for the four-hour standard should start 15 minutes after the ambulance arrives regardless of whether the patient has been handed over or not. The Department continues to make clear to the NHS that local services need to ensure they have effective and efficient processes in place to deliver timely handover.</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.8/1">In June 2007, Safe.Sensible.Social.&mdash;The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy (which has already been placed in the Library) updated the 2004 National Alcohol Strategy and has a main aim to reduce drinking that is harmful to health.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.8/2">The Department has put in place a new NHS vital signs indicator from April 2008 to measure change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol related conditions. Included within this, alcoholic liver disease was responsible for 14,668 hospital admissions in 2006-07. The number of admissions with a primary diagnosis of liver disease more than doubled between 1995-06 and 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.8/3">We expect that this vital signs indicator will encourage the national health service to identify those drinking above lower risk levels earlier. This approach, linked with advice and support from general practitioners or other healthcare staff, has been shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of 'everyday' harmful drinking that leads to health harm, including liver disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.8/4">This NHS vital signs indicator is included in the Home Office Public Service agreement to reduce drug and alcohol harm and in the Department of Communities and Local Government list of indicators for local authorities and their partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.8/5">Since the introduction of this indicator, this year more than 90 primary care trusts have developed plans to reduce alcohol-related admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.8/6">In May 2008, the Department launched a campaign on alcohol units and health, with a second burst of adverts running later this year. This campaign highlights how regularly exceeding daily guidelines on drinking increases the risk of liver disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.8/7">We recognise that there is strong support for developing a national plan for liver disease and we are considering what the national health service needs to do over the next few years in order to address these pressures, and how this should be monitored. We shall announce next steps in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.383W.0/1">The interests of United Kingdom manufacturers of specialist food supplements are being represented as part of working group discussions and bilateral meetings between the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and their counterparts in other member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.0/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been running an extensive programme to manage the regulatory impact of the traditional herbal registration scheme. This programme, which includes individual company meetings held free of charge to help companies progress their plans to register products, is contributing to the steady expansion in the number of applications made and registrations granted under the scheme in the United Kingdom. Where companies have acquired successful experience of the scheme, they may wish to take up opportunities to submit applications to register products in other member states of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.0/3">There are no current plans for Health Ministers to meet with the food supplements industry. The FSA meets regularly with the food supplements industry to discuss issues relating to food supplements, including the work on setting maximum levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.0/4">We have been advised by the FSA that member states were not consulted by the European Commission before the commencement of the Commission's impact assessment exercise in summer 2008. The FSA has met with the contractor appointed by the European Commission to carry out the work and provided details of United Kingdom stakeholders who could provide the data on the food supplements which are currently being marketed.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.0/5">The FSA has not made an assessment of the options put forward in the European Commission's impact assessment exercise and their impact on specialist manufacturers and retailers and consumer choice. An assessment of the likely impact will be made when the specific levels being proposed by the European Commission are available. These will be set out in European Commission proposals, which are currently expected in January 2009, on which the FSA will consult fully.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.0/6">In advance of the Commission publishing its proposals, an ad hoc technical working group comprising a small number of member states has been established which met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-15">15 October 2008</phrase>. A further technical working group meeting has been suggested for late November 2008 and it is envisaged that the outputs of these meetings will then be reported back to all member states at a full working group meeting, a date for which is yet to be advised.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.0/7">A meeting was held on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-11">11 April 2008</phrase> between officials from the Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man Governments and those of the FSA, MHRA and Ministry of Justice. Officials representing the Government of Jersey indicated that a major update of food safety legislation was under way in Jersey and that both the Food Supplements Directive and the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation are to be implemented as part of this exercise. Discussions at official level regarding the implementation of the legislation in Guernsey are ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.0/8">The MHRA has written to the Government of Jersey to begin discussions with them on the implementation of the Medicines Directive 2001/83/EC. During 2007 and 2008, the MHRA has had written discussions and a series of meetings with the Government of Guernsey over the implementation of the Medicines Directive. The MHRA believes that Guernsey's proposed medicines law will receive Royal Assent in the near future. The MHRA will continue to assist the Government of Guernsey in the development of the additional legislation required for implementation of the Medicines Directive.</p>

	<p pid="b.384W.7/1">Over the last 12 months my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and other Ministers have raised the need for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Burma on many occasions with key countries in the region including China, India, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. Our ambassador in Rangoon has also repeatedly raised the issue with ministers in the military Government. In October 2007 we helped to secure unprecedented UN Security Council action on Burma, which included a clear demand for the early release of political prisoners. This demand was reaffirmed by the UN Security Council in May under UK chairmanship. We continue to support the UN Secretary-General's efforts to work on the release of prisoners. The EU has also made its position clear, and with strong UK support, strengthened sanctions against the regime in response to the brutal crackdown on peaceful protests last autumn, when many political activists were detained. Our embassy in Rangoon continues to inquire about specific cases with political prisoner support networks and those non-governmental organisations concerned with prisoner welfare.</p>
	<p pid="b.384W.7/2">While we welcome the release during September of a small number of political prisoners, it is important to remember that arbitrary arrests continue, and more than 2,000 political prisoners remain in detention.</p>

	<p pid="b.385W.2/1">The military regime is determined to maintain its hold on power regardless of the cost and suffering of the people of Burma. The junta's 'Roadmap to disciplined democracy', including a new constitution and elections planned for 2010, is designed to entrench military rule behind a facade of civilian government. The process excludes the opposition and meaningful participation by the ethnic groups. Fundamental rights are consistently ignored. Over 2,000 political prisoners remain in detention, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and other pro-democracy leaders. Ethnic minority groups have been methodically marginalised. Against this backdrop, we will continue to do all we can to generate international pressure for a peaceful transition to democracy and respect for human rights in Burma. In particular, we will continue to give our full support to the UN Secretary-General and his efforts to break the current deadlock.</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.2/2">The humanitarian situation is of serious concern across the country. One third of the country's population lives on less than one third of a dollar a day, 10 per cent. do not have enough to eat, half of Burma's 20 million children do not complete primary school, and 70 per cent. of the population is at risk from malaria. The protests of August and September 2007 were sparked by this ever increasing poverty, and people's deep frustration with the economic and political failures of the Burmese regime. Relief aid for those affected by Cyclone Nargis, which struck Burma in May, is now getting through with greater co-operation from the Burmese regime than it showed in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. However, as many as 300,000 people remain highly vulnerable. The UK is committed to supporting the post-Cyclone Nargis relief effort and remains the biggest bilateral donor, contributing &pound;45 million. UK aid for Cyclone Nargis is delivered through the UN, Red Cross and international and local non-governmental organisations to ensure that relief supplies are properly distributed to cyclone victims and do not benefit the regime.</p>

This only increases the humanitarian crisis facing the thousands of displaced people living near or on the Thai-Burma border.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.2/2">The continued violence in Karen state is regrettable and highlights the need for a comprehensive and just settlement of Burma's ethnic conflicts. Stability and territorial integrity are important to all nations and the continued neglect of the needs of the people of Burma by the regime is at the root cause of conflict in many parts of the country. We regularly emphasise to the Burmese regime, and to countries in the region, the need for the full and fair participation of ethnic nationalities in the political process as key to a durable solution to Burma's problems. There can be little prospect of national reconciliation without genuine recognition of their political, economic and social rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.387W.0/1">The Cuban Government retains tight control over information about their prisons. It is therefore difficult to put an exact figure on the number of political prisoners. Four prisoners of conscience were conditionally released during 2007 and subsequently exiled to Spain. However, Amnesty International consider, in their latest 2008 report, that there are at least 62 prisoners of conscience currently in Cuba.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/2">In January 2008 the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, an unofficial source of human rights information inside Cuba, counted 234 cases of political prisoners. In the Commission's August report, it notes an overall decline in numbers of political prisoners but an increase in temporary detentions and harassment against dissidents. This is consistent with reporting we have received from our embassy in Havana.</p>

We will begin this by introducing, in 2009, mandatory pathways to work interviews for existing customers under aged 25. By 2013 all customers will have been migrated from incapacity benefits to employment and support allowance and as part of that most will be required to engage with us in a pathways to work style programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.401W.2/1">From December 2004, the standard interest rate (SIR) used to calculate support for mortgage interest payments in income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance and state pension credit was changed to respond to changes in the Bank of England base rate. The SIR is the Bank of England base rate plus an additional 1.58 per cent. This is more representative, transparent, easier to understand and easier to administer than the previous method, which was based upon an average of building society interest rates. The additional 1.58 per cent. recognises the fact that lenders' interest rates are set at a higher rate than the base rate and to ensure that no-one lost out when the method of calculation changed.</p>
	<p pid="b.401W.2/2">DWP no longer needs to wait for the collation of statistics by the Financial Services Authority and the official publication by the Office for National Statistics of the average building society interest rate. Nor does it need to lay regulations to change the SIR. As soon as the Bank of England announces a change which triggers a move in the SIR, action is taken to amend the relevant departmental computer systems. This has reduced the implementation time by approximately four weeks compared to the pre-December 2004 arrangements. Changes are normally implemented in about five weeks from the Bank of England's announcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.401W.2/3">The SIR is currently 6.58 per cent. The Bank of England announced a 0.5 per cent. cut in the base rate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October</phrase>. This will mean that the SIR will reduce to 6.08 per cent. in about five weeks' time.</p>

	<p pid="b.404W.2/2">Many employers already help their workers to provide for their retirement through workplace pensions. To encourage this and increase participation in workplace pension schemes, our reform programme includes measures that will remove some of the regulatory burdens on schemes and employers and from 2012 employers will have a statutory duty to enrol workers into workplace pension saving that meets minimum standards. We estimate these reforms will lead to between six million to nine million more people newly participating or saving more in workplace pensions.</p>

	<p pid="b.406W.2/1">Tackling pensioner poverty continues to be one of this Government's key priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.2/2">The Government have introduced a number of measures to help older people out of poverty. In 1997, the poorest pensioners lived on around &pound;69 a week, today pension credit ensures that no-one needs to live on less than &pound;124.05 a week (&pound;189.35 for a couple). We have successively raised the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit at least in line with earnings in every year since its introduction, and the value of the safety-net we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by over a third in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.2/3">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Between 1998-99 and 2006-07 the number of pensioners in low income in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million to 2.1 million (measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs.)</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.2/4">Our commitments in the Pensions Act 2007 to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee at least in line with earnings over the long term, and to reintroduce the earnings link to basic state pension from 2012, or by the end of the next Parliament, will help secure the gains we have made into the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.2/5">We will continue to strive to ensure that older people are aware of, and take up their entitlements through initiatives such as: using sophisticated data matching to identify those who may be entitled to, but not currently receiving, benefits; home visits for vulnerable customers; local and national advertising and media campaigns; a simple and straight-forward claim process; and ever closer working with partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.2/6">In addition to pension credit we have increased winter fuel payments to &pound;200 for households with someone aged 60-79, and &pound;300 for those with someone aged 80 or over. We will be making an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &pound;50 for households with someone aged 60 to 79 and &pound;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. Since 1997, we have also introduced free eye-tests, free off-peak bus travel for pensioners and free television licences for over 75s.</p>

	<p pid="b.406W.5/1">Addressing pensioner poverty has been one of the Government's key priorities since 1997. The number of pensioners in relative low income has fallen from 2.9 million in 1998-99 to 2.1 million in 2006-07. Pensioners are less likely to be in poverty, as measured by relative incomes after housing costs are accounted for, than the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/2">Maximising the take-up of benefits is crucial to tackling poverty levels. Since pension credit was introduced in 2003 the number of pensioners in relative low income has fallen by around 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/3">We are making every effort to ensure that people are aware of and claim their entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/4">We have simplified the claim process to make pension credit easier to claim. Customers no longer need to sign and return their pension credit claim forms, claims can be made entirely over the phone.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/5">This autumn 2008, we are introducing a measure which will enable claims to housing benefit and council tax benefit made over the phone with pension credit to be forwarded directly to the local authority without the need for a signature&mdash;this is a significant simplification to the claim process and should benefit thousands of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/6">In February 2007, an additional question was introduced in the pension credit application process to identify relevant caring responsibilities in order to invite the customer, where appropriate, to claim carer's allowance using a new, shortened, claim pack specifically designed for people of pension age.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/7">In addition we are using sophisticated data matching to identify eligible non- recipients, home visits for vulnerable customers, targeted local marketing and media campaigns and ever closer working with partner organisations.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of families have been helped by new tax credits, better public services and a renewed welfare state.

	<p pid="b.414W.5/2">The Government are confident that funding for statutory concessionary travel is sufficient in total to meet the cost to travel concession authorities (TCAs). The bulk of the funding remains within the overall local government formula grant settlement. Additionally, the Department for Transport provides a special grant totalling &pound;212 million in 2008-09 based on generous assumptions around fares, pass take-up, extra journeys and additional costs. This new funding gave many TCAs increases of 30 per cent. or more on the spending that they reported for concessionary travel in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.5/3">The Government will continue to monitor the impact of England-wide statutory concessionary travel. There are seasonal patterns to travel so it will take several months to see the full effect.</p>

	<p pid="b.414W.8/1">The Local Transport Bill, currently before Parliament, contains measures to improve local bus services. These include provisions that will support stronger partnership working between local authorities and bus operators, make quality contracts schemes a more realistic option for local authorities where they are in the public interest, give passengers a stronger voice by establishing a statutory bus passenger 'champion', and help to improve bus punctuality.</p>

Over the coming months, we will be engaging with key stakeholders on the details of the scheme in preparation for the competition to begin in early 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.430W.5/1">The 1998 Transport White Paper, &quot;A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone&quot;, established a programme of de-trunking to allow the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of a strategic road network that links the main centres of population and major transport hubs. The programme enables local highway authorities to set priorities for routes that primarily serve local needs, and supports the Government's aim to devolve more responsibilities to local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.5/2">The financial arrangements that have been established for the programme ensure that local highway authorities receive funding commensurate with the purpose the roads will continue to serve. This is taken as being broadly equivalent to the funds the Highways Agency would have spent on the road if it had continued to be a trunk road, because the de-trunking of a road through this programme is not expected to alter the quantity or nature of traffic using the road.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.5/3">Consequently, the de-trunking programme is expected to be broadly cost-neutral.</p>

	<p pid="b.434W.3/1">Building upon the successes of the previous Alcohol Misuse Enforcement campaign (AMEC), the Tackling Under Age Sales of Alcohol to Children (TUSAC) and the Responsible Alcohol Sales campaign (RASC) the Home Office is proposing to run a different style of campaign this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/2">We are making funds available to support local problem solving projects, which can address local priorities which stem from alcohol related issues. Unlike previous enforcement campaigns this year's campaign is much less prescriptive and will also enable partnerships to bid for varying amounts of money to undertake more protracted and in depth problem solving work.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/3">This year we have set broad strategic objectives for the campaign, and have invited CDRPs/CSP's to submit bids, up to a maximum of &pound;30,000. The following principles detailed in the Safe Sensible Social strategy will be considered in order to decide on funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/4">The Government's vision is to produce a long-term and sustainable reduction in the harms associated with alcohol and drugs, where there is a safe, sensible and social drinking culture; where violent and antisocial behaviour is not tolerated; where young people are prevented from experiencing poor outcomes resulting from alcohol misuse; where those who drink alcohol are aware of the risks involved; and where those that are drinking too much receive the advice and support they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/5">The Government's delivery strategy for reducing the harms caused by alcohol is divided into three strands:</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/6" class="indent">first, the laws and licensing powers introduced to tackle alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder, protect young people and bear down on irresponsibly managed premises need to be used widely and effectively;</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/7" class="indent">second, focusing prevention, information and support, and where appropriate the criminal justice system at the minority of drinkers who cause or experience the most harm to themselves, their communities and their families. These are: 18 to 24-year-old binge drinkers; young people under 18 who drink alcohol; and harmful drinkers; and</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/8" class="indent">third, collaborative work by all agencies to shape an environment that actively promotes sensible drinking. Delivery will draw on the knowledge, skills, commitment and ability of local communities, the police, local authorities, prison and probation staff, the NHS, third sector organisations, the alcohol industry, the wider business community and the media.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.3/9">Completed bids will be submitted by <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-07">7 November 2008</phrase>, and partnerships will be notified if their bid has been successful by <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-14">14 November 2008</phrase>.

The agency's work is due to be completed by the end of February 2009. We should await the outcome of this work as it will inform the way forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.443W.5/1">The information requested on arrests is not available centrally. Information on arrests held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform is based on aggregated quarterly data collected at police force area level covering persons arrested for recorded crime (notifiable offences) by gender, specific age groups (under 10,10-17,18-20, 21 and over and unknown), ethnicity and by main offence group only.

	<p pid="b.443W.5/2">It is not possible to calculate the information requested by comparing arrest figures with figures for the number of people added to the NDNAD, because if the same person is arrested on more than one occasion during the year, that person will appear in the figures more than once.

This is the maximum wait time in which we aim to process passengers and in turn informs staff deployment, as well as informing considerations on further investment. We are clear that the averages are well within these benchmarks but will continue to work on reducing the occasions where those figures are exceeded.</p>

The Home Office is likely to be the major contributor to this but money will be drawn from a number of different Departments. The &pound;600 million envelope excludes spending being met by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) for requirements that fall within their remits.</p>

	<p pid="b.449W.0/2"><i> </i>The police use of Taser is limited to trained officers in accordance with Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidance. That guidance is clear that Taser use is currently restricted to authorised firearms officers (AFOs) where a firearms authority has been granted in accordance with criteria laid down in the ACPO Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms. In addition AFOs are able to deploy Taser in operations or incidents where the use of firearms is not authorised, but where they are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves or the subject. A trial of the deployment of Taser in 10 police forces to specially trained police units not composed of firearms officers, for use when facing similar threats of violence, is currently being evaluated. The use of Taser in the trial is subject to the authority level of the appropriate authorising officer, thus placing it at the same authority level as for a firearms incident.</p>

In addition, the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has announced a relief contribution of &euro;2 million, of which 17.5 per cent. is funded by DFID. The United Nations Relief Agencies have mobilised $8.6 million for relief and rehabilitation works in Cuba, $1.6 million of which is funded by DFID through the UN. However, the UN remains in negotiation with the Cuban authorities on full access and co-operation in order to use that money. We also understand that the Cuban Government has received offers totalling $30.5 million from a number of countries to assist with their reconstruction and emergency response efforts following the impact of the recent hurricanes.</p>

	<p pid="b.460W.2/1">We remain concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and continue to monitor it closely.</p>
	<p pid="b.460W.2/2">In Gaza, 69 per cent. of the population receive some form of food aid. Over 95 per cent. of businesses have closed and unemployment is over 45 per cent.. Health and educational services are under severe strain and the economy has been severely affected by crossing restrictions. Since the ceasefire began in June there have been some improvements. For example, projects to repair sewage treatment facilities have restarted and fuel supplies to the Gaza power plant have increased. However, the overall flow of humanitarian supplies, commercial goods and people into Gaza has only improved marginally.</p>
	<p pid="b.460W.2/3">In the west bank, 25 per cent. of the population is affected by food insecurity and unemployment is over 16 per cent. Due to falling incomes and continuing rises in food prices, people in the west bank now spend 56 per cent. of their income on food. Movement and access restrictions continue to hold back economic growth and to affect the daily life of ordinary Palestinians. In August, the United Nations counted 630 physical obstacles such as roadblocks and checkpoints in the west bank. This is almost 68 per cent. higher than when the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access was signed.</p>

	<p pid="b.460W.5/1">Widespread violence continues to cause large-scale displacements and restrict humanitarian access. Across Darfur, over 270,000 have been newly displaced so far in 2008. In September, fighting between government forces and rebel groups in North Darfur displaced tens of thousands and hindered humanitarian access. In the last two weeks, militia attacks have increased in South Darfur, displacing thousands. The World Food Programme (WFP) expects that it will not be able to reach 450,000 intended beneficiaries with food aid in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.460W.5/2">Meanwhile, increasing numbers of humanitarian workers are subjected to targeted attacks. So far in 2008, 225 humanitarian vehicles have been hijacked, 170 humanitarian workers abducted, and 144 compounds attacked. The equivalent figures for September are 17, 15 and 21 respectively. Totals are already significantly above 2007 figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.460W.5/3">Distribution of rainy season non-food items has been ongoing throughout Darfur. WFP and its implementing partners continue to deliver food aid to almost 3.5 million people. Our implementing partners continue to address priority needs for IDPs in all three states in Darfur across a range of sectors.</p>

The Assessing Pupils' Progress (APP) materials provide teachers with an effective tool to help them form robust judgments about pupils' progression through national curriculum levels and sub-levels. Teachers are able to see a pupil's relative strengths and weaknesses and it is this diagnostic potential of APP, linked to clear routes for progression through the levels, which enables teachers to personalise teaching to address pupils' strengths and weaknesses, and so support them to make the best possible progression.</p>

	<p pid="b.464W.3/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-21">21 October 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.3/4" class="indent">I am writing in response to your Parliamentary Questions that asked:- &quot;how long on average it took to complete applications for education maintenance allowance (EMA) from application to confirmation of award in the 10 per cent of cases which took longest to process&quot; and &quot;what the average time taken to complete applications for EMA was from receipt of application to confirmation of award in the latest period for which figures are available&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.3/5" class="indent">Due to the difficulties we are currently experiencing with EMA processing. It is difficult to be precise about the average time taken to process an application. We are seeking to improve it all the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.3/6" class="indent">Each year a substantial minority of applications are received with information missing. In these cases, they will have to be sent back to the applicant who is asked to provide the information and return it to us. We can only continue processing that application once it is sent back to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.3/7" class="indent">In all cases where an application is initially received before the end of October and an applicant is eligible for EMA all payments will be backdated and no one will miss out for EMA that they are entitled to.</p>

	<p pid="b.467W.2/1">There are provisions in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 to simplify the current system for enforcing unpaid employment tribunal awards in the county court. Once implemented these provisions will allow the applicant to go straight to enforcement rather than through registration at a county court. Additionally, for the first time, the award will be registered on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines. Inclusion on this register, which is often consulted by banks, building societies and credit companies when considering applications for credit, may make it more difficult for defaulters to obtain credit and therefore provides an incentive to pay the sum due. This provision will ease the burden on the recipients of tribunal awards and it is intended to implement this provision in April 2009.</p>
