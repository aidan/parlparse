In east Africa, DFID is preparing a major new regional programme which will help to facilitate trade between East African Community member states (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi). It will focus on reducing the costs of trading across borders by supporting one stop border posts, customs reforms and the development of revenue sharing arrangements between countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.6/2">In southern Africa, DFID funds the Regional Trade Facilitation Programme. This aims to make it quicker and easier for businesses to trade between countries. Important activities include harmonisation of trade-related regulations and procedures, introduction of one stop border posts, and promotion of exports into the south African market.</p>

	<p pid="d.1W.9/1">Much of Sub-Saharan Africa has been a relatively difficult place for manufacturing activities. Key reasons for this are poor infrastructure, particularly roads, ports and power infrastructure, a poor business environment and restrictive rules of origin in trade agreements.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.9/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) works on all of these agendas. For example, DFID provides support to the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA). This encourages a joined-up approach among donors and partner governments to meet Africa's urgent infrastructure needs. We also provide support to the Investment Climate Facility for Africa which is a new private-public partnership, focused on improving the investment climate in African countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.9/3">DFID's soon to be launched Aid for Trade Strategy will set out how we will support countries to become more competitive traders. In parallel, DFID continues to press for more development-friendly trade agreements with African countries. This is particularly evident in the ongoing negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), where we are arguing for more liberal rules of origin for African exports.</p>

	<p pid="d.2W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has provided &pound;250,000 in direct humanitarian aid to Cuba through the International Red Cross for shelter material and water filters for some 40,000 people. In addition, the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has announced a relief contribution of &euro;2 million, of which 17.5 per cent. is funded by DFID. The United Nations Relief Agencies have mobilised $8.6 million for relief and rehabilitation works in Cuba, $1.6 million of which is funded by DFID through the UN. However, the UN remains in negotiation with the Cuban authorities on full access and co-operation in order to use that money. We also understand that the Cuban government have received offers totalling $30.5 million from a number of countries to assist with their reconstruction and emergency response efforts following the impact of the recent hurricanes.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/2">Beyond humanitarian relief we do not provide direct reconstruction or long-term development aid to Cuba.

	<p pid="d.4W.5/1">In accordance with the Civil Service Recruitment Code, all external appointments to the Department for International Development (DFID) are made on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.</p>
	<p pid="d.4W.5/2">Job advertisements for vacancies at the Department for International Development (DFID) are placed in the national press or specialised magazines, in addition to appearing on DFID's own website and on the Civil Service Recruitment Gateway website. DFID does not routinely use recruitment consultants to fill vacancies for permanent posts. However, the central framework of executive search services, which is owned by the Cabinet Office, was used in February 2008 to engage Russell Reynolds Associates, at a cost of &pound;43,671, to help identify suitable applicants for the post of Permanent Secretary in DFID.</p>
	<p pid="d.4W.5/3">DFID also periodically engages temporary staff through recruitment agencies, mainly in administrative grades. A management fee is included in the salary costs for each person supplied by the agency, but it is not possible to disaggregate the management fees from the total amount charged by the agencies without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.4W.5/4">DFID's total spend on recruitment advertising for each of the last five financial years was as follows:</p>

	<p pid="d.5W.2/1">The Department for International Development has a strong set of controls to manage the risk of misuse of funds. Throughout the management of our programmes, there is a strong emphasis on establishing comprehensive arrangements to guard against fiduciary risks. The rules of UK Government accounting are rigorously applied.</p>
	<p pid="d.5W.2/2">DFID checks on the use of funds by requiring recipients to provide audited financial statements and by conducting annual monitoring reviews. DFID's programme management is supported by regular audits by DFID's Internal Audit Department and the National Audit Office, both providing further evidence of the correct use of aid funds.</p>
	<p pid="d.5W.2/3">Within DFID's fraud policy specific actions to reduce the incidence of fraud include:</p>
	<p pid="d.5W.2/4" class="indent">DFID's programmes are designed to respond from the outset to the risks of fraud or corruption which are identified through planning tools such as the fiduciary risk assessment;</p>
	<p pid="d.5W.2/5" class="indent">A specialist Counter Fraud Unit coordinates DFID's response to allegations or suspicions of fraud and corruption, and provides support to management to strengthen systems and processes to prevent or detect future losses; and</p>
	<p pid="d.5W.2/6" class="indent">Action is taken to recover funds which are lost, and DFID takes a robust approach in dealing with anyone found to have diverted UK aid funds away from their intended recipients. This includes disciplinary sanctions, criminal prosecutions, recovery of losses and the suspension of aid.</p>

The capacity of the estate beyond 2010 will depend, in particular, on the progress of our plans for the Home Office owned site outside Bicester and the land adjacent to the existing Yarl's Wood removal centre.

Several changes to the service have been made since the original contract was signed in February 2000. These comprise enhancements to resilience and fallback arrangements, plus an extension of the service to include coverage within the London Underground.

	<p pid="d.15W.10/1">Since 2000 the Government have helped to ensure business success by promoting the creation and growth of business and a strong enterprise economy across all regions, ensuring that all Government Departments and agencies deliver better regulation for the private, public and third sectors and delivering free and fair markets, with greater competition, for businesses, consumers and employees.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/2">Since 2000 the regional development agencies (RDAs) have been charged with stimulating the economic regeneration of the English regions through regional economic strategies.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/3">The RDA for Yorkshire and the Humber, Yorkshire Forward, working together with local authorities and other regeneration organisations, has supported the building of a stronger, mixed economy that combines a strong service sector with a higher value manufacturing sector, with more people starting their own businesses and new businesses that survive longer. As a result, the region's economy has been transformed following the decline in core traditional industries and recovered well from natural disasters such as foot and mouth in 2001 and flooding in 2007. Latest data to 2006 show it has had consecutive years of growth above the EU average.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/4">Latest statistics show there were over 350,000 businesses in the Yorkshire and the Humber region at the start of 2007, up by 94,000 (37 per cent.) from 256,000 in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/5">Yorkshire Forward has been leading on the simplification of business support provision in the region. The most significant change for business so far has been the rationalisation of the Business Link network and the development of a single regional gateway to business support (Business Link Yorkshire) that was launched in April 2008. This will significantly reduce the duplication of services, provide greater clarity, and redirect resources into front-line support services for businesses in the region. Yorkshire Forward also plans to make significant changes to its own support mechanisms, to focus on supporting six core programmes of activity that aid the overall start up and growth of a business.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/6">Examples of specific support programmes that have supported business development include:</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/7" class="indent">Objective 1 European Funding for South Yorkshire&mdash;where the 2000-06 programme worth a total of &pound;2.4 billion (including over &pound;770 million from the European Union's Structural Fund budget as well as public and private sector resources) resulted in over 1,300 new small and medium enterprises and over 30,000 new jobs in the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/8" class="indent">Objective 2 European Funding for the rest of Yorkshire and the Humber&mdash;where total of nearly &pound;1 billion (including &pound;350 million of European Structural Funds alongside UK public and private sector sources) resulted in over 22,000 new jobs.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/9" class="indent">Yorkshire and Humber Manufacturing Advisory Service (Y and H MAS)&mdash;based on a national scheme, where since 2002 advisers have worked with almost 2,500 manufacturers across the region to improve their processes and productivity, helped to secure 17,640 jobs and create 1,140 new jobs and made productivity improvements which have contributed to an overall increase in turnover of over &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/10" class="indent">The region's Graduate Retention Programme, which has been running for six years, funded by Yorkshire Forward in partnership with the region's universities, which aims to retain graduates from the universities and colleges of Yorkshire and Humber, as well as the attracting graduate talent from outside the region. This is critically important for business' ability to compete on a national and international stage.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/11" class="indent">Centres of Industrial Collaboration (CICs)&mdash;are funded by Yorkshire Forward. They aim to get knowledge within universities into companies in practical ways. Since their launch in 2003 they have collaborated with over 1,800 businesses and generated more than &pound;39 million of research income for the region.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/12">Leeds and the wider Leeds city region have benefited, as have all parts of the region, from these programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/13">Since 2005, a major new driver for encouraging enterprise in the neediest areas of the region is the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI). Yorkshire and Humber has five LEGI partnerships, led by the local authorities, working to ensure wider benefits of business growth spread to more deprived communities. They will be supported by &pound;128.6 million from the Government over five years. The five LEGI schemes cover Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Doncaster and North East Lincolnshire.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.10/14">The Leeds LEGI programme, entitled 'Sharing the Success' aims to address great imbalances in the local economy. Leeds has been awarded approximately &pound;20 million to deliver an enterprise programme targeted at tackling worklessness issues in its most deprived neighbourhoods. To date nearly 50 new businesses have started in the LEGI area, nearly 100 new jobs created and over 100 local residents found employment.</p>

	<p pid="d.28W.5/2">The ruling does not change the fact that local authorities can, under section 46 of the Environment Protection Act 1990, restrict the number of waste receptacles per household. However, section 46 requires the arrangements for receptacles to be reasonable and it is the authority's failure to comply with that requirement that led to the Ombudsman's investigation and subsequent ruling.</p>

	<p pid="d.32W.5/1">The waste oil directive requires member states to ensure the collection and correct management of waste oil and to take measures to give priority to the regeneration of waste oil above combustion. As a specific measure applying to waste oil, the waste oil directive takes precedence over the waste framework directive.</p>
	<p pid="d.32W.5/2">It is the view of the Government that the duty regime applicable to waste derived fuel oil from <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-01">1 November 2008</phrase> should have no adverse effects on the volume of waste oil collected, as correct management of hazardous waste is a legal requirement. Waste oil has a value and there will continue to be a demand for waste-derived fuel. A higher duty rate for waste-derived fuel could also encourage the provision of regeneration of waste oil in preference to combustion.</p>

As far as sustainable consumption is concerned, we have published a framework for pro-environmental behaviours which sets out a social marketing style approach to helping people move to more sustainable living. This includes core principles and approaches, headline behaviour goals, consumer insight, a segmentation model and an assessment of the implications for policy. The framework has been used, for example, to inform the development of the Government's Act on CO2 campaign.</p>

	<p pid="d.40W.5/1">The 24 hour, seven days a week operational nature of the Ministry's work in various sectors of the justice service necessitates a large number of our staff to regularly provide out of hours work. This flexible additional work is required in order to better protect the public and meet the needs of a modern service.</p>
	<p pid="d.40W.5/2">In line with good practice guidelines overtime is paid only with prior management authority to carry out specific work, which cannot be done within normal working hours. The majority of overtime paid in the Ministry of Justice relates to work done in Her Majesty's Prison Service. Within Her Majesty's Court Service examples of such work include provision of out of hours legal advice to judges on issues such as Emergency Protection Orders or Extradition matters, or the provision of Saturday court sittings. The Ministry of Justice is also responsible for overtime payments made to probation staff in the National Offender Management Service.</p>

This means that parents of a disabled child, like other associates of a disabled person, are protected by the directive from direct discrimination or harassment on the grounds of their child's disability.

	<p pid="d.52W.2/1">As a result of public concern about possible links between suicide and the internet, and in line with recommendations from the Byron Review and the Law Commission, we have considered whether the law in this area could usefully be clarified. As the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" name="Maria Eagle">the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle)</phrase> told Parliament in a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-17">17 September 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-09-17.142"><i> Official Report,</i> column 142WS</phrase>, we have concluded that the scope of the current law should not be changed but that the existing statutory language of section 2 of the Suicide Act should be simplified and modernised in a way which will make it clearer for everyone to understand.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.2/2">The number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts for offences relating to the Suicide Act 1961 S.2(l), 1978 to 2006 can be viewed in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.2/3">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="d.52W.2/4">Court proceedings data for 2007 will be available in November of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="d.53W.5/1">A summary of Youth Offending Teams national performance targets for the last five years, along with information on Torbay YOT's performance against these targets is shown.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/2" class="italic"> First-time entrants</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/3">These data are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/4" class="italic"> Final Warnings</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/5">The performance indicator for the years 2003-04,2004-05 and 2005-06 was to ensure that 80 per cent. of final warnings were supported by interventions. For the years 2006-07 and 2007-08 the target was raised to 100 per cent. but only applied to young people if their total asset score is greater than or equal to 12, there are any concerns of risk of serious harm to others or their total score is less than 12 but any sections score four. The required target was met by Torbay YOT in each of these years.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/6" class="italic"> Use of secure facilities</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/7">The secure remand performance indicator for years 2003-04, 2004-05,2005-06 and 2006-07 was to reduce the number of remands to the secure estate to no more than 30 per cent. of all remand episode decisions (excluding conditional and unconditional bail). In 2007-08 the new remand target was to reduce the number of remands to no more than 9 per cent. of all remand episode decisions (excluding unconditional bail). The target for custodial sentences was to reduce the number of custodial episodes to no more than 6 per cent. of all court disposals in years 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, and to no more than 5 per cent. in the years 2006-07 and 2007-08. The Torbay YOT has achieved the target for custodial sentences in all five years whereas the target for secure remands was met in 2005-06 only.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/8" class="italic"> Restorative justice</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/9">The performance indicator for 2007-08 was to ensure that victims participate in restorative processes in 25 per cent. of relevant disposals referred to the YOT. Prior to 2007-08 the indicator was to ensure that 75 per cent. of the victims of all youth crimes referred to YOTs are offered the opportunity to participate in a restorative process. In 2003-04 the indicator was to ensure restorative processes are used in 80 per cent. of disposals. The target was exceeded by the YOT in Torbay in all years except in 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/10" class="italic"> Victim Satisfaction</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/11">In 2003-04 the performance indicator was to ensure that, by the end of the year, 70 per cent. of victims who have been consulted or participated in restorative processes were either satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome. In years 2004-05 to 2006-07 the indicator was to ensure that 75 per cent. of victims participating in a restorative process were satisfied. In 2007/08 the target raised to 85 per cent. The indicator has been exceeded by the Torbay YOT in all five years.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/12" class="italic"> Parenting interventions</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/13">In 2007-08 the indicator was to ensure that for 20 per cent. of young people with Final Warnings with intervention, relevant community-based penalties, or DTO, their parent/carer(s) received a parenting intervention. Previously the target was 10 per cent. of young people with community-based penalties. Torbay YOT achieved the target in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/14" class="italic"> Parental Satisfaction</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/15">In 2003-04 the performance indicator was to ensure that 70 per cent. of parents completed parenting programmes (voluntary and statutory) and that, of those, at least 70 per cent. were satisfied or very satisfied&mdash;the target was met by Torbay. In years 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 the parental satisfaction indicator was to ensure that 75 per cent. of parents participating in parenting interventions are satisfied. The indicator was exceeded by Torbay YOT in each of those years.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/16" class="italic"> Parenting prevention</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/17">The performance indicator for 2007-08 was to ensure that for 20 per cent. of young people on prevention programmes, their parent/carer(s) receive a parenting intervention. The target has been successfully met by the Torbay YOT.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/18" class="italic"> Asset</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/19">The performance indicator was to ensure that Asset was completed for all (100 per cent.) young people subject to final warnings, relevant community based penalties and sentences.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/20">The required target was achieved by Torbay YOT in 2003/04,2004/05,2005/06 and has been narrowly missed in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/21" class="italic"> Pre-sentence reports</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/22">The performance indicator was to ensure that 90 per cent. of pre-sentence reports (PSR) prepared for courts were produced within the time scale prescribed by National Standards. The target has been narrowly missed in 2003-04 and achieved in all of the remaining years.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/23" class="italic"> Detention and Training Order</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/24">The performance indicator was to ensure that all (100 per cent.) initial training plans for young people subject to DTOs were developed within the time scales prescribed by national standards. The Torbay YOT met this indicator in 2003-04,2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/25" class="italic"> Education, training and employment</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/26">The performance indicator was to ensure that 90 per cent. of young offenders supervised by YOTs are in suitable full-time education, training or employment (ETE). The required target level has still not been met by the YOT in Torbay.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/27" class="italic"> Suitable accommodation</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/28">The performance indicator was to ensure that all (100 per cent.) young people completing community interventions, or on release from the secure estate, have suitable accommodation to go to. Torbay has narrowly missed this target in each of the years.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/29" class="italic"> Mental Health</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/30">The performance indicator was to ensure that all (100 per cent.) young people, who were assessed by Asset or the Mental Health Assessment Framework as manifesting:</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/31" class="indent">acute mental health difficulties, are referred by YOTs to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) for a formal assessment commencing within five working days of the receipt of referral, with a view to their accessing a tier 3 service or other appropriate CAMHS tier service based on this assessment</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/32" class="indent">non-acute mental health concerns are referred by the YOT for an assessment, and engagement by the appropriate CAMHS tier (1-3) commencing within 15 working days.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/33">The target on Acute Mental Health was achieved by Torbay YOT in 2003-04, 2005-06 and 2006-07. On non-acute mental health the target has been met in 2003-04 and 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/34" class="italic"> Substance Misuse</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/35">The performance indicator was to ensure all young people were screened for substance misuse, that those with identified needs receive appropriate specialist assessment within five working days and following the assessment, access the early intervention and treatment services they require within 10 working days. The target on the timeliness of the assessments has been achieved by Torbay YOT in 2006-07 and 2007-08. The target for the timeliness of the interventions has been met in each year since 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/36" class="italic"> Reoffending</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/37">In 2006-07 the performance indicator was to reduce the reoffending rate for the 2005 cohort after 12 months, when compared to the 2002 baseline, with the respect of the following four populations:</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/38" class="indent">pre-court</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/39" class="indent">first-tier penalties</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/40" class="indent">community penalties</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/41" class="indent">custodial penalties</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/42">Torbay YOT met the target and reduced the reoffending rate by 12.4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/43" class="italic"> Ethnicity</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/44">The performance indicator for 2006-07 and 2007-08 was to ensure that any significant difference between the ethnic composition of offenders on all pre-court and court disposals and the ethnic composition of the local community was reduced year on year. The indicator focuses on achieving a significant reduction (with a 90 per cent. confidence interval) in the disproportionally of the ethnic group most over-represented in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/45">Torbay YOT has not been scored on ethnicity as the overrepresentation in 2005-06 was not statistically significant.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/46">The following table shows performance against the targets/indicators.</p>

	<p pid="d.66W.11/1">National health service trusts in England self-report the number of accident and emergency (A&amp;E) services they provide against definitions provided by the Department on a quarterly basis. This includes type 3 services, which are A&amp;E services providing minor injury and illness services and include walk-in centres and minor injury units.</p>
	<p pid="d.66W.11/2">It is possible to provide numbers of type 3 services excluding walk-in centres. However, the remaining type 3 services may provide a range of minor injury and illness services, not simply a count of minor injury units.</p>
	<p pid="d.66W.11/3">Latest information shows that, for the quarter ending in June 2008, NHS trusts self-reported 214 type 3 A&amp;E services, excluding walk-in centres. For 2006-07 the figure was 220.</p>

There is no information provided for Jarrow because data are not collected for that geographical area. Information has been provided according to the age categories requested where possible. However, no age breakdown has been provided for South Tyneside PCT because the numbers involved are below five and need to be suppressed in order to maintain confidentiality.</p>

Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 3. Cause code&mdash;stab wounds<sup>(1)</sup>: The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. HES has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes when referring to stab wounds.<br/> Stab wounds<sup>(1)</sup>:<br/> W26&mdash;Contact with knife, sword or dagger.<br/> X99&mdash;Assault by sharp object.<br/> 4. Data quality: Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 6. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 7. Low numbers: Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk).<br/> 8. Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality: PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97,1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Sources</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care<br/> Primary Care Trust (PCT) and Strategic Health Authority (SHA) Population data<br/> 1997-2006 SHA Mid Year Estimates, 2001 Census based.

	<p pid="d.74W.0/1">The Department introduced a new working capital loans system in 2006-07. Instead of relying on brokerage as a source of funding or planned support, trust working capital requirements must now be financed by loans agreed with the Department and recorded in individual accounts. Organisations now have to address financial problems head-on and take steps to ensure that they live within their means. Deficits remain where they occur, and are transparent in final accounts at the year-end.</p>
	<p pid="d.74W.0/2">As a result of introducing the new loans system, there were 17 NHS trusts where the financial challenges are such that the Department either could not give a loan because the trust could not afford to meet the repayments, or where a loan was agreed, but the amount could be repaid only over a very extended timescale. Instead these trusts were advanced money as a short-term measure to cover their running costs while a rigorous review was conducted on their finances.</p>
	<p pid="d.74W.0/3">In the 2007/08 Quarter 4 edition of The Quarter (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), the Department announced that 10 of the original 17 trusts were no longer classified as financially challenged. This was a result of the trusts working extremely hard in conjunction with their strategic health authorities (SHA) and primary care trusts (PCT) to improve their underlying financial position. As a result they are now trading in balance and are able to produce sufficient surpluses going forward to operate as a sustainable organisation, both financially and in the provision of health care.

	<p pid="d.78W.0/1">Information about waiting times for physiotherapy is not collected centrally. It is for primary care trusts in partnership with local stakeholders, including practice-based commissioners, local government and the public to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and to commission services accordingly. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including access to physiotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="d.78W.0/2">The national health service has seen historical levels of investment and a period of expansion in the work force to improve services and reduce waiting times since 1997. The number of physiotherapists employed in the NHS has increased by 41 per cent. since 1997, from 14,243 to 20,146 in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.78W.0/3">In the White Paper, &quot;Our Health our care, our say&quot; (CM 6737) (copies of which are available in the Library), we set out the future direction for health care, including access to physiotherapy. We have collaborated with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy to pilot and evaluate self-referral to physiotherapy. The conclusions from these pilots will be included in a report to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="d.78W.0/4">Physiotherapy services are included in the 18-week patient pathway if their intervention forms part of a consultant-led pathway. The Allied Health Professions (AHP) Service Improvement Programme was undertaken to support AHP service improvement through information management. The outcomes of the programme are the Physiotherapy Pathway Improvement Tool and the Information Management Handbook for AHP Services. Both interactive documents build on good practice to provide guidance for benchmarking current practice, making improvements and monitoring progress. The tools are available on the 18 weeks website at:</p>

Copies of this publication are available in the Library. The clinical and service development workstream within TCS will focus on six clinical areas that will support the improvement of AHP services including physiotherapy for older and vulnerable people.</p>

The Tribunals Service at the Ministry of Justice has consulted on the Rules for the new Health, Education and Social Care Chamber, of which SENDIST will become a part, and the Tribunals Procedures Committee has amended the Rules in the light of consultation responses from those with an interest in SEN. SENDIST has also established a special user group, on which the parent-led Independent Panel for Special Education Advice (IPSEA) is represented, to advise it on what is practical and appropriate for users in the new arrangements. The overriding principle informing the drafting of the Rules has been that they must be able to deal with all cases justly and fairly.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.8/2">The Department for Children, Schools and Families, in association with the Tribunals Service, is currently conducting research into parental confidence in the SEN system of school provision, assessment, statements and appeal to SENDIST. This will reflect any parental concerns with the current operation of SENDIST. The Department has also commissioned Brian Lamb, the Chair of the Special Educational Consortium, to lead an inquiry into parental confidence in special educational provision, assessment and appeal. The Lamb Inquiry is due to report in September 2009. IPSEA is also represented on the Inquiry's Expert Advisers Group and through this and the Inquiry's Reference Group it will be able to hear whether the new arrangements for the tribunals are increasing parental confidence. The Department will continue to work closely with the Tribunals Service to address any concerns there are about the effect of the new tribunal arrangements on parental confidence in the SEN system.</p>

We are prepared to risk any impact the reduction in trade promotion activities may have on British business with Iran in order to maintain pressure on the Iranian regime over its nuclear programme. It is too early to judge the effect that these changes may have on our wider commercial relationship with Iran. We look forward to the day when we can return to business as usual, to the benefit of the UK and Iran. But a decision to reach that state rests with the Iranian regime. It is of note that trade between the UK and Iran fell by 8 per cent. over the first four months of this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.99W.6/1">The latest fully audited data that we have are for the 2006-07 academic year. Figures are not directly available for the North Staffordshire. Figures have been provided for the Staffordshire local authority.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.6/2">Apprenticeships are demand-led and employer responsive; therefore the number of apprenticeship places available is determined by the number of places employers are able to offer and subject to learner demand. That is why, in terms of monitoring performance, we focus on the number of people who actually start on an apprenticeship programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.6/3">&quot;World-class Apprenticeships&quot; confirmed our commitment to stimulate a greater supply of apprenticeship places with employers. This is a key element of the remit of the new National Apprenticeship Service and its National Vacancy Matching Service which will help employers advertise apprenticeship vacancies and enable prospective apprentices to apply for them online.</p>

My right hon. Friend told the House that the Higher Education Funding Council for England had identified 12 universities which held deposits with Icelandic banks that have recently entered into administration.

	<p pid="d.102W.5/2">Officials from HM Treasury are engaging with the affected universities and HEFCE about their concerns.

Certainly, no university faces a level of exposure that would raise questions about its continuing solvency.</p>

	<p pid="d.104W.0/1">This Government remain fully committed to widening access to higher education for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Widening access requires long-term investment and change across the higher education system. We have reformed student finance, reintroducing grants and raising the income threshold at which repayments start. No one is required to pay a contribution to their higher education up-front. These reforms, together with Aimhigher, have been instrumental in bringing about progress. The proportion of UK domiciled, young, full time, first degree entrants to English higher education institutions who were from lower socio-economic groups rose from 27.9 per cent. in 2002-03 to 29.8 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="d.104W.3/1">This Government are totally committed to widening participation in higher education (HE), both for economic reasons and reasons of social justice. HE offers significant earnings and other benefits to individuals and we want to see a broader range of people to be able and willing to take advantage of these benefits.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/2">There is convincing evidence that we are making steady progress, for example:</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/3" class="indent">(a)<i> </i>in the 1997-98 academic year, 81.0 per cent. of young (to age 21) full-time first degree entrants to HE came from state schools. By the 2006-7 academic year, this had</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/4" class="indent">risen to 87.2 per cent.&mdash;a rise of 6.2 per cent.;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/5" class="indent">(b) in the 2002-3 academic year, 27.9 per cent. of young (to age 21) full-time first degree entrants to HE came from lower socio-economic classes. By the 2006-7 academic year, this had risen to 29.8 per cent.&mdash;a rise of 1.9 per cent. A different method of identifying social class groupings was in place between 1997-98 and 2001-2, but this showed an increase of 0.8 per cent. over that period&mdash;from 24.7 per cent. to 25.5 per cent.;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/6" class="indent">(c) in the 1997-98 academic year, 11.4 per cent. of young (to age 21) full-time first degree entrants to HE came from low participation neighbourhoods. By the 2005-6 academic year this had risen to 13.5 per cent.&mdash;a rise of 2.1 per cent. A new way of identifying low participation neighbourhoods was introduced from 2006-7; and</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/7" class="indent">(d) in the 2002-3 academic year, 44.1 per cent. of 18-20 year olds from higher socio-economic classes participated in HE, compared with 17.5 per cent. of those from lower socio-economic classes&mdash;a gap of 26.5 per cent. By 2006-7, the participation rate of higher socio-economic classes had fallen to 39.5 per cent and that of lower socio-economic classes had risen to 19.0 per cent&mdash;reducing the gap by six percentage points to 20.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/8">But we are not complacent, it is clear that issues affecting HE participation patterns require long-term address. We continue to help and encourage a range of people to enter HE through for example</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/9" class="indent">(a) The Aimhigher programme, to raise the attainment levels of young people and their aspirations towards higher education;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/10" class="indent">(b) Aimhigher Associates, announced by the Secretary of State in April, from this autumn a pathfinder will see undergraduates mentoring pupils from Y9 onwards to support them and encourage them through key transition points and into HE, including with the UCAS application process. The scheme will roll out nationally in 2009; and</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/11" class="indent">(c) the HE recommendations to the National council for Educational Excellence&mdash;announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-03">3 October 2008</phrase>, these recommendations include: Primary schools should ensure older children have the opportunity to visit a university campus. Government support the recommendations and will work with the sector to Implement them.</p>

	<p pid="d.105W.2/1">We are introducing a number of measures aimed at increasing the level of innovation within small business. These include:</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/2" class="indent">Increased support for business innovation through the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) including funding for Knowledge Transfer Partnerships&mdash;which will double in number over the next three years&mdash;and support for UK engagement in the Eurostars scheme for research performing SMEs;</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/3" class="indent">Refocusing of the Small Business Research Initiative is making good progress.

	<p pid="d.105W.2/4" class="indent">Over the English regions, at least 500 businesses will be given an innovation voucher, as a means for smaller firms to collaborate with knowledge-based institutions, with the aspiration that this will increase to at least 1,000 per year by 2011 as the vouchers are demonstrated to be effective for business;</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/5" class="indent">The rate of tax relief under the SME R and D tax credits scheme was increased significantly from <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-01">1 August</phrase> to support and incentivise SMEs to undertake more R and D and the scheme was broadened to include companies with between 250 and 449 employees;</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/6" class="indent">DIUS's grant for research and development, delivered by RDAs, provides support of up to &pound;250,000 to help small and medium-sized businesses to research and develop technologically innovative products and processes and, between January and June 2008, 120 businesses were offered funding of &pound;10 million through the scheme; and</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/7" class="indent">The FE Specialisation and Innovation Fund will build the capacity of the FE sector to support businesses to raise their innovation potential through knowledge transfer and we are encouraging FE providers to showcase their expertise in implementing innovative business solutions, particularly for SMEs, through a number of pathfinder projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/8">In addition, we have also published a Higher Level Skills Strategy that provides an overall framework for driving up the high level skills that contribute to innovation in business. We are also encouraging more HEIs to develop and offer high level programmes for management and leadership as part of the new management and leadership funding for SMEs under the Train to Gain Plan for Growth.</p>

	<p pid="d.119W.5/1">ISAF helicopter support is provided from a multinational pool. The UK has provided Chinook, Sea King and Lynx helicopters in Afghanistan to undertake combat support roles and has also deployed Apache attack helicopters. The UK also makes use of a range of civilian helicopters through a NATO contract. While any helicopter could in extremis be used to support medical evacuation, Chinook and Sea King helicopters are primarily tasked for this specific purpose.</p>

	<p pid="d.120W.2/2">The Army Air Corps is currently in a very strong position with regard to manning. It continues to attract high quality volunteers for flying training from across the Army, including sufficient candidates for Attack Helicopter training. There are no plans to initiate recruitment activities beyond those measures currently in place.</p>
	<p pid="d.120W.2/3">The training our Attack Helicopter (AH) crews receive is world class. It takes a full year to make AH pilots ready for deployment on combat operations. The training schedule includes a pre-deployment training exercise to Arizona to experience 'hot and high' conditions and culminates in a mission rehearsal exercise alongside the deploying formation. In the Afghan theatre, force levels and the capabilities required are regularly reviewed and AH training is constantly scrutinised to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="d.120W.2/4">Retention of AH crews is currently being examined, as part of work recently commissioned by the Joint Helicopter Command. We are, however, confident that the operational commitments of the AH force are sustainable. The Apache continues to provide a battle winning capability in Afghanistan and we have increased the flying hours available to commanders on the ground by 15 per cent. since October 2006. We aim to increase flying hours by a further 25 per cent. by early next year, by deploying additional helicopters, and we are building the logistic support required in terms of spare parts and personnel, particularly engineering manpower, to enable this.</p>

	<p pid="d.120W.5/1">Pathogen inactivation (PI) is a process designed to eliminate pathogens&mdash;i.e. viruses, bacteria and fungi&mdash;from water, air or donated blood. The majority of the blood held in-theatre by the Defence Medical Services (DMS) is supplied by the UK National Blood Services (NBS), which does not routinely carry out PI on its blood products. However, we understand that the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO, an independent non-departmental public body) will be undertaking a comprehensive review of pathogen inactivation for blood products in 2009, which will inform decisions on its use in the UK. It would not be practical for the DMS to introduce its own discrete in-theatre PI capability, in view of the complexity of the current technology and the infrequency with which it would be required.</p>

Over that period, available records show that only one patient is known to have become infected with methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus Bacteraemia while being treated in a Birmingham hospital; 12 patients were infected with Clostridium difficile (including one patient diagnosed twice within a six-week period).

Armed forces presentation teams and careers advisers visit about 1,000 state and public schools across the UK each year, but only at the specific invitation of the schools/colleges themselves. Their aims are to raise the students' awareness of the armed forces in a democratic society, support schools' careers programmes, facilitate participative learning exercises with students, and offer advice on service careers. The teams do not go into schools to recruit.</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.5/2">We are proud of the work the single-service presentation teams do with schools and colleges to inform young people about the tremendous work undertaken and careers on offer in the armed forces and which can provide fantastic opportunities to a wide range of people from all sectors of society. Young people should be shown all available career options; the more information they receive about life in the Armed Forces, covering all points good and bad, the better informed they will be.</p>

These are then set against advertising expenditure to assess the cost effectiveness of the various media channels and tools used compared with each other, across government and with industry averages.</p>
	<p pid="d.130W.8/2">The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) undertakes two modest regional awareness campaigns each year to raise awareness of its services to veterans. As part of a wider campaign evaluation, a coupon is attached to each advertisement that readers can return. For the last two campaigns 19 and 101 coupons were returned respectively. Small 'feature' entries for SPVA are also included in all British Telecom phone books, but no realistic assessment is possible of these entries. In addition, a small number of ad-hoc advertising opportunities are exploited throughout the year in ex-service and commemorative magazines. These are low value and are not formally evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="d.130W.8/3">The Department also works closely with the Central Office of Information to develop a system which will provide clarity on the value for money of advertising campaigns in the future.</p>

This includes seven recommendations which relate to air-to-air refuelling (AAR), which are considered to be closed because AAR for the Nimrod has been prohibited.</p>

Many claims can now be made in one phone call with no forms to fill in and we are always looking at ways to make the application process simpler. We have a range of initiatives such as sophisticated data matching to ensure older people are aware of and take up their entitlements.</p>

	<p pid="d.144W.0/1">The main telephone numbers used by the Department for Work and Pensions are 0800 and 0845. The use of these 08 numbers allows the Department opportunities to reduce customer confusion by minimising the volume of contact numbers advertised to the extent the Department can control this to offer free calls or low cost calls to the majority of our customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.144W.0/2">For 0800 numbers, which are typically provided for our claim lines, the call is free for customers who use BT landline or public call box facilities. BT remains the service provider with the largest market share. Many other landline service providers do not charge for these calls, but this cannot be guaranteed by the Department as the contract is between the customer and his service provider and can be subject to change. Customers contacting us by their personal mobiles will be alerted that charges will apply if they proceed with the call and if the customer advises us that they are concerned about these charges we will call them back. Again the Department cannot control the charges made by mobile service providers.</p>
	<p pid="d.144W.0/3">For 0845 numbers BT customers pay a charge which is broadly the same as national call rates. Other service provider charges will vary and may be higher. Calls from mobiles are likely to be higher and again the Department will call customers back if they are concerned about the charges.</p>
	<p pid="d.144W.0/4">The Department is currently conducting a review of the issues associated with its numbers and the charges that apply to customers. However it recognises that the telecom market is constantly changing and any change the Department makes need to be sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="d.144W.0/5">The Department no longer receives any income from its use of telephone numbers used to access its services. Prior to December 2007 the Department did receive a rebate of &pound;500,000 per annum on 0845 calls and this was used to help provide free call services for customers.</p>

	<p pid="d.144W.6/1">Once entitlement to disability living allowance is established, the frequency of reassessment varies according to the individual circumstances of the case. For example, a claim may be reassessed if a customer reports a change in their circumstances, or information is received suggesting that there has been a change of circumstances since the original award of benefit was made. In addition, where a fixed period award is nearing its end point, the customer is invited to submit a new claim which is then assessed on the current evidence before a new decision is made on entitlement. Other claims may continue throughout the period of the award without being reassessed.</p>

	<p pid="d.145W.5/1">A holding reply was sent on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-13">13 October 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/2">A communication strategy to support the changes to the eligibility rules for income support affecting lone parents has been agreed by DWP Communications and policy officials and is currently being implemented.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/3">The strategy has a very clear focus on the need for timely and accurate communications to (1) customers affected by the changes, (2) Jobcentre Plus staff in roles impacted by the changes, and (3) external stakeholders involved in giving accurate advice to customers. We have ensured that all communications activities are properly co-ordinated, and fit with messages about the Government's wider agenda for increasing the number of people in paid work and reducing child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/4">Key objectives of the communications strategy are to ensure that the following audiences receive co-ordinated, timely and tailored messages, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/5" class="indent">Existing lone parent customers and those making new or repeat claims to income support&mdash;understand the changes and how they will be affected.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/6" class="indent">Advisers working with customers&mdash;know how the changes will impact on them and their lone parent customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/7" class="indent">Stakeholders external to Jobcentre Plus&mdash;are clear on these changes and the effect they will have upon them and their customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/8">To meet these objectives the strategy includes the following:</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/9" class="indent">Mailshots sent direct to specific lone parent customers, which outline the effect that the changes may have on them, including new requirements for quarterly attendance at work-focused interviews and how their claim to disability premium could be affected (where relevant).</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/10" class="indent">A further mailshot in November 2008 to lone parents affected, confirming that the changes have been approved by Parliament. This will be supported by local mailshots to offer voluntary interviews six weeks prior to the end of the lone parents' income support.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/11" class="indent">Providing lone parent customers with detail information factsheets that clearly outline the changes for them and the action they may need to take with the support of their adviser.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/12" class="indent">A leaflet and poster campaign to explain in visual format the steps each lone parent will take as the changes impact them.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/13" class="indent">Local 'Options and Choices' events for lone parents that explain the changes and offer advice and guidance in preparing for work (these have been in place since April 2008).</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/14" class="indent">Publication of details of the changes on both the DWP and Jobcentre Plus Internet sites.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/15" class="indent">A range of products available to Jobcentre Plus staff to ensure that they are able to deliver the correct messages to customers including briefings, desk aids, presentations, key messages, links to guidance and supporting articles in internal publications. This also includes road shows delivered to senior managers to ensure understanding of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/16" class="indent">Numerous presentations to key external stakeholders and close engagement with external lone parent voluntary groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.5/17">The same approach is proposed for introduction of Phase 2 of the changes in 2009 and Phase 3 in 2010. However, in spring 2009 we will evaluate the Phase 1 communications and feed these findings into communication plans for the next phases.</p>

	<p pid="d.147W.3/1">Since October 2002 carers aged 65 or over have been able to qualify for carer's allowance on the same basis as younger carers. The general principle is that if a claimant qualifies for more than one non-means-tested income replacement benefit the higher benefit is paid. Therefore, if a carer is receiving a state pension they would not be paid a carer's allowance unless their state pension was less than the rate of carer's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.3/2">Over 400,000 carers receive income-related benefits including income support, jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, council tax benefit and pension credit which are paid at a higher rate because they are entitled to carer's allowance. The higher rate is paid even if the carer satisfies the qualifying rules for carer's allowance but receives a state pension at a higher rate and as a result cannot be paid carer's allowance.</p>

	<p pid="d.147W.6/2">There is a statutory requirement to review all social security benefits each year and to increase certain benefits from April each year.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.6/3">The increases are calculated for most benefits using the annual inflation figure for the preceding September. This ensures that benefits keep their real value in broad terms, and any fluctuations throughout the year feed into this rate.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.6/4">In addition the Government continue to monitor the economic situation very closely.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.6/5">The Chancellor announced in his Budget 2008 speech that for winter 2008-09 an additional payment will be made alongside the winter fuel payment. Households with a member aged 60 to 79 will receive an additional &pound;50 and households with a member aged 80 or over will receive an additional &pound;100. This makes the winter fuel payment &pound;250 and &pound;400 respectively for winter 2008-09 which provides a significant contribution towards an older person's winter fuel bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.6/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September 2008</phrase> the Government announced a new &pound;1 billion package of measures to help people cut their energy bills. Measures on offer deliver significant energy savings including increased help with cavity wall and loft insulation. 11 million lower income and pensioner households are eligible for these free of charge. And for winter 2008-09 cold weather payments will increase in value from &pound;8.50 to &pound;25.00. Cold weather payments are made to vulnerable people in receipt of qualifying benefits, including pension credit, if there is a period of very cold weather in their area.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.6/7">Addressing pensioner poverty has been one of the Government's key priorities since 1997. The number of pensioners in relative poverty in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million in 1998-99 to 2.1 million in 2006-07. Once housing costs are accounted for, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.6/8">Pension credit, a key element of the strategy to tackle pensioner poverty, ensures no pensioner need live on less than &pound;124.05 for single people and &pound;189.35 for couples. It makes a difference to the income of millions of older people. Since pension credit was introduced in 2003 the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by around 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.147W.6/9">Non-cash benefits in kind make a real difference to the lives of millions of UK pensioners. These include free NHS prescriptions and eye tests for those over 60 and free TV licences for those over 75. People aged over 60 and disabled people living in England are entitled to free England-wide off-peak bus travel, and similar schemes are available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. British Citizens born before <phrase class="date" code="1929-09-02">2 September 1929</phrase> can apply for a free 10-year UK passport and from April 2009 local authorities will be able to offer free swimming to the over 60s, in a scheme jointly funded by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Department of Health and Department of Work and Pensions.</p>
