	<p pid=".1410W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Mr. Peter Luff, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-23">23 June 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the conclusion of Professors Oswald and Blanchflower on the stance of the Office of National Statistics on allowing access for researchers to check the Government's calculations relating to the Area Cost Adjustment. (177066),</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/4" class="indent">Professors Oswald and Blanchflower conclude that a decision has been made by ONS not to release micro-data from the New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in order to prevent researchers from checking the government's calculations of the Regional Funding Adjustment. No such decision has been made. On the contrary, ONS policy is to support statistical research in the academic community by supplying micro-data in as much detail as possible, within any legal constraints and with respect to the duty of confidence owed to survey respondents.</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/5" class="indent">Access to confidential NES micro-data is covered by legislation, including the Statistics of Trade Act (1947), and there is no provision to allow access for the research that Professors Oswald and Blanchflower would like to perform. Non-disclosive, fully anonymised NES micro-data is not covered by legislation can be provided to researchers on request. However, the measures taken to prevent disclosure include the removal of small area geographical indicators, which may make the data unsuitable for Professors Oswald and Blanchflower's purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/6" class="indent">ONS offers secondments to researchers working on behalf of ONS for purposes consistent with the aims of National Statistics and of benefit to ONS. As secondees to ONS, these researchers may use the ONS Business Data Linking research facility which holds identifiable, disclosive, disaggregated NES datasets. Professors Oswald and Blanchflower may wish to explore this option further and should contact Prabhat Vaze at ONS (telephone 020 7533 5905) for further information.</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/7" class="indent">The Labour Force Survey is voluntary, and not governed by legislation. However, information collected in the survey is confidential and subject to the common law duty of confidentiality and the Data Protection Act (1998). The obligation of confidentiality is reinforced by a pledge given to survey respondents, which states that no identifiable information they provide will be passed to any government department or member of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/8" class="indent">Non-disclosive, fully anonymised LFS micro-datasets are available at the UK Data Archive and are available to the academic research community. However, as for the NES, small area geographical indicators have been removed to prevent disclosure, which may make the data unsuitable for Professors Oswald and Blanchflower's purposes. The Business Data Linking research facility does not presently hold any LFS microdata.</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/9" class="indent">Supporting research is one of the aims of National Statistics, but data access arrangements are bound by the National Statistics Code of Practice and Protocols and by legal and professional constraints that may limit access to confidential data. Compliance with these statutory and common law duties does not constitute a decision to prevent researchers' access to data. It is critically important that these obligations are met, in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of official statistics and the security of the confidential data on which they are based. Failure to do so would undermine participation in future data collections, reducing the reliability and value of official statistics for all users.</p>
	<p pid=".1410W.2/10" class="indent">In comparison to National Statistics Institutes in other countries, ONS goes to great lengths to enable the use of its microdata for research purposes. We recognise that access to microdata by reputable researchers (within the legal and professional constraints discussed above) adds much to the value and trust of official statistics. It is therefore disappointing that my office's application of these constraints has been subject to criticism.</p>

	<p pid=".1413W.0/1">There are 354 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) in England and 22 Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) in Wales. These partnerships bring together a wide range of key agencies that are engaged in tackling crime and disorder, misuse of drugs and anti-social behaviour. Information from a variety of partnership sources including recorded crime statistics and other police and local authority data, is used to assess the impact of partnerships in reducing crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1413W.0/2">We are developing an integrated performance management framework for the crime reduction and misuse of drugs agendas which will allow us to agree with each Government Office in the regions (GO) and the Welsh Assembly clear targets for the performance of partnerships in their area, and hold them to account for local delivery. This will be underpinned by a targeted programme of work aimed at identifying and addressing the issues which community safety practitioners themselves tell us remain barriers to success.</p>

	<p pid=".1416W.2/2">We set up a Distraction Burglary Task Force in 2000 to gather data, publicise good practice and increase the awareness of the problem, particularly among vulnerable people. The Task Force includes representatives of the police, voluntary organisations, the utility companies, banks and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1416W.2/3">Many measures are now in place to prevent distraction burglary including in a number of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships where this crime has been identified as of local concern. These measures include improving the appearance and security of homes, sharing intelligence between all the involved agencies and educating people in crime reduction measures. In addition, from February to April 2004, the Home Office ran a publicity campaign to raise awareness of distraction burglary and to promote safe doorstep behaviour. Over 100,000 &quot;How to Beat the Bogus Caller&quot; leaflets were distributed, many regional and local newspapers published articles on local incidents and initiatives and over 30 local radio stations ran items about distraction burglary and how to combat it.</p>

	<p pid=".1418W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-18">18 June 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1418W.8/2">To support the &quot;top to bottom&quot; review of the immigration system called for by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary set up managed migration taskforces.</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.8/3">The taskforces work across the whole of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) and with other departments and stakeholders to identify and address any areas of abuse of managed migration routes, drawing on intelligence, the experience of front line staff and management information from across the system. In this way, the Department is building on what worked to reduce abuse of the asylum system, in a comprehensive monitoring and reporting framework. This will allow resources to be properly directed to target potential abuse even before problems arise.</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.8/4">Based on the work to date, we have already announced a number of steps to tackle abuses of the marriage, students and employment routes. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.8/5">To date the student taskforce has visited 401 colleges about which we had suspicions and applications to those institutions clearly found to be bogus are now being refused. A registration scheme is being established for genuine colleges and will be operational by the turn of the year. Once this has been done, student visas will not be issued in respect of colleges not on the register. We are discussing with the education sector how best to implement arrangements for notifying us of overseas students who fail to turn up for, or drop out of, a course.</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.8/6">To tackle the increasing problem of sham marriages being used to circumvent immigration controls, the Government are bringing forward legislation to establish powers to restrict the authorisation of marriages involving foreign nationals from outside the EEA to designated register offices and to introduce a pre-marriage eligibility requirement for such cases. IND officials have already formed a cross governmental joint working group made up of officials from the Offices of the Registrars General for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Department of Constitutional Affairs, the Church of England, LACORS, and registrars from across the UK. The Group is working on identifying strengths and weaknesses of current systems and will facilitate the introduction of the aforementioned designated centres.</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.8/7">Based on the analysis and recommendations of the employment and business taskforce, the Sectors Based Scheme quota has been cut for the year beginning <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-01">1 June 2004</phrase>. The Scheme has been reduced from a total of 20,000 to 6,000 in food processing and 9,000 in hospitality. The Government have also announced that the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme quota will be reduced in 2005 by 35 per cent. These cuts reflect the proportion of the previous year's quotas taken up by workers from the accession countries, who are now entitled to come and work in the United Kingdom under the worker's registration scheme. The taskforce is currently consulting on introducing country-specific quotas which will be dependent on countries having satisfactory returns agreements with the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".1424W.3/1">The Department's Market Transformation Programme, working closely with the DTI and in consultation with industry and other experts, has established a substantial evidence base on the energy consumption of appliances and equipment in use, including standby mode, and on the potential for improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.3/2">For TVs and set-top boxes, we have sought undertakings by manufacturers to reduce both &quot;on&quot; and &quot;stand-by&quot; power consumption. Following an EU industry commitment, we expect that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK will soon consume around 1 Watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&ndash;8 Watts consumed by older models. Furthermore, our commitment to more sustainable procurement requires any Government Department which purchases televisions to specify a stand-by power requirement of no more that 1 Watt.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.3/3">My Department has strongly supported the development of the EU voluntary Code of Conduct for set top boxes, which we estimate will already secure energy savings of about 3 Terawatt hours per annum by 2010. We are working via the EU and channels such as the IEA to further raise the profile of this policy issue. We are also working with the Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes and the Energy Saving Trust to explore the scope to use the Efficiency Recommended logo to encourage consumers to choose boxes which use the least energy. And, with DTI, we have agreed on minimum and best practice standards as part of the Government's policy on the switch over to digital TV services.</p>

	<p pid=".1425W.5/1">There are several types of external costs that are usually associated with energy activities, including impacts on noise, health, buildings, crops, ecosystems and global warming. The most important externalities of energy activity in the UK are attached to emissions to air, including emissions of CO2 and of local pollutants.</p>
	<p pid=".1425W.5/2">The DTI UK Energy Model is the most comprehensive source of forecasts of CO2 emissions from energy use. The UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI), which is funded by Defra and Devolved Administrations, annually compiles estimates of emissions to the atmosphere from UK sources such as cars, trucks, power stations and industrial plants. Estimates of emissions of pollutants to air are a fundamental input to the air quality modelling work that the Department carries out to assess ambient concentrations of important air pollutants and to estimate their health and other impacts.</p>
	<p pid=".1425W.5/3">Valuation of non-market impacts is a challenging but important element of appraisal, and should be attempted wherever feasible. However valuation techniques are constantly being refined and considerable uncertainty typically characterises monetary estimates of the marginal damage costs associated to emissions of various pollutants.</p>
	<p pid=".1425W.5/4">A Government Economic Service working paper 'Estimating the Social Cost of Carbon Emissions' suggested a range of illustrative estimate for the global damage cost of carbon emissions. These figures are currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental group on the social cost of carbon which is expected to report by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".1425W.5/5">The Department of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) advises on how to quantify the health impacts associated with changes in local pollutant emissions, including PM10, NOx, SO2 and ozone. Currently there is no UK agreed monetary value that can be used for the reduction in risk of deaths brought forward by air pollution due to a lack of empirical evidence in the field. However, Defra has recently published a study which attempts to generate a theoretical range of monetary values for health benefits and is considering the feasibility of recommending a range of values to monetise the health impacts associated with air pollution for use in policy appraisal.</p>
	<p pid=".1425W.5/6">The Government also follow with interest the work of ExternE, a major EU-funded research study on the external cost of energy.</p>

	<p pid=".1427W.5/1">The delivery plan for Sustainable Farming and Food (SFF) in the South West, &quot;Making a difference&quot;, was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-26">26 May</phrase> after extensive consultation. It has been drawn up by the stakeholders who will be responsible for implementing the actions detailed within it.</p>
	<p pid=".1427W.5/2">The delivery of the South West plan, as with all of the SFF regional delivery plans, will be facilitated by many public body and industry representatives and these organisations will work together with both resource and funding support to deliver the vision detailed in the plan. They are making use of Government grants, industry support and the resources of the Government Office and Regional Development Agency, as well as other Government bodies participating in the regional steering group. In particular, existing support programmes, including the England Rural Development Programme and the objective 1 agriculture programme in Cornwall, have been targeted to deliver the SFF plan; also the Regional Development Agency is making considerable resources available to support delivery of the plan. Given the number of public and industry bodies contributing to delivery of the plan, it is not possible precisely to quantify the level of support available to fund the plan.</p>

	<p pid=".1429W.0/31">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1429W.0/32">1. The financial data are taken from LEAs' Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1429W.0/33">2. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Brent LEA had 11 GM schools out of 13. The GM schools were not included in the 1998&ndash;99 data but were in 1999&ndash;00. If 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99 figures are adjusted to include funding and pupils, the figures become 3,019 for 1997&ndash;98 and 3,171 for 1998&ndash;99.</p>
	<p pid=".1429W.0/34">3. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10.</p>
	<p pid=".1429W.0/35">4. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".1429W.0/36">5. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary &amp; primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1429W.0/37">6. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1429W.0/38">7. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>

	<p pid=".1433W.3/1">The yellow card scheme is the United Kingdom system for collecting and monitoring information on suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The scheme is run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on behalf of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and currently depends on voluntary reporting of suspected ADRs by health professionals. The purpose of the scheme is to provide an early warning that the safety of a product may require further investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".1433W.3/2">Following an independent review of access to the yellow card scheme, it was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-04">4 May 2004</phrase> that the recommendation that patients should be able to report suspected adverse drug reactions directly to the CSM/MHRA had been accepted in principle.</p>
	<p pid=".1433W.3/3">The MHRA is currently developing proposals to pilot different arrangements for patient reporting to gauge effectiveness. The Licensing Authority will reach a decision on the proposals, taking into account the advice of the CSM.</p>

	<p pid=".1444W.6/1">Workstep was introduced in April 2001 to replace the former Supported Employment programme. Workstep provides support in jobs for disabled people who have more complex barriers to finding and keeping work but who, with the right support, can work effectively and develop in their job. Where it is appropriate, supported employees may also progress to unsupported employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1444W.6/2">The information on participants is not available in the format requested. Nationally, 1,800 people progressed into unsupported work in 2001&ndash;02; 2,144 in 2002&ndash;03 and 1,856 in 2003&ndash;04. Figures are currently not available below national level.</p>
	<p pid=".1444W.6/3">The Government allocated an additional &pound;37.2 million over three years 2001&ndash;04 to expand the programme and to support providers to modernise and develop their delivery. From this sum a Workstep Modernisation Fund of &pound;9.6 million was established in order to enable former Supported Employment Programme Providers to adapt quickly to the changes in the programme. Workstep providers in the London Region successfully submitted bids for modernisation funding totalling approximately &pound;0.5 million.</p>

	<p pid=".1457W.17/1">The UK is currently a net exporter of oil and oil products, and, largely due to geography, imports relatively little oil from OPEC countries. However, the UK is expected to become a net importer of oil by 2010 and the Government therefore recognise the need to take a longer term strategic international approach to energy security. This approach is outlined in the 2003 Energy White Paper, &quot;Our Energy Future&mdash;creating a low carbon economy&quot;, available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml</a>. The aim is not to reduce dependence on OPEC per se, but rather to promote more diverse sources of supply, fuel types and trading routes and to put in place policies that will help ease the economy away from power supplied primarily through fossil fuels as well as bringing about reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

	<p pid=".1461W.8/1">The Government do not intend to publish a single response to the Barker Review of Housing Supply in the UK. Kate Barker made a number of recommendations and, as my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated in an initial reaction to the report when it was published, the time scale for responding to each of these will vary. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister intend to announce our decision on new regional arrangements for planning by the end this year, following a consultation exercise to be launched next month, and have them in place by September 2005. Also in September 2005, we will publish a national housing market affordability goal, again, following consultation. Our aim will be to keep stakeholders fully informed as the work develops and to publish regular reports on overall progress.</p>
