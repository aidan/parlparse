	<p pid="e.7W.6/1">Like all other customers, people aged 50 and over can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work.</p>
	<p pid="e.7W.6/2">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme that provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment, including 320 people in Hartlepool. Once in work, New Deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.7W.6/3">People aged 50 and over, including those in Hartlepool, are also eligible for help from New Deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated in New Deal 25 plus are already required to attend the Gateway stage of the New Deal 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="e.7W.6/4">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the New Deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50 to 59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Hartlepool was not part of the pilot. However, interim pilot data has yielded positive results and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be commencing a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="e.7W.6/5">New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme for those who have been claiming benefits, including those claiming the pension credit, for six months. However, our Green Paper also announced our intention to pilot mandatory participation in New Deal 50 plus activities for people aged 50 to 59 who have been claiming JSA for six months. This will involve attendance at work-focused interviews and the development of action plans to help participants move into employment. Pilot locations have not yet been confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="e.7W.6/6">In spring 2005 there were 3 million people claiming incapacity benefits in Great Britain, of whom 1.3 million were aged 50 or over. As nearly half of all benefit claimants aged 50 or over are on IB, they will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a &quot;Choices Package&quot; of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis. Pathways has already begun helping people in the Hartlepool area, having rolled out there last year.</p>
	<p pid="e.7W.6/7">Our Age Positive campaign works with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the 'Be Ready' national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.9W.6/1">Like all other customers, people aged 50 and over can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work.</p>
	<p pid="e.9W.6/2">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme that provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment, including 240 people in Denton and Reddish. Once in work, New Deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.9W.6/3">People aged 50 and over, including those in Denton and Reddish, are also eligible for help from New Deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated on New Deal 25 plus are already required to attend the Gateway stage of the New Deal 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="e.9W.6/4">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the New Deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Denton and Reddish was not part of the pilot; however, interim pilot data has yielded positive results and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be commencing a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="e.9W.6/5">New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme for those who have been claiming benefits, including those claiming the pension credit, for six months. However, our Green Paper also announced our intention to pilot mandatory participation in New Deal 50 plus activities for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for six months. This will involve attendance at work-focused interviews and the development of action plans to help participants move into employment. Pilot locations have not yet been confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="e.9W.6/6">In spring 2005 there were 3 million people claiming incapacity benefits in Great Britain, of whom 1.3 million were aged 50 or over. As nearly half of all benefit claimants aged 50 or over are on IB, they will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a 'Choices Package' of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis. Pathways is due to roll out in the Denton and Reddish area in the future.</p>
	<p pid="e.9W.6/7">Our Age Positive Campaign works with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the 'Be Ready' national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.11W.0/1">We continue to keep work incentives in both benefits under review. For example, since April 2004 a move into work has no longer required a fresh claim for either housing benefit or council tax benefit for the vast majority of people. Also, from April 2004 the extended payment scheme in housing benefit and council tax benefit has been widened to include people moving off incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance because they are starting work.</p>
	<p pid="e.11W.0/2">As outlined in the Green Paper &quot;A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work&quot; published in February, we propose to roll out the new local housing allowance to tenants in the private rented sector. The local housing allowance would be a major simplification of the housing benefit system which would make it easier for people to understand what in-work support they could receive. Our proposal to pay the local housing allowance directly to tenants, rather than to landlords, is also designed to promote financial inclusion and, where appropriate, help tenants develop financial and budgeting skills as they move towards work.</p>

	<p pid="e.14W.5/1">Since November 2004, the Department has taken forward a wide-ranging assessment to investigate how best to support the improvement of child and adult immunisation services through commissioning including:</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/2" class="indent">an examination of the systems and commissioning routes needed to improve access and increase low uptake; and</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/3" class="indent">a review of the way services could deliver more effectively for the people currently missing out.</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/4">Primary care trusts' (PCTs) experience of the new commissioning routes for immunisation is still growing and there is an opportunity to share good practice on planning and service delivery using these mechanisms. In support of this, the Department has:</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/5" class="indent">prepared guidance for the wave two national purchasing pilots of alternative providers for immunisation services (referred to as the alternative personal medical services (ARMS) wave two pilots);</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/6" class="indent">developed a series of targets for local use as part of the Better Metrics project in conjunction with the London Health Observatory to allow service managers to monitor the performance of services targeted at deprived or disadvantaged groups;</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/7" class="indent">held two national events with national health service primary care contracting to share good practice and facilitate learning networks; and</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/8" class="indent">in the recent White Paper, announced measures to free up the target payment funds and allow them to be carried across into other contract forms. It also highlighted a recent example of a nurse-led personal medical services that successfully increase immunisation uptake rates among poor and deprived groups who were planning to apply for ARMS status.</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/9">The Department is working in partnership across policy teams, NHS employers, other Government Departments (including the Department for Education and Skills, Social Exclusion Unit and Neighbourhood Renewal Unit) and a range of NHS implementing agencies in order to improve childhood immunisation take up for families. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/10" class="indent">continue collaboration with our stakeholder to examine the systems and commissioning routes that have worked to improve access and increase low uptake;</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/11" class="indent">requiring the Health Protection Agency to promote the benefit of opportunistic immunisation, in order to reach disadvantaged groups more effectively;</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/12" class="indent">continue to deliver a series of reports and seminars and generate concrete recommendations for PCTs and commissioners; and</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.5/13" class="indent">issued joint guidance with neighbourhood renewal unit on local partnerships that led to a number of PCTs and councils to submit and secure a local area agreement for immunisation among disadvantaged groups.</p>

	<p pid="e.15W.8/1">In 2003, the Department announced &pound;8.5 million central funding to stimulate improvements in care and access to treatment and to ensure the long-term continuing provision of services for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) across England. This resulted in the development of 13 clinical network co-ordinating centres and 36 local multi-disciplinary teams, as well as 11 specialist children and young people teams to support the development of multi-disciplinary CFS/ME services in their designated area.</p>
	<p pid="e.15W.8/2">Funding of these services from 2006-07 is included within the resource allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs), to facilitate the continuation of services following the end of the ring-fenced period of funding.

	<p pid="e.15W.8/3">National health service organisations are expected to demonstrate that they are making progress towards achieving the level of service quality described in the national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions. The NSF sets out a clear vision of how health and social care organisations can improve the quality of care, consistency and responsiveness of their services and help improve the lives of people with neurological conditions, including CFS/ME. The Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection can undertake performance reviews to assess progress on local implementation of the NSF.</p>

	<p pid="e.18W.8/1">It is for councils to decide how to set charges for non-residential social services. The legal basis is that charges generally should be 'reasonable' and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can. The position contrasts with that on charges for residential care, where regulations prescribe a national means test, which councils must follow.</p>
	<p pid="e.18W.8/2">The Department of Health issued statutory guidance, &quot;Fairer Charging Policies for Home Care and other Non-residential Social Services&mdash;Guidance for Councils with Social Services Responsibilities&quot;, which is available in the Library, to all local councils in November 2001. It was amended in September 2003 to reflect the introduction of pension credits. It does not seek to change councils' power to charge, or not, for these services.</p>
	<p pid="e.18W.8/3">The guidance aims to ensure in particular that service users on low incomes are protected from charging and that any charges levied on disability benefits are subject to an assessment of disability costs, to ensure their reasonableness. Councils are required to ensure that charges do not put any users' incomes below basic income support levels or the guarantee credit of pension credit, plus a buffer of 25 per cent. This can lead to real improvements in the position of many users, who will cease to pay charges or pay a smaller charge.</p>

We understand that there has been concern that plasma imported from the United States may have carried a higher risk of transmitting hepatitis C. However, knowledge of the viral risks associated with both domestically produced and imported blood products evolved over time.</p>
	<p pid="e.23W.11/2">Blood products contain plasma pooled from many thousands of donors, and only one donation needs to carry the virus to infect the whole batch. Regardless of the source, or of the manufacturer of the plasma used, all products were potentially contaminated with the hepatitis C virus as a result of the need for pooling and the prevalence of the virus in blood donor populations around the world.</p>

	<p pid="e.37W.0/15">Article 21 of the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006 provides that the Secretary of State for Defence may defray necessary expenses in respect of the medical, surgical or rehabilitative treatment of a former member of the armed forces which arise from a disablement due to service, provided they are not provided for under other UK legislation. Under this discretionary power, MOD defrays the individual costs of war pensioners undergoing &quot;remedial treatment&quot; at the Combat Stress homes for conditions related to their individual pensioned disablement and of related expenses, such as travel costs.

	<p pid="e.39W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-11">11 January 2005</phrase>, the then Secretary of State announced to the House that he had commissioned a comprehensive review of the Terms and Conditions of Service under which Gurkhas serve in the British Army.</p>
	<p pid="e.39W.8/2">As part of this review, the Department is looking at the pension position of Gurkhas back to <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> Gurkhas were members of an overseas-based force and had no comparable British soldier equivalents. Gurkha soldiers are members of the Gurkha pension scheme which does not provide for preserved pensions; there are therefore no Gurkha widows who would be eligible. The Department does not hold records of individuals (or of their widows) who do not have an entitlement to a pension, so cannot make reliable estimates of either the numbers involved or the cost of hypothetical pension entitlements.</p>
	<p pid="e.39W.8/3">However there are currently 26,699 Gurkha service pensioners (of which 1,900 have retired since <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>) and the Gurkha Welfare Trust has reported that last year it paid 10,246 welfare pensions. Of the 26,699, there are about 5,000 Gurkha widows' or family dependants' pensions in payment.</p>

	<p pid="e.42W.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) rolled out Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) to all 48,000 RAF service personnel throughout the world on time and on budget. The event marked the culmination of five years of system design, development, integration and testing and bears testimony to a very strong partnering agreement between MOD and EDS. The total cost to date of JPA is &pound;116 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.42W.9/2">The suitability of JPA was considered in July 2004 by the Defence Investment Approvals Board in approving the Main Gate Business Case. Prior to rollout, the readiness for service was assessed by an independent Office of Government Commerce Gateway review.</p>
	<p pid="e.42W.9/3">On JPA rollout to the RAF there were a small number of technical issues which had not manifested themselves in the extensive testing carried out prior to its launch. This resulted in the system operating much more slowly than anticipated which greatly restricted the number of self-service users at any one time. Over the course of the last six weeks these early problems have been overcome and all users now have full access to the system. JPA has performed satisfactorily on rollout to RAF professional HR administrators and has delivered pay to the RAF with only a relatively few discrepancies caused by the migration of data from the legacy systems to JPA. Although the first few weeks following rollout have generated a significant number of enquiries, no formal complaints have been received.</p>
	<p pid="e.42W.9/4">Following RAF rollout, the related provisional JPA dates for the RN and Army were June and November 2006 respectively. However, in order to more closely align JPA with Defence Information Infrastructure (Future) programme requirements, current plans are that JPA will be rolled out to the RN from October 2006 and to the Army from March 2007 respectively.</p>

From <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June 2006</phrase>, guidance will be included on the Defence Intranet to encourage staff to consider healthy choices in relation to lifestyle and diet.

MOD restaurants also provide healthy choices.</p>
	<p pid="e.50W.2/3">Health is vital to operational effectiveness and the armed forces have always had policies for health promotion. A Health Promotion Action Plan was published last year prior to the production of the Choosing Health White Paper covering issues such as diet, tobacco and alcohol consumption and sexual health. There is an expert panel on armed forces feeding which advises on diet and has published &quot;Recruits' and Commanders' Guides to Nutrition&quot;. These offer advice on diets and eating patterns which are compatible with military requirements and health.</p>

	<p pid="e.51W.2/1">Encouraging staff to share vehicles when travelling to work is dependent on the circumstances of each site. For example, at Abbey Wood in Bristol, there is a scheme offering 300 car-sharing priority parking spaces. There are also informal schemes established on an individual basis. The Royal Navy also encourages the practice through its intranet sites with schemes in place at Royal Navy Fleet HQ, and at Portsmouth and Devonport Naval Bases.</p>
	<p pid="e.51W.2/2">Vehicle-sharing is one of a number of measures that the Ministry of Defence encourages as part of its work on sustainable development and travel. These include the use of both telephone- and video-conference facilities for business meetings, and offering staff a pay advance to purchase bicycles and public transport season tickets for commuting to their place of work.</p>

	<p pid="e.58W.6/1">The cost of calls to the new 101 single non-emergency number has been set at 10p per call following consultation with a wide group of stakeholders and research with the public. The research showed that a small fixed charge would not put people off calling the service but would reduce the likelihood of the service being abused. The Government, police and local authorities will not profit in any way from the 10p fixed charge for calls to the single non-emergency number. The charge will be retained by telecom providers to offset the substantial cost of carrying calls.</p>
	<p pid="e.58W.6/2">This fixed rate charge compares favourably with existing police and local authority non-emergency numbers many of which are charged at 0845 call rates which can cost as much as 10p per minute or more. Calls to 101 will be 10p per call regardless of length which means that callers are protected against additional cost if their call is longer and more complex.</p>
	<p pid="e.58W.6/3">The tariff will be reviewed once the service is in operation and has been evaluated with the aim of making it free to call the number in the future.</p>

	<p pid="e.67W.2/1">Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 is the primary measure for combating illegal working. It provides employers with a statutory defence from conviction if they check and record certain specified documents belonging to potential employees. To support employers in meeting their responsibilities under section 8, IND produced short (summary) guidance which was distributed widely among other Government Departments and agencies. If further guidance on this legislation is required, the booklet refers the reader to the immigration and nationality directorate website where comprehensive guidance is available, and there is also a reference to the Employers' Helpline which offers a dedicated service for employers by advising on the legislation on preventing illegal migrant working. The Employers' Helpline also disseminates hard copies of the comprehensive guidance on request. The comprehensive guidance makes clear that this legislation covers contracted and sub-contracted employment.</p>

	<p pid="e.72W.2/1">The responsibility for ensuring that the nutritional standards are being met will rest with either the local authority or the school governing body, depending on the model of provision. Ofsted are already inspecting schools' general approach to healthy eating as part of the new inspection framework for schools. They have also already carried out, alongside nutritionists, a pilot thematic study in three local authorities, looking at the standard of food provided in a sample of schools. A further larger-scale thematic study is planned for next year.</p>
	<p pid="e.72W.2/2">We have published a full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which considers the financial impact that the new nutritional standards will have. In compiling the RIA, account was taken of the report written for the School Meals Review Panel (SMRP) by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the costs of implementing the Caroline Walker Trust's recommendations, which are closely mirrored by the recommendations of the SMRP.</p>

	<p pid="e.74W.2/1">The Learning and Skills Council was established in 2001 to replace the 72 Training and Enterprise Councils and the Further Education Funding Council.

These savings have been realised and a significant proportion has been reinvested in better training in local areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.74W.2/2">Building on this, the Learning and Skills Council is currently undertaking a second major restructuring exercise which will further streamline the organisation and strengthen its capacity to work strategically with partners at local and regional level.

TECs, which were independent local companies, will also have incurred some local costs connected with the ending of the TEC network, but we do not have details of the amounts involved. Although the majority of TECs have now been formally wound up, there will be some additional costs involved in winding up those remaining.

Our expectation is that local authorities will use the expertise of Regional Broadband Consortia to make best use of the funding (for example, through aggregated procurement) and to make sure that schools' needs are met effectively. Guidance has been made available to local authorities and schools to allow them to plan and meet their requirements in time to meet the 2008 personal online space target. Becta is procuring a national framework (with preferred suppliers), which will help purchasers to select appropriate learning platforms. This framework will be available to all educational institutions from January 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.75W.2/1">I do not have a tally of the number of complaints which the Department has received about private finance initiative contracts, but I will write shortly to the hon. Lady with this information. We have been working consistently to improve the delivery of operational private finance initiative contracts in response to problems that have been brought to our attention. We have, for instance, provided additional support directly and through Partnerships UK for those schools and authorities which had contracts with Jarvis plc., and where there were undoubtedly exceptional problems because of the financial difficulties of that firm.</p>
	<p pid="e.75W.2/2">Ensuring satisfactory delivery of the services included in a private finance initiative contract is the responsibility of the authority which is signatory to the contract. However, the Department is always happy to advise and support where there are individual problems that cannot be resolved locally. It also continues to work with Her Majesty's Treasury and with other Departments to improve the delivery of public services through private finance initiatives. This is done by a process of continuous improvement of the contracts, and also by providing additional support through the recently formed Operational Task Force. This will support and intervene on wider structural issues like benchmarking, market testing, payment mechanisms and variations.</p>

	<p pid="e.78W.5/1">Student loans are collected by employers alongside income tax and national insurance contributions and passed to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. At the end of each financial year, HMRC reconciles the loan repayments and passes the information to the Student Loans Company which updates borrowers' accounts.

	<p pid="e.88W.3/2">The 'Government strategic framework for the sustainable control of bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain', published in March 2005, sets out our commitment to work in partnership with our stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, vets, wildlife groups and conservation groups, in developing policies on bovine tuberculosis (bTB).</p>
	<p pid="e.88W.3/3">We worked closely with stakeholder groups in developing the Strategic Framework itself, and in developing our policy for pre-movement testing in England. Between December 2005 and March 2006 we consulted on the principle and method of badger culling in high incidence areas of England, and held a number of citizens' panels to provide further information to feed into the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="e.88W.3/4">On <phrase class="date" code="">6 March</phrase> we held our first annual bTB meeting for Great Britain, which allowed a two-way exchange of information between the Government and our stakeholders on the latest bTB developments and provided opportunities for constructive discussion. In addition, we are in the process of setting up a new national bTB stakeholder body to advise on the development and delivery of new bTB policies.</p>

	<p pid="e.89W.5/2">The objective of the current trial is to assess whether a specially designed body snare for badgers is an effective and humane method of restraint. The body snare is intended to be non-lethal and the purpose of the proposed trials is to assess the snare. The study will follow the principles laid down in the draft EU Directive on Humane Trapping Standards whereby the humaneness of a trapping device is first assessed under controlled conditions in pen trials before, if its humaneness is deemed to be acceptable, field trials of the device are conducted to confirm its humaneness and to assess its efficacy and non-target risks. The aim is to release all captured badgers taken during the trial back into the wild unharmed.</p>

	<p pid="e.91W.6/1">The Environment Agency started to monitor for perfluorooctance sulfonate (PFOS) in the vicinity of the site following the fire in order to give a better understanding of the impact of the incident on the environment.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.6/2">The agency has been closely monitoring the River Ver, and have detected low levels of PFOS in the river both during and after the Buncefield incident. No evidence to date has been observed of any impact on fish or other wildlife in the river as a result of this contaminant.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.6/3">Water samples have been taken from the network of groundwater boreholes both on the Buncefield site and in the surrounding area. These samples have also shown evidence of the presence of PFOS mainly at low levels or below the limit of detection. Two samples however showed elevated levels of PFOS at 4.5 and 5.9 micrograms/litre. Repeat testing of the sample giving the higher result, showed a much lower level of 0.20 micrograms/litre.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.6/4">The latest results of this groundwater monitoring were the subject of an Environment Agency press release on <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 12 May</phrase>. Details can be found on the agency website at: <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/1387272">http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/1387272</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.6/5">The agency has instigated a significant programme of work to further monitor the presence and extent of PFOS in both surface and ground waters in the environment around Buncefield. This programme will also look at background levels of PFOS in the wider environment in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.6/6">The Environment Agency will continue to make public its findings as they emerge.</p>

	<p pid="e.94W.6/1">Section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 allows a person with a complaint of statutory nuisance, for example, noise, smell or smoke, to take private action through the magistrates court. If the court agrees that a statutory nuisance exists and/or is likely to recur, it will issue an abatement notice on the person responsible for the nuisance, requiring that the nuisance be ceased or abated within a specified timescale. It may, but does not have to, specify the steps to be taken. Anyone causing a statutory nuisance could also be liable to a fine.</p>
	<p pid="e.94W.6/2">The statutory nuisance provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 have been amended by measures implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which introduce insects, and artificial light, to the list of potential statutory nuisances. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 also introduces an optional seven-day deferral for serving of an abatement notice for statutory nuisance from noise in order to pursue alternative steps before formal action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="e.94W.6/3">The Government work as a matter of course with stakeholders and, on statutory nuisance from noise in particular, we will be seeking stakeholder views on the Noise Strategy, which will be the subject of full public consultation early in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.94W.6/4">A large number of amendments have been made to the 1990 Environmental Protection Act and the cost of collating a list would be disproportionate. As there is no central record of representations received by the Department that would enable officials to identify those about the operation of the whole Act, it would also incur disproportionate cost to do so.</p>

	<p pid="e.98W.0/1">The Marine Fisheries Agency, along with other fisheries administrations in the UK, operates systems as required by EU legislation to monitor and control the activity of UK fishing vessels to ensure quotas allocated to the UK are not exceeded. This involves maintaining dedicated systems for the collection and collation of information from vessel logbooks and landing declarations, as well as information from sales notes from registered buyers and sellers of fish. The information from UK systems is collated to produce reports on the level of uptake of quotas that are updated on a daily or weekly basis as appropriate. These reports are used by fisheries administrations, producer organisations and other groups in the UK to manage the individual quota allocations during each year. Monthly reports are provided to the European Commission, with measures also in place to check and validate information received by the Commission from other member states on landings by UK vessels outside the UK. The agency takes management action, as necessary, to control or close activity in particular fisheries to ensure quotas limits are complied with.</p>
	<p pid="e.98W.0/2">The risk weightings relate to enforcement of sea fisheries legislation. The Marine Fisheries Agency aims to deploy 60 per cent. of its inspection and enforcement resources to high risk fisheries, 30 per cent. to medium risk and 10 per cent. to low risk. The specific risk weightings take account of a number of factors, including the nature of the fishery, the area and the type of fishing activity. For instance, we would consider vessels fishing in an area and for a species for which specific recovery measures have been introduced to be classified as 'high risk'. The agency is developing a computer model to assist in analysing a wide range of factors to determine compliance risks in fisheries for the medium to long term so that its resources can be deployed and utilised to best effect.</p>

	<p pid="e.104W.2/19">No funds have been withdrawn from the south west region's allocation.</p>
	<p pid="e.104W.2/20">Under the EU regulations supporting the rural enterprise scheme, 50 per cent. of funding comes from the European Union. These European funds are allocated on an annual basis and it is generally not possible to transfer any unspent EU funds to a later financial year. This scheme, therefore, requires close and careful financial management. To this end, each region is given an annual budget within which it must manage the grant awards it has made. This will include any delays to project expenditure and therefore delays to claims, as well as any under or over-claims by beneficiaries.</p>
	<p pid="e.104W.2/21">The performance of approved projects is subject to continuous review to establish the true value of any 'headroom' in annual budgets. For 2006-07, a detailed exercise is in place to ensure that budgets are used to the maximum extent possible. In this regard, it is expected that some additional monies will be identified as available to support new grant awards before the closure of the scheme at the end of June. The precise value of funds available for grant awards will be confirmed by mid-June.</p>
	<p pid="e.104W.2/22">There will continue to be significant competition for the remaining funds; the Rural Development Service will continue to manage the position carefully in 2006-07, with a view to the possible redirection of funds between regions where regional interest in the scheme is genuinely lower than anticipated.</p>

	<p pid="e.106W.3/1">The Rural Payment Agency's (RPA) Customer Service Centre (CSC) provides an inquiry response facility and, outside business hours, a recorded messaging service, referring customers to RPA's website. As such the CSC seeks to answer inquiries as they are made. A proportion of the inquiries that are answered require a follow up response from a CSC operator or a member of RPA's processing staff. Moreover, RPA provides an electronic ordering facility for those customers seeking to acquire an application form or other scheme literature.</p>
	<p pid="e.106W.3/2">RPA launched a CSC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-14">14 February 2005</phrase>. This was done to streamline single payment scheme and customer registration telephone inquiries into the Agency through one route, to allow staff to concentrate on processing. More importantly, this system aims to ensure that customers receive consistent answers and that any more complex inquiries can be directed to specialist areas of the business to call the customer back.</p>
	<p pid="e.106W.3/3">The main call centre is based in Workington with facilities for calls to be diverted to staff at other RPA sites during periods of unusually high demand.</p>

Small businesses across the value chain, in a wide variety of sectors and throughout the nations and regions, have much to gain from the commercial opportunities arising from the Games. The Government are determined to maximise those opportunities both for SMEs and British business as a whole. All the Olympic partners and stakeholders are working together to identify the best model to achieve this, taking into account best practice from previous host cities.</p>

	<p pid="e.126W.2/2">As stated in the White Paper, the Government believe that one of the overriding duties of the Trust should be the effective stewardship of the licence fee on behalf of licence fee payers: making sure that it is spent with maximum effectiveness and efficiency and always providing value for money. It will be part of the Trust's role to secure and demonstrate continuing improvements in the BBC's efficiency, increasing the return provided by its commercial services and bearing down on the costs of proposed investments. The Government also welcome the proposal of the current Chairman of the BBC that the Trust should ask the NAO to consider the extent to which future &quot;self-help&quot; targets are being met and that the results of this work will also be reported to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="e.126W.5/2">The Government are currently conducting a funding review to determine the level of the licence fee to apply from April 2007. As part of this process the BBC has submitted an assessment of its future funding needs. That assessment made clear that projected costs in some areas would be subject to revision. The BBC has undertaken to make revisions to its assessment available to the Government as work progresses. The Government will announce the details of the settlement in due course.</p>

	<p pid="e.126W.8/1">The new governance structure is designed to strengthen the BBC's independence from Government and will be reinforced by very clear separation between the Trust and the Executive Board. This clear separation will be achieved through the distinct and different roles of the Trust and Executive Board. The Trust's overarching responsibility will be to represent the interests of the licence fee payer. The new system will also deliver effective oversight of the Executive Board's activities by the Trust, in the public interest; at the same time, it will prevent micro-management of the executive Board's activities by the Trust in a way that would distract from the Trust's strategic role.</p>

	<p pid="e.135W.12/1">The Government believe that society lotteries and the National Lottery can co-exist happily. Both types of lottery play an important role in raising money for good causes, and it is our policy to ensure that appropriate and proportionate regulation applies in each case. Society lotteries are required to abide by strict limits on proceeds and prizes, currently up to &pound;2 million and &pound;200,000 respectively in any single lottery. We are supporting the work of society lotteries by introducing a range of deregulatory measures through the Gambling Act 2005, and by strengthening the protection for society lotteries from illegal lotteries that purport to be prize competitions in certain media outlets. The National Lottery continues to be regulated under separate legislation.</p>

This funding, which will help ensure that we capitalise on the explosion of interest in cricket among our young people following last summer's Ashes series, was matched by a donation from the England and Wales Cricket Trust.</p>

This is to develop a programme of work examining how farm plastic waste can best be collected and recovered within the formal structure of a producer responsibility scheme. Producer responsibility regulations are already in place for producers placing packaging on the market. It is likely that any new collection scheme will be set up to collect both packaging and non-packaging farm plastics.</p>

	<p pid="e.147W.0/1">Culling efficiency in the proactive trial areas is calculated by taking the proportion of the badger population that is available to be trapped within the whole trial area (the trapping efficacy) and correcting this to reflect the degree of landowner consent.</p>
	<p pid="e.147W.0/2">At the time of publishing the consultation document, &quot;Controlling the Spread of Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle in High Incidence Areas in England: Badger Culling&quot;, experts at the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) estimated the culling efficiency within the proactive areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) to have been 20 to 60 per cent. during the initial proactive culling operations. This figure was based on a trapping efficacy of 50 to 80 per cent. and landowner consent of 43 to 82 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.147W.0/3">The Independent Scientific Group (ISG) on cattle TB believe the trapping efficiency may be greater than the 20 to 60 per cent. estimate. I have asked CSL to carry out further analysis on both these estimates, using the latest data from the RBCT. Variations in trapping efficiency will reflect the season, the weather, the differing amount of non-consent land within each proactive removal area, and trap interference. The approach and results from the revised estimates will be discussed with the ISG.</p>
	<p pid="e.147W.0/4">At the end of the trial, following the completion of all culling, the relative density of badgers in the proactive and survey only areas was assessed using a technique known as distance sampling. This found that there was an average difference of 58 per cent. (range 26 to 93 per cent.) in the relative density of badgers in the proactive and survey only areas at the end of the proactive treatments.</p>

For the two weeks following the recent ministerial changes, approximately 30 to 40 per cent. of their time was spent on work in some way connected to the blog. This is expected to decrease.</p>

	<p pid="e.155W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply</p>
	<p pid="e.155W.2/2">The UK Government have not banned the use of strychnine for mole control by dairy farmers.</p>
	<p pid="e.155W.2/3">The use of strychnine for mole control is controlled under the Biocidal Products Directive administered in the UK by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) as the UK Competent Authority.</p>
	<p pid="e.155W.2/4">This Biocidal Products Directive aims to harmonise controls for marketing and use of biocidal products across Europe, while ensuring a high level of protection for human health and the environment. This includes the assessment of the active substances (such as strychnine) in biocidal products, followed by the authorisation of individual products containing those substances. These risks assessments should be based on scientific data packages provided by industry or other interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="e.155W.2/5">Industry did not submit any such data to support the continued marketing and use of strychnine, and so under the requirements of the directive, strychnine must be removed from the market by <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-01">1 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.155W.2/6">However, the directive does allow member states, on behalf of applicants, to apply for a temporary exemption for substances considered to have 'essential use' in those member states. The HSE has received an application for the 'essential use' of strychnine to control moles from the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) and will forward this to the European Commission for consideration.</p>
	<p pid="e.155W.2/7">If this application is successful, it will allow strychnine to continue to be used until <phrase class="date" code="">14 May 2010</phrase>. However, in the meantime, industry will need to develop alternative methods for controlling moles in the future.</p>
	<p pid="e.155W.2/8">On research into alternatives to strychnine, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published in 2004 a report produced by the Central Science Laboratory which reviewed the range of mole control methods that exist across the EU.

	<p pid="e.156W.3/1">The Government's vision for sustainable waste management in England and Wales and their plan of action are set out in their document, &quot;Waste Strategy 2000&quot;, available on the Defra website: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/strategv/policy.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/strategv/policy.htm</a>. This is currently under review and our revised strategy will put forward a range of measures to build on recent improvements in recycling.</p>
	<p pid="e.156W.3/2">Defra has set national targets to increase household waste recycling to 25 per cent. by 2005-06, 30 per cent. by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. The amount of household waste which is recycled has doubled in the last four years and is continuing to rise.</p>
	<p pid="e.156W.3/3">Local authorities are working hard to improve their performance in household waste recycling, however, Defra is proposing more targeted intervention and engagement with the poorest performers. Those local authorities with the lowest recycling rates in England have had their targets for 2007-08 raised from 18 per cent. to 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.156W.3/4">The Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund and its successor (the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant) have provided funding totalling &pound;294 million over the three years to 2005-06 for specific projects to expand recycling operations. Through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), credits worth &pound;355 million have been made available over the same period as an extra source of funding, with a further &pound;535 million available in 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="e.156W.3/5">The Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme has been developed to give &pound;284 million in additional landfill tax revenues back to business in a revenue neutral way. This is being done by funding resource efficiency and waste projects that will benefit business, including recycling.</p>
	<p pid="e.156W.3/6">On a national basis, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is working to promote sustainable waste management by creating stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products. WRAP also runs the Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team (ROTATE), which is available to all local authorities in England to provide support and advice on the separate collection of dry recyclables and organic wastes.</p>

	<p pid="e.157W.0/2">RES is a competitive scheme that has been very popular and successful in the South West and across the country. The announcement that the scheme would close on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> has lead to an increased number of applications, and that has meant that competition for funding has been much higher than usual.</p>
	<p pid="e.157W.0/3">Over &pound;5.2 million has been allocated to RES in the South West in 2006-07 and a substantial amount of this is now fully committed. Around 100 applications are currently being considered in the South West and the large number of applications will inevitably mean that some projects are unlikely to be funded.</p>
	<p pid="e.157W.0/4">The Rural Development Service is working to make the best use of funds under the current England Rural Development Programme&mdash;to ensure that as much of the money allocated to this programme is spent.

	<p pid="e.157W.3/1">No specific assessment of the cost of making an application to the Rural Enterprise Scheme has been carried out, but we know from our work with applicants to schemes run by my Department that the costs associated with applications can vary considerably from case to case. This will depend on the project size and complexity and is usually in proportion to the amount of grant being requested.</p>
	<p pid="e.157W.3/2">My Department recognises that costs to applicants can be significant. Indeed, the costs of preparing a project and its supporting documentation (which may include feasibility studies, technical development work and preparation of a detailed business case), are themselves eligible for funding. Development costs will not be funded in respect of unsuccessful Rural Enterprise Scheme applications, however; and it is clear throughout the guidance that work is undertaken at the applicant's own risk</p>
	<p pid="e.157W.3/3">In 2003 we introduced a fast-track system for smaller projects to reduce the detail required. This has helped to keep the costs of applying for small amounts of grant to a minimum.</p>

	<p pid="e.158W.0/2" class="italic"> (a) Telephone calls</p>
	<p pid="e.158W.0/3">Customer Service Centre (CSC) telephone agents are monitored by their team leaders and given feedback reports each week. Team leaders also listen into calls on a regular basis. From this, agents are given more specific feedback and advice on call handling techniques. The results of these checks are recorded with the weekly feedback to show where development is required and where progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="e.158W.0/4">Team leaders also carry out sample checks of customer records on the main computer application to ensure that calls are being logged to the required standard and all relevant information is noted.</p>
	<p pid="e.158W.0/5" class="italic"> (b) Electronic mails</p>
	<p pid="e.158W.0/6">A call tracking system logs all incoming e-mails and date stamps their receipt. The e-mail is assigned to the appropriate Rural Payments Agency site for a response and the time taken to reply is tracked against published charter targets. Using this system, RPA can measure its e-mail handling performance and also identify bottlenecks in the process and allocate resources efficiently to remove them.</p>
	<p pid="e.158W.0/7">Once the member of staff has investigated the customer's query and drafted a response it is checked by their line manager to ensure that the reply fully answers the customer's query and that the spelling and grammar is correct. This is then forwarded to the monitoring office for a final review where the reply is checked for plain English, spelling, grammar and layout.</p>
	<p pid="e.158W.0/8">RPA launched a CSC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-14">14 February 2005</phrase>. This was done to streamline single payment scheme and customer registration telephone enquiries into the agency through one route, to allow staff to concentrate on processing. More importantly, this system aims to ensure that customers receive consistent answers and any more complex inquiries can be directed to specialist areas of the business to call the customer back.</p>
	<p pid="e.158W.0/9">The main call centre is based in Workington with facilities for calls to be diverted to staff at other RPA sites during periods of unusually high demand.</p>

	<p pid="e.159W.4/24">RPA launched a CSC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-14">14 February 2005</phrase>. This was done to streamline single payment scheme and customer registration telephone enquiries into the agency through one route, to allow staff to concentrate on processing. More importantly, this system aims to ensure that customers receive consistent answers and any, more complex enquiries can be directed to specialist areas of the business to call the customer back.</p>

	<p pid="e.163W.8/2">To date, over &pound;1.3 billion has been paid out under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme (SPS), representing some 88 per cent. of the total sum to disburse. SPS claimants will be best served by the Rural Payments Agency maintaining its focus on ensuring that outstanding sums are paid as soon as possible. In addition, in view of the cash-flow problems faced by some farmers, the Department has substantially increased the amount of funding available to key rural support organisations who help farmers deal with hardship issues.</p>

	<p pid="e.164W.6/1">A number of Defra activities fit well with this important campaign.</p>
	<p pid="e.164W.6/2">Considerable work is being done by Defra to promote healthy living and a better understanding of the natural world through increased access to the English countryside and urban green spaces. This is for people of all ages and backgrounds. Defra has recently launched a public consultation exercise, in collaboration with the Countryside Agency, called &quot;Access for All?&quot;. This seeks views on a draft action plan that aims, over a 10 year period, to increase the number of people who choose to make use of outdoor recreational facilities. In particular, the plan is aimed at the nine million disabled people and the five million people from ethnic minority communities in the UK, often living in areas of high urban density, who do not currently access proportionate benefit from England's green areas.</p>

This &quot;right to roam&quot; means that walkers can freely explore such land without having to stay on footpaths.</p>
	<p pid="e.164W.6/4">As the programme of work develops the Department of Health (DoH) will be working across all of government to ensure the programme joins up to promote maximum impact. DoH is leading the implementation for this initiative as part of its cross-government commitment to deliver the November 2004 White Paper &quot;Choosing Health: Making healthy choices easier&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.164W.6/5">Our Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS), published in April 2006, shows how we are following up the March 2005 paper &quot;Choosing a Better Diet: a Food and Health Action Plan&quot; that arose from the White Paper. This follow-up action will include Defra membership of a new Government working group to establish and develop nutritional standards for food procured by the NHS, armed forces and HM prisons. Defra will act as the group's link to the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative, which is working with buyers to ensure that as much as possible of the &pound;1.8 billion spent per annum on food supply and catering services for the public sector is sustainably produced.</p>

	<p pid="e.167W.2/1">Reuse has an important role in sustainable waste management. It is second only to waste minimisation in the waste hierarchy.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.2/2">In reviewing the Government's Waste Strategy, we are looking to put greater emphasis on waste prevention and resource efficiency, including re-use. This includes work to improve the evidence base and taking a. life cycle approach to identifying priority products so that we target our intervention at the most significant areas. Our existing consultation exercise seeks views on how re-use and re-manufacture could be further stimulated.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.2/3">Some parts of the waste stream already have well-developed re-use networks, including textiles, second-hand vehicles, electrical and, to a lesser extent, electronic goods. In other areas the voluntary and community sector plays a valuable role through the work of charity shops, furniture and appliance re-use projects, the Community Re-Paint initiative, Fareshare's food programme and scrapstores using spare materials for educational purposes.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.2/4">The Government's Business Resource Efficiency Programme (BREW) programme will be supporting a number of reuse activities through the Business Reuse Fund in 2006-07. In addition, the Packaging, End of Life Vehicles, and Waste Electrical and Equipment Directives all serve to encourage more re-use.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.2/5">The Defra-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) also supports a variety of reuse projects, including the Choose To Reuse shopping bag campaign and the use of real nappies. Further information is available on the WRAP website:</p>

	<p pid="e.167W.5/1">Various surveys are carried out on the amounts of controlled and non-controlled waste generated. Detailed figures and statistics on waste and recycling in England and Wales are available from the Defra website: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/statistics/waste/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/statistics/waste/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.5/2">Good progress has been made on the minimisation and recycling of waste since the publication of the &quot;Waste Strategy for England and Wales 2000&quot;, which sets out Government's strategy for sustainable waste management.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.5/3">Lesser amounts of most kinds of waste are being landfilled, and recycling and composting of household waste has doubled in the last four years. The latest figures show that local authorities in England recycled 22.9 per cent. of household waste in 2004-05 compared to 10.3 per cent. in 2001-02. More packaging waste is being recovered and recycled, rising from 33 per cent. to 56 per cent. between 1998 and 2004. The re-use and recycling of industrial and commercial waste has also increased, together with construction and demolition waste.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.5/4">However, we still have much more to do. In 2000, our waste strategy set targets to recycle or compost at least 30 per cent. of household waste by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. The Government have provided local authorities with greater levels of funding to enable them to meet their targets, and the majority of local authorities are working hard to improve their performance. Defra is proposing more targeted intervention and engagement with the poorest performers, and those local authorities with the lowest recycling rates in England have had their targets for 2007-08 raised from 18 per cent. to 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.5/5">A number of programmes including the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund and its successor the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant, the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme, and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) have been set up to support and increase waste recycling and provide efficient markets for recycled materials.</p>
	<p pid="e.167W.5/6">A review of the Government's waste strategy is currently underway. The new strategy will support the use of waste as a resource. It will also focus on waste prevention and resource efficiency, the development of a recycling culture, and a more joined up approach across waste streams&mdash;particularly for business and local authority waste.</p>

	<p pid="e.169W.0/2">In a drought situation, companies should apply the maximum available effort to reducing demand and increasing supply. This will have the effect of producing a new short-term ELL based on setting the costs of additional leakage reduction options against the economic valuation of other available short-term options such as increasing abstraction and hosepipe bans. As the cheaper longer term options are excluded from this calculation, the short-term ELL in a drought is lower than the published ELL.</p>

	<p pid="e.170W.5/1">During the period April 2005 to date, the 18,300 MOT garages in Great Britain have issued some 15.4 million MOT certificates via the new computer system.</p>
	<p pid="e.170W.5/2">Because the booking of MOT tests is the responsibility of individual garages and is managed outside of the MOT computer system, it is not possible for VOSA to ascertain if any MOT tests were delayed because of computer malfunctions.</p>
	<p pid="e.170W.5/3">In order to ensure that road safety is not compromised, VOSA has however made contingency procedures available to garages in the event of either hardware failure at an individual site or a more widespread disruption to the MOT service. These arrangements ensure that there should be little or no impact on motorists both in terms of having their vehicles tested and receiving their MOT certificates.</p>

	<p pid="e.175W.5/1">Between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s, relative child poverty more than doubled. This Government have committed to halve child poverty by 2010 and to eradicate it by 2020. In 2004-05 there were 700,000 fewer children in relative poverty than in 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="e.175W.5/2">The Child Poverty Review, published in July 2004, set out a multi-faceted strategy for halving child poverty. Child care, child benefit and child tax credit all have important roles but must be combined with wider interventions such as work for those who can, tackling material deprivation and improving public services for poor children.</p>
	<p pid="e.175W.5/3">As a solid foundation for meeting the target to halve child poverty by 2010, at Budget 2006 it was announced that the child element of the child tax credit would continue to be uprated at least in line with earnings until the end of this Parliament. Any current projection of the number of children in poverty in 2010 would, however, be subject to large uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution and individual changes in behaviour in response to policy changes.</p>

	<p pid="e.182W.12/2">HMRC have had a strategy for tackling missing trader intra-community (MTIC) VAT fraud since September 2000. In recent months they have committed significant additional resources to strengthen their strategy, including re-deploying 420 compliance staff and 55 detection staff, and recruiting 48 new criminal investigators. There are now over 1,000 staff engaged in tackling MTIC fraud. HMRC will continue to review their strategy, including the deployment of resources, to ensure that it remains effective. HMRC's financial accounts do not provide financial resource figures for individual strategies.</p>

	<p pid="e.192W.5/1">Like all other customers, people aged 50 and over, including those above state pension age, can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/2">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New deal 50 plus, which is a voluntary programme, provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment. Once in work, new deal 50 plus customers can claim a Training Grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/3">People aged 50 and over are also eligible for help from new deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated on new deal 25 plus, are already required to attend the Gateway stage of the new deal 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to 4 months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the Intensive Activity Period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/4">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the new deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Interim pilot data has yielded positive results and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be commencing a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/5">New deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme for those who have been claiming benefits, including those claiming the pension credit, for six months. However, our Green Paper also announced our intention to pilot mandatory participation in new deal 50 plus activities for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for six months. This will involve attendance at work-focused interviews and the development of action plans to help participants move into employment. Pilot locations have not yet been confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/6">Since October 2004, pension credit has been a qualifying benefit for the majority of Jobcentre Plus programmes. This enables people aged 60 and over who are claiming pension credit to take advantage of the wide range of back to work help available.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/7">In spring 2005 there were three million people claiming incapacity benefits in Great Britain, of which 1.3 million were aged 50 or over. As nearly half of all benefit claimants aged 50 or over are on IB, they will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a 'Choices Package' of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/8">Our Age Positive Campaign works with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the 'Be Ready' national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.192W.5/9">The number of people working past State Pension Age has been increasing and now stands at over one million. We have introduced more attractive state pension deferral options with a higher rate of increment (10.4 per cent.) and the option of taking a lump sum instead of a weekly increase if individuals defer taking their pension for 12 months or longer.</p>

The 2004 Housing Act requires home inspectors to be fit and proper persons to carry out inspections. Those wishing to become home inspectors will therefore be subject to a full background investigation, involving a Criminal Records Bureau check. We are working with the Home Office on developing an approach similar to that used for people wishing to become police officers.</p>

	<p pid="e.210W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.210W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not normally provide funding directly to any Urban Regeneration Company (URC). Instead, funding is provided by the partners in each URC; this covers, separately, revenue and capital costs. The usual partners of a URC comprise the local Regional Development Agency (RDA), the local authority or authorities, and English Partnerships (EP). The table shows the estimated revenue funding provided to the individual URCs for the latest financial year, 2005-06. Allocations for previous years were of a similar order for each URC. Note that URCs have been created at different times over the past seven years.</p>
	<p pid="e.210W.2/3">Information on funding allocations for capital projects in each URC is not held centrally. Funding for capital projects is not normally provided directly to the URCs; rather, expenditure on projects is incurred by the partners themselves, on the basis of strategies agreed with the URCs.</p>
	<p pid="e.210W.2/4">Exceptionally, and in addition to the above quoted data, ODPM does provide special direct funding to the URC in Peterborough, under the Growth Areas programme, and to the URC in Southend, as part of the Thames Gateway programme; this is done to support the work that these two companies are carrying out under these initiatives, in addition to their standard URC regeneration activities.</p>

The challenge is to implement these policies effectively and for this reason DFID is engaging with the Government of India and other development partners to help to implement their commitments.</p>
	<p pid="e.212W.5/3">For example, in education, DFID supports India's National Programme for achieving universal primary education (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan&mdash;SSA). One of the objectives of this programme, which was launched in September 2004, was to narrow the gaps that existed between the enrolment of Scheduled Caste and other children.</p>
	<p pid="e.212W.5/4">The recent mid-term review of SSA indicates that the programme has been effective in increasing the enrolment of Scheduled Caste children into mainstream education. The proportion of Scheduled Caste children in the school population has increased from 19 per cent. in 2003 to 21.3 per cent. in 2005. This means that millions of Dalit children are now in schools alongside other children and the proportion of Dalit children in mainstream Government schools now exceeds the proportion of Dalit children in the general population. This success has been achieved through a range of strategies that have helped to tackle discrimination at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="e.212W.5/5">Special efforts are needed to ensure that Dalits are able to exercise their rights to access mainstream services. DFID is providing &pound;75 million over five years to UNICEF in India to help reduce child mortality to tackle social exclusion in health and education services. Under this partnership, UNICEF has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies. This will increase understanding of how to tackle the constraints and barriers that Dalits face in accessing services.</p>

	<p pid="e.214W.7/1">99.8 per cent. of UK households can now access broadband. Broadband coverage in rural areas stands at 99.2 per cent. of households. Some households are, however, not able to receive broadband services, or only at very low speeds, due to local technicalities such as distance from a home to the local exchange or because of the poor quality of networks.</p>
	<p pid="e.214W.7/2">The broadband market is dynamic, where research and competition are stimulating rapid developments and innovative solutions to technical problems. There is a range of private and public sector funded pilot projects emerging across the UK aiming to identify solutions to further improve access to broadband services.</p>
	<p pid="e.214W.7/3">The DTI and DEFRA produced a CD-ROM &quot;A New Way to Live, Work and Play&quot; last year. It contains hundreds of stories and examples of how people obtained and gained benefits from broadband. The CD-ROM was sent to parish councils, rural community councils, regional development agencies, devolved Administrations, intermediary organisations and other interested parties. The material is also available via the DTI website. The Department also has regular contact with the regional development agencies and devolved Administrations to discus future broadband developments and the impact of initiatives to promote its take-up.</p>
	<p pid="e.214W.7/4">In addition, the DTI continues to explore broadband deployment in the UK and has initiated a debate and review of next generation access for broadband in the UK, through the Broadband Stakeholder Group, involving public and private sector stakeholders and including exploring technical solutions to the inhibitors of broadband access, such as line lengths.</p>
	<p pid="e.214W.7/5">The DTI is separately engaging organisations such as the Royal National Institute for the Deaf; Help the Aged, the Royal National Institute for the Blind and organisations such as Citizens on-line and the Alliance for Digital Inclusion and other industry organisations to develop options for disadvantaged people to access ICT and broadband.</p>
	<p pid="e.214W.7/6">&quot;Connecting the UK: The Digital Strategy&quot;, launched in April 2005, is the Government's initial response to bridging the digital divide. It sets out a number of actions aimed at driving take-up and use of ICT, particularly among typically excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="e.214W.7/7">The DTI is working in partnership with other Government Departments to assist delivery of their programmes including the DfES's e-Strategy 'Harnessing Technology: Transforming learning and children's services', the DCLG's Digital Challenge, to which the DTI has committed &pound;250,000 for the prize fund, and the Cabinet Office's 'Transformational Government'.</p>
	<p pid="e.214W.7/8">The DTI is also working with stakeholders to develop and promote the support services, which enable access for those without their own equipment, or necessary IT skills such as UK On-line Centres. The Department is active in a European context in supporting the European Commission's i2010 initiative, including supporting the recent Commission communication on Bridging the Broadband Gap, which aims to promote the use of existing measures and initiatives to further broadband access within the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="e.216W.2/1">The Department introduced the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) scheme in 1999, under the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations, which were updated by the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations in 2003. The TPS scheme provides protection to UK consumers from cold calling by foreign companies if the calls are made on behalf of UK companies and the consumer has previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or has been registered with the TPS for at least 28 days. Therefore, those making cold calls are legally required not to call a number that has registered on the TPS list. The Information Commissioner has responsibility for the enforcement of the TPS scheme and considers complaints about breaches. However, cold calls from non-UK companies marketing a service or product are not covered by the TPS scheme, as the companies and products have no link with the UK.</p>

	<p pid="e.216W.5/77">In England and Wales together and the UK as a whole, the stock of VAT registered businesses has increased each year since 1997, as registrations have exceeded de-registrations throughout this period.</p>
	<p pid="e.216W.5/78">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million businesses (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.216W.5/79">Barclays Bank provides estimates of the total number of business closures each quarter in England and Wales, based on closures of business bank accounts. Barclays estimate that there were 321,500 business closures in England and Wales in 2004. However, Barclays does not publish a regional breakdown of closures.</p>

	<p pid="e.220W.2/1">There have been no recent discussions between Ministers or officials with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). Prior to the UK announcements, officials were in touch with the company headquarters concerning the implications of their global announcement, including possible effects in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.220W.2/2">Clearly, I very much regret any job losses, and the impact this has on individuals and their families.</p>
	<p pid="e.220W.2/3">However, recent Labour Market Statistics data (May 2006) show that employment levels remain around record levels, with nearly 2.5 million more people in work then there were in 1979. The loss of jobs with the Computer Science Corporation needs to be seen in the context that every month there are approximately 200,000 people moving into, and out of, work.</p>
	<p pid="e.220W.2/4">The Office for National Statistics does not record the number of jobs outsourced. However in ICT-enabled jobs, which are among those more likely to be affected by outsourcing, employment has over the last four years grown by 8.8 per cent., nearly three times the national average of 3.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.220W.2/5">Globalisation is changing the shape of skills requirements in the UK workforce. The Department is working with e-skills UK as the lead UK body in addressing these skills challenges. Ministers and officials have supported the work to improve professionalism in IT led by the British Computer Society and other UK bodies. These and other initiatives aim to improve the competitiveness of the UK's skills as well as enhance the basis for lifelong learning and career development. The Department also continues to monitor information from the IT industry in the light of offshoring as an input to policy.</p>

	<p pid="e.221W.0/1">The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 implement European Council Directive (97/7/EC) to increase consumer protection throughout the EU and give consumers confidence when buying at a distance. Distance selling is where there is no face-to-face contact between the supplier and consumer, such as by phone, mail order, via the internet or digital TV.</p>
	<p pid="e.221W.0/2">It lays down basic requirements to suppliers of goods and services on the information to be given to consumers before and after they buy, including deadlines for the delivery of goods or performance of services and protection against credit card fraud. The Regulations provide a seven day &quot;cooling off period&quot; during which the consumer can withdraw from the contract, this gives consumers an opportunity to examine the goods. Consumers who exercise their right to cancel must be refunded all money paid within 30 days.</p>
	<p pid="e.221W.0/3">Following representations from stakeholders, the Regulations were amended on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>, making changes to the requirements to provide information and to cancellation periods for the supply of services.</p>
	<p pid="e.221W.0/4">Designated enforcers such as the Office of Fair Trading and Trading Standards Services have a duty to consider complaints about possible breaches of the Regulations. To ensure compliance enforcers may apply for a court injunction or accept undertakings from a supplier that they will comply.</p>
	<p pid="e.221W.0/5">The European Commission has begun a review of eight consumer directives known as the Consumer <i> Acquis</i>, which includes the Distance Selling Directive. The review of the <i> Acquis</i> aims to simplify and improve these eight directives. The Commission will review each Directive looking at how successful they are at protecting consumers and enhancing the internal market across the EU. My Department has consulted and continues to consult UK business and consumer stakeholders as part of this process.</p>

	<p pid="e.225W.3/1">Since September 2003 UK First, the Furniture Industry Forum, has been supported by DTI with &pound;1.75 million over 41.5 years, to introduce productivity and process improvements to the sector. Savings to date for companies in the sector have exceeded &pound;2.5 million. We also supported the establishment of the Furniture Industry Strategy Group in 2003 to help the sector to address key areas affecting productivity and competitiveness. The Strategy Group has led to the establishment recently of the British Furniture Confederation which is working to promote the interests of the sector.</p>

	<p pid="e.233W.2/2">Personal debt has risen substantially over the last 10 years, both in real terms and as a proportion of income. By the end of 2005 borrowing stood at approximately &pound;1.3tn, or 151 per cent. of income. This compares to a real value of &pound;530 billion in 1995, or 75 per cent. of income.</p>
	<p pid="e.233W.2/3">Despite these significant rises in the uptake of borrowing in the UK we do not believe that personal debt constitutes a major problem. The large majority of consumers continue to use credit in a productive and prudent way.</p>
	<p pid="e.233W.2/4">However, the Government recognise that for a small but significant number of individuals debt causes serious problems. Current estimates suggest that the number of individuals experiencing such debt problems stands at around 5 per cent. of the adult population.</p>
	<p pid="e.233W.2/5">In recognition of these problems we are doing much to help those with personal debt problems as outlined in the Government's 2004 &quot;Tackling Over-indebtedness: Action Plan&quot; and the subsequent 2005 Annual Report. DTI examples include the recently launched &pound;45 million Face-to-Face Debt Advice Project, which will result in hundreds of new debt advisers, and the multi-million pound support given to the National Debtline phone service.</p>
	<p pid="e.233W.2/6">The DTI also recognizes that over-indebtedness is an issue that can only be resolved through the close co-operation of a number of different Government bodies, and actively supports programmes by other Departments including major financial education policies currently being implemented by the Financial Services Authority and Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="e.233W.2/7">Furthermore, the DTI is committed to the continued monitoring of the over- indebtedness picture in the UK and will report again in early 2007 on the extent of the problem.</p>

The Royal Mail chief executive's reference to a network of 4,000 post office branches reflects a hypothetical network geared solely towards fulfilling licence criteria for provision of mail services.

	<p pid="e.239W.0/1">Entitlement to vote in elections in the UK is based in large part on nationality but is not restricted only to those holding British citizenship. In recent years the addition of a &quot;nationality&quot; box in the registration form provides an opportunity for electoral registration officers (EROs), who would otherwise have no reason to know, to determine an individual's eligibility for inclusion on the basis of their stated nationality. Electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may object and notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual. The Electoral Administration Bill, currently under consideration, strengthens the objection process and creates a new offence of supplying false information of any kind to an ERO, or failing to supply information, in connection with registration.</p>

	<p pid="e.239W.6/3">The Government take election fraud seriously, and encourage anyone who did not receive their postal vote to report this to their local authority, and if they believe that a postal vote has been cast fraudulently they should report this to the police.</p>

	<p pid="e.240W.0/1">The Government believe that family mediation has significant advantages in resolving disputes, particularly in relation to children. The Government are taking forward a number of measures to give the strongest possible encouragement to mediation as an alternative to contested court proceedings. However, for mediation to be successful both parties have to enter into it freely and without constraint, and therefore the Government do not believe mediation should be made compulsory.</p>
	<p pid="e.240W.0/2">Under the provisions of the Children and Adoption Bill the courts will be able to direct people in disputes over contact with children to attend contact activities, which will provide a range of interventions including programmes, counselling and classes to facilitate contact and also meetings to receive information about mediation. The court will be able to direct people to the most appropriate intervention for the dispute concerned.</p>

	<p pid="e.241W.6/1">There is no current requirement on either judges or magistrates to meet victims of crime as part of their training. However, they will be aware of local victim support schemes and local magistrates training often provides an opportunity to groups such as Victim Support, to give information and input as part of a general induction process.</p>
	<p pid="e.241W.6/2">Victims of crime must be informed of their option to submit a 'Victim Personal Statement' to be read by the judge/magistrates before sentencing. The statement focuses the Court's attention on the effect of the crime upon the victim. Given the number of judges and magistrates that there are nationally, it is quite likely that a number of them, or those personally known to them, have been victims of some form of crime at some point in time.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister set out details of my new role and responsibilities in his answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 985W. It is a wide-ranging brief, focusing on improving the effectiveness of policy development across Government and carrying out international duties on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. As part of this cross-cutting brief, I shall continue to champion the interests of the North in all aspects of the Government's work.</p>
	<p pid="e.245W.8/2">So far this year, I have visited a number of towns and cities in the North of England, to see for myself the progress that has been made since 1997 in regenerating our cities and making them places where people want to live and work. I am also very proud of the advances being made in growing the North's economy, improving its local environments and providing affordable and decent housing, for example through initiatives such as Housing Market Renewal Pathfinders and the Northern Way, which have demonstrated how the public, private and voluntary sectors can work together towards a common vision for creating sustainable communities. For instance, I continue to follow with interest the pilot projects being taken forward by the Northern Way, with funds from the &pound;100 million Northern Way Growth Fund, to demonstrate how things can be done differently in the North to improve people's lives and how the &pound;1.2 billion Housing Market Renewal Fund continues to turn around neighbourhoods which people were previously leaving, but where house prices have now doubled.</p>
	<p pid="e.245W.8/3">The Government and our partners have achieved a lot, but we are aware of the need to deliver even more, and to ensure we narrow the economic gap between north and south. We need to work across Government Departments to maximise the benefits of our policies. My new role will enable me to ensure that Cabinet Committees work even more effectively to deliver more integrated solutions across the full range of Government programmes and spending.</p>

	<p pid="e.252W.5/5" class="indent">It is currently not possible to give a figure for the number of redundancies in any part of the LSC although it is our policy to ensure that we minimise the number of job losses wherever possible. In Merseyside, we are proposing that the 106 staff presently employed will reduce to 40. Although this initially looks like a significant reduction, job losses in real terms will be much smaller. As part of our restructuring, we are ensuring that where it makes sense to carry out an activity at 9 regional sites as opposed to 47 individual sites, we will do so. A number of the roles presently carried out at the Greater Merseyside LSC will transfer to the North West Regional Centre, but will continue to support the Greater Merseyside LSC. The North West Regional Centre will be established in Manchester, which is approximately 35 miles from the Greater Merseyside LSC.</p>
	<p pid="e.252W.5/6" class="indent">At the same time, we are recruiting staff into new roles both in Greater Merseyside and in the North West Regional Centre, which will also have an impact on the final number of redundancies. In addition, we are seeking volunteers for early retirement or voluntary severance. We have had 47 applications for voluntary severance from staff at the Merseyside office and all have been supported.</p>

	<p pid="e.253W.5/1">The Department welcomes the priority attached to skills in the Northern Way's Business Plan. We are committed to working with the Northern Way partners to ensure each of the Regional Economic Strategies for Yorkshire and Humber, the North West and North East are mutually reinforcing and maximise the opportunities offered by cross-regional working.</p>
	<p pid="e.253W.5/2">The Northern Way is a pan-regional growth strategy being taken forward by the three northern Regional Development Agencies and their partners. Its work has potential to play an important role in delivering Government's Regional Economic Performance Public Service Agreement. The Department for Communities and Local Government co-ordinates Government involvement with the Northern Way. The Department for Education and Skills works with the Northern Way where its activities relate to our responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="e.253W.8/1">Over the past few years the Department has both commissioned and jointly funded external studies to examine the benefits and potential barriers to out-of-classroom learning. We have commissioned a survey of schools and local authorities to assess the extent of education outside the classroom, gather their views on the benefits and look at some of the barriers. The results will be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="e.253W.8/2">The Department has recently supported an Ofsted survey to be published in the autumn of effective fieldwork practice in schools and how this supports pupils' motivation and learning in geography. As part of the emerging Education Outside the Classroom Manifesto, 10 working groups of leading organisations from different out-of-classroom learning sectors (including field studies) submitted reports to the Department on the benefits of out-of-classroom learning, barriers to participation and practical recommendations to remove those barriers.</p>

	<p pid="e.258W.2/1">The right to establish a conscientious objection to military service has long been recognised by the armed forces. As conscription no longer exists, it is unlikely that anybody who has an existing conscientious objection to military service would join the armed forces. Those who develop a genuine conscientious objection during service in the armed forces are able to follow well established procedures for their service to be terminated, and this includes an independent appeals procedure in any case where an application has been rejected. Information about the procedures is readily available.</p>

The information is only available from the 1999-2000 training year as previously the data were compiled in a different manner. The figures for the training year 2005-06 are given in the table and will be published in the next statement on the pattern of military low flying that will be available in the House in summer 2006.</p>

These statistics are consistent with the information provided annually in the statement on the pattern of military low flying.</p>

The King is no longer the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Nepalese Army are now subordinated to democratic control. Her Majesty's Government's goal in Nepal remains to help the country emerge from the current conflict with a sustainable peace, based on the principles of a civilian, accountable and democratic Government, as the necessary foundation on which to build a viable economy and climate for recovery and reform. Although much remains to be done, this can best be achieved through engagement by the international community with the new democratic Government and with the new Nepal Army to help it adjust to the new accountability. Our current support to the Nepalese Army includes help towards the development of democratic control of the military, human rights training and explosive ordinance disposal training (in support of their post-conflict role).</p>

	<p pid="e.263W.6/1">Since humans can be exposed to low levels of chemicals in their diet, or in their environment, over a significant proportion of their lifespan, studies to evaluate lifetime exposure are conducted in animals to ascertain the potential for the chemical to cause cancer. The objective of carcinogenicity studies is to identify the potential of test materials to cause tumours in animals and to assess the relevant risk in humans. Carcinogenicity studies are time consuming and resource intensive and are only performed when potential or actual human exposure warrants the need for this information to be generated. Our implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 ensures that this is the case, and that the studies that are undertaken avoid unnecessary animal use, do not cause unnecessary suffering and provide data of a sufficiently high quality to inform risk assessments and regulatory decisions.</p>
	<p pid="e.263W.6/2">We make every effort to keep abreast of developments in this and other areas relevant to the use of animals under the 1986 Act. For example, issues relating to the use of animals for carcinogenicity studies fall within the broader remit of the Inter-departmental Group on the 3Rs, which the Home Office leads and membership of which includes relevant United Kingdom regulators. We are informed of work on validation within Europe through the United Kingdom representative to the Scientific Advisory Committee to the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). In addition, our professional inspectorate maintains awareness of developments taking place within United Kingdom research laboratories, and of relevant publications.</p>
	<p pid="e.263W.6/3">In this latter context, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have recently published a report entitled &quot;Creative Accounting&quot; looking at carcinogenicity studies. We have referred the technical issues contained in the PETA report to the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) for scientific evaluation. We will consider any issues relevant to the implementation of the 1986 Act when we have received the Committee's advice.</p>

	<p pid="e.264W.5/2">From commencement, <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-31">31 May 2000</phrase>, Antisocial Behaviour Order (ASBO) data were collected on aggregate numbers only by police force area. Tables A to H give the number of ASBOs issued to 10 to17-year-olds at all courts, as notified to the Home Office, from <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-01">1 June 2000</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> (latest available), by individual age and the local authority area in which prohibitions have been imposed. Data collated centrally for statistical purposes do not identify the type of antisocial behaviour that led to the issuing of an ASBO.</p>
	<p pid="e.264W.5/3">ASBO breach data only cover breach proceedings where there has been a conviction. These data are available at criminal justice system area level only and are currently available from <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-01">1 June 2000</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December 2003</phrase> for ASBOs issued since <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-01">1 June 2000</phrase>. During this period, of the 392 persons aged 10 to 17 convicted for breaching their ASBO, on one or more occasions, 179 received a custodial sentence, of which 30 were for breach of ASBO alone. Within the same period and, as notified to the Home Office, no notification was received of the breach of an ASBO made at the same time as a parenting order.</p>
	<p pid="e.264W.5/4">The minimum duration of an ASBO is two years but there is no maximum period. It is for the court to decide the duration of the order depending on the severity of the anti social behaviour. The latest published figures up to September 2005 show that 62 per cent of anti social behaviour orders issued to young people aged 10 to 17 were for a period of less than three years. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase> we announced that we would put on a statutory footing the exisiting good practice guidance that agencies should conduct a one year review of ASBOs issued to children and young people, in order to ensure that they are receiving the help and support they need in order to avoid breaching the terms of the ASBOs.</p>
	<p pid="e.264W.5/5">In addition, it is always open to the defendant or the applicant authority to go back to the court to vary or discharge the ASBO if one or more of the terms is no longer needed or needs strengthening.</p>

	<p pid="e.270W.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has issued 8.9 million Disclosures since its launch in March 2002 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>. In that time, there have been 2,273 occasions where Disclosure applicant details were matched by the CRB to a person with the same or very similar details who has a criminal record and, where the details had been challenged by the applicant, their dispute was subsequently upheld.</p>
	<p pid="e.270W.2/2">These cases are clearly regrettable, but represent a very small proportion of cases&mdash;0.025 per cent. of the total number of Disclosures issued. The CRB is acutely aware of the human consequences of making an incorrect matching decision and does not do so lightly.</p>
	<p pid="e.270W.2/3">However, the CRB must err on the side of caution when an individual has the same or very similar personal details to those of someone who has a criminal record. This is because it is better to be safe than run the risk of letting an inappropriate person through.</p>
	<p pid="e.270W.2/4">When a Disclosure is disputed it is resolved by asking the applicant to have their fingerprints taken at a local police station to help either confirm or overturn the original matching decision.</p>
	<p pid="e.270W.2/5">The CRB will always apologise if the original matching decision is later found to be incorrect. In the event of a dispute the CRB notifies the prospective employer who would be aware of the CRB's Code of Practice that asks them not to take any precipitative action and defer any employment decision until the dispute is resolved. When a Disclosure is disputed the CRB will inform all parties that this is the case, including the employer. Where the information contained in the Disclosure is found not to relate to the applicant, a fresh Disclosure will be issued free of charge to both the applicant and the Registered Body. 90 per cent. of disputes are resolved within 21 days.</p>
	<p pid="e.270W.2/6">A public consultation exercise was conducted in October 2003 about making greater use of fingerprinting at an earlier stage in the application process and to aid the matching and decision-making procedures. The overwhelming response was not in favour of such a measure.</p>
	<p pid="e.270W.2/7">It is worth noting that under the previous police checking arrangements, individuals were not able to see the criminal records information disclosed about them. The information would have been passed only to the prospective employer and not to the job applicant and the prospective employer would have had no obligation to pass on the contents of the information to the individual.</p>

	<p pid="e.271W.2/1">The information sought by the hon. Member is not available. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) is unable to provide information on Disclosure applications based on geographical areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.271W.2/2">In order to identify how many applicants reside in Wales and received an incorrect assessment, the CRB would need to perform a manual trawl, at disproportionate cost, of each application to ascertain whether the postcode falls within Wales. Furthermore, this may not provide a conclusive figure as applicants may live on the borders of England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="e.274W.6/1">The selection of the pathologist to undertake a post-mortem examination is made, by the coroner with jurisdiction, under the provisions of section 19 or s20 Coroners Act 1988. In cases of suspicious death, where there may be a prosecution, the coroner would consult the police (see Rule 6 Coroners Rules 1984) before making the selection. The death of Dr. Kelly took place within the jurisdiction of the Oxfordshire coroner and so the choice of Dr. Hunt would have been made by that coroner.</p>

The penalty notice for disorder scheme was brought into effect in all police forces in England and Wales during 2004. Under the scheme the police are able to issue persons believed to have committed specified minor offences with a fixed penalty notice. No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability to conviction of the offence. Data on the number of penalty notices for disorder issued in 2004 and 2005 (provisional data) for offences related to drunkenness are provided in the second table.</p>

	<p pid="e.277W.5/3">A number of London prisons participated in a pilot organised by Business in the Community (BITC), an organisation that forges links between managers in the public and private sectors to enhance the skills and knowledge of participants. Mr. Rod Eddington was the chief executive of British Airways, selected by BITC to partner the Governor of Feltham as part of this initiative. Mr. Eddington visited the prison on two occasions, helped promote the positive aspects of the work of the prison and facilitated the use of BA facilities for a training event for Feltham managers. Mr. Eddington concluded his participation in January.</p>

Among other things, the code requires mobile providers: to undertake a process of age verification; to classify commercial content which they supply themselves as unsuitable for customers under 18 where appropriate; to moderate chat rooms made available to customers under 18; and to allow parents and carers to apply filters to the mobile operator's internet access services so that the internet content thus accessible is restricted. The Independent Mobile Classification body (IMCB), a subsidiary of the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS), fulfils the commitment in the Code to appoint an independent classification body to provide a framework for classifying commercial content that is unsuitable for customers under the age of 18.</p>

	<p pid="e.287W.2/2">The Preventing Extremism Together (PET) working groups convened last year suggested that further debate between young British Muslims and influential Muslim scholars and figures could help and encourage a stronger challenge to the message of extremism. As a result the Government have supported a campaign to help do this, led by grassroots British Muslim organisations such as Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS), Q News and Young Muslim Organisation (YMO) amongst other Muslim organisations. To date the initiative which was successfully launched in December 2005 has brought influential mainstream Muslims scholars and thinkers to speak to audiences of thousands of 18 to 30 year old British Muslims, a large percentage of whom have been young British Muslim women. To ensure that the message reaches a wider audience the organisers have also developed a website and are producing a range of other resources.</p>

	<p pid="e.288W.2/1">There has been no formal evaluation of the impact on resettlement outcomes of open and resettlement regimes. Valuable work is undertaken with prisoners throughout their sentence and it might be misleading to ascribe resettlement outcomes only to the discharging prison. However, a new method of evaluation is now being tested within the National Offender Management Service which may facilitate a more sophisticated analysis of the impact of different regimes. If this methodology proves successful, the same approach will used, later this year, to evaluate the impact on re-offending of open and resettlement estate regimes, close to their homes; <i> (b)</i> or the impact of doing so on employment on release, successful resettlement or their re-offending rates.</p>

The strategy is contained in Prison Service Order 1215 &quot;Professional Standards: Preventing and Handling Staff Wrongdoing.&quot; It sets out a policy framework and practical advice for staff, including governing governors, for obtaining, developing and dealing with information and intelligence on corrupt staff. It includes provision for confidential reporting and establishes the requirement to provide specialist professional standards managers at prison, area and national levels. The London Area Professional Standards Managers support and visit London establishments to monitor compliance with the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="e.296W.9/1">A new core day is being developed at Belmarsh prison, as part of a general improvement programme, which is expected to provide significant developments for prisoners in their first 12 hours in custody. This will include allowing prisoners more time out of cell and having the opportunity to see the doctor, the chaplaincy and listeners (Samaritans) and drug agencies. The purpose of the changes is to ensure that Belmarsh is able to effectively meet the immediate needs of the new prisoner.</p>

	<p pid="e.301W.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has not met with the police service to discuss the theft of works of art from private collections. However, I am aware that senior officers from a number of forces recently met with representatives of the art and antiques trade to discuss a range of issues.</p>
	<p pid="e.301W.0/3">The Government take all crime seriously and has a public service agreement target to reduce crime by 15 per cent. by 2007-08, and by more in high crime areas. This broader target gives police forces and authorities, together with communities and partners, flexibility to target the crimes that are of most pressing local concern.</p>
	<p pid="e.301W.0/4">Police authorities and chief constables are required to have regard to the national strategic priorities when drawing up their local policing plans. One of these is tackling serious and organised crime, which may include theft of works of art from private collections.</p>
	<p pid="e.301W.0/5">Both the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad have in the past provided assistance to police forces in recovering art works and antiques. The Serious Organised Crime Agency will also play a role here.</p>

	<p pid="e.307W.12/1">According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime figures, 2004-05 saw a 21 per cent. reduction in the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. However, production decreased by only 2.4 per cent. as improved weather conditions and less disease resulted in higher yields per hectare. This was particularly the case in Helmand Province, where opium production increased despite a 10 per cent. fall in the area under cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="e.307W.12/2">It would be speculation to draw a link between an increase in opium production in 2004-05 and the security situation in Helmand. However, it is clear that the drugs trade flourishes in a lawless environment. It also contributes to the perpetuation of that environment and hinders the reconstruction process.</p>
	<p pid="e.307W.12/3">That is why the UK is supporting the Government of Afghanistan to implement its National Drug Control Strategy, including by co-ordinating international assistance designed to target the trafficker and the trade, strengthen and diversify legal rural livelihoods, build effective counter narcotics institutions and reduce domestic demand. More broadly, our wider military and civilian engagement in Helmand Province will help to create a more secure environment and develop Afghanistan's institutions and legitimate economy.</p>

We are currently integrating the EMS covering our two Whitehall buildings, which is certified to International Standards Organisation (ISO) 14001: 2004, with the EMS operating on our rural site at Hanslope Park in Buckinghamshire.

We have therefore not nominated a Minister to be responsible for monitoring compliance under section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. We will keep this under review.</p>

We are very concerned about the apparent hardening of Chinese policy on freedom of expression, including in relation to the Internet. We made this a theme of our bilateral human rights dialogue with the Chinese in June 2005 and the UK-led EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in October 2005.

However, the central themes of the report including China's need to increase transparency in its military planning and budgeting, to guard against the risks of miscalculation in the Taiwan Straits, and for China to build up its bilateral co-operation and engagement as a responsible stakeholder in the international community are ones which the Government broadly share.</p>

	<p pid="e.312W.6/1">We keep the human rights situation in Colombia under constant review and frequently raise specific human rights cases with the relevant Colombian authorities. We remain concerned about the situation faced by civil society in Colombia. While the human rights situation clearly remains unacceptable, we feel that some progress has been made and it is important to recognise this. Figures for 2005 demonstrate that the number of murders, kidnappings, displacements and massacres generally decreased by comparison with those for 2004. Much more needs to be done, however. The UK's objective is to support both the Government of Colombia and civil society through projects that promote human rights, democracy and good governance.</p>

My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, most recently did so with Foreign Minister Barco of Colombia on <phrase class="date" code="">12 May</phrase> in the margins of the European Union-Latin America and Caribbean summit in Vienna.

	<p pid="e.313W.3/1">There are some encouraging signs. As indicated in the Ministerial Conclusions on Colombia of the Council of the European Union in October last year, we and other EU member states consider that the effective and transparent implementation of the Law on Justice and Peace, under which more than 30,000 paramilitaries in Colombia have now demobilised, will have a positive impact on peace-building in Colombia.</p>
	<p pid="e.313W.3/2">The Colombian Government are talking actively with the National Liberation Army, a left-wing illegal armed group. The last round of talks took place in Cuba last month, and further talks are scheduled for later this year. However, the Colombian Government's recent efforts to begin preliminary talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the countries biggest illegal armed group, have been consistently rejected by the guerrillas. We hope that, after the elections, the incoming government will continue actively to promote peace in Colombia. We will continue to support Colombia in its efforts to tackle the inter-connected problems arising from the internal armed conflict, the trade in illegal drugs and human rights abuses.</p>

	<p pid="e.313W.6/1">We encourage the Colombian Government to ensure that the civilian justice system is used where appropriate, rather than the military justice system. Indeed, the UK is currently funding a project in support of the reform of the Colombian military justice system, aimed at making it more transparent and accountable. One of the additional objectives of the reforms is to ensure there is a very clear delineation between those cases where military justice procedures are applicable and those that should be dealt with by civilian courts. The subordination of the military justice system to the civil system is fundamental to this reform process. We will continue to work with the Colombian authorities to help improve this key area of governance.</p>

	<p pid="e.323W.2/1">The political and security situation in Guinea is worrying. Economic stagnation and uncertainty over the transition from the current regime leaves the potential for conflict. The withdrawal of opposition and civil society from national social dialogue is also of concern, and reduces the prospects of a constitutional transition of power. A ministerial reshuffle took place on <phrase class="date" code="">30 May</phrase> and we will be monitoring the progress of this new team.</p>
	<p pid="e.323W.2/2">We are engaging with EU and the Economic Community of West African states partners to open a better dialogue with the political and military authorities in Guinea. At the International Contact Group Meeting on the Mano River Basin in Vienna on <phrase class="date" code="">23 May</phrase>, the UK welcomed the regional focus on contingency planning and agreed the need for further EU engagement, including organising a seminar series in Guinea on democratic culture.</p>

She would have been subject to deportation.

The judge later amended his original decision, choosing instead to issue a recommendation advising the Interior Ministry to allow Ms Maynard to enter the country until <phrase class="date" code="">28 May</phrase>. The Interior Ministry declined the judge's suggestion. Ms Maynard was told she could take the matter to another judge, but Ms Maynard chose instead to return to the UK and departed on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="">25 May</phrase>.</p>

Officials have started work to understand the possible future threats, develop more precise options and assess their costs.

We are currently in discussions with EU and other partners about the scope for collectively monitoring the elections.

	<p pid="e.341W.2/1">There is no censorship of the Sri Lankan press which, generally reports freely. The public have a wide choice of print and electronic media sources from which to choose. However, we are deeply concerned about the recent attack on a newspaper office in Jaffna that killed two staff. This is the latest incidence of threats and violence directed at journalists in Sri Lanka. We have raised the issue of press freedom with the Sri Lankan Government as well as our concern at the use of violence and intimidation more widely.</p>

	<p pid="e.342W.2/1">We are deeply concerned at the recent escalation in violence in Sri Lanka. We condemn all forms of violence and intimidation. We urge the Liberation of Tamil Tigers Eilam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfil the commitments they made in Geneva in February. The Government pledged that no armed group or person other than Government security forces would carry arms or conduct armed operations. The LTTE pledged to take all necessary measures to ensure that there would be no acts of violence against the security forces and police. Both sides made a commitment to ensure that there will be no intimidation, acts of violence, abductions or killings.</p>
	<p pid="e.342W.2/2">The LTTE is a proscribed organisation in Britain and is likely also to be listed by the EU as a terrorist organisation. We urge the LTTE to renounce violence and pursue a political solution.</p>
	<p pid="e.342W.2/3">We call on the Government of Sri Lanka to do all in their power to ensure the safety and wellbeing of their population. And to ensure that any suspected human rights abuses are fully investigated in an open and transparent way.</p>
	<p pid="e.342W.2/4">We continue to believe that dialogue is the only way to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Sri Lanka. Violence cannot solve internal differences nor bring sustainable peace. All sides need to exercise restraint and act in a constructive and patient way. We fully support the Norwegian facilitated peace talks and will continue to work for a settlement that takes full account of the legitimate demands of all communities within a democratic and stable Sri Lanka.</p>

It is important for the Government and the military to adhere fully to international humanitarian law, and accepted rules of conduct and engagement. They must demonstrate that no-one is above the law and that members of the armed forces do not enjoy impunity. We are also concerned at the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam's failure to halt the violence despite their public commitments at the peace talks in Geneva in February to do so. Both sides must follow through on the implementation of their commitments. Violence against the civilian population can never be justified.</p>

It remains to be seen what will happen in the longer term. The African Union's mission to Darfur is responsible for reporting any breaches of the ceasefire to the Ceasefire Commission. We continue to call on all parties to rein in their fighters and bring an end to the conflict.</p>

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is also responsible in the enforcement of relevant export control legislation. The Export Control Organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry acts as licensing body for all strategic exports from the UK and currently has a dedicated staff complement of 110.

	<p pid="e.350W.12/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services, which could include patient transport services, to such extent as they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. It is, therefore, for the local national health service to decide who provides patient transport services for eligible patients in their area.</p>
	<p pid="e.350W.12/2">A range of different providers may and do provide patient transport services, for example the local ambulance service, private or voluntary sector providers, or a combination of these organisations. It is for PCTs to ensure that that they are getting the best service for the best price. The ambulance review &quot;Taking Healthcare to the Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services&quot; set out our intention to develop a system of accreditation of independent ambulance providers, which should help PCTs further in making this assessment.</p>

There are not separate expenditure lines for DACs within PCT accounts and there has been no single funding stream. DACs have instead been funded through a variety of mechanisms as part of the non-discretionary general dental services and PCT-led personal dental service pilots. A separate breakdown of DAC expenditure and allocations would be available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The profile of safe use, storage and disposal of medicines has been raised through NHS Direct's website and the NHS Direct section of the Thompson local directory, which is issued to all households. We are also in discussion with NHS Direct to develop a leaflet, which professionals can give to members of the public when they are prescribed controlled drugs to ensure that they understand the importance of taking these medicines, and also to encourage them to return unused and unwanted medicines to pharmacies for safe disposal. We take every appropriate opportunity to communicate messages of safe use and disposal of medicines in our communication strategy.</p>

	<p pid="e.373W.5/1">There is no need to include a non-discrimination clause in the Bill to amend the Mental Health Act because the legislation must work in conjunction with other non-discrimination legislation, including the Race Relations Act, which prohibits any discrimination on racial grounds including race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins, and the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>
	<p pid="e.373W.5/2">However, while there is no need to duplicate this principle in primary legislation, we recognise the need to ensure that this important principle is understood and adhered to by those who use the Mental Health Act.

	<p pid="e.374W.3/1">There are a number of policies which were in the 2004 draft Mental Health Bill which we are not intending to take forward in the proposed Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 1983. Our intention with the proposed amending Bill is to focus on the main priorities in terms of modernising mental health legislation. Some of the policies which will not be in the amending Bill may be taken forward through other means.</p>
	<p pid="e.374W.3/2">For example, we are using our programme on risk management to promote the importance of care planning and we intend to use the Code of Practice to provide guidance on many issues, such as the importance of information sharing between agencies involved in a patient's care. We may also use other legislative vehicles to introduce some of the changes previously planned. For example, we are currently considering the possibility of using other legislation to provide a second tier appellate structure allowing for appeals to be heard within the tribunal system but this will not be specific to mental health, and to improve the monitoring functions of the Mental Health Act Commission. We will also be exploring the scope for clarifying the safeguards for children, if necessary through the amendment of existing regulations and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="e.374W.3/3">In terms of the changes we are planning to make to the 1983 Act, these may involve some new powers to make secondary legislation. In particular, we are intending to improve patient safeguards by increasing the speed and frequency of the Mental Health Review Tribunal's consideration of cases for all civil patients treated under the Act, by taking an order making power.</p>

	<p pid="e.380W.0/1">National health service priorities for 2005 to 2008 are set out in &quot;National Standards, Local Action: Health and Social Care Standards and Planning Framework 2005-06-2007-08&quot;, and are available from the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a>. These detail healthcare standards, existing commitments and new national targets. The standards themselves will be taken into account by primary care trusts and other national health service organisations providing NHS care directly, in all settings, and aim to safeguard and raise quality and safety across the board.</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/2">The operating framework, published by the Department in January, sets out the NHS's specific business and financial arrangements for 2006-07. It, identifies six priorities for local delivery plans which will require particular attention in 2006-07, to ensure delivery of national targets by 2008 and beyond:</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;health inequalities, focusing on life expectancy at birth by focusing initially on smoking cessation;</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/4" class="indent">achieving a maximum waiting time of two months (62 days) from urgent referral to treatment and one month (31 days) from diagnosis to treatment for all cancers;</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/5" class="indent">achieving an 18-week maximum wait from general practitioner referral to hospital treatment by 2008;</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/6" class="indent">achieving year-on-year reductions in methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) levels as set out in the agreed local delivery plans for 2006-07;</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/7" class="indent">ensuring that all hospital appointments can be booked for patients' convenience through choose and book and that every patient is offered a choice of four or more providers; and</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/8" class="indent">improving access to genitor-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics so that by 2008 all people referred to GUM clinics can have an appointment within 48 hours&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.0/9">The six priorities do not include mental health. We have also made it very clear to primary care trusts and their partner organisations that they are expected to deliver the existing mental health commitments by their target dates, and to maintain that level of performance beyond the target date. This will be monitored by the Healthcare Commission's annual health check. Thanks to the strong emphasis we put on improving mental health services since publishing the NHS Plan in 2000, very significant progress has been made to date.</p>

	<p pid="e.385W.5/1">Research evidence shows, that apart from the benefits to oral health, the only negative effect of adding fluoride to drinking water to a level of one part per million is on the incidence of dental fluorosis. In 2003, the independent expert advisory committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment (COT), issued a report &quot;Fluorine in the 1997 Total Diet Study&quot;, which noted that fluoride intakes of formula-fed infants may exceed the</p>
	<p pid="e.385W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;no observed adverse effect level&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.385W.5/3">for dental fluorosis. However, COT concluded that infants are at lesser risk of dental fluorosis than older children because the critical time for development of aesthetically significant dental fluorosis is during formation of the permanent teeth at age three to four. COT went on to recommend that more research is needed to determine the impact of the cosmetic effect of dental fluorosis on the affected individual and on any possible long-term health outcomes in people affected by dental fluorosis.</p>

	<p pid="e.398W.5/1">Racist attacks on hospital staff are not currently recorded as a specific statistic. They are however subsumed within the Department's monitoring of violent attacks on health and personal social services staff figures as both verbal and physical abuse. The Department is actively addressing the issue of racist attacks and has commissioned research which is being carried out by the Institute for Conflict Research.</p>

	<p pid="e.398W.8/1">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) has a contingency plan in place to ensure that any outbreak of Avian Influenza is dealt with quickly and effectively. If there is an outbreak in domestic poultry, infected birds and dangerous contacts will be culled. As part of the ongoing testing of the plan, culling has been tested on two separate occasions with a further exercise planned over the summer. Vaccination offers potential benefits in disease control but preventive vaccination of poultry is not the most effective defence. At UK-level, a plan is in place for a possible vaccination programme for zoo birds for conservation purposes, based on veterinary risk assessment, and 2.3 million doses of vaccine have been obtained for this purpose. DARD's policy on the wider use of vaccination will be kept under review in the light of scientific developments in vaccines.</p>

	<p pid="e.406W.3/1">The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) has considered the case for bowel screening and recommended that a population programme should be introduced. As a consequence, England and Scotland have announced their intention to introduce a bowel cancer screening programme.</p>

However, this will have a significant effect on current services for those showing possible symptoms of bowel cancer. Before a similar programme could be implemented in Northern Ireland there is a need to consider the current capacity and pressure on the symptomatic bowel service and to identify other issues which need to be addressed, including additional capacity required, training and accreditation of colonoscoptists and units.</p>
	<p pid="e.406W.3/3">A workshop has therefore been arranged for <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-20">20 June 2006</phrase> to explore the issues and identify the steps and actions required in the symptomatic service in order to prepare for a bowel screening programme.</p>

	<p pid="e.409W.9/1">The report of the Fit Futures taskforce on tackling obesity in children and young people was published in March of this year. The report included over 70 recommendations designed to deliver the public service agreement target to stop the increase in levels of obesity in children by 2010. A response from the Ministerial Group on Public Health to the report, including a comprehensive, cross-departmental implementation plan is currently being developed.</p>
	<p pid="e.409W.9/2">Action to address key recommendations has, however, already commenced. The Department of Education, in conjunction with the -Education and Library Boards, began the implementation of New Nutritional Standards for School Meals in September 2005. Over 800 schools are now participating in this initiative and the remainder will be included by the end of 2006. Under the Extended Schools element of the Children and Young People funding package, &pound;10 million is available each year in the period 2006-08 for allocation to schools in disadvantaged areas. The focus of Extended Schools will include healthy lifestyles and tackling childhood obesity.</p>
	<p pid="e.409W.9/3">As part of the Sport in Our Community Programme, the Sports Council for Northern Ireland is making a major investment to encourage more children to develop the basic physical movement skills required to facilitate sustained involvement in sport and a healthy and active lifestyle. In addition, the Health Promotion Agency has launched &quot;Every Step is a Forward Step&quot;, to promote the health benefits of physical activity and to encourage members of the public to undertake regular, moderate physical activity.</p>

	<p pid="e.414W.2/1">The enriched curriculum is primarily a pedagogical approach to teaching and learning for children in years one and two of statutory education. It is designed to be sensitive to the way young children learn naturally and to provide greater flexibility in how children learn at an early age. It is not possible to make a direct comparison in the cost of delivery of the enriched curriculum and traditional curriculum, as there are other contributory factors, such as school size and type and involvement in other initiatives that influence costs in any individual school.</p>

	<p pid="e.414W.8/1">The Enriched Curriculum pilot arose from concerns expressed by teachers in the Shankill area, where the traditional curriculum was not meeting the needs of their pupils. The external evaluation by Queens University was undertaken on a longitudinal basis. It compares the achievements of Enriched Curriculum pupils and traditional curriculum pupils in different classes within the same school. The findings are that children in the Enriched Curriculum in Shankill schools benefit from the approach. Their educational achievements are at least of the same standard as those taking the traditional curriculum by the end of Year 4, and in addition they demonstrate increased self-esteem, confidence, oral skills and enjoyment of learning.</p>

	<p pid="e.418W.5/1">A strategy for addressing domestic violence in Northern Ireland, &quot;Tackling Violence at Home&quot;, was launched in October 2005. The strategy is aimed at providing protection and support to all victims of domestic violence, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. All victims can seek information and advice through the free-phone Domestic Violence Helpline and male victims are sign-posted to organisations that provide services for men, such as the Men's Advisory Project, Men-to-Men or the Rainbow Project. Any victim of a domestic assault can seek protection from the police who will investigate, arrest the alleged abuser if power exists and prosecute where there is evidence of a crime. Alternatively a victim can engage a solicitor and apply to a court for a civil order (a non-molestation order and/or an occupation order) to prevent further abuse or exclude the abuser from the family home. There are 12 Women's Aid Refuges for women and children fleeing domestic violence. There are no refuges in operation specifically for male victims of domestic violence given the small numbers involved but men may seek assistance from the Housing Executive who will offer the full range of homelessness services including supported or unsupported temporary accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="e.432W.11/1">The Government are taking the issue of pandemic flu very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) believes the United Kingdom to be one of the best prepared countries in the world for dealing with a pandemic influenza.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/3">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) has been working on pandemic influenza plans for two years. These dovetail with the UK National Plan and are based on the framework recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for national pandemic plans.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/4">Health and Social Services Boards and Trusts within Northern Ireland have also developed contingency plans based on the DHSSPS plan.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/5">Antivirals will provide the first form of defence against a pandemic flu. In line with the rest of the UK we have ordered sufficient doses of antivirals to treat the predicted number of people who will become ill. The full supply is on target to be received here by September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/6">Vaccination will offer the best form of protection against pandemic flu but a vaccine cannot be manufactured until the exact flu strain is known. It will take around 4-6 months for Northern Ireland Office stocks to become available. Once the vaccine is available, Government plan to vaccinate the whole population.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/7">As a further precautionary measure, Government have ordered 3.5 million doses (and Northern Ireland will get its share) of the H5N1 vaccine as part of the work to prepare for and reduce the impact of a possible flu pandemic. The vaccine will be used to carry out further research and may also be used to vaccinate front line health care workers before a specific pandemic vaccine is developed.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/8">Integral to Government's preparedness on pandemic flu is surveillance. For the past four years Northern Ireland has had an enhanced surveillance scheme for human influenza operated by the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSDC NI) through a network of GP spotter practices. This enhanced surveillance will provide early warning of new viruses circulating here in NI and CDSC and will also link to the Health Protection Agency (UK) to provide timely information for the production of UK surveillance data in the event of a pandemic.</p>
	<p pid="e.432W.11/9">DHSSPS recently carried out a large-scale tabletop exercise to test its contingency plan. The report of the lessons learned will be available shortly.</p>

It is however possible to identify the median or mid-point waiting time band. Current median (average) waiting times for children waiting an initial paediatric cardiology outpatient assessment, in each applicable Health and Social Services Trust, are shown in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="e.447W.5/1">In Northern Ireland care for those suffering from perinatal mental health problems including psychiatric illness takes place at all levels within the health care system (psychiatric services, maternity and child welfare services and primary health care).</p>
	<p pid="e.447W.5/2">However, the ongoing Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disability has recommended that &quot;A regional specialist mental health services should be established for women with mental health problems occurring in the perinatal period&quot;. This is being considered in light of the wider findings of the review, which deals with a number of highly complex issues. I hope to publish my response to this and other recommendations of the review by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="e.456W.11/14">Psychology is commonly studied alongside other disciplines. Accordingly a procedure of apportionment is used from 2002-03 onwards to allocate students to specific subject areas, by dividing each headcount in a way that reflects the pattern of split programmes. The figures therefore refer to a full-person equivalent value. Prior to 2002-03, enrolments split equally between two or more subject areas were assigned to the combined subject group and are not included in this table.</p>

	<p pid="e.460W.0/1">The chief executive of roads service, Dr. Malcolm McKibbin has been asked to write to the hon. Lady in response to these questions.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.0/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland two Parliamentary Questions regarding how much Road Service funding has been allocated to each district council area in Northern Ireland in each of the last five financial years; and, how much Road Service funding has been allocated to (a) bridge strengthening programmes and (b) road maintenance and resurfacing in each district council area in Northern Ireland in each of the last five financial years.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.0/4" class="indent">I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.0/5" class="indent">The following table at Annex 1 shows the total expenditure incurred by Roads Service on capital (major and minor) road improvement schemes and on maintenance activities during the period 2000/01-2004/05. Expenditure details by district council area for 2005/06 are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.0/6" class="indent">In providing this information, I should like to emphasise that Roads Service does not simply apportion its total budget for capital and maintenance expenditure equally across district council areas. In particular, major road improvements are prioritised on a country-wide basis, not on a district council basis, taking account of a broad range of criteria such as strategic planning policy, traffic flows, number of accidents, potential travel save times, environmental impact and value for money. While the actual spend on a major works scheme may be within one council area, the benefits of such schemes are not confined to the district council area or constituency in which they are located.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.0/7" class="indent">The resources available for minor capital schemes are allocated to the four Roads Service Divisions and, in turn, apportioned across district council areas on a needs-based priority approach using indicators such as population, weighted road lengths and the number of accidents. -This ensures, so far as possible, an equitable distribution of funds across the country. Similarly the resources available for each maintenance activity (e.g. resurfacing, patching, gully emptying, grass cutting etc) are apportioned to district council areas using appropriate indicators of need.</p>
	<p pid="e.460W.0/8" class="indent">You also asked for a separate breakdown of funding in relation to bridge strengthening programmes and roads maintenance and resurfacing. The attached table at Annex 2 details the information per district council area in the years 2000/01-2004/05. Again, expenditure details by district council area for 2005/06 are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="e.476W.2/1">Translink has advised that, in line with passenger demand, minor route changes regularly occur. Recently more substantial alterations have been made to some Goldline service routes, specifically those operating between Coleraine, Larne, Ballymena and Belfast. Also, Coleraine itself has recently seen a major reorganisation of services in the Coleraine/Portrush/Portstewart areas. Following the introduction of the new Metro network in February 2005, Translink is now developing Metro Phase 2, which will extend Metro-type services to areas outside Greater Belfast.</p>
	<p pid="e.476W.2/2">In considering requests in relation to bus operational issues, particularly with regard to bus stops, Translink examines the individual locations in conjunction with other relevant authorities, ie Roads Service and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).</p>
	<p pid="e.476W.2/3">Roads Service, in conjunction with the PSNI, provides advice on road safety matters pertaining to the location of bus stops as and when requested. Where a demand to cross a particular road has been highlighted, Roads Service may carry out an assessment to ascertain whether the location may qualify for a pedestrian crossing. The assessment procedure takes into account the demand to cross the road, together with the difficulty crossing the road. Vulnerable road users are given extra weighting in the assessment. Pedestrian refuges may be provided at sites that do not qualify for a pedestrian crossing facility.</p>

This will simplify the registration and licensing process when vehicles move between Northern Ireland and other parts of the United Kingdom. The vehicle keeper will only need to notify a change of address. This could be in place as soon as October 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.484W.3/2">All these new charges will be phased in over three years so NIWL will not be fully self-financing until 2009-10. There will also be a low-income protection scheme in the form of an affordability tariff which will involve capping charges for eligible customers at an affordable level. The affordability tariff will ensure that eligible low-income households spend no more than 3 per cent. of their income on water and sewerage charges. As many as 200,000 households (30 per cent. of all households) in Northern Ireland who presently qualify for rate rebate, housing benefit or the new Northern Ireland rate relief scheme should benefit from this scheme. The affordability tariff will also extend to all 16 to 17-year-old householders and to children leaving care up to the age of 21. For those on low incomes, the affordability tariff will mean that no-one will pay more than &pound;180 regardless of the value of the property in which they live. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June 2006</phrase> the Government published draft legislation, entitled The Water and Sewerage Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, which will introduce important changes to the way water and sewerage services are delivered in Northern Ireland. Among other things the Draft Order sets out a framework for the levying of charges for water and sewerage services.</p>

	<p pid="e.484W.6/1">The chief executive of Water Service (Mrs. Katherine Bryan) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="e.484W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mrs. Katharine Bryan, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.484W.6/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about the cost to public funds of water lost through leaks in Northern Ireland in each of the last five years (74983). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="e.484W.6/4" class="indent">The estimated costs are set out in the table below. They are based on the additional operating costs, principally for power and chemicals, associated with supplying water above the economic level of leakage. The economic level of leakage is the point at which it would cost more to make further reductions than to produce water from an alternative source.</p>
