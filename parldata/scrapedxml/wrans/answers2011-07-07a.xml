The information should be treated with caution as it was intended for internal use only, and in the earlier years it may not have captured every agreement made under SOCPA.

	<p pid="a.1307W.2/1">The design and timing of the auction is a matter for Ofcom. Ofcom has consulted on this recently, proposing a 95% coverage obligation on one of the licences and are considering the responses calling for changes to their proposals. Ofcom is aiming to carry out an auction in the first half of 2012. If there is any legal challenge to the auction then that would be made to Ofcom. Given the benefits to the economy and to citizens and consumers, it is in the national interest that this spectrum is released as soon as possible. We would not welcome any further delay to the release of this spectrum. We would hope that any organisation that might consider legal action recognises the importance of carrying out the auction as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1307W.10/1">On <i>(a)</i>, nothing was spent on new furniture. In terms of <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i>, in May 2010, on the change of Government, it was apparent that Gwydyr House, a grade 2* listed building, was in need of a significant amount of work to make it structurally sound. A large office on the ground floor was unusable and most of the staff who had previously occupied the room had been temporarily evacuated to another building, as the room was occupied by acro props that were supporting a first floor office. The acro props had been installed following advice from a structural engineer that the condition of the building was unsafe, and work was subsequently carried out over the summer of 2010 to complete all the structural repairs, including the installation of steel beams to stabilise the floor that was at risk of collapse. Work also took place to address various health and safety and DDA compliance issues within Gwydyr House. Work was carried out after consultation with English Heritage, given the listed status of the building. The overall cost was &#163;185,000. Some redecoration was necessary as a consequence of the structural and other remedial work but it is not possible to separate out those costs as the redecoration was an integral part of much wider projects.</p>

The revocation of the Consular Fees Order 2010 and the Consular Fees (Amendment) Order 2010 will make minimal annual savings because the fees set out in these Orders have in general been replaced by the fees set out in the Consular Fees 2011 Order which envisaged no impact on the private or voluntary sectors.

	<p pid="a.1313W.2/2">It would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases. The Government's policy on disclosure in criminal proceedings is that investigators, prosecutors and defendants should adhere rigorously to the requirements of the disclosure laws (notably the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, as amended, and its accompanying codes of practice), upon which fair and efficient trials are founded. In January 2011, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) announced that it would carry out a review of the work conducted by the National Domestic Extremism Units. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (&#8216;IPCC&#8217;) is carrying-out a separate independent investigation into disclosure issues around a number of specific cases. The Director of Public Prosecutions has also commissioned a separate independent review of the CPS decisions on a specific case. The Government will consider very carefully any recommendations which may emerge from these reviews for changes to the disclosure laws.</p>

This proposal reflects my broad provisional assessment of the balance of economic benefits to the Liverpool City Region and the impact on fair competition with terminals elsewhere. The consultation provides an opportunity for respondents to express views on the economic, employment, tourism and other impacts of this proposed measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1317W.11/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Noel Shanahan</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/4">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assistance the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission gives to parents living in the UK in respect of outstanding maintenance payments owed by absent parents resident in the Irish Republic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/5">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) has jurisdiction to make a maintenance calculation and collect child support maintenance only when the parent with care, the non-resident parent and the qualifying child are all habitually resident in the UK. Habitual residence is a legal concept which means more than simply 'where you live'. A person can habitually reside in more than one country or in none. Habitual residence can continue during an absence from UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/6">The Commission retains the power to pursue a non-resident parent who moves overseas, including those that live in the Irish Republic, for ongoing maintenance payments, but only where the non-resident is regarded as being habitually resident in the UK. The criteria for establishing jurisdiction when a non-resident parent leaves the United Kingdom is described at Section 44 of the Child Support Act 1991. There is no distinction made between an EU state and a non-EU state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/7">If the non-resident parent ceases to be habitually resident, the Commission can no longer seek ongoing maintenance. We can only enforce child maintenance arrears directly if the non-resident parent holds assets within the UK, such as savings or property, which would fall within the jurisdiction of the UK courts. Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-03">3 August 2009</phrase>, the Commission has had the power to make deductions from current or savings accounts held within the UK without the consent of the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/8">The Commission may take action to prevent the non-resident parent disposing of his assets, from which the Commission could recover the arrears. The Commission may apply to the High Court (England and Wales) or the Court of Session (Scotland) if a non-resident parent has arrears of child support; and have disposed of, or is about to dispose of, assets with the intention of avoiding child support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/9">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-18">18 June 2011</phrase>, the Commission will have some ability under the new European legislation EC EU 04/2009 to enforce certain arrears of maintenance that accrued while both parents were resident in the UK where the non-resident parent now resides in another jurisdiction within the European Union (except Denmark). It can also assist parents with care in the process of obtaining a court order for ongoing maintenance which can then be enforced via an application to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMO) unit at the Office of the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee. The new European legislation also allows the Commission to make enquiries about assets a non-resident parent may own in another E.U member state (except Denmark) for the purposes of enforcing child maintenance arrears owed in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317W.11/10">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1319W.2/1">The Social Fund consists of a regulated and a discretionary scheme.

Community Care Grants, Crisis and Budgeting Loans are part of the discretionary Social Fund scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1319W.2/2">The Social Fund does not routinely monitor or assess the extent to which money paid to claimants is used for the purposes set out in their applications because the high volume of payments made for the scheme, especially in relation to cold weather and winter fuel payments, make the cost of monitoring and assessing what payments are spent on prohibitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1319W.2/3">In relation to the Community Care Grant scheme, however, targeted pre-award visits based upon set risk criteria are made to confirm claimants needs prior to an award being made.

No new jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and housing benefit claims will be accepted. New claims for tax credits will continue to be accepted until April 2014. Detailed planning is still at an early stage, and the timetable and sequence for transition may change as a result.</p>

Any changes to the regulatory framework, including changes to the role and function of HEFCE and OFFA, as defined by these acts is likely to require primary legislation and secondary legislation. Over the summer we will consult on a new regulatory framework, which will set out clear and demanding conditions for an organisation to be recognised as a provider of higher education in England. As part of this consultation we will consider changes to the process and criteria for obtaining university title and taught degree-awarding powers. We are currently consulting on the potential introduction of an early repayment mechanism for student loans. Depending on the outcome of this consultation we may need to introduce primary and/or secondary legislation.</p>

In their response, made to Parliament as a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-06-07.8"><i>Official Report</i>, column 8WS</phrase>, the Government made clear that they accepted and welcomed Mr Bailey's analysis and the thrust of all the recommendations he has made, which will reduce the pressure on children to grow up too fast. The Government's policy on implementation of these recommendations was also set out in the written ministerial statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/2">Most of the recommendations of Mr Bailey's report are made to businesses, industry associations and the regulators. It is a matter for those organisations to decide how best to achieve the intended outcomes for each of the recommendations, although the Government look to them to see that these recommendations are implemented as fully as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/3">Mr Bailey has also recommended that the Government should consider strengthening the controls on music videos. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport will respond to this recommendation by consulting on the operation of the Video Recordings Act 1984 and 2010. The consultation will look at a range of options including consideration of whether it would be appropriate for the exemption that music videos enjoy from this legislation to be removed, and call for evidence in support of the costs and benefits of such a change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/4">Mr Bailey has placed the responsibility for action on businesses themselves and, if necessary, their regulators. The Government will actively monitor implementation of the recommendations, leading up to a full stock-take of progress in 18 months' time. At this point, we will consider what further measures may need to be taken to achieve the recommended outcomes, including considering statutory regulation if voluntary action has not been effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/5">I have already held a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-27">27 June</phrase> with representatives of many of the major businesses and regulators concerned to discuss how they propose to take action to implement the recommendations of the Bailey review. The Prime Minister has also announced that he will hold a similar meeting in October to review progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.1326W.2/4">Since 2005, maintained school inspections have been carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Ofsted records all judgements made by inspectors in section 5 inspections, including the judgement for overall effectiveness of the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1326W.2/5">Maintained schools inspected under section 5 include nursery, primary, secondary (including academies and city technology colleges), special schools and pupil referral units.</p>
	<p pid="a.1326W.2/6">Table A below shows the number of maintained schools judged to be outstanding for overall effectiveness at their section 5 inspection during the academic years 2007/08 to 2009/10 inclusive in Worcestershire local authority and Redditch constituency. Equivalent data have also been provided for England for context, and the table shows the total number of inspections in each of these areas in each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1326W.2/7">In September 2009, Ofsted implemented a policy of more proportionate inspection using risk assessment as an aid to scheduling the inspection of good and outstanding schools. We deliberately set out to inspect a greater proportion of previously satisfactory or inadequate schools each year and a smaller proportion of previously good or outstanding schools. The sample of schools inspected is therefore skewed and means that comparisons between years should be treated with caution as some differences are due to the very different sample of schools inspected during the different periods.</p>

The Youth Justice Board specifies staffing levels for individual institutions that are operated by NOMS on their behalf.</p>

	<p pid="a.1331W.0/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.0/2"><i>(a)</i> Commissioning responsibility for health services provided in the publicly run young offender institutions (YOIs) rests with NHS primary care trusts (PCTs). These services are subject to the same standards, regulation and governance as are applied in the wider NHS. Each PCT should decide which health care treatments and services to provide for its local population based on a full needs assessment, and commission these from NHS or independent sector providers. PCTs also decide on spending levels for specific health care treatments and services provided in all primary care settings, including staffing levels. The Department of Health (DH) does not ring-fence PCT money, and is not prescriptive about how individual PCTs spend their budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.0/3">In both the publicly run YOIs and in private YOIs, all young people are screened within 24 hours of arrival for any immediate needs including health care needs. Health services in all YOIs must comply with Prison Service Orders/Prison Service Instructions and any relevant DH and NHS guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.0/4">24 hour health care is provided at private YOIs. Health services must also be of an equivalent standard to those available in the community. There are full-time medical staff on site to provide regular assessment and health care and in addition there are visiting doctors, dentists and specialists. Any young person involved in an incident or a restraint will be seen immediately by a nurse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.0/5">Young people will also be taken outside to local NHS services where required for emergency or specialist treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.0/6"><i>(b)</i> Medical and nursing care is available every day on a 24-hour basis within Secure Training Centres (STCs). Contractual provisions require that a qualified nurse must be on site at each STC during the day and early evening and on call at all other times; and that a young person who requests to see a health care worker will be seen by a qualified nurse or medical practitioner within 30 minutes of making his/her request. Any young person involved in an accident or emergency will receive immediate medical attention. Young people are also entitled to a basic monthly medical examination and/or health assessment by health care staff at the STC and have access to NHS facilities and specialists when clinically required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.0/7"><i>(c)</i> Secure Children's Homes (SCH) are regulated by The Children's Homes Regulations 2001 which are made under the Care Standards Act 2000. Under Regulation 20, each child must be registered with a GP, have access to health services that s/he may require and be provided with the necessary support for their health needs. Additionally, at least one person on duty in the SCH must have a suitable first aid qualification and any appointed nurse must be registered. The National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Children's Homes are issued under section 23 of the Care Standards Act 2000. These standards are to enable individual providers to develop their own particular ethos and approach to practice. For example, standard 6 of the NMS state that all children's homes (which include SCHs) must promote good health and wellbeing of young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.0/8">It has been agreed by the Department of Health and Ministry of Justice that commissioning responsibility for health services in STCs and SCHs with youth justice commissioned beds, will transfer to the NHS. The Ministry of Justice is also working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that the changes to the NHS proposed in the Health and Social Care Bill (regarding the responsibilities of the National Commissioning Board for those in prison and in custody) will further enhance commissioning of health services in the youth secure estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1333W.2/1">The Government support the European Semester as an important development in the EU's overall surveillance framework. The treaty sets out (article 121) that member states shall regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and shall co-ordinate them within the Council. However, under the terms of the UK's protocol to the treaty, the United Kingdom only has to &#8220;endeavour to avoid&#8221; excessive government deficits; all other member states are obliged to &#8220;avoid&#8221; them. Moreover, because of our opt-out, sanctions cannot apply to the UK under the excessive deficit procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333W.2/2">It is important to note that any recommendations adopted by the ECOFIN Council and addressed to the UK are non-binding. When making plans for the annual Budget, the Chancellor routinely considers assessments made by international partners, such as the OECD and IMF, as well as representations from businesses and individuals. He will of course similarly consider the final recommendations of the EU's ECOFIN Council.</p>

The content of both documents was drawn entirely from information already in the public domain, including the 2011 Budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.1334W.9/6">However, ONS is unable to provide an answer to your question as the business register, upon which the estimates are based, is compiled using information from the VAT trader and PAYE administrative systems. As the VAT registration threshold for 2008/09 was &#163;67,000 per year the feed for the business register from the VAT system will have poor coverage of businesses whose turnover was below &#163;25,000. Furthermore, businesses with very low turnover are unlikely to operate a PAYE scheme leaving the PAYE feed also deficient as a measure of the target businesses.</p>

They enable purchasers to streamline ordering processes, for example removing the need to raise a purchase order, and ensure Government meet their prompt payment initiatives.</p>

We are now working with each of the card providers to provide a consistent method of reporting government procurement card spend data for transactions above &#163;500 in value, so this is available for publication on/via departmental websites, from the end of September 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1337W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.2/2">The retail prices index (RPI) and consumer prices index (CPI) are not measures of official statistics, but are headline measures of price inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.2/3">In December 2003, the Government announced that the inflation target would be based on the CPI rather than the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX).</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.2/4">In June 2010 the Government announced that from April 2011 the consumer prices index (CPI) rather than the retail prices index (RPI) will be used for the indexation of all benefits, tax credits and public service pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.2/5">Budget 2011 announced that from April 2012 the default indexation assumption for direct taxes will switch from the RPl to the CPI. To ensure employers and older people do not lose out, the annual increases in the employer national insurance contributions threshold, and the age-related allowance and other thresholds for older people, will be over-indexed compared to the CPI, and will increase by the equivalent of the RPl. The personal allowance will increase from 2013-14 by at least the equivalent of the RPl, until the Government's goal of increasing the personal allowance to &#163;10,000 is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.2/6">The default indexation assumption for indirect taxes and index-linked gilts is currently RPl. The Government expect to undertake a formal consultation on the issuance of CPI-linked gilts in 2011-12. The Government will also review the use of the CPI for indirect taxes once their fiscal consolidation plans have been implemented and the duty increases they inherited from the previous Government have come to an end.</p>

	<p pid="a.1348W.5/1">No such assessment has been made. It is for the national health service locally to decide how best to meet the needs of its local populations and in doing so they are free to commission a wide range of psychotherapeutic services. In addition, the Department recommends evidence-based, and preferably National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) approved, therapies for the treatment of common mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.5/2">Following the publication of NICE guidelines for depression in October 2009, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapy programme are now beginning to offer a choice of four new NICE approved therapies for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in addition to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. They are: Interpersonal Psychotherapy, Counselling for Depression, Dynamic Interpersonal Therapy, and Couples Therapy for Depression.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-07-07a.64350.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-07-07a.1350W.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40288" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="1350W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/text/110707w0002.htm#11070762001417">
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/1">Stop smoking services are the most common locally commissioned service under the community pharmacy contractual framework. For example, in 2009-10, 5,612 stop smoking services were provided locally by community pharmacies. Recent initiatives to improve the impact of pharmacies in their smoking cessation activities include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/2">The Department worked closely with pharmacy partners across England between January and March 2011 to pilot a new approach to distributing the NHS Quit Kit&#8212;a box of practical tools and support that have been developed to help smokers quit for good.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/3">Through the Department and the Cabinet Office Behaviour Change Unit, the Government are collaborating with Boots to pilot and assess the use of behavioural insights alongside improvement to the quality and length of services provided within the NHS-commissioned stop smoking service provided by Boots.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/4">The results will help inform how publicly-commissioned pharmacy local stop smoking services providers can best develop their service offer to help smokers to quit in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/5">In early 2009, the Department commissioned Portsmouth Primary Care Trust (PCT) to develop an evidence-based commissioning framework based on public health need for healthy living pharmacies (HLPs). By May 2011, seven out of 38 pharmacies in Portsmouth have been awarded HLP status. These pharmacies have to demonstrate consistent, high-quality delivery of a range of services such as stopping smoking, weight management, emergency hormonal contraception, Chlamydia screening, advice on alcohol and reviews of the use of their medicines. Interim results indicate that community pharmacies have delivered a total of 664 smoking quits, which exceeds the PCTs annual target of 480 by 38%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/6">The Department has commissioned the provision of an evidence-based training and assessment programme from the NHS Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training that is freely available to pharmacists and their teams, and other health care professionals, and which leads to significant improvements in the support offered to smokers wanting to quit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1351W.2/1">&#8220;The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011/12&#8221; sets out that, to improve outcomes from radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients, commissioners should develop local plans to ensure that access rates to radiotherapy and the use of advanced radiotherapy techniques, such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), are appropriate for their populations. The National Cancer Action Team has been working with providers to support the development of IMRT services and, at this time, 20 of the 28 cancer networks have at least one provider offering IMRT.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351W.2/2">It is not possible to identify IMRT from other forms of radiotherapy treatment within the Hospital Episode Statistics available to the Department. The Department is working with the national health service to implement a national radiotherapy dataset, and the dataset project team is working with providers to improve collection of data on IMRT.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351W.2/3">Release of the radiotherapy dataset is governed by the Radiotherapy Clinical Information Group (RCIG). RCIG has decided to produce a report on the dataset collection for 2009-10, which is due for publication shortly. RCIG also planning to release the full dataset via the cancer commissioning toolkit (CCT) by the end of the year. The CCT gives commissioners access to high quality data about cancer services across the treatment pathway, allows providers and commissioners to benchmark their performance against one another and supports commissioners to deliver cancer services for local populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351W.2/4">To support the commissioning of radiotherapy services in the reformed NHS, we will shortly be publishing a transitional update to the Cancer Commissioning Guidance, first published in January 2009. This best practice document sets out key issues and questions that commissioners and cancer network teams will wish to take into consideration when assessing local health needs and when reviewing cancer services. The guidance is intended to complement the CCT.</p>

	<p pid="a.1355W.10/5">As the Secretary of State reported to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-23">23 June</phrase> (Official Report, column 24WS), the current estimate of the net additional costs of military operations for six months in support of Operation Ellamy&#8212;the United Kingdom's contribution to coalition operations in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973&#8212;is in the region of &#163;120 million. This excludes costs associated with capital munitions expended. You asked specifically about the costs of operating aircraft from Italy which, I am afraid, can not be broken out separately as the information is not held in that format.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.10/6">Based upon current consumption rates we estimate the cost of replenishing munitions may be up to &#163;140 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.10/7">You also asked about the cost of moving and operating an aircraft carrier off the coast of Libya. As the UK does not currently maintain a carrier strike capability we have not prepared cost estimates for a hypothetical scenario. Historic costs for the previous capability are not a good guide as it is impossible to know how NATO would have used such a capability if it had been available and offered, whether alongside or instead of the British aircraft currently contributing to the operation. Hence it is impossible to estimate some key cost drivers such as weapons expenditure and flying hours.</p>

Over 500 contracts across 100 programmes are estimated to be affected and the Ministry of Defence is examining over 300 of these in the first instance. We expect the process of renegotiation to take around 18 months, with the initial focus being on those contracts which will deliver the highest savings in 2011-12. We have already renegotiated around 30 contracts with BAE Systems and Rolls Royce relating to the Nimrod and Harrier programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1357W.2/1">The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft programme is making good progress and remains within its approved performance, cost and time boundaries. The first two aircraft, Airbus A330-200, converted to military specification are currently undergoing flight testing. At RAF Brize Norton, Air Tanker Ltd has built a hangar and operations centre, maintenance and training facilities. These have been completed ahead of schedule in readiness for introduction to service later in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.2/2">The current forecast whole life cost is &#163;12 billion; this includes the private finance initiative (PFI) contract cost and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) costs, such as fuel and RAF manpower that fall outside the PFI contract. The flexibility within the contract allows the MOD to optimise value for money by exploiting the aircraft to the utmost. We are also investigating options with internal partners on how best to utilise any spare capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.2/3">Under the PFI contract 14 aircraft will be available to the MOD by September 2016. These will be made available incrementally with the first aircraft being introduced into service in late 2011. The air-to-air refuelling capability will be available with the first aircraft in 2011 and is on schedule to meet the approved in-service date for air-to-air refuelling of 2014 with the delivery of the ninth aircraft. The final five aircraft will be delivered up to September 2016.</p>

	<p pid="a.1373W.0/1">The Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Cabinet Office are currently considering what Government resources will be committed to the review of the Japanese response to the Fukushima emergency, including possible engagement with independent experts. This review was recommended by the Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations in his interim report on the implications for the UK nuclear industry of the Fukushima incident (the &#8216;Weightman Report&#8217;). The Office for Nuclear Regulation's costs in preparing the Weightman Report have been met from its existing budget, which is largely recovered from industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.0/2">The Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group (NEPLG) will play an important role in the Government's response to the events at Fukushima. The group, which is resourced by Departments and agencies nationally, is currently reviewing the capacity and capability of the UK's nuclear emergency response arrangements to effectively manage a prolonged nuclear emergency, caused by a UK or overseas incident. The NEPLG is a national forum, which brings together organisations with an interest in off-site planning for an emergency at civil nuclear sites, including licensed site operators, and representatives from local authorities and the emergency services. Under its terms of reference, the group agrees improvements in planning, procedure and organisation which might form a framework of advice to nuclear operators, the emergency services and those other organisations that may be involved in the response to a nuclear emergency.</p>

These are barriers which hamper people from accessing life saving prevention and treatment. The coalition Government work to address these barriers through our bilateral and multilateral support to combat tuberculosis (TB). For example, in advance of its 11th funding round, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), which is the largest single provider of international funds to fight TB, issued guidance on taking a rights based approach to the design of TB programmes. It also recommends that countries specifically consider activities and programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination in their TB proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.1383W.2/1">We estimate that around 10 million people in the Horn of Africa are currently in need of emergency relief. About half of those are in Ethiopia, and the other half split between Kenya and Somalia. A large proportion of those in need are women and children. Nutritional surveys in southern and south eastern parts of the region indicate prevailing rates of malnutrition above emergency thresholds. The situation in the Somali refugee camps is especially concerning. Acute child malnutrition among new arrivals to camps in Kenya and Ethiopia is running at 33-40%, more than double emergency levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383W.2/2">The UK's humanitarian response to the crisis is specifically targeting women and children. Our new contribution to the World Food Programme in Ethiopia will help ensure that 329,000 malnourished children and pregnant and lactating mothers receive supplementary food. Ongoing UK support to Kenya and Somalia since October 2010 has been used to treat acute malnutrition in more than 140,000 children and 17,500 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1383W.5/1">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports there are now more than 394,000 Somali refugees in Kenya. The situation is now an emergency in the Dadaab refugee camps, with 1,300 new arrivals reported daily in the last two weeks. Congestion and conditions remain unacceptable.
