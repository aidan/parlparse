	<p pid="c.917W.9/1">My Department contributes data on energy consumption to the Northern Ireland Public Sector Energy Committee annual report. The most up-to-date figures on carbon emissions from energy consumption are contained in the 2005-06 PSEC report and show estimated emissions as being 1,434,000 kg CO2; this is a reduction of 11 per cent. from 2004-05 figures. During this period 17 per cent. of our electricity came from renewable sources; overall, 9 per cent. of our energy came from renewable sources. We have recently invested in biomass heating and solar energy generation at Hillsborough Castle. No figures are available prior to 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="c.917W.9/2">Since April 2006 emissions from central Government ministerial and official air travel has been offset through the Government carbon offsetting fund. Departmental aviation emissions are calculated on an annual basis and subsequently offset through payments to the fund. The fund purchases certified emissions reduction credits from energy efficiency and renewable energy projects with sustainable development benefits, located in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.923W.2/2">The UK Film Council provides funding aimed at bringing a wider choice of films to cinemas with a specific emphasis on British films.</p>
	<p pid="c.923W.2/3">For example, they have rolled out the digital screen network, providing 240 screens nationwide with state of the art digital projection equipment in return for a commitment to screen more British films. The success of the first Summer of British Film season this year, with seven classic British films digitally restored and shown in cinemas, is a direct result of this initiative.</p>
	<p pid="c.923W.2/4">The UK Film Council has invested a further &pound;2.5 million to assist the distribution of 53 British films and co-productions. They have given &pound;45 million from the national lottery to British film production, resulting in worldwide revenues of &pound;410 million since.</p>
	<p pid="c.923W.2/5">The UK Film Council also gives &pound;7.9 million a year to regional film bodies across England (e.g. Film London), all working to create a clear film strategy for each English region and provide cash support for production.</p>
	<p pid="c.923W.2/6">Government have also established a new tax relief framework which directly targets filmmakers producing cultural British films. As of September this year more than 100 films were certified as British for the new tax relief, more than 30 claims had been received by HMRC and around &pound;35 million of tax credit had been paid out.</p>

	<p pid="c.932W.6/1">The Department is committed to helping to achieve the ambitious targets set by the Government to halve child poverty by 2010 on the way to eradicating it by 2020. Significant progress has been made with 600,000 children lifted out of relative poverty since 1998-99 but there remains much more to be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.6/2">Work, for those who can, remains the best and most sustainable route out of poverty and this sits at the heart of the Department's child poverty strategy. In March 2007 the Department published its refreshed child poverty strategy &quot;Working for Children&quot; which focuses around three broad themes. These are: increasing support for lone parents through increased rights and responsibilities; helping people to stay in work and make progress in their jobs; and increasing the family focus of employment programmes. In &quot;Ready for Work: Full employment in our generation&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-13">13 December</phrase> as a result of the responses to our Green Paper &quot;In Work, Better Off: next steps to full employment&quot;, we have announced increased support and obligations for lone parents who are claiming income support solely based on being a lone parent. They will have to move onto a more appropriate benefit when their youngest child is aged 12 and over from October 2008; 10 and over from October 2009; and seven and over from October 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.934W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked Lesley Strathie to reply to your questions asking how many telephone calls have been made to the St Austell call centre by benefit recipients through the Job Centre Plus office in Stroud. Specifically, how many are using outside lines but registered through the Stroud office in each week since it opened, and when he plans to make an evaluation of the effectiveness of the call centre at St Austell. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Ms Strathie as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. I am replying in her absence as Acting Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.5/4" class="indent">The centre in St Austell is not a call centre but a Benefit Delivery Centre (BDC), dealing with the assessment of customers' claims to benefit. Although BDCs do have records of call volumes by benefit, the telephony system in place does not record where the customer is calling from. I am therefore unable to answer your question about the number of calls made by our Stroud customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.5/5" class="indent">In line with every Benefit Delivery Centre, St Austell reviews its performance on a regular basis. St Austell is currently meeting Actual Average Clearance Time targets for Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support and Incapacity Benefit claims.</p>

The guidance outlines that an ADZ can only be designated jointly with the police force, and we would not expect therefore to receive representations from local authorities until final ratification of the statutory instrument in Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.949W.11/2">Section 96 of the Police Act 1996 placed a statutory duty on police authorities to make arrangements for obtaining the views of people in the force area about matters concerning the policing of the area. It is for police authorities to determine locally the methods they adopt to consult with the community. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established partnerships between police, local authorities, fire and rescue authorities, Primary Care Trusts in England and Local Health Boards in Wales and police authorities. Under new regulations that came into effect in August 2007, partnerships are required to consult and engage with their communities to identify local crime and disorder priorities, as part of a new set of minimum standards. Partnerships are also required to identify ways in which their communities can support the delivery of those priorities. These new requirements will ensure that local communities are able to influence, and be involved in, crime reduction work at the local level.</p>

	<p pid="c.955W.2/1">For the purposes of this reply, the answer gives details of requests made by England and Wales; requests from Scotland and Northern Ireland are matters for the Scotland Office and Northern Ireland Office respectively. Extradition requests in England and Wales originate with the prosecuting authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.955W.2/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>, extradition between the UK and European Union has been conducted under the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), which was given effect in the UK by Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003. The other EU member states have been designated under Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003 at regular intervals. A separate table sets out the statistics for the EAW.</p>
	<p pid="c.955W.2/3">If an extradition request was sent to a member state before that state began operating the EAW, the request will continue to be dealt with under the arrangements in place with that state when the request was made.</p>

	<p pid="c.959W.3/1">Legislation will shortly be introduced to require carriers to provide Travel Document Information (TDI) together with Passenger Name Record data (PNR) (otherwise known as Other Passenger Information (OPI) to e-Borders to the extent that it is known to the carrier.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/2">From March 2008 those carriers which provide OPI data under existing arrangements to Project Semaphore, the e-Borders pilot project, will be expected to continue to do so. The Government have funded transmission and transaction costs together with some systems change costs of participation in this pilot. Analysis of both OPI and TDI data has delivered significant operational benefits to border agencies, contributing to the arrest of individuals wanted for offences including murder, drug smuggling, rape and assault; and has led to the seizure of counterfeit travel documents, drugs and contraband. This arrangement however, was always with the understanding that the funding would cease in March 2008 and we will continue to fulfil our undertaking to industry to meet these costs until then.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/3">The e-Borders Programme will cover 95 per cent. of passenger movements by 2010 and is committed to using all reasonable efforts to achieve a fair roll out. This will be implemented progressively, in a consultative and collaborative manner with carriers and port operators.</p>

	<p pid="c.959W.6/14">Information on the NDNAD is recorded on the basis of the police force which took the DNA sample. The address of the person sampled is not recorded. Thus the figure for Suffolk (for example) includes people from outside Suffolk whose DNA was sampled by Suffolk police, and excludes people from Suffolk whose DNA was sampled by forces elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="c.959W.6/16">A certain number of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). At present, the replication rate is 13.7 per cent. i.e. the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.7 per cent. less than the number of profiles. The number of individuals shown is calculated on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.6/17">The national DNA database records the DNA profile for a particular individual. It does not hold data on whether people have been charged with an offence. This information is held on the police national computer. Obtaining information on the number of under-16s whose DNA was sampled by Suffolk police, who have been charged with a criminal offence, would require cross searching of records held on the PNC against the NDNAD, which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.961W.0/1">the latest six monthly Identity Cards Scheme Cost Report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November 2007</phrase>, sets out those elements of the cost estimates that relate specifically to passports, those specific to identity cards and those that are common to both. The cost of registering individuals for passports and ID cards is included in common costs because the same technology infrastructure and business processes will be used. In many cases, the same application will result in the issue of both a passport and an ID card.</p>

	<p pid="c.961W.0/5">A similar analysis of cost assumptions was undertaken previously in June 2007 to derive the proportion of costs that would be required under the scheme for biometric passport purposes. The June 2007 cost estimates, and the November 2007 cost report figures, are not comparable as they cover different time periods, as required under the ID Cards Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.961W.0/6">The details assumptions that underpin the Business Case and Cost Report of the National Identity Scheme are commercially sensitive.

Rather they operate under the departmental waste policies which stem from our commitment to the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate, published in June 2006 which require central Government Departments and their agencies to increase the amount of waste recycled to 40 per cent. of their waste arisings by 2010 and increase their recycling figures to 75 per cent. of their waste arisings by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="c.971W.2/2">Provisions in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (IAN Act 2006) and Police and Justice Act 2006 introduced new police powers to capture passenger, crew and service information on international and domestic air and sea journeys. The IAN Act 2006 also introduced a power to allow the police, Border and Immigration Agency and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to disclose passenger, crew, service and other travel related data, held by them, to the security and intelligence agencies, where those data are likely to be of use for their statutory purposes. The intention is that these powers will be brought into force by order in 2008. An order made under the Channel Tunnel Act 1987 will also be made to extend the police data acquisition and sharing powers to cover international train journeys. There is no secondary legislation planned that relates to the capture of data about individuals travelling by road.</p>

	<p pid="c.974W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary intends to introduce regulations in respect of the Police and Justice Act 2006 to give police authorities a greater role in the selection of their members, and reduce her own role. These regulations will also introduce measures to monitor appointments to ensure they are fair and transparent. The Mayor of London will also have an increased role under the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.974W.8/2">We also intend to introduce regulations to make police authority planning processes more efficient and streamlined and to ensure that police authorities <i> (a)</i> monitor the compliance of their forces with the Human Rights Act 1998 and with the authority's policing plan, <i> (b)</i> put in place arrangements that secure collaboration between police forces where this would be in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness and <i> (c)</i> promote diversity and equality within forces and authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.982W.2/1">Countering the threat posed by nuclear terrorism is part of the Government's wider counter-terrorism strategy (CONTEST). This involves a large number of wide ranging actions by the Security Services, the Police and Government; the exact details of which cannot be given for reasons of national security.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/2">However, three examples of the type of steps taken by Government to counter this specific threat are:</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/3" class="indent">1. The UK's Global Threat Reduction Programme which operates and extends a programme of collaboration and international assistance aimed at reducing the threat of proliferation of nuclear and radiological materials. The Programme enables a wide range of non-proliferation and threat reduction activities, ranging from making safe spent nuclear fuel assemblies to improving security at civilian nuclear sites.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/4" class="indent">2. Programme Cyclamen, which is the joint Home Office and HM Revenue and Customs programme to deploy radiation screening equipment at UK ports of entry. This aims to intercept the illicit movement of dangerous radiological and nuclear materials into the UK. Further details on this programme can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.982W.2/6" class="indent">3. The Home Office-led Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Resilience Programme, established in 2002 to ensure that in the event of a CBRN terrorist incident the response from all concerned will be quick and effective, so that lives can be saved and the impact on property and the environment minimised. This programme has delivered significant improvements in the emergency response to radiological and nuclear incidents. Further details on the programme can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.984W.2/1">We work closely with our EU partners to push for substantive improvements in the human rights situation in China, which includes raising concerns on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners. We do not take a position on the nature of Falun Gong. However, we continue to support EU action to raise individual Falun Gong cases of concern with the Chinese Government. The EU did this at the most recent round of the EU-China Human Rights dialogue, which was held in Beijing in October. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials also met a vice president of the European Parliament in September to discuss action on a range of human rights issues, including Falun Gong.</p>

	<p pid="c.987W.5/1">Only an inclusive political process can provide a sustainable solution to the crisis in Darfur. The UK has committed &pound;1 million to support the African Union and UN joint mediation support team, which is currently focused on encouraging the rebel movements to unify further and agree on common platforms ahead of negotiations with the Government of Sudan. We have made clear publicly and directly to the rebel movements that there will be consequences for any party that seeks to obstruct progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.987W.5/2">Civil society and Arab engagement in the political process will be essential for an inclusive process. The UK is filling five key posts in the Darfur-Darfur dialogue and consultation, which will be the main mechanism for civil society engagement in the political process and in longer-term reconciliation and rehabilitation in Darfur.</p>

	<p pid="c.990W.3/1">The Government introduced the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which came into force earlier this year, to protect the welfare of all animals, including animals used in sporting events. Under the Act it is an offence either to cause any captive animal unnecessary suffering or fail to provide for its welfare needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.990W.3/2">The Act also provides powers to introduce new regulations to further promote the welfare of animals. The Government have made a commitment to introduce regulations to safeguard the welfare of racing greyhounds. There will be a public consultation on our proposals for greyhound racing before approval by Parliament. We intend to give this matter priority, although the timing of the consultation will be dependent on the response of the industry to the recommendations made in Lord Donoghue's recent independent review of greyhound racing.</p>
	<p pid="c.990W.3/3">Additionally, in January 2007 new EU-wide welfare in transport rules came into force. These provide increased welfare protection when animals are transported in connection with an economic activity such as horseracing. To ensure there is no lessening of welfare protection for animals transported in connection with sporting events undertaken purely for pleasure or competition, the national legislation implementing the EU rules (The Welfare of Animals (Transport) (England) Order 2006 and parallel legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) include a general duty of care provision.</p>

	<p pid="c.990W.6/1">DEFRA takes a science-based approach to all bird gatherings, including those that involve pigeons (both for showing and racing). A Veterinary Risk Assessment (VRA) using the best available scientific evidence is carried out to assess the risk of avian influenza (Al) specifically in relation to pigeons.</p>
	<p pid="c.990W.6/2">The VRA cites evidence available that pigeons can be susceptible to the disease and in particular a study by the European Food Safety Authority in 2006 concluded that pigeons may have the potential to act as a &quot;bridging&quot; species between waterfowl and poultry. However, available evidence on the ability of pigeons to spread the Al viruses is limited and contradictory. It is likely that the susceptibility of pigeons (and other species of birds) to Al, and the clinical picture caused by infection, is strongly associated with genetic and biological variations between different strains of the virus.</p>
	<p pid="c.990W.6/3">There is research available which suggests that pigeons have limited susceptibility to some virus strains (mainly isolated some years ago), but other more recent publications suggest the contrary and demonstrate that recently isolated strains of HPAI H5N1 could infect pigeons. This later study indicates that pigeons may be asymptomatic carriers of the Al virus.</p>
	<p pid="c.990W.6/4">Pigeons could also spread Al mechanically through infective material on their feet and feathers, and there is potential, especially in long races, for pigeons to land and mingle with wild birds while still on the continent.</p>

	<p pid="c.993W.6/2"><i> </i>We have not sought to assess the levels of transmission of tuberculosis (TB) from cattle to other animals for three reasons:</p>
	<p pid="c.993W.6/3" class="indent">(i) While TB is primarily a respiratory disease in the majority of mammalian species including cattle, the relative importance of different routes of transmission among and between species is unknown;</p>
	<p pid="c.993W.6/4" class="indent">(ii) Small numbers of many wild and domesticated mammalian species have been shown to be infected with bovine TB, however, most are spill-over end hosts and there is no evidence that they can transmit infection to other species; and,</p>
	<p pid="c.993W.6/5" class="indent">(iii) Being infected with a disease does not mean that the individual is necessarily infectious to others. The reasons for this are usually immunological (the animal may contain the disease effectively) or behavioural (e.g. the species may be solitary). The current TB testing and slaughter regime applied to cattle ensures that in reality, the number of infected cattle which remain in herds long enough to become infections is extremely low and very few develop clinical signs of the disease.</p>
	<p pid="c.993W.6/6">The principle species affected by bovine TB in GB are cattle and badgers and research from the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB has provided evidence which confirms that there is a cycle of disease between the two. However, it has not been possible to quantify the relative contribution of cattle or badgers to the level of the disease and this will vary between areas.</p>

We have forwarded the results of this work to the Commission in support of our request for an across-the-board review of the rules relating to margins of tolerance.</p>
	<p pid="c.997W.0/2">More generally, my officials keep the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) under constant review to ensure that they achieve their enforcement objective in a way that imposes the minimum burden upon both fishermen and administrations. The first step in achieving compliance is to ensure that the rules in place are necessary, can be easily understood and can be effectively enforced. When enforcing the regulations resources are targeted using risk-based systems and sanctions are imposed at levels that act as a clear deterrent to others. We shall be using the forthcoming review of the Control Regulation as an opportunity to re-examine the whole body of CFP control rules to ensure that these objectives are met.</p>

	<p pid="c.998W.3/1">Risk is defined in flooding terms as a combination of probability and consequences. There is as yet no national assessment of risk on this basis which can be used to give a reliable ranking as requested. However, the local authority areas in England identified by the Environment Agency's 2006 National Flood Risk Assessment as having the most properties in areas considered to have a significant probability of flooding, (i.e. greater than one in 75 or 1.3 per cent. chance in any one year) are given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.3/2">The actual probabilities of flooding for these properties will vary within the one in 75 and higher probability band and the table should not be regarded as a reliably accurate ranking of areas' vulnerability to flooding. It must also be recognised that this estimation is a complex process and, although techniques are developing rapidly from research to operational methodology, it is subject to further improvement which may lead to changes in probability assessments in the future.</p>

The precise requirements for separation will be established on a case-by-case basis by the inspecting animal health officer, but typical requirements may include complete fencing off of the composting premises and separate access to the public highway. The inspecting officer will need to be fully satisfied that livestock cannot gain access to the animal by-products or catering waste.</p>

	<p pid="c.1009W.2/1">In 2005 the first Government response to the consultation on 'Making Space for Water' we announced an intention to extend the role of the Environment Agency to include strategic overview of management of flood risk from all sources (rivers, the sea, sewer, surface water and groundwater) and of coastal erosion risk, and that these changes would be implemented progressively by 2009. We have announced the detailed form this new role will take on the coast, to take effect from next April, and are considering how it should be applied inland. As with the coastal overview role, the inland changes will be informed by public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1009W.2/2">As part of the upcoming 'Government Water Strategy, Future Water', due to be published early in 2008, we will review approaches to urban drainage, taking account of recommendations from the independent review of the summer flooding being undertaken by Sir Michael Pitt. To support this work, the Government, along with UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR) is spending &pound;2 million on 15 integrated urban drainage pilot studies around the country to test new approaches to reduce the risk of urban drainage flooding. The pilots, to be completed in spring 2008, are intended to clarify responsibilities for urban drainage management.</p>

	<p pid="c.1010W.2/1">An independent review, peer-reviewed by the Royal Society, on the Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management, was published by DEFRA in 2004. The review concluded that, based on the evidence from studies so far, the treatment of municipal solid waste&mdash;including by incineration and landfill&mdash;has, at most, a minor impact on human health and the environment. DEFRA has also published a study, &quot;Impact of Energy from Waste and Recycling Policy on UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions&quot;, which is available on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.2/2">Eleven per cent. of waste is currently incinerated in England, but an increase is likely to be needed to be able to meet Landfill Directive targets, despite big improvements in waste recycling and minimisation. Recovering energy from waste (including via incineration) offers a considerable climate change benefit compared to the alternative of landfill. This is primarily through avoided landfill methane emissions, with energy generated from the biodegradable fraction of waste also offsetting fossil fuel power generation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.2/3">The Environment Agency ensures that emissions and other outputs from waste management facilities are within the limits set by the EU and the UK Government to minimise any negative impact.</p>

	<p pid="c.1012W.0/1">DFID's programme is primarily intended to support the development work led by the Government of Afghanistan. The best way to do this is by supporting Afghans themselves&mdash;which is why over 80 per cent. of our aid goes directly to the Government of Afghanistan. This is helping to build the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of Afghanistan to manage their own finances and economy. DFID's programme focuses on: building effective state institutions and better governance; improving economic management; and improving livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="c.1012W.0/2">As a result of this support, Afghanistan has seen real progress since 2001, with life improving for many Afghans. Around 5.4 million children are now in school, over a third of them girls. This is up from an estimated 1 million children in school in 2001, of whom very few were girls and who were officially denied access to education under the Taliban. Afghan domestic revenues grew by over 300 per cent. between fiscal years 2002-03 and 2006-07 and over &pound;166 million worth of small loans have been given to over 404,000 families, shopkeepers, tailors, farmers, builders and others to invest in legal businesses and increase their savings. DFID also provides support to the Afghan Government's National Solidarity Programme (NSP), which is helping over 18,000 community development councils identify development priorities, and has approved over 32,000 projects in villages across Afghanistan&mdash;including building health clinics and schools, and improving water supplies and electricity generation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1012W.0/3">All elements of the DFID programme take account of and support the counter-insurgency role of UK armed forces in Helmand province, as well as other aspects of the UK's Comprehensive Approach in Afghanistan. DFID provides a development adviser to the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand. Last year DFID provided &pound;4 million of the total &pound;6.2 million UK funding for Quick Impact Projects (QIPs), and this year will provide &pound;6 million of the total &pound;9 million of UK funding. By July 2007, over 180 QIPS were planned, on-going or complete, including training programmes for drug addicts, equipment and training for the Afghan police, improvements to the prison in Lashkar Gah, and construction of parks and children's playgrounds. DFID also works with the Government to improve service delivery in Helmand. In 2007-08 DFID provided &pound;10 million of funding to help the Government of Afghanistan improve sanitation, build and maintain roads, and provide credit to support legal businesses, and we plan to provide the same amount next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1013W.3/1">DFID provides its main support to physical reconstruction projects in Afghanistan through three Government of Afghanistan programmes: the National Solidarity Programme (NSP), which funds community-level projects chosen by these communities; the National Rural Access Programme (NRAP), which builds and rehabilitates rural roads and bridges; and the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (HARDP), which funds a wide range of development activity in Helmand province, including wells.</p>
	<p pid="c.1013W.3/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November</phrase>, NSP had completed 15,111 projects in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, an increase of 552 projects on the previous month. It had also rehabilitated 9,333 km of road and 101 bridges across the country, with a further 544 km of road and 16 bridges under construction. Meanwhile, under HARDP, 740 wells have been completed since the start of 2007, with 270 under construction. A further 1,000 wells and 6,030 latrines are planned for 2008. The Government also supports physical reconstruction projects in Helmand through its programme of Quick Impact Projects (QIPs). Over 230 QIPs have been implemented by the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Helmand since July 2006, including 100 in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1013W.3/3">Since March 2003, DFID has committed over &pound;100 million to infrastructure regeneration projects in Iraq. This has helped to create employment for several thousand Iraqis in repairing some of southern Iraq's key infrastructure. We have added or secured 415 MW of electricity to the Iraqi national grid, and will be adding or securing a further 60 MW over the next few months. This will be enough to provide 24 hours of power for around 1 million people. By early 2008 DFID will have improved access to water for 1 million people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1013W.3/4">Our work with Basra Provincial Council (BPC) has helped it to deliver a Provincial Development Strategy (the first ever in Iraq), and establish increasingly transparent economic governance. The BPC was consequently able to access $195 million of central Government funds in 2007, after receiving nothing in 2005. We are also working with the Iraqi Government and the BPC to take forward a series of economic initiatives supported by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. They include a Basra Investment Promotion Agency (BIPA) and an overarching 'Basra Development Commission (BDC)', to be supported with advice from international business leaders, including from the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1014W.3/1">The United Nations conducts its own internal monitoring systems as standard practice. These tend to focus more on factual outputs, such as number of schools refurbished or text books distributed. Furthermore, each project is assessed based on its own merit. This 'Multi-donor Stocktaking Review' will assess the impact and sustainability of projects funded by IRFFI rather than focusing on the outputs; it will also assess IRFFI funded programmes relative to programmes funded by bilateral donors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1014W.3/2">The stocktaking review will be led by a review steering committee (RSC), which is made up of four parties&mdash;Canada, the Commission, Japan and the UK. They are appointing an international consultancy firm to conduct the review. This tendering process is close to completion and, when it is, the successful bidder will be announced by UNOPS, the administrating agent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1014W.3/3">The stocktaking review will take a comprehensive look at the impact of IRFFI's projects in Iraq as a whole. It aims to provide an independent, results-based assessment of the appropriateness, efficiency and effectiveness of IRFFI-supported programmes. The review will be important for both the accountability of the Iraqi authorities to the Iraqi people, as well as donor agencies to their taxpayers.

	<p pid="c.1016W.3/1">The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) have so far provided over &pound;12 million to meet the immediate needs of the 8.9 million people affected by Cyclone Sidr. The GoB is also distributing water, food, water purification tablets, saline, blankets, tents, utensils and other relief items. The UK has provided &pound;7 million through the United Nations and NGOs for immediate assistance in the form of food, clean and safe water, and the restoration of livelihoods. United Nations reports show that relief efforts have reached nearly all affected areas, with the water availability crisis having passed due to the high attention given to this by the GoB and others.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.3/2">However, more will be required for the recovery operation. The GoB has appealed to raise a further $1 billion, of which over $213 million has so far been pledged by bilateral donors.

	<p pid="c.1019W.2/1">On his recent visit to the occupied Palestinian territories (OPTs), the Secretary of State discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, businessmen, donors and humanitarian workers. These discussions confirmed the assessment provided by DFID's regular monitoring, much of which relies on information from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). OCHA's most recent reports indicate that although humanitarian aid is getting into Gaza, restrictions at crossings mean that only 41 per cent. of Gaza's food needs are being imported. Shortages in basic foodstuffs have led to price increases and less food being purchased. 80 per cent. of the population in Gaza now receives food aid. Following the fuel cuts imposed by Israel on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-28">28 October</phrase>, the public provider of water services is receiving only 50 per cent. of the fuel needed to operate its facilities. Combined with a lack of spare parts for generators, this has meant that some people are only receiving water for one to two hours a day.</p>
	<p pid="c.1019W.2/2">The UK is deeply concerned about the situation and we are doing what we can to help. During his visit, the Secretary of State expressed concern to Defence Minister Barak about the humanitarian effect of the reduction in fuel supplies and other Israeli actions. He discussed plans to reopen Gaza's crossings with President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad.</p>
	<p pid="c.1019W.2/3">The UK is also providing humanitarian assistance. In 2007, DFID has given &pound;15.6 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency to provide essential services such as food, housing and education to Palestinian refugees in the occupied Palestinian territories and wider region. Refugees make up 70 per cent. of Gaza's population. We have provided &pound;15 million to the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) since 2006 for health services, allowances for government workers and water, sanitation and electricity services. We have also given &pound;1 million this year to fund ICRC's emergency appeal for Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="c.1020W.0/1">Provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) were originally established in Afghanistan and adopted in Iraq as a successful model. The PRT model has proven itself as an effective means of improving the delivery and co-ordination of aid and other development activity in conflict environments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.0/2">DFID works closely with other Government Departments and international partners to ensure that key lessons from PRTs in both countries are captured. The cross-departmental Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit has a formal role in ensuring that lessons are recorded for wider application, including the co-ordination of civilian and military initiatives. The primary purpose of PRTs in Iraq is to build the capacity of the provincial government to deliver benefits for its citizens. Major differences in the focus of the Iraq and Afghanistan programmes mean that some lessons are not readily transferred, but some general principles are applicable. The importance of building the capacity of provincial government and good governance, and of supporting each country's own central and provincial government to lead on and deliver reconstruction initiatives are major examples.</p>

	<p pid="c.1022W.9/1">MOD has a very wide range of mechanisms available to support the families of Service personnel with their childcare needs, including while Service personnel are deployed on operations. In particular, we have recently introduced a childcare voucher scheme to assist personnel with the cost of childcare. In the UK, though local authorities and devolved administrations have the lead responsibility for facilitating access to appropriate childcare, many Service locations also have onsite childcare provision tailored for the Service community. This is particularly the case in many overseas locations where the MOD takes the lead in service provision. Service families seeking childcare can access information through the MOD HIVE Information Service and, in UK, through the normal childcare information services. All of these services continue to be available to families while Service personnel are deployed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.9/2">In addition, the armed forces have welfare and community support staffs that focus on providing additional support and guidance to the Service community, including childcare development. They and other support groups, such as the Families Federations, are available throughout periods of deployment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.9/3">Ultimately, the care of their children must remain the personal responsibility of all Service parents regardless of deployment. This includes a requirement to make plans in advance to cater for their families during any deployments. However, in exploring further ways in which they can be supported in this, the Department is completing a review of the provision of childcare across the armed forces and plans to publish a new MOD childcare policy in early 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1023W.5/1">The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.1023W.5/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is keen to support coroners in the conduct of their statutory duty to inquire into certain deaths. The level of MOD attendance at the inquests into the deaths of service personnel will vary depending on the circumstances of the death, and the roles of those attending are varied.</p>
	<p pid="c.1023W.5/3">The Ministry of Defence provides the family of a deceased service person with a dedicated visiting officer to support them through their bereavement and it is usual for visiting officers to attend inquests as part of their duties. On occasion, other welfare support staff will also attend to assist the families; each case varies and is largely dependent on the wishes of the families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1023W.5/4">An inquest into a road traffic accident on public roads in the UK may have only one or two MOD personnel attending, made up of the family's visiting officer and, as needed, an officer to report on the proceedings and findings. For more complex inquests, there is a greater level of attendance; this may include MOD service and civilian personnel who have been called as witnesses, as well as MOD subject matter experts provided to assist the coroner to establish the facts around more complex areas such as operational or technical issues. The MOD may also have support staff for witnesses and a press officer in attendance on some occasions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1024W.3/2">The MOD places a very high priority on the welfare of its service personnel and their families.

This includes close links with organisations such as RELATE.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.3/3">Support to armed forces personnel deployed away from their home base is primarily through the Chain of Command, supported by service religious leaders and medical staff where appropriate. Service welfare staff remain available in home base locations to support families during deployments of service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.3/4">Additional support for those on operational deployments and certain overseas exercises include briefings before and during deployment, free telephone calls, 'e-blueys' and internet access to facilitate communication, extra travel allowances available to dependants and close family members and welfare grants to assist parent units to fund group welfare activities and facilities. Local commanders retain discretion to return service personnel from theatre for welfare reasons. When service personnel return from operations they receive post operational leave (20 days for a six-month tour), which enables them to spend quality time with their families and friends.</p>

	<p pid="c.1025W.2/1">A review of the UK's military hospitals as part of the 1994 Defence costs study confirmed that they were no longer able to provide the volume and range of cases essential to train our medical personnel in the advancing medical skills needed for their essential operational roles. The majority of the hospitals were closed during the 1990s, with the training needs of Defence Medical Services personnel being managed through Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) established within NHS hospitals at Derriford, Frimley Park, Peterborough, Portsmouth, Northallerton, and at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) at University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust (UHBFT).</p>

	<p pid="c.1025W.2/3">Clinical management of Haslar passed to the Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust in 2001, and it has not been a military hospital as such since that time. We continued to be responsible for the management of the site until March 2007, when this responsibility also passed to the trust. It is still owned by the MOD and will continue to function, under a partnership arrangement with the NHS Portsmouth Hospitals Trust, until late 2009 when clinical services, along with NHS and some military staff, will transfer to the redeveloped Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham, Portsmouth.</p>

	<p pid="c.1029W.2/1">Every effort is made by the services to effect a reconciliation, with the local service commander able to authorise a 'cooling off' period of up to three months. During this time, it is usual for the service person to move into single living accommodation, leaving the other party in the services family accommodation (SFA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.2/2">After the 'cooling off' period or when it becomes clear that no reconciliation is possible, the local service authorities are required to inform the Housing Information Centre (HIC) of the change in circumstance. The HIC will then issue a 93-day Notice to Vacate for the party who remains in the property, and also a 'Certificate of Cessation of Entitlement to Occupy Service Families Accommodation' that will assist the family to seek social housing from their local authority on expiry of the 'notice to vacate' their SFA. However, no one will be evicted from SFA until alternative accommodation has been found.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.2/3">Within the armed forces, further advice for both partners with regards to finding new accommodation is available from the Joint Services Housing Advice Office (JSHAO). In addition to providing advice, the JSHAO operates a nomination scheme with a number of housing associations in England and Wales that allow applicants to apply for social housing in areas in which they wish to reside.</p>

	<p pid="c.1030W.2/1">The majority of service families accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales is leased from Annington Homes Ltd. and properties no longer required for defence purposes are returned to the company. Although no receipt accrues to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in respect of properties returned, there are savings in rent, contributions in lieu of council tax and maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.2/2">In Scotland and Northern Ireland, surplus SFA are sold on the open market. We currently have plans to dispose of 600 properties in Scotland and 800 in Northern Ireland over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.2/3">Overseas, the majority of SFA are returned to the host government when no longer needed, but SFA on permanent joint operations bases are owned by the MOD. When they are no longer required, the future of these properties is determined by the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.2/4">In respect of single living (barrack) accommodation (SLA), this is usually within the wire of a service establishment and the disposal normally forms part of the disposal of the wider site. Receipts cannot, therefore, be estimated specifically for SLA.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.2/5">As part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review, the Department agreed overall defence estate disposal targets (including accommodation) as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.1030W.2/8"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound; million</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1030W.2/9"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>403</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1030W.2/15">It is not possible to separate out the accommodation element of these targets. Receipts from house sales will depend on market conditions at the time of sale, the area and the type of property. To release any valuations we may have carried out ahead of the sale would, in any case, be likely to influence the market and these are thus regarded as commercially confidential until the sale is complete.</p>

	<p pid="c.1031W.5/1">All three Services undertake numerous and varied initiatives, both at national and local level, aimed at sustaining and increasing the level of recruitment to the armed forces. Included among the many current initiatives are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/2" class="indent">The use of multi-media advertising campaigns, including digital media;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/3" class="indent">Services' presentation teams' attendance at schools, careers fairs and graduate recruitment seminars, road shows, exhibitions, youth clubs and organisations;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/4" class="indent">Specialist teams to attract doctors, dentists, nurses, lawyers and padres by promoting Service careers within specialist recruitment shows and through professional bodies;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/5" class="indent">Work experience placements within Service establishments;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/6" class="indent">Personal development courses and Look at Life Courses for young people who express an interest in the armed forces;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/7" class="indent">Taster day visits to HM ships and service establishments;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/8" class="indent">A dedicated careers website for each of the Services complete with a dedicated information support call centre;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/9" class="indent">An Army 'on-line' recruiting office, with plans for this to be replicated by the other Services;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/10" class="indent">Specialist ethnic minority recruiting and diversity action teams aimed at promoting armed forces careers among the UK's ethnic minority and faith communities;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/11" class="indent">A partnership with Jobcentre Plus, making use of its network (totalling in excess of 1,100) of local outlets;</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/12" class="indent">Financial incentives, for example: Golden Hellios, for those who have studied specific vocational subjects to a set level; and re-joining bounties to certain trades.</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/13">Turning to retention; in the armed forces as a whole, retention rates are broadly stable and we have seen no sudden outflow of personnel. However, there are areas where exit rates remain too high. These areas are continuously monitored closely and focused action taken to continue to improve recruitment and retention. We continue to restructure our forces so that they can best meet operational demands. Retention measures such as commitment bonuses, re-engagement packages, financial retention initiatives and initiatives to improve work/life balance and working conditions at the front line, continue to be used with the aim of discouraging outflow. There are a number of specific initiatives currently being undertaken such as the strategic remuneration review and the defence living accommodation strategy which will contribute towards this effort. In addition, we have made improvements to travel allowances to permit personnel to get home more easily and we continue to add to the deployment welfare package, that provides additional support to people deployed on operations and their families. We have also introduced a council tax rebate for serving personnel deployed on designated operations while also promoting measures such as work/life balance and career breaks to improve the day-to-day lives of Service personnel and their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/14">The Services are also currently examining further non-financial retention measures including, in the near term, continuance of service, restructuring of trades to relieve pinch points, and being more flexible on what rank is required for a given post. Longer term work is also being carried out into the potential for easier movement between regular and reserve service, more flexible employment generally, assistance with house purchase, and any opportunities for stability a more regionalised Service might offer.</p>

	<p pid="c.1032W.5/1">While the costs of an infantry battalion are not generally held centrally (as these figures are extensive and spread over a wide variety of budgets), a set of general assumptions on which to base an illustrative costing of adding three infantry battalions has been developed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/2">These costings are dependent on the inter-relationship of a range of complex factors. Each of the assumptions that have been made is regarded as the most reasonable for indicative costing. Costs would break down broadly into two categories: the initial start-up and capital investment costs, and the annual running costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/3">Changes to these assumptions (particularly on the unit role or accommodation requirements) could result in significant changes to the overall total.</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/4">The following assumptions informed the costing:</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/5" class="indent">Three light role infantry battalions, based in the UK, not held at high readiness and consisting of 625 personnel per battalion;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/6" class="indent">Three new barracks (furnished and equipped to standard). It is assumed that there are no existing empty barracks that are fit for purpose in which to accommodate the battalions, and co-location on a single site is unlikely;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/7" class="indent">The requirement for new single living accommodation (furnished and equipped to standard) (400 SLAs per battalion);</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/8" class="indent">The requirement for new service family accommodation (furnished and equipped to standard) (225 SFAs per battalion);</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/9" class="indent">Build is on land currently owned by MOD (therefore, there is no cost assumed for any requirement to purchase land);</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/10" class="indent">There are no appreciable costs to gain planning permission or prepare the sites and access to them;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/11" class="indent">That over the period of implementation, this will not materially change the totality of Defences demand for personal clothing and equipment;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/12" class="indent">There is no impact on the Equipment Customer Capability Programme in that existing and programmed equipments, vehicles and communication items are whole fleet managed;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/13" class="indent">Initial recruitment costs are based on a total of 2,802 enlistments required to generate a throughput of 1,875;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/14" class="indent">Basic and collective training costs<sup>(1)</sup>;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/15" class="indent">Annual barrack running costs estimated at 10 per cent. of cost of new build;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/16" class="indent">Annual salary costs (pay, national insurance and pensions) based on salaries within a rank structure of a light role infantry battalion;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/17" class="indent">No additional cost is assumed for allowances such as operational, separation and education allowances;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/18" class="indent">No other running cost is assumed (e.g. annual recruitment and retention and other costs);</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/19" class="indent">No depreciation and cost of capital charges are assumed;</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/20" class="indent">Figures quoted are at 2007-08 prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/21">Based on these assumptions, the following costs were derived:</p>

	<p pid="c.1042W.8/1">In both Iraq and Afghanistan, for all serious operational injuries that require treatment in a field hospital, our doctrine is to provide emergency battlefield care within the first hour after wounding, and&mdash;for those requiring further treatment&mdash;within two hours to have transported every casualty to a UK or coalition field hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.8/2">In Iraq, we routinely adhere to this 'two-hour to surgery' limit, although in Afghanistan, where the distances can be significantly greater, we may, if appropriate, deploy a medical emergency response team (MERT) directly to the casualty, enabling advanced medical care to be provided at the point of wounding. An analysis of MERT timelines in Afghanistan over a 13-month period from May 2006 to June 2007 showed that the median time from injury to handover at the field hospital emergency department for all UK military casualties requiring emergency care and life-saving surgery was one hour 39 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.8/3">On arrival at the field hospital, the clinical condition of the casualty will be assessed by the surgical team, and a decision made as to the most appropriate course of action. This could include provision of immediate surgery in the field hospital; aeromedical evacuation casualty to the UK following stabilisation of their condition; or transfer to another coalition field hospital facility.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.8/4">In Iraq, the nearest specialist neurosurgical facilities are available at the US medical facilities at the Balad airbase. If it is assessed that this is the most appropriate course of action, UK casualties may be transferred there from the UK field hospital at Basrah. The average transfer time to Balad is one hour 20 minutes by fixed-wing aircraft or three hours by helicopter.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.8/5">In Afghanistan, neurosurgical facilities are currently available in the UK role 2 (enhanced) field hospital at Camp Bastion, consisting of one neurosurgeon, one anaesthetist and two intensive treatment unit nurses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.8/6">For both operational theatres, once the condition of the patient has been stabilised, they will be airlifted back to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1044W.2/28" class="indent">The degree of protection required at MOD sites will vary from site to site and area to area according to the threat, location and the nature of the establishment and it would therefore be inappropriate to give all establishments equal protection. Security measures are informed by threat assessments, derived from available intelligence. They involve risk management decisions, taking into account the effectiveness and proportionality of available countermeasures. We have to accept that guaranteed security against all forms of incursion is not achievable. It would not, for instance, be realistic to attempt to secure the outer perimeters of any MOD site to a level that would guarantee that it could never be penetrated, or to exclude the possibility of material damage in a non-sensitive area. We rely on defence in depth, with priority being given to the protection of life and those assets critical to the delivery of defence capability.</p>
	<p pid="c.1044W.2/29" class="indent">I can assure you that we continue to strive to adapt and improve the security measures already in place so that they meet the evolving threat. As part of this continuous review of security 13 MOD sites and three MOD licensed nuclear sites were designated for protection by a new offence of criminal trespass, under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. The number of incursions at these sites has reduced significantly, and the number of prosecutions has increased as a result of this added protection.</p>

	<p pid="c.1051W.8/1">The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2006 was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-28">28 November 2007</phrase>. PIRLS is a comparative study of the reading attainment of 10-year-olds, run by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The average age of pupils tested ranged from 9.7 years in Italy to 11.9 in Morocco. The average age of pupils tested in England was 10.3 years (Year 5 equivalent).</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/2">The study is conducted in England by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), under contract to the Department for Children, Schools and Families. NFER published the national report for England on their website <a href="http://www.nfer.ac.uk/pirls">www.nfer.ac.uk/pirls</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-28">28 November 2007</phrase>. Print versions of the report are being prepared and hard copies will be made available in both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/3">The main conclusions from the national report for England were:</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/4" class="indent">On average, pupils in England achieved significantly above the international mean in PIRLS 2006 but the mean score for England has fallen since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/5" class="indent">Children in England read for pleasure less often than their peers in other countries. There is a strong link between the amount of reading for pleasure and their achievement in PIRLS tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/6" class="indent">37 per cent. of 10-year-olds in England play computer games for more than three hours a day. This is one of the highest proportions internationally and there is a link between high use of computer games and lower attainment in PIRLS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/7" class="indent">75 per cent. have access to desk or quiet space to study at home&mdash;a much lower number than Western Europe.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/8" class="indent">Of the five countries testing in English, Singapore scored significantly higher than the others. There was no significant difference between the scores of England and the United States, which both scored significantly higher than New Zealand, Scotland, and Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/9" class="indent">In almost all countries, including England, girls achieved significantly higher than boys overall.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.8/10">I have also recently commissioned a benchmarking study that will compare our curriculum to that of other countries. This independent review will focus on literacy, mathematics and science and cover the seven-11 age range. It will look at curriculum content, learning styles and educational outcomes and will report in 2008.</p>

An estimate of the number of young people who were aged 16 on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-31">31 August 2007</phrase>, and who remained in education and training at the end of 2007, is due to be published in June 2008.

	<p pid="c.1053W.2/3">The latest information available on the participation of young people at age 17 relates to the cohort that would have reached the statutory school leaving age in summer 2005, but the figures will be affected by subsequent increases in the size of the cohort. At the end of 2005, 582,000 16-year-olds were in education and training at the end of that year, representing 88.7 per cent. of the cohort. At the end of 2006, there were 538,000 17-year-olds in education and training, representing 81.5 per cent. of the cohort.</p>

	<p pid="c.1053W.5/1">The intention of the policy to raise the participation age is that all 16 and 17-year-olds resident in England will be required to participate in some form of education or training. Ensuring that all young people have the support they need to overcome barriers to learning, stay in their chosen route and succeed in it is one of the fundamental building blocks for making this policy a success. This includes having appropriate support for young people with special educational needs; having the right level of financial support in place; and being able to provide advice, help and support with specific problems or when things go wrong. And where there are significant barriers to young people's engagement, such as homelessness or drug or alcohol problems, support services will focus on overcoming these first and taking steps towards re-engagement in education and training. No young person will enter the enforcement system if they have a reasonable justification for why they are not participating in learning and they are taking the right steps for them towards participation. The armed forces provide opportunities to continue with constructive training and education for all recruits from every level of ability and achievement. The new duty to participate will apply for young people in custody. Education and training for young people in custody is currently provided through a mix of arrangements, including through the LSC and contracted learning providers. Young people preparing to be professional sportsmen and sportswomen will also be subject to the requirement.</p>

	<p pid="c.1068W.2/2">We are seeking to introduce a new individual insolvency procedure, the debt relief order (DRO) from April 2009, the framework for which is set out in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. DROs are aimed at people who owe relatively little, have very low incomes and few, if any, assets and have no way to pay their debts because they are financially excluded from existing remedies. In order to obtain a DRO the debtor will need to pay one up-front fee that will be set at a level to cover the official receiver's costs of administering the case and no more. The precise level is yet to be determined but it will be significantly less than the deposit required on presentation of a bankruptcy petition and no further fees will be payable in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1068W.2/3">We have also been consulting extensively on proposals to augment the existing individual voluntary arrangement regime (IVA) with a simplified version of the IVA for those with undisputed debts of less than &pound;75,000. The necessary legislative changes to give effect to this are planned to come into force from October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1068W.2/4">Work is also being undertaken to consolidate and modernise the insolvency secondary legislation including the insolvency rules themselves, which set out the detailed procedures for the various insolvency processes. The changes proposed include changes to the mechanism by which insolvency office-holders have their remuneration and expenses agreed by creditors. These changes are intended to increase transparency and accountability by requiring insolvency office-holders to have their remuneration and expenses agreed by creditors. These changes are intended to increase transparency and accountability by requiring insolvency office-holders to provide information on remuneration taken, on a regular basis. Creditors will be given new powers to request further and better particulars in respect of remuneration charged and expenses incurred, together with clearer rights to challenge those amounts in court where they consider them to be excessive.</p>

	<p pid="c.1075W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/2">For the purposes of this question &quot;nuclear waste materials&quot; will be taken to mean irradiated nuclear fuel (INF) which is transported by rail from nuclear power stations to Sellafield in Cumbria.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/3">The transport of all radioactive material, including INF, is governed by the stringent internationally agreed standards recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an agency appointed by the United Nations to oversee all aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/4">Packages (&quot;flasks&quot;) used to transport INF are designed to withstand a very severe impact followed by severe fire. The safety of INF shipments is therefore secured by the design and build quality of the packages used and not by the particular mode of transport used or route travelled. The Department for Transport (DfT) is required to ensure that the design of INF flasks meets the IAEA standards and issues approval certificates to this effect.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/5"><i> (a)</i> In addition to approving the design of flasks, monitoring activities regarding the transport of INF carried out by the DfT consist of</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/6" class="indent">(i) The commissioning of reports on the radiological impact of the transport of radioactive material under normal and abnormal conditions. The latest report looking at the rail transport of INF under normal conditions is &quot;Survey into the Radiological Impact of the Normal Transport of Radioactive Material in the UK by Road and Rail, NRPB-W66&quot;. Reports detailing abnormal events involving the transport of radioactive material in the UK have been published annually since 1989 the latest being &quot;Radiological Consequences Resulting from Accidents and Incidents Involving the Transport of Radioactive Materials in the UK&mdash;2005 Review, HPA-RPD-021&quot;. Copies of these and similar reports have been placed in the House Libraries and recent ones are available via the DfT website at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/freight/dgt1/guidance/guidance7class/theradiologicalimpactofthetr1178">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/freight/dgt1/guidance/guidance7class/theradiologicalimpactofthetr1178</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/8" class="indent">The conclusion of these reports is that the radiological impact of INF transport is low.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/9" class="indent">(ii) Periodic radiological surveys of the extent of radioactive contamination on the external surfaces of INF flasks. These surveys are carried out by suitable qualified and experienced personnel working under contract to the DfT and are an independent check to those routinely carried out by the industry. These surveys confirm that incidences of external contamination in excess of the regulatory limits are low and their radiological impact is minimal. Events where the industry has reported contamination in excess of the regulatory limits are detailed in the reports referred to in (i) above.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/10" class="indent">(iii) Compliance assurance audits of organisations and their Quality management systems involved in the transport of INF.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/11"><i> (b)</i> A condition of being approved by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), part of the Health and Safety Executive, is that all carriers must meet regulatory or defined requirements which require all such movements to be notified to the OCNS at least seven days in advance of the proposed date of transport and to be tracked throughout the course of the transport.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/12">In the case of INF transported by train, such tracking is carried out by one or more of the following methods:</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/13" class="indent">(i) Train Operations Processing System (TOPS). TOPS is a UK rail network-wide computerised system managed by Network Rail which records the expected and actual passing time of all trains. TOPS monitors trains along their preset routes and, in this case, alerts whenever a train is delayed by more than 60 seconds or deviates from its set route,</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/14" class="indent">(ii) Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite tracking, monitored by the carrier in accordance with parameters set by OCNS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.2/15" class="indent">(iii) Mobile phone communications, again monitored by the carrier in accordance with parameters set by OCNS.</p>

	<p pid="c.1085W.6/1">The listing of cases in the criminal courts is a judicial function. The Lord Chief Justice issued guidance in July 2005 outlining the practices to be adopted when listing cases in the magistrates courts and Crown court. It says priority should be accorded to the trial of young defendants and specific account taken of whether they are remanded on bail or in custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.6/2">The persistent young offenders (PYO) pledge was established in 1998 to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders from 142 days to 71 days. Under this pledge the Government remain committed to prioritising the prosecution of persistent young offenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.6/3">The Government are also committed to ensuring that cases dealt with in the youth court are dealt with as swiftly and effectively as possible and are considering implementing the principles of the Criminal Justice Simple, Speedy, Summary (CJSSS) programme to speed up the youth court. A recent test at Balham youth court suggested that CJSSS could help achieve significant improvements in the time taken from charge to disposal of a case. I am placing a copy of the evaluation in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.6/4">The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal aims to process and hear all appeals quickly and efficiently. The current target for asylum appeals is six weeks from receipt of the appeal to determination by an immigration judge. There is therefore no need for special arrangements to expedite asylum appeals involving children, although there is guidance on the conduct of hearings involving unaccompanied minors.</p>

Other smaller components of the probation budgets are in the process of being worked through pending updated information. The current planning assumption for Cambridgeshire is an increase of 3.41 per cent. for 2008-09 over 2007-08 on the main resource grant, which will be subject to confirmation when SLA negotiations are completed.

	<p pid="c.1087W.6/13">Data for the average waiting time for persons giving evidence is obtained from the biannual witness survey which is carried out over two weeks in June and November every year. It covers all witnesses who attended the Crown court, whether or not they were actually called to give evidence. We do not currently hold figures for the time taken to give evidence centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1087W.6/14">Witness waiting times are affected by several factors, for example the times that witnesses are asked to attend, how many witnesses there are in a trial and what happens in the courtroom. There could be unexpected lengthy legal argument or other delays on the day, perhaps caused by the defendant not attending. These estimates should all be used with caution as the number of witnesses surveyed was less than 100 for each survey at Chelmsford Crown court, meaning that margins of error will be wide.</p>

	<p pid="c.1089W.0/1">In March 2006 the Government published research by Dr. Liz Trinder of the university of East Anglia on in-court conciliation in three courts in England. This looked at the process and overall effectiveness of conciliation and examined the relative effectiveness of three contrasting models; 125 cases were examined immediately following the conciliation meeting and again six months later. A further study examined 117 of these cases to assess the position two years on. The Government published the findings of this further study on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.0/2">At the two-year follow-up, 79 per cent. of parents had an agreement about contact. More children were having overnight contact and the overall amount of contact per child had increased since the initial conciliation meeting. However, 60 per cent. of agreements made at the original conciliation meeting had been changed or broken down. Analysis suggests that this was due to one or more of the adults or children not supporting the agreement rather than a change in circumstances. In 40 per cent. of cases there had been further litigation; 9.4 per cent. of parents reported that their case was currently active, a reduction from 25.6 per cent. at the six-month follow-up.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.0/3">To provide ongoing support to parents and help prevent a return to court, the courts can make Family Assistance Orders (FAOs). On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase> the Government implemented section 6 of the Children and Adoption Act 2006. FAOs may now be made for 12 months rather than six, and are not restricted to exceptional cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.0/4">The 2006 Act also contains provisions to enable the courts to direct parties to take part in contact activities during the court stage and before contact is formally agreed. These activities will provide parents with access to more therapeutic services designed to help them overcome some of the underlying issues they face, which can act as barriers to co-parenting and to making contact work. We will announce shortly the timetable for implementing these and other provisions in the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.0/5">The research found that 76 per cent. of parents in the study reached a full or partial agreement immediately following conciliation. In most of these cases the court will have made an order for contact with the consent of the parties, avoiding a contested final hearing. The Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service reports that in 2006-07 its dispute resolution work in these cases (focused mainly on the delivery of in-conciliation) achieved a full or partial agreement in 59.4 per cent. of cases going through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.0/6">The research concludes that child wellbeing is related to the quality of the relationship between the parents. While parental relationships had improved a little for some, this improvement was modest and the majority of parents continued to report a negative relationship that had not improved since the original conciliation meeting. Contact activities will help to equip these parents with the skills and understanding they need to be more effective co-parents.</p>

	<p pid="c.1090W.5/1">Section 8(3) of the Coroners Act 1988 requires the coroner to hold a jury inquest where he has jurisdiction and the person has died in prison, in police custody or in circumstances requiring an inquest under any other Act. Deaths of people detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 are not specified in the Coroners Act 1988 Section 8(3), and are not regarded as automatically requiring an inquest to be held. In the Coroners Bill, which will be brought before Parliament as soon as time allows, it is intended that the death of any person in lawful detention, including those detained under the Mental Health Act, will be investigated by a coroner.</p>

	<p pid="c.1099W.2/3">The Government's national delivery plan for domestic violence includes an objective relating to the management of perpetrators to reduce the risk of reoffending. The following steps have been taken to achieve this objective.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/4" class="indent">Specialist domestic violence courts (SDVCs) place victims at the heart of the criminal justice system through a multi-agency response to domestic violence that affords greater victim safety while bringing perpetrators to account for their offences. We are planning to expand the number of specialist courts from 64 to around 100 SDVCs by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/5" class="indent">The development of three accredited treatment programmes for convicted domestic violence perpetrators: the Integrated Domestic Abuse programme (IDAP) and Community Domestic Violence programme (CDVP) have been rolled out across all probation areas in England and Wales. The Healthy Relationships Programme (HRP) is run by HM Prison Service. These programmes are based on evidence of what is most likely to work in reducing re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/6" class="indent">The establishment of multi-agency risk assessment conferences which aim to increase the safety of identified high risk victims through a safety planning approach and to determine whether perpetrators pose a significant future risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/7" class="indent">The continuing support of multi-agency public protection arrangements under which police, probation and prison services in each of the 42 areas in England and Wales work together with social care, health, housing and education services to assess and manage the most serious sexual and violent offenders. Some perpetrators of domestic abuse will</p>

	<p pid="c.1099W.5/1">The role of head of the MSSU in the Prison Service no longer exists. The MSSU, which is based in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, has responsibility for the design and delivery of assessment centres for the recruitment or internal promotion of prison staff. Under changes introduced in September this year, the former head of the MSSU became responsible only for the design of assessments and not for delivery. He plays no part in managed moves within the service, in either his current or his former role.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.5/2">However, the head of the MSSU reports to the head of resourcing within the HR directorate. The head of resourcing has responsibility for assisting both the operations and HR directors in the career management of senior operational managers.

	<p pid="c.1108W.2/1">The project using satellite tracking for certain prisoners released on licence and offenders who received exclusion orders from the courts was piloted in three areas between 2004 and 2006, during which 517 offenders were tracked. The satellite tracking service was provided by three suppliers up to March 2005, after which it was provided by Group 4 Securicor (G4S) and Serco Monitoring under new electronic monitoring contracts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/2">The total cost of the project was &pound;4.75 million. This included the cost of the service provision from G4S, which amounted to &pound;2.39 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/3">The pilot project was subject to an independent evaluation by Birmingham university, whose final report was published in August 2007. After consideration of the evaluation report, and the recommendations of a National Offender Management Service working group, there are no current plans to implement the scheme more widely until the technology has been developed further to provide assurance of its capabilities and cost-effectiveness. This issue will be kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.1143W.3/2">However, Government do set the overall strategy for housing supply in England, and have announced several targets for supply in recent years.

	<p pid="c.1143W.3/6">The Housing Green Paper commitment is measured against net additional dwellings (new build plus gains and losses from conversions, change of use and demolitions). The latest figures for 2005-06 show 185,000 net addition dwellings delivered in England.</p>

	<p pid="c.1145W.8/2">The Get Safe Online campaign, a joint Government and industry initiative, has had a significant impact on awareness of internet safety. Following the first phase of the campaign in 2005, research of a representative sample of broadband users in the UK revealed that 22 per cent. were aware of the campaign. Of those, 40 per cent. said they would change their behaviour and 75 per cent. of those said they would back-up their files. At the end of 2006, the tracking study was repeated and 25 per cent. had heard of the campaign with 52 per cent. saying they would change their behaviour as a result.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.8/3">The third Get Safe Online week has just been completed this November and further research will be conducted on the campaigns impact at the end of this year. The Internet Safety Week has achieved over 250 items of media coverage including national television and radio as well as giving internet safety advice directly to people through roadshows in six cities across the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1151W.6/1">The Government worked closely with local authorities during the comprehensive spending review 2007 to identify all pressures over the next three years, and the ways to manage them. The provisional local government finance settlement I announced recently provides local authorities with a total increase in Government grant of &pound;2.7 billion, &pound;3.1 billion and &pound;3.2 billion over the next three years (increases of 4 per cent., 4.4 per cent. and 4.3 per cent. respectively). An additional &pound;4.9 billion is potentially available by 2010-11 through the delivery of 3 per cent. efficiency gains each year. We believe that authorities are able to meet the pressures on their services while keeping average council tax increases substantially below 5 per cent. a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1151W.6/2">Many migrants are, of course, self-sufficient, employed and contribute to the local economy and do not put any significant pressure on public services. However, we recognise that other types of migrants such as unaccompanied minors do create real pressures, as can large movements of people into an area in a short space of time. So we recognise that some individual local authorities are experiencing more challenges than others.</p>
	<p pid="c.1151W.6/3">We have therefore already announced a &pound;50 million investment over the next three years to promote community cohesion and support local authorities in preventing and managing community tensions. This money will help local authorities respond to their own particular challenges, including for example issues relating to new migration.</p>

	<p pid="c.1160W.5/22">At the end of September 2007, 92 per cent. of families with dependent children and/or an expectant mother in temporary accommodation were living in self-contained properties with their own front door.</p>
	<p pid="c.1160W.5/23">In January 2005, the Government set a target of halving the total number of households in all forms of temporary accommodation used by local authorities to discharge their main duty under the homelessness legislation. The number of families with children in temporary accommodation has fallen by 15 per cent. since September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.1162W.6/2">I assume the hon. Member is referring to the European Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC) in his question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.6/3">No specific assessment has been made by my Department of the ability of the waste authorities in Hampshire to meet requirements on waste facilities in line with the Landfill Directive. Local authorities have no specific requirements in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.6/4">Article 5(2) of the directive places requirements on the UK to divert biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) from landfill by target years. In England, the Government have introduced the Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme (LATS) to ensure that our share of these targets are met cost-effectively. LATS places an obligation on waste disposal authorities to landfill only BMW for which allowances are held. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have similar schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.6/5">Article 5(3) of the directive bans the landfilling of certain classes of waste, (for example liquids and most tyres), while article 6 requires that only waste that has undergone treatment (which includes sorting) may be landfilled.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.6/6">The remaining provisions of the directive apply principally to the operators of landfill sites and include measures to prevent or reduce potential adverse effects on the environment and risks to human health and for the aftercare and closure of landfill sites. These provisions and others are subject to the need for a permit and are monitored by the Environment Agency, as the regulator for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.6/7">DEFRA's Waste Implementation Delivery Programme (WIDP) is maintaining a national overview of existing and planned residual treatment capacity to ensure that resources are applied in the most effective manner.</p>

This predicts future populations within the noise contours (including the 54dBA contour level) for various operating and development scenarios in 2015, 2020 and 2030. All these documents are available on the Department's website at:</p>

These powers enable airports to introduce noise control schemes or impose financial penalties on aircraft operators straying from agreed flight paths or exceeding noise limits on departure. We plan to consult airport consultative committees next year as to the extent to which airports have begun to make use of these new powers and keep this issue under review. A number of airport operators have also introduced noise related charging schemes to encourage the use of quieter aircraft.</p>

States are required as a minimum to deliver the security standards laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and, within the European Union, those mandated by EU aviation security legislation. The Department for Transport engages both multilaterally and bilaterally to help reinforce aviation security performance in other countries, including in particular those from which there are flights to the UK.</p>

The grant allocation distributes &pound;212 million to authorities using a formula based on data about bus patronage, retail floor space, visitors and eligible population.</p>
	<p pid="c.1166W.3/2">Torbay's allocation for 2008-09 is &pound;0.982 million. This represents a significant increase on its existing budget for concessionary travel. We are confident that the total being distributed to local authorities is sufficient in aggregate to cover all the costs of the new concession.</p>
	<p pid="c.1166W.3/3">The special grant funding is only to meet the additional costs of the new concession. Existing funding for concessionary travel will continue to be distributed through the formula grant system (RSG). This is consistent with the wishes of local government to have freedom and flexibility in how they use their funding. Authorities are free to add local enhancements to the statutory minimum concession at their own discretion. However these enhancements must be funded locally.</p>

	<p pid="c.1176W.2/1">In the White Paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, we asked UK airport operators to consult on details of voluntary schemes to address 'generalised blight', to offer acoustic insulation to noise sensitive buildings such as schools and hospitals that are exposed to medium-to-high levels of aircraft noise, and to offer home relocation assistance to households subject to high levels of aircraft noise.</p>
	<p pid="c.1176W.2/2">BAA has put in place two schemes to mitigate the impacts of blight arising from a proposed third runway at Heathrow, and two schemes to mitigate the impacts of current aircraft noise. The two blight compensation schemes would be triggered at the point BAA decided to apply for planning permission to build a third runway. The two noise compensation schemes are currently active and eligible properties and community buildings have been contacted directly about how the schemes affect them. There are no plans to change these existing voluntary arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.1178W.2/1">To date, a centralised method has not been available to monitor the compliance of Highways Agency traffic officers with working time regulations. However, the agency recognises the need to implement a method of assessment which facilitates both local and central monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="c.1178W.2/2">As it moves towards implementation of Shared Services with Department for Transport and its other agencies, it is exploring in more detail how an electronic solution might best assist in the management and monitoring of working time. To that end, the agency is to implement a &quot;standard&quot; timesheet across the Traffic Officer Service by February 2008. By implementing the new timesheet the agency will be able to monitor working time in more detail.</p>

	<p pid="c.1178W.5/2">The results of the review were largely inconclusive in that, at the time, the roles within the HA were relatively new and many regions were still developing towards full service. As such, it was difficult to identify valid external comparators.</p>

	<p pid="c.1179W.2/1">Representations by Prospect at this year's pay talks have focused on their aim to achieve an award for their members that at least matches RPI inflation, the level of shift allowances, the methodology used to determine pay levels at the inception of the Traffic Officer Service and the pay differential between control room operators (mainly represented by the PCS Union) and on-road Traffic Officers, represented by Prospect.</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.2/2">The Highways Agency has responded that is it obliged to comply with Government policy on civil service pay and has to work within the pay remit approved by HM Treasury. It believes the offer for Prospect members in the Traffic Officer Service is the best that can be achieved within that policy and the approved remit. Higher shift allowances are not achievable except at the expense of the pay award for other Highways Agency employees. The Agency is undertaking a strategic review of its reward package and aims to review the pay and allowances for Traffic Officers as part of that work.</p>

It is also making provision for a possible new service towards Bedford or Oxford. It was not practicable, because of intense line and train occupation to change the decision in the 2003 Strategy for the route to provide new capacity so that peak hour commuter traffic, between Milton Keynes and London, will be handled by the Silverlink (now London Midland) services.</p>

The new DVLA systems already interact with IPS Passport systems and as the NIR is established the intention would be for DVLA to rely more on the ID verification provided by the new register and avoid the duplication in activities that currently have to take place as DVLA are required to carry out their own verification. This has been reported publicly in the ID scheme business case as the major benefit expected for DVLA.

	<p pid="c.1189W.2/1">In 2000, we published 'Tomorrow's Roads: Safer for Everyone', our road safety strategy to 2010. This contained a wealth of actions to educate road users, improve the road environment and enforce road safety offences. The strategy also contained a commitment to achieve by 2010:</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.2/2" class="indent">a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents;</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.2/3" class="indent">a 50 per cent. reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.2/4" class="indent">a 10 per cent. reduction in the slight casualty rate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.2/5">A review of the strategy earlier this year found that, while there was a need to improve further in a number of respects, progress against the targets was good:</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.2/6" class="indent">the number of people killed or seriously injured was 33 per cent. down;</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.2/7" class="indent">the number of children killed or seriously injured was 52 per cent. down; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.2/8" class="indent">the slight casualty rate was 28 per cent. down.</p>

	<p pid="c.1195W.0/1">The information is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.0/2">The ambulance response-time data that are collected, and which include the number of emergency calls received by ambulance trusts across England and their performance against the targets set, are published annually. The latest statistical bulletin, &quot;Ambulance Services, England, 2006-07&quot; was published in June 2007, a copy is available in the Library and includes data for the North West Ambulance Service Trust. The data are not collected or reported on below ambulance trust level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.0/3">Changing the way we measure response times to emergency calls will save lives. Implementing call connect, where the clock start time is taken from the moment an emergency call is connected to the local ambulance control room, will result in shorter waits for 999 calls to be answered and ambulances dispatched more quickly. The aim is to save lives and improve patient experience as well as ensuring that resources are being used efficiently combined with the necessary investment in technology. One key change is around vehicle deployment, with ambulance trusts implementing a front-loaded model. This is where ambulance trusts may send a single responder rather than double-crewed ambulance to some calls, based on the needs of the patient. This will free up resources for other calls and help to optimise performance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1198W.0/2">It is the policy of the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) to take a proportionate approach to inspection. CSCI's professional guidance for inspectors, 'Referring medication issues to a CSCI pharmacist inspector', sets out a targeted referral pathway whereby CSCI's generic inspectors will consult with regionally-based lead pharmacist inspectors wherever there is a concern about inappropriate handling of medication.</p>
	<p pid="c.1198W.0/3">In those cases where there would appear to be misuse of medication for sedation, an inspector would consult with the regional pharmacist inspection teams. Where there are serious concerns, a targeted inspection of a service could then be carried out by a pharmacist inspector. Pharmacist inspectors are also made available to generic inspectors to give advice and guidance on medication issues and are copied into regulation 37 (of the Care Homes Regulations 2001) cases, which relate to serious medication issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1198W.0/4">CSCI is aware of the dangers around misuse of medication and pharmacist inspectors routinely inspect controlled drugs in all of the services they visit. Pharmacist inspectors refer relevant information about controlled drugs to accountable officers in primary care trusts, who are part of the local intelligence networks set up following the Government's response to the Shipman inquiry. CSCI is also piloting a project in its south-west region for random inspections of services that stated on their annual quality assurance assessments that they have looked after schedule 2 controlled drugs in the past 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1205W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June 2006</phrase>, the Prime Minister and the former Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David Miliband) announced revised sustainable operations targets for the Government Estate. They focus on key areas such as carbon neutrality and emissions, energy efficiency, waste and water consumption.</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.8/2">The 2006 Estate targets include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.8/3" class="indent">Recycling:</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.8/4" class="indent">Departments to increase their recycling figures to 40 per cent, of their waste arisings by 2010 and to 75 per cent, of their waste by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.8/5">These targets will apply for the reporting period April 2006 to March 2007 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.8/6">Previous Government targets that applied to the Government Estate were launched in March 2004 but have since been superseded by the new targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.1205W.8/7">The Department has consistently exceeded the targets. Our performance over the past five years is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.1207W.2/1">Practice-based commissioning will improve the design and delivery of dermatology services. In particular, practice-based commissioners in partnership with primary care trusts (PCTs) draw up the detailed specification for services such as dermatology in order that these are tailored to best meet local needs. Practice-based commissioning can facilitate, where clinically appropriate, the provision of services such as dermatology in settings that are closer to home or more convenient for patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.1207W.2/2">For example in Huntingdonshire, practice-based commissioners have worked in partnership with the PCT to establish both general practitioner and consultant led clinics delivered in community settings for dermatology, anti-coagulation testing, ear nose and throat, community echocardiography testing and gynaecology services.</p>

The data is presented both in raw form and also standardised for changes in age, sex, method of admission and case type and exclude discharges for those coded as death, day cases, maternity spells, mental health specialties and those with a mention of cancer or chemotherapy for cancer anywhere in the spell. Full definitions are on the NCHOD website.</p>

	<p pid="c.1212W.2/1">Information on hospital building schemes approved (full business case (FBC) approved and financial close or tender awarded for both private finance initiative (PFI) and public capital schemes) in the last three years is in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.2/2">For PFI schemes expected completion dates ('Operational' in the table) are collected centrally at the point of financial close but whether these are precisely achieved is not logged. Capital costs are recorded at the point of financial close but not on completion as the risk of any cost overruns lie with the private sector under a PFI contract. Information on cost increases and the reasons for them from approval of the first business case in the procurement process (the strategic outline case (SOC) or outline business case (OBC)) to FBC for each scheme in the table are submitted annually as part of the Department's evidence for the Health Select Committee's Public Expenditure Inquiry. I refer the hon. Member to the reports of the House of Commons Health Committee 'Public Expenditure on Health and Personal Social Services, HC26-i'. Indicative timetables are set for all schemes as part of this first business case as part of approved project management practice but are revised as necessary to reflect changed circumstances and are not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.2/3">For public capital hospital building schemes expected completion dates ('Operational' in the table) are collected centrally at the point of tender award after FBC approval; cost increases and time overruns from then until completion are submitted annually to the Health Select Committee and can also be found in 'Public Expenditure on Health and Personal Social Services, HC26-i' (this shows all projects over &pound;10 million&mdash;new hospital building schemes are now considered by the Department as projects over &pound;25 million with a clear, frontline clinical purpose). The capital values provided in the table in this answer are taken at a point near to completion. Cost increases from approval of the first business case in the procurement process (the SOC or OBC) are not collected centrally nor requested by the Health Select Committee as part of the evidence. The information is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1216W.0/1">While National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have calculated that the average cost of delivering a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is &pound;750, the cost calculation for delivering CBT and other evidence-based psychological therapies, used in implementing the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, is lower.

	<p pid="c.1216W.6/1">We only support applications for national health service foundation trust status if we are satisfied that the NHS trust is a high performing organisation both in terms of service quality and financial rigour. Once NHS trusts become NHS foundation trusts they must continue to deliver high quality services and should they fall short of national standards then they will be subject to intervention by Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. Monitor has a range of interventions available, from increased reporting through to direct managerial change.</p>
	<p pid="c.1216W.6/2">All acute NHS trusts are obliged to report all methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) blood stream infections and <i> clostridium diff</i><i> i</i><i> cile</i> infection (CDI) diagnosed in their laboratory.</p>
	<p pid="c.1216W.6/3">In 2006-07, 69 trusts had MRSA rates above the national rate of 1.67 cases per 10,000 bed-days, and of these 15 were NHS foundation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1216W.6/4">However, it is misleading to compare trusts on their reported CDI surveillance data. This is because the calculation used attributes all cases of CDI to the trust whose laboratory detects and reports the infection. This is inappropriate for those trusts that test samples from other hospitals, general practitioner practices etc. because the rate produced is higher than the actual infection rate in trust patients.</p>

The grant will help women meet the additional costs involved in pregnancy and in the run up to birth.</p>
