Therefore, in terms of recording functions, no one should lose functionality of their VCR after switchover. However, in areas where digital switchover has taken place, any VCR with an analogue tuner will not be able to independently record one digital channel while the TV receiver is tuned to another digital channel.</p>

	<p pid="c.727W.0/2">All deployed personnel are issued a rules of engagement card, which specifies exactly the aspects of the law that allows them to conduct operations and react to hostile action.</p>
	<p pid="c.727W.0/3">Role specific training that covers the pertinent application of the Geneva Convention is also undertaken. For example, dedicated prisoner handling teams and medics are briefed in depth of their responsibilities that may be in addition to those usually held.</p>
	<p pid="c.727W.0/4">Trained and qualified lawyers are deployed on all standing operations and are an integral part of the targeting process, are consulted on all forms of the conduct of operations and are available for specialist queries if doubt exists.</p>

	<p pid="c.728W.2/1">We are taking the situation off the coast of Somalia very seriously and have played an important role in developing the military response to pirate activity. We have key command roles within all of the international task forces and continue to develop our strategies in line with changing operational and political requirements. Piracy is a symptom of wider instability in Somalia and the MOD continues to work comprehensively with other Government Departments and the International community as part of a coherent strategy to address the root causes of piracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/2">The UK is providing a sizeable contribution to the military effort in the region and has a leading role in countering pirate activity off the coast of Somalia:</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/3" class="indent">MOD has been at the forefront of the European Union mission-Operation Atalanta-since it was introduced in December 2008, providing the Operation Commander, the Operation HQ at Northwood, and a frigate for the first period of the operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/4" class="indent">The Royal Navy has a long standing commitment of frigates and a tanker to the Combined Maritime Force conducting maritime security operations in the region.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/5" class="indent">The Royal Navy is a contributor to the Standing NATO Maritime Groups, which at present are rotationally undertaking NATO's counter piracy mission-Operation Ocean Shield. The UK currently has command of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/6" class="indent">The Royal Navy manned UK Maritime Trade Organisation has been supporting Merchant Vessels transiting through the region since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/7">The UK has a bilateral arrangement with the Kenyan and Seychellois Governments which allows the transfer of suspected pirates for prosecution. Kenya is currently prosecuting eight suspected pirates detained by a Royal Navy vessel. We are very grateful for their ongoing support.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/8">Royal Navy vessels and coalition forces in the region seek to deter and disrupt pirate activity. Specifically, Royal Navy vessels can actively search for suspected pirate vessels. The Royal Navy can also take robust action to come to the aid of a victim vessel under attack by pirates in international waters. This can again range from deterring and disrupting the attack to the use of reasonable force to defend the victims. However, the safety of any hostages involved remains paramount.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/9">If suspected pirates are encountered, a decision will be made by the UK Maritime Component Commander, based on legal advice, on whether or not they could be transferred to a regional state for prosecution. If there is insufficient evidence to be confident of a successful prosecution, they will be released. Any piracy equipment found, such as ladders and weapons will be seized and disposed of accordingly.</p>

A further 53 suspected pirates have been encountered during boarding operations. However, following detailed analysis of all physical evidence and witness statements, all suspects were released as it was assessed that there was insufficient evidence to be reasonably confident that a successful prosecution could be undertaken in either Kenya or (more recently) Seychelles. The subsequent destruction of any pirate equipment and weapons serves as a disruption measure and prevents their future use.</p>

	<p pid="c.734W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/2">All EU legislative provisions on police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters adopted on the basis of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) apply to the UK, with the exception of the Council Decision concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by designated authorities of member states and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences. The UK was excluded from that measure on the basis that it builds on that part of the Schengen acquis in which the UK does not participate. The UK is challenging this decision before the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/3">The only other measures adopted with a legal base in the TEU which build on the Schengen acquis are those relating to the development of the second generation Schengen Information System, where the UK will participate in the police and justice elements of that system. The Council is also negotiating a Council Decision with a TEU legal base to create a mechanism to evaluate applications to join the Schengen area.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/4">We do not participate in any measures building on the Schengen acquis with a legal basis in Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC). This is because the UK has not opted into that part of the Schengen acquis which deals with visa and immigration. This is one of the areas regulated by Title IV TEC (the other being civil law, which is not an area of Schengen co-operation).</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/5">Measures with a legal basis in Title IV TEC which do not build on the Schengen acquis are subject to the Title IV opt-in protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, which means the UK can chose what it participates in.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/6">To date we have opted in to 43 measures on asylum and migration and 15 measures on civil law. There are 82 measures which we have either not opted in to or have not been eligible to participate in.</p>

	<p pid="c.737W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had detailed and wide ranging discussions with Foreign Minister Lavrov when he visited Moscow from 1 to <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-03">3 November 2009</phrase>. Topics included our concerns about human rights and the rule of law. The Foreign Secretary stressed both the importance of effective investigations into attacks on human rights defenders and journalists, including in the North Caucasus, and the importance of the rule of law in protecting property rights and safeguarding investments. The Foreign Secretary also met non-governmental organisations and civil society in Moscow, when he listened to their concerns and reasserted that the UK will continue raising human rights concerns as part of a comprehensive dialogue with the Russian authorities. I followed up these discussions during my recent meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Karasin.</p>
	<p pid="c.737W.0/2">Human rights and the progress of Russian democracy are high on the agenda and we do not shy away from making our concerns known. We support President Medvedev's ambition to improve the rule of law in Russia, as an important way of protecting human rights and reducing corruption. We want to see democracy in Russia deliver political pluralism and all its associated freedoms. We believe that an open and democratic Russia will provide better opportunities for the Russian people and consolidate Russia as a stable and reliable international partner for the global community.</p>

Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/>  2. Alcohol-related admissions<br/>  The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br/>  Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br/>  Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/>  Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br/>  Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/>  Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/>  Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/>  Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br/>  Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/>  Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/>  Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/>  Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/>  Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/>  Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/>  3. Ungrossed data<br/>  Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/>  4. Finished admission episodes<br/>  A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/>  5. Data quality<br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/>  6. Assessing growth through time<br/>  HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/>  7. Assignment of Episodes to Years<br/>  Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br/>  8. n/a = not available.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  HES, The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.743W.8/1">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) advises the Government in relation to the protection of communities from radiation hazards, including those associated with exposure to non-ionising radiation such as the radio waves from wireless communication systems. The HPA has concluded that there is no consistent evidence to date that exposure to radio waves from wireless networks adversely affects the health of the general population and that there is no reason why schools and others should not use wi-fi equipment. The HPA also keeps the situation under review.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.8/2">The HPA has reviewed technical standards and wireless equipment used in United Kingdom schools, and performed laboratory measurements with examples of typical equipment. The results are consistent with the position that exposures to the radio waves from Wi-Fi equipment are not expected to exceed internationally-accepted guidelines and that they are less than from mobile telephones. Further measurements in school classrooms are planned, as are computer modelling studies. Information about these studies is available on the HPA website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.743W.8/4">The Department of Health has not commissioned or undertaken any studies specifically on the effect of wi-fi on the health of people who are reportedly electrosensitive. The independently managed Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has investigated whether electrical hypersensitivity symptoms result from exposure to radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones. In its 2007 report the MTHR Programme Management Committee concluded that the MTHR research results, taken together with earlier evidence, offered no support for this hypothesis. The MTHR report is available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.744W.5/1">This Department has not made its own estimates of the level of mental illness among children in each of the last 12 years. It commissioned the Office of National Statistics to carry out surveys in 1999 and 2004 on the mental health of children and young people in Great Britain. The 2004 survey found that nearly one in 10 children aged five to 16 had a clinically diagnosable mental disorder. The 1999 survey, which covered children aged five to 15, produced a similar result. Earlier surveys have shown that the proportion of young people with hyperactive or emotional problems increased significantly between 1974 and 1999 but this increase may not reflect and increase in incidence, but rather greater awareness of conditions. No recent assessments have been carried out on trends because of the difficulty in identifying the extent to which other factors, such as greater awareness of conditions, have contributed to changes in incidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.5/2">A three-year study by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), commissioned by the Department and the Scottish Executive, &quot;Three Years On: A survey of the emotional development and wellbeing of children and young people&quot; published in October 2008 tracked the emotional wellbeing of a sample of children and young people between 2004 and 2007 and reviewed the factors likely to be associated with the onset or persistence of mental disorders. The report is downloadable from the ONS website.</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.5/3">An independent CAMHS Review, commissioned by Ministers, reported in November 2008 setting out 20 recommendations to improve children and young people's mental health and psychological wellbeing. The full Government response to the CAMHS Review is to be published soon.</p>

The authorities responsible for authorising the use of covert human intelligence sources under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ('RIPA')-including the Serious Organised Crime Agency which replaced the National Criminal Intelligence Service and National Crime Squad in 2005-are listed in Schedule 1 to that Act as amended by statutory instruments 2003 No.3171, 2005 No. 1084 and 2006 No. 1874.

	<p pid="c.757W.3/1">The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) cannot be achieved without addressing the specific needs and rights of people with disabilities.

It is estimated that 90 per cent. of children with disabilities in developing countries are out of school.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.3/2">The UK is spending &#163;8.5 billion over the period 2006-07-2015-16 in support of education in developing countries. Alongside funding from other donors, these resources are used to support governments to ensure all children have access to basic education-including the children with disabilities. DFID is the second largest donor (&#163;202 million) to the global financing partnership for education, the Education for All- Fast Track Initiative (FTI). We use our support to the FTI to leverage greater attention from partner governments to the needs of the most excluded children. DFID also directly supports Disability Partner Organisations (DPOs) in countries where we work to advocate for the rights for adults and children with disabilities. This is in recognition that social stigma and discrimination remain the main barriers for children with disabilities to attend school.</p>

No time period was specified. As my <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-09">9 November</phrase> answer explained, no such records are held centrally. To seek to obtain the information would therefore require an exhaustive search of both electronic and paper records across the Department for Transport at least as far back as 2002 when options for airport development were consulted upon. Such an exercise would well exceed the &#163;750 threshold in Cabinet Office guidance for written questions.</p>

Accurate cost estimates can only be obtained once a scheme's detailed design has been undertaken, as this will depend on the type of treatment required and associated site specific requirements. The higher costs would only be incurred where roads constructed to old design standards (i.e. before 1987) were resurfaced, so these are becoming increasingly rare.</p>

	<p pid="c.774W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking how many vacancies for (a) all jobs (b) jobs of less than 16 hours a week and (c) jobs of 16 to 30 hours a week there were in each region and country of the UK in the latest period for which figures are available (302455).</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics measures the number of vacancies in the UK using the ONS Vacancy Survey. There were an estimated 428,000 vacancies in the UK in the period August to October 2009 (seasonally adjusted). Estimates of the number of vacancies in regions and countries of the UK are not available from this source.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.2/6" class="indent">An alternative source of data is the Jobcentre Plus administrative system. This data only includes job vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and so is inconsistent with the UK estimates from the ONS Vacancy Survey, which covers a wider range of vacancies. However, geographical breakdowns of Jobcentre Plus data are available, apart from Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.2/7" class="indent">Neither the ONS Vacancy Survey nor the Jobcentre Plus administrative data give details of whether vacancies are for less than 16 hours a week or between 16 and 30 hours a week. However, the Jobcentre Plus administrative data does give a split between full-time jobs, defined as 30 or more hours a week, and part-time jobs, defined as less than 30 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.2/8" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the number of live unfilled job vacancies held by Jobcentre Plus for each English region, Scotland, Wales and Great Britain for October 2009. The table also shows the number of live unfilled vacancies that are for full-time and for part-time jobs.</p>

	<p pid="c.775W.2/5" class="indent">Estimates of economic inactivity are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS).

	<p pid="c.775W.2/6" class="indent">Estimates of the reasons for inactivity are not available for all people aged 16 and over.

	<p pid="c.782W.5/1">The Government are committed to reducing all fire deaths and use research and statistics to inform more effective targeting of fire safety messages. We are aware of the potential vulnerability of older people to domestic fire. The latest fire statistics (2007) show that over 50 per cent. of the fatalities in accidental dwelling fires were aged over 65.</p>
	<p pid="c.782W.5/2">Independent research, published in 2006, highlighted five key groups who were more vulnerable to fire and harder to reach with crucial messages, one of whom was older people. The Government's Fire Kills campaign seeks to reduce fire deaths in older age groups through specifically targeting its television advertising at programmes that older people are likely to watch. The campaign recognises the importance of partnership working. We are pursuing a range opportunities with Help The Aged/Age Concern, the main suppliers of oxygen to hospital out-patients, and Bowls England, as a means to deliver fire safety messages to older people through their trusted communication channels.</p>
	<p pid="c.782W.5/3">Between 2004 and 2008, Government provided pump-priming funding of &#163;25 million to fire and rescue services to deliver a programme of home fire risk checks. Firefighters target this free service to vulnerable groups in their communities, including older people and provide tailored fire safety advice and, where necessary, install free smoke alarms. Fire and rescue services continue to deliver this programme and funding is now available through the Revenue Support Grant Block Grant.</p>

	<p pid="c.783W.2/1">The Government are committed to the protection of green belt and its crucial characteristics of openness and permanence. Under our policy in PPG2 (Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, Green Belts), house building in green belt other than limited infill in villages or affordable housing for local needs allowed for in development plan policies is 'inappropriate development'. Any such proposal would be subject to the tests set out in PPG2.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.2/2">Government encouragement to give priority to &quot;brownfield&quot; development is also playing its part. In 2008, 80 per cent. of dwellings (including conversions) were built on brownfield land. Also, homes were built at an average of 44 per hectare. This all helps to reduce the pressure on both greenfield and green belt land.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.2/3">Green belt area at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase> was estimated to be 1,638,840 hectares, around 13 per cent. of the land area of England. This represents a net increase of 3,170 hectares on the <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase> estimate of 1,635,370 hectares.</p>

	<p pid="c.785W.5/1">As at June 2008, it was estimated that local authorities had spent &#163;224 million on the response to and recovery from the summer 2007 floods. This total includes insurable costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.785W.5/2">Government made available a comprehensive package of over &#163;136 million to assist the affected regions and help those in greatest need, including funding for schools, transport and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.785W.5/3">The Bellwin scheme was activated nationwide, for all authorities affected by the June and July 2007 floods. The schemes announced by the Prime Minister were among the most generous ever, with an extension of the period for which local authorities are eligible to claim from two months to six months and an increase in the proportion of costs local authorities could claim to 100 per cent. (instead of the usual 85 per cent.), once they spent above their usual threshold (0.2 per cent. of their revenue budget). Around &#163;19 million was paid out through this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.785W.5/4">In addition, we exceptionally made available Flood Recovery Grant of &#163;18.4 million to support the work of the hardest hit local authorities in helping these people in their communities in greatest need and, in July 2008, &#163;30.6 million was allocated under the Restoration Fund to support their continued efforts to rebuild their communities. The Department for Children, Schools and Families also made &#163;13.5 million available for schools and children's services affected by the floods.</p>
	<p pid="c.785W.5/5">Local authorities are expected to meet some of the costs of flooding by claiming on their insurance policies, reprioritising their budgets, and using their reserves, if necessary. Every local authority is required to maintain reserves, one of the main purposes of which is to meet unexpected costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.786W.3/1">No estimates of the likely bills have been made, as these contain not only transitional relief but all other reliefs, some determined at the billing authorities' discretion. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the likely bill of a hereditament.</p>
	<p pid="c.786W.3/2">For the purpose of modelling the 2010 transitional relief scheme, the Notional Chargeable Amount (NCA) was calculated. The NCA for a given year is the product of the rateable value and that year's small business multiplier. The NCA is then compared to the previous year's reference value increased by the caps. The minimum of these two values was used as a proxy for the bill after transition but before all other reliefs. Details on the methodology and assumptions used can be found on page 49 of the &quot;Transitional arrangements for the non-domestic rating revaluation 2010 in England&quot; consultation document.

	<p pid="c.795W.2/2">Absconds have been falling for some years and last year recorded the lowest number of absconds on record. This year is on course to improve further on that record low. Prisoners abscond from prison for many reasons. While open prisons will look for indications that prisoners may be susceptible to absconding, both on allocation to the prison and during their stay in the prison, it is not possible to predict every instance in which a prisoner may want to abscond.</p>

	<p pid="c.800W.5/1">There is a well established categorisation and allocation system which aims to ensure that all prisoners are allocated to a prison with a security category consistent with managing their needs in terms of security and control. The categorisation process assesses the risks posed by individual prisoners in terms of: likelihood of escape or abscond; the risk of harm to the public in the event of an escape or abscond and any control issues that impact on the security of the prison and those within it. The risk assessment will take account of issues including: the nature and circumstances of the index offence, any previous convictions, positive and successful efforts to reduce identified risk levels.</p>

Convicted murderers serving life sentences and other indeterminate sentence prisoners will be transferred from closed to open prison conditions only following the decisions of the independent Parole Board. Before making such a decision, the Parole Board must be satisfied that the case meets the criteria set out in the Directions to the Parole Board under section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.</p>

	<p pid="c.806W.5/1">Published research, commissioned by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in 2005, by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) estimated that 69 per cent. of the employees receiving Employer Supported Childcare (ESC) are women (Table 4.6, Page 49). NatCen's report is available at</p>
	<p pid="c.806W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/research/research-report23.htm">www.hmrc.gov.uk/research/research-report23.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.806W.5/3">The report also estimates the number of eligible employees offered employer supported childcare in late 2005 and that childcare vouchers represent the majority of the provision of ESC. Using these estimates along with the eligible employee take up rate for those offered ESC (on page 44) shows that approximately 63,200 women were receiving childcare vouchers at the end of 2005. Information for other time periods is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.806W.5/4">The report also estimates the proportion of employers that offer ESC split by Government office region (Table A.7, Appendix A, page 19). From this, an estimated 85 per cent. of employers offered ESC are based in England and 1 per cent. in the North East of England. No such estimate is available for the constituency Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland.</p>
	<p pid="c.806W.5/5">These numbers should be treated with caution as the employee take up rate and use of vouchers over other forms of ESC would likely vary from region to region and this does not account for employees working in one region and living in another. All of these estimates are subject to very wide confidence intervals due to random sampling.</p>

Officials and line managers are required to report all accidents and incidents that occur during the course of work. This includes accidents whilst driving on official business. Any reported incidents involving injury are investigated and compliance is normally monitored through internal audit procedures.</p>

	<p pid="c.811W.8/2">The Barnett formula has been applied to changes in provision of UK Government Departments in spending reviews over the last five years. The Barnett formula is applied to the aggregate changes in provision of Departments. Details are provided in spending review White Papers. Under the Barnett formula arrangements the Scottish Executive receives an unhypothecated block budget which it then allocates reflecting its own priorities. Details of spending by UK Government Departments can be found in their departmental reports. So while the Scottish Executive has received Barnett consequentials on spending on renewable energy sources these are not separately calculated or identified in its spending review settlements.</p>

	<p pid="c.815W.2/1">The Manufacturing Strategy launched in September 2008 brings together over &#163;150 million support for a range of policy measures that address key issues impacting on competitiveness such as skills, design, technology, global value chains and the move to a low carbon economy. Work is also well under way to complete a new purpose-built Manufacturing Technology Centre at Ansty, near Coventry, which will provide industrial-scale demonstration facilities to help industry develop new manufacturing capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/2">The Advanced Manufacturing package of measures announced in July 2009 provides more than &#163;150 million from the Strategic Investment Fund to support the development of high tech manufacturing that will enable UK manufacturers to take advantage of new market opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/3">Over the last 12 months, the Government have also launched the Real Help for Business package, and the Vehicle Scrappage Scheme where more than a quarter of a million orders for new vehicles have been placed, 9 per cent. of which were in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/4">The recently expanded Manufacturing Advisory Service has conducted 31,000 manufacturing reviews and supported more than 11,000 implementation projects worth nearly &#163;700 million value added. Support in the West Midlands over the past year was worth &#163;7.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/5">In addition, Advantage West Midlands has provided assistance worth just over &#163;54 million to manufacturers in the West Midlands over the last 12 months, including a &#163;3.5 million boost for the automotive supply chain announced in July.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/6">Based on ONS's latest Index of Production (IOP) data, manufacturing output in the UK declined 15.3 per cent. from peak to trough (February 2008 to August 2009), however there are no comparable data for manufacturing output in the West Midlands over the same time period.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/7">In the UK, during the three months to June 2008 there were 2.87 million employee jobs in the manufacturing industry, while in the three months to June 2009 there were 2.64 million, a fall of 7.9 per cent. This compares to the West Midlands where there were 322,000 employee jobs in the manufacturing industry in the three months to June 2008, while in the three months to June 2009 there were 284,000, a fall of 11.8 per cent.</p>

Our Renewable Energy Strategy consultation estimated that renewable energy could generate 160,000 jobs by 2020, both in the UK and abroad. Since the consultation, research commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) suggests that the size of the renewable energy sector and of the broader low-carbon and environmental goods and services economy, has been substantially underestimated. Based on the research projections and Labour Force Survey data, we estimate that this strategy, combined with a growing market for renewable energy across Europe and globally, could increase UK employment in the renewable energy sector by up to 500,000 people by 2020. (These projections use a broad definition of the sector and are subject to considerable uncertainty).</p>

	<p pid="c.822W.5/6">A wide range of venues were considered for each location. Suggested venues have been recommended by local authorities and energy companies (who have undertaken similar events in the past) and we have endeavoured to use as many of these recommendations as possible. A continuous three-day slot that stayed open into the evening was also sought, which meant many venues were unavailable due to regular weekly clubs/fitness programmes etc.</p>

	<p pid="c.830W.3/2">Plans to legislate for mandatory parenting orders when 10 to 15-year-olds breach their ASBO are contained in the Crime and Security Bill. Parenting orders are court-based orders that can be applied for by a range of different agencies in different circumstances. They are intended for parents who are unwilling to engage with voluntary measures. An order will specify requirements for the parent to comply with, for example, to counselling or guidance sessions for a period of up to three months. They may also have conditions imposed on them such as attending meetings with teachers at their child's school, ensuring their child does not visit a particular place unsupervised or ensuring their child is at home at particular times. These conditions can last for a period up to 12 months. A parent/carer can be prosecuted for failing to keep the requirements of the order. A parenting order is a civil order but breach of the order is an offence punishable by a fine of up to &#163;1,000.</p>

It is therefore not possible to disaggregate the amount allocated to nursery provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.3/3">The Department provides a number of other grants to local authorities to fund the wider policies of Early Years provision. The Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant (SSEYCG) supports the delivery of the Government's 10-Year Strategy for Childcare and the goals in the Children's Plan, by providing funding: for Sure Start children's centres; for the Graduate Leader Fund; to improve the quality of and access to learning environments in early years settings; and to transform short break services for disabled children, among other things.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.3/4">Details of the amounts allocated to the various strands of the SSEYCG are shown in the following table. Many of the strands are not individually ring-fenced, and similarly to the DSG, local authorities are responsible for apportioning the grant to best meet local needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.3/5">Lastly the Standard's Fund includes funding to extend and increase the flexibility of the entitlement for three and four-year-olds to free child care. The local authorities in question received an allocation for this in 2009-10, details of which are also shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid="c.841W.5/1">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November 2009</phrase> the allocation of &#163;271 million of capital funding for the provision of additional primary places by 2011, to 34 authorities including both Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames. Richmond is allocated &#163;3.3 million and Kingston &#163;8.2 million. This will enable these authorities to start projects to provide additional permanent places for 2010 and beyond. This allocation is in addition to over &#163;1.2 billion allocated nationally from 2008-11, to support the provision of additional school places.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.5/2">It is the responsibility of local authorities to forecast and plan to provide school places where they are needed. The Government allocate capital funding to support their provision, based on local authority forecasts. However, we accept that in some areas there have recently been local demographic and other pressures which have made this unusually difficult. Therefore, in July, we invited all authorities which are experiencing exceptionally high and unpredicted increase in demand for additional primary school places to apply for additional funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.5/3">Initially, we secured &#163;200 million for this need, but when evaluating applications, and from discussions with authorities and representative bodies, we concluded that a larger sum, and more flexibility in our eligibility and allocation criteria, would provide appropriate support to a wide range of the neediest authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.5/4">The Department does not allocate revenue money directly to schools. Local authorities need to allocate budgets to schools for the 2010-11 financial year before the <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.848W.2/1">The DCSF does not have any specific estimate of the extent of eating disorders caused by bullying. However, we do know that bullying can destroy lives and impact negatively on young people's confidence, self-esteem, mental health, and social and emotional development, so it is important that young people who are suffering speak out.</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/2">Because of the effects of bullying, the DCSF has sent a strong message to all that bullying should not be tolerated in and outside of schools. To reinforce this message, we have given schools the powers to regulate the conduct of pupils, to put measures in place to promote good behaviour, respect for others and to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.</p>
