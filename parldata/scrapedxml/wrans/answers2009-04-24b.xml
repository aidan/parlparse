	<p pid="b.900W.0/3" class="italic"> Parliamentary Question Number 269667: To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, how many and what percentage of special schools assessed as inadequate by Ofsted at their most recent inspection are in each decile of area deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.0/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.0/5" class="indent">Inspections of maintained and non-maintained special schools are carried out under the inspection framework defined by section 5 of the Education Act 2005, and include a judgement on overall effectiveness. Inspections of non-association independent special schools are carried out under the inspection framework defined by section 162a of the Education Act 2002, as amended by schedule 8 of the Education Act 2005. Under this framework, there is no summary judgement for overall effectiveness and these schools are not categorised as outstanding, good, satisfactory or inadequate. Consequently, Ofsted does not hold the information on these schools that you requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.0/6" class="indent">Table A shows the numbers and percentages of maintained special schools and non-maintained special schools found to be inadequate at their most recent Ofsted inspection. These have been allocated to ten bands according to the income deprivation affecting children index (IDACI) 2007 produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government, where 1 indicates the most deprived 10%, and 10 indicates the least deprived 10%.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.0/7" class="indent">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March 2009</phrase>, 984 maintained special schools and 73 non-maintained schools were open in England. 958 of the maintained special schools and 70 of the non-maintained special schools have been inspected by Ofsted up to <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>, the latest inspection data available. Of these, 14 maintained special schools and 2 non-maintained special schools were found to be inadequate at their most recent inspection. The IDACI was then used to allocate these schools into ten bands, based on their postcodes.</p>

	<p pid="b.900W.0/51" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.0/52" class="indent">Table A shows the number of maintained special schools and non-maintained special schools inspected by Ofsted under the current inspection framework (commonly known as section 5), as well as their inspection outcomes. These have been allocated to ten bands according to the income deprivation affecting children index (IDACI) 2007 produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government, where 1 indicates the most deprived 10%, and 10 indicates the least deprived 10%. Table B shows the same figures expressed as percentages.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.0/53" class="indent">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March 2009</phrase>, 984 maintained special schools and 73 non-maintained special schools were open in England. 958 of the maintained special schools and 70 of the non-maintained special schools have been inspected by Ofsted up to <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>, the latest inspection data available. The IDACI was used to allocate these schools into ten bands, based on their postcodes. The IDACI band of deprivation is not yet available for the postcode of one maintained special school and, therefore, this school, which was rated outstanding, has been excluded from the analysis. The information used to allocate postcodes to IDACI band of deprivation has been updated since my response to Parliamentary Question 264609. As a result, the number of good schools in the 10% most deprived areas has increased from 56 to 57.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.0/54" class="indent">Within the total number of inspected schools given above, two maintained special schools and one non-maintained special school were last inspected under the previous inspection framework (commonly known as section 10), in use before September 2005. The inspection outcomes and deprivation bands for these overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor. It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from a seven- to a four-point scale. Ofsted's criteria for making inspection judgements about schools are clearly set out in our inspection guidance. Inspectors do not make reference to, or comparisons with, the previous inspection framework.</p>

	<p pid="b.908W.5/3">Persistent absence, where a pupil misses 20 per cent. or more of schooling, is the best indicator of problem absence. The proportion of persistent absentees in primary, secondary and special schools fell to 3.6 per cent. in 2007/08 compared to 4.1 per cent. in 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.5/4">Persistent absence in secondary schools accounted for 27.7 per cent. of all overall absence. All schools and local authorities now have to target 'persistent absentees' and in 2007/08 persistent absence fell by 17 per cent. in the 452 schools with the highest numbers of persistent absentees.</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.3/3">These assessment summaries were the outcome of the scrutiny of all proposals received, including Dunsfold Park, following the launch of the Eco-towns Prospectus (July 2007), and considered proposals in relation to the eco-towns criteria set out in the prospectus. Where proposals met the criteria they then were looked at across Government and its agencies in terms of transport and environment issues, and the opportunities that the locations put forward. Dunsfold Park was not judged to perform sufficiently strongly against the eco-towns criteria to be shortlisted.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.3/4">As the Dunsfold Park proposal was not shortlisted for consultation in 'Eco-towns&mdash;Living a greener future' (April 2008) no further representations were received by my Department or the Government Office South East in relation to the eco-town proposal. Representations received prior to this from Dunsfold Park Ltd. and its advisers, and any of the promoters of proposals not shortlisted, are not being released by my Department, because this could potentially prejudice any future applications they make in relation to their proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.926W.0/1">Jurisdiction over the investigation of the death of a member of the armed forces will vary depending on where the death occurs. In the United Kingdom the armed forces are subject to the law in the same way as other citizens. Therefore primacy for any investigation lies with the local civil police force. Jurisdiction over the investigation of the death of a member of the armed forces overseas will vary depending on the nature of the incident: foreign civil police and/or service police will sometimes investigate if the death occurs overseas, arrangements will vary from country to country. Where a death occurs on a warship or auxiliary at sea, investigations will fall to the service police and/or (within UK territorial waters) Ministry of Defence police until such time as it can reasonably be established that no criminal act by a person within the services' jurisdiction has taken place. In operational theatres, the service police will usually investigate the cause of death for all unnatural deaths under the lead of the Provost Marshal (Army). A service inquiry will be convened for deaths where it is considered that anything of consequence may be learned which is not apparent from the incident or which has not been or is unlikely to be identified by any other report into the matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.927W.8/1">The armed forces conduct a wide variety of overseas military exercises each year. All overseas exercises are conducted in order to generate, or maintain military capability in line with the tasks outlined in Defence Strategic Guidance. On occasion, exercises are cancelled for reasons that include: effectiveness of delivery; value for money constraints; international policy dimensions and circumstances; operational constraints; and focus on current operations. Table two on page 54 of the MOD Annual Report and Accounts 2007-08 (volume 1) summarises the military exercises cancelled each year since 2004-05. Copies of this report are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.8/2">Further data in response to this question has been collated from the Defence Exercise Programme and from the Front Line Command (FLC) archives depicting both the overseas collective training exercises that were undertaken and those cancelled since 2003.

	<p pid="b.930W.4/1">We have a programme of outreach to Muslim communities around the UK by Ministers and senior officials to engage on foreign policy issues and challenge extremists' distortions of British foreign policy. Engaging with communities also helps tackle misconceptions about UK foreign policy and undermines the extremist narrative. Violent extremists use misconceptions about foreign policy as a way to radicalise vulnerable young people in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.4/2">The cost of foreign policy outreach events to British Muslim communities undertaken by Ministers and Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials during FY 2008-09 was &pound;85,000. During the past year my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary personally visited the following areas:</p>

	<p pid="b.930W.4/9">We expect that outreach activity during FY 2009-10 will incur roughly similar costs to the previous year. Funding for FY 2010-11 is yet to be allocated. Visits are evaluated through feedback from participants and local authorities as well as by monitoring wider dissemination of information about the events through press coverage and blogs. Locations for visits over the coming year are yet to be decided but we intend to include areas with substantial Muslim and diaspora communities.

Arrangements can include rescheduling the asylum interview date to accommodate childcare arrangements, or provide childcare provision at or near UKBA premises where this is safe and sensible.</p>
	<p pid="b.938W.6/2">Where suitable alternative arrangements have proved impossible the asylum interview will go ahead with the child present. In these cases, the case owner will offer sufficient breaks and will fully note any disruptions on the interview record.</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.14/1">Inquiries from my officials have established that the letter referred to in the Question is about settlement in the UK for former Gurkhas who retired before July 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.14/2">In September 2008, the High Court agreed that the 1997 cut-off date applied to retired Gurkhas was sound and not discriminatory. However, it did find that the policy guidance relating to the treatment of Gurkhas discharged before 1997 was not sufficiently clear and did not cover service-related factors. We are determined to get the revised guidance right to ensure that it is fair to all Gurkhas and this has involved consultation across Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.14/3">The revised guidance for Gurkhas who retired before July 1997 and who wish to seek settlement in the UK will be published by <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-24">24 April</phrase>. We want to give Members the fullest possible information and we therefore plan to write to them on or soon after that date with an explanation of our revised guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.949W.3/1">As part of the 14 to 19 education and adult skills reforms, we are developing the Foundation Learning Tier (FLT) to create a more coherent set of entry level and level 1 qualifications for both young people and adults. By 2010/11 we expect the majority of foundation learning to be offered through the FLT in all settings. There will be a focus on employability throughout the FLT, supporting independent living where possible, which is vital for those with LDD.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.3/2">Planned investment for adults aged 19 or over (including those aged 25 or over) undertaking FLT activity is estimated at around &pound;230 million each year for 2008-09 and 2009-10 (Grant Letter to Learning and Skills Council (LSC), November 2008). The exact amount spent on adults through the FLT will depend on demand; however the funding is not separated out within this age group.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.3/3">Funding for 16 to 18-year-olds is allocated in line with the expected route of learning, for example schools, further education colleges, work-based learning and specialist colleges for those with LDD.

Interest rates are normally adjusted annually, each September.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.2/2">For borrowers repaying income contingent loans, which have been available since 1998, the rate of interest makes no difference to the level of their monthly repayments. Borrowers repay 9 per cent. of their earnings over the income threshold of &pound;15,000.</p>

It is not possible to separately identify the payment rate of fines arising from unpaid PNDs, but the latest enforcement rate for all fines, including those from unpaid PNDs, is 85.2 per cent. for the period April-December 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.958W.5/1">Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs hold infrequent requests, dating back 20 years, from local offices for authority to make an application to the magistrates court to force entry. There have been no instances where Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs have used the power. Since the introduction of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 records held by Her Majesty's Court Service show that the power to force entry has been used by magistrates court civilian enforcement officers 386 times. The power to force entry has been used by private bailiffs contracted to Her Majesty's Court Service on two occasions. Her Majesty's Court Service does not hold the information requested centrally and it would require extensive manual intervention to retrieve from individual court records.

Initially, attention has been focused on server rooms, and monitoring equipment is being installed to measure energy consumption from which other information can be derived. As the Northern Ireland Office does not have separate electrical circuits for ICT equipment in offices, the measurement of energy consumption will be based on using a 'ready reckoner' across the Department and the information extrapolated.

This is the sort of level to be expected from the current system and it is a limitation of the design/technology available when it was implemented in 2004. The equipment is still in use since the Northern Ireland Office has sought to extend the lifecycle as recommended in the Cabinet Office Greening ICT strategy. However, the Department has also been testing new replacement technologies known collectively as 'virtualisation', and future refreshes of our internal network will implement this new technology to achieve the recommended 50 per cent. server utilisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.976W.3/1">Through the London Development Agency's Local Employment and Training Framework (LETF), delivered by the five Olympic host boroughs in partnership with the Olympic Delivery Authority, 3,446 local residents have been given Olympic-related skills training. This has included direct construction training such as plant, civils, rail and steelwork, as well as preliminary construction-related training such as site security. Training provision is based on specific forecasted demand for the skills requirements of the Olympic Park and Village and other local construction projects such as the Stratford City development and the East London Line Extension project.</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.3/2">The LDA uses three main training categories; Skills Basic, Skills Other and Skills Level 2. Skills Basic is equivalent to literacy, numeracy or ESOL at Entry Level 3 and above; Skills Level 2 is broadly equivalent to NVQ Level 2; Skills Other is formed of training between Skills Basic and Level 2, and this qualification has been specifically designed for use by the five host boroughs to deliver a range of short entry level courses based on the expressed requirements of employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.3/3">For the year 2008-09, by the end of quarter 3 there had been 1,458 Skills Other trainees and 147 Skills Level 2 trainees. Of these, 665 trainees, all of who were previously unemployed, had already moved into new jobs. Activity has continued into January, February and March, and the next LETF update to cover the full year will be available on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-01">1 May 2009</phrase>. The numbers receiving training during 2007-08 were 1,749 Skills Other and 65 Level 2, and for 2006-07 (commencing late autumn) the numbers receiving training were 764 Skills Other, but no Level 2s.</p>
