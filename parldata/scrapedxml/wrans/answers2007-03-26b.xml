	<p pid="b.1229W.6/21">The steady increase in carbon emissions from electricity was due to an increase in electricity consumption in the Palace and 7 Millbank. This was due mainly to the installation and usage of more air conditioning units.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.6/22">The figures have been calculated from gas and electricity invoices and not meter readings taken by estate staff, but estimated invoices were amended using actual meter readings where possible. Natural gas invoices list several multiplying factors used to calculate each month's consumption and the existing monitoring and targeting system used on the parliamentary estate, based on staff meter readings, is not as sophisticated and therefore not as accurate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">pursuant to the reply,  <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March 2007</phrase>, Official Report,<i> c.</i><i> 907</i> W</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/2">I regret that my previous answer was not published in full. The complete answer is set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/3">Only residual waste after recycling has taken place is sent for incineration with energy recovery. In 2006 residual waste collected from the parliamentary estate amounted to 1,299 tonnes. This material was combusted at an energy recovery facility regulated by the Environment Agency, generating 725,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. The recovered energy is classed as renewable energy by the UK Government, in line with directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/4">Recovering energy from waste is acknowledged in the Stern Review as an effective weapon in combating climate change, displacing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power generation sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/5">The carbon footprint associated with the combustion of this waste is made up of a number of components:</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/6" class="indent">(1) Direct emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), expressed as carbon equivalents</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/7" class="indent">(2) &quot;Avoided&quot; emissions of GHG (that is, emissions displaced from an equivalent amount of fossil fuel power generating capacity)</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/8" class="indent">(3) GHG emissions (additional or saved) from waste transportation</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/9" class="indent">(4) Net GHG emissions, taking account of direct, avoided and transport-related emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/10" class="italic"> Direct emissions of GHG</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/11">GHG emissions from waste combustion are calculated in two steps. First, an estimate is made of the percentage of fossil and non-fossil carbon in the waste. Second, the emissions from the combustion of the fossil carbon within the waste are calculated. Emissions of non-fossil carbon do not contribute to global warming and are therefore not taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/12">Methane is not produced in combustion plants. The remaining greenhouse gases are released in trace quantities relative to emissions of carbon dioxide. Because their concentrations in the emission gases vary according to the composition of the waste, the total GHG effect expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (Teq) is estimated using emission factors developed by Defra, based on measured emissions averaged across UK energy recovery facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/13">Direct GHG emissions following the combustion of residual waste from parliamentary estates amounts to 415 Teq, of which 295 Teq is carbon dioxide.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/14" class="italic"> &quot;Avoided&quot; e missions of GHG</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/15">Combustion of parliamentary estates waste in an energy recovery facility also results in avoided carbon dioxide emissions. The electricity produced by the facility displaces electricity that would otherwise be provided by an electricity utility power plant. Because most utility power plants burn fossil fuels and thus emit carbon dioxide, the electricity produced by waste combustion reduces utility carbon dioxide emissions. These avoided GHG emissions must be subtracted from the GHG emissions associated with combustion of the waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/16">The convention is to assume that the electricity displaced arises from so-called &quot;marginal&quot; power generators, which in the UK is assumed to be gas-fired power stations. As with direct GHG emissions, emission factors are used to estimate the tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents avoided when waste is combusted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/17">GHG emissions avoided following the combustion of residual waste from parliamentary estates amounts to 435 Teq, of which 405 Teq is carbon dioxide.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/18" class="italic"> GHG emissions from waste transportation</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/19">A saving in GHG emissions is realized when residual waste from the parliamentary estates is combusted, since the energy recovery facility is just 12 miles from the House. Previously the waste was being transported to landfill further away from the estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/20">The GHG emission factor developed by Defra for waste transportation varies between 0.37 and 0.49 kg carbon dioxide equivalents per tonne of waste transported, depending on distance travelled. For transportation of 1,299 tonnes of parliamentary estates waste, this amounts to a GHG emission of between 0.48-0.65 Teq. Since this is less than 1 per cent. of the emissions of direct or avoided emissions, the GHG saving in transporting the waste a shorter distance will be omitted when presenting net emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/21" class="italic"> Net GHG emissions</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/22">The carbon footprint associated with the combustion of waste from the parliamentary estates is obtained by subtracting avoided emissions from direct emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/23">This equates to a net GHG saving of 20 Teq. Therefore 20 Teq should be subtracted when determining the total carbon footprint of parliamentary estates.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232W.7/1">We welcome the German G8 Presidency's continued focus on HIV/AIDS including universal access to prevention, treatment and care, and essential medicines for AIDS treatment for all that need it. Development Ministers will include reducing the price of first and second line anti-retrovirals, and intellectual property issues, in their discussions. They will also consider related factors, such as research and development funding and propose a UN stock-take to review countries' universal access plans. A rapid review would strengthen efforts to deliver universal access and help realise our commitment to ensuring that &quot;costed, inclusive, sustainable, credible and evidence-based national HIV/AIDS plans are funded&quot; as agreed at the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS in June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.7/2">We are working to encourage G8 partners to support and subscribe to mechanisms to help reduce medicine prices, for example as the UK and France have done by joining the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNITAID), the drug purchase facility. One of the first actions of UNITAID, which started work in September 2006, was to negotiate lower prices for paediatric HIV/AIDS treatment expected to benefit 100,000 children. Through its long-term and predictable funding, UNITAID has an explicit aim to help lower drug prices. We are also working closely with the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) initiative to make paediatric AIDS treatments more widely available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1234W.5/1">I am extremely concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. About 1 million Zimbabweans are reliant on international food aid as the next harvest approaches. There has been confirmation of almost total crop failure in the southern part of the country. Many Zimbabweans face difficulty buying food because of the terrible economic situation resulting from the appalling policies of their Government. AIDS is also contributing to high mortality rates resulting in over 1.3 million orphans; approximately one in four children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234W.5/2">DFID has spent &pound;33 million in the last financial year to tackle food insecurity and HIV/AIDS. All of our funding in Zimbabwe goes through UN agencies and NGOs. DFID has provided &pound;3 million to support World Food Programmes. We have also provided &pound;30 million for a three year programme to help over a million vulnerable people in rural and urban areas through NGO initiatives. DFID is also providing &pound;5 million to the International Organisation for Migration to help internally displaced people.</p>

Due to historical differences in the treatment of Scottish rent rebate expenditure, it is not possible from local authority subsidy returns to identify all expenditure on temporary accommodation in Scotland. These figures may therefore slightly understate temporary accommodation expenditure. From an assessment of the England and Wales data, we estimate that this understatement would be of the order of &pound;1-2 million.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1242W.8/1">Income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance are non-contributory benefits. The full basis for entitlement is set out in regulations. The principal rule in relation to remunerative work is that, where the claimant works 16 hours or more a week or the claimant's partner works 24 hours or more a week the claimant does not satisfy the conditions of entitlement. For those cases where the couple is obliged to make a joint claim for JSA, the 16-hour rule applies to both partners because both are claimants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.8/2">In cases other than joint claim JSA cases, where the claimant's partner is working between 16 and 24 hours a week, it may be possible for the couple to claim both working tax credit and either income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. In such cases, there is an automatic entitlement to maximum working tax credit, but the claimant's entitlement to income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance will be reduced pound for pound by the working tax credit that is paid.</p>

	<p pid="b.1244W.3/2">While the 2004 figure shows a 12 per cent. gain in efficiency since 1995 (the first year of the EU-manufacturer emissions agreements), it is also clear that the 2008 target is unlikely to be met. Because of this, the Commission recently announced its intention to legislate on emissions: by mid-2008, it will propose legislation requiring manufacturers to reach an emissions level of 130g/km by 2012 (with other measures taking the overall target to the equivalent of 120g/km). While details around the target level are still being considered, we welcome in principle the Commission's intention to bring forward mandatory proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.2/2"><i> </i>This information is not available in detail for all lottery distributors. However, the information that we do have suggests that distributors channel a significant amount of their funding through the voluntary and community sector (VCS).</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.2/5">Sport England estimates that around 30 per cent. of its funding has gone to the VCS over the lifetime of the lottery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/6">Since 2004-05, the total annual Community Fund budget and approximately 40 per cent. of the New Opportunities Fund budget has been allocated to the voluntary and community sector. From 2006-07, the Big Lottery Fund made a new undertaking to allocate 60-70 per cent. of its total budget to the voluntary and community sector and will be reporting on its performance against this target in its annual report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250W.0/2">The voluntary and community sector also receives lottery funding from distributors for the other good causes, the arts, heritage and sport. At this stage it is not possible to estimate the effect on this funding of the recently revised Olympic budget. No decisions have been taken by Arts Council England or the Heritage Lottery Fund about possible adaptations to their lottery programmes. They intend to honour all existing commitments and they remain committed to supporting the voluntary and community sectors in their fields. Furthermore, a significant proportion of Sport England's investment is directed to the voluntary and community sector and I expect this to continue also. My Department will also be working closely with all distributors to ensure they are able to fully benefit from the many opportunities London 2012 will afford.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256W.2/1">Springvale was to be a joint project, between the University of Ulster (UU) and the Belfast Institute, for a main campus, a community outreach centre and an applied research centre on a split site on the Springfield road. &pound;9.2 million has been spent to date&mdash;&pound;0.9 million from Government, &pound;6 million from external sources and the remainder from the two institutions. The outreach centre has been built but, following the withdrawal of UU, the other two elements will not proceed. The Belfast Institute brought forward an alternative proposal for a workforce and economic development centre, to be located adjacent to the community outreach centre. This proposal received ministerial approval at April 2006 and, when delivered, will complete the regeneration of the south site.</p>

While these are sensitive and complicated issues that take time, we are fully committed to securing Mr. al-Rawi's release from Guantanamo Bay and his return to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1258W.0/1">East and west Africa is increasingly being used as a transit route for cocaine and heroin from Latin America and Asia to European and other western markets. We have supported counter narcotics capacity building projects with local law enforcement agencies in Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ghana, Gambia and Senegal to improve interdiction through the provision of training and equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1258W.0/2">While significant challenges remain, our assistance is starting to have some impact in the region. In 2006 the Kenyan authorities destroyed over one ton of cocaine from an earlier seizure. In Ghana, drugs interdiction training and equipment at Accra International airport (Operation Westbridge) has achieved some good success interdicting cocaine couriers, since the start of its operation in November 2006. As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March 2007</phrase>, 40 couriers destined for the UK or Europe had been interdicted with seizures of 130 kg of cocaine and 413 kg of cannabis, with an estimated UK street value of &pound;8.5 million. This progress proves the importance of supporting good law enforcement co-operation coupled with training on interdiction techniques.</p>

It is anticipated that the final reports will be published in May. Community justice makes a key contribution to the Government's Respect Action Plan, which was published in January 2006. It aims to strengthen the links between the courts, the criminal justice system and the local community so that local people's confidence in the work of the courts and the wider criminal justice system increases. As the Lord Chancellor said in his written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-27">27 November 2006</phrase>, the Government are now establishing 10 further community justice initiatives. The aim of this next phase of community justice work is to provide further learning and best practice so that in the long term the principles of community justice are applied in the courts and the criminal justice system throughout England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.12/1">Figures from November 2006 from the Home Office put the most recent re-offending rate for England and Wales at 57.6 per cent. This is measured for adult offenders over two years following the date of release from prison or sentence to a community order. Since it is less than two years since the launch of both Liverpool and Salford, these figures are not yet available.</p>

Figures for 2006 are not yet available. Figures for the Community Justice Centre in Liverpool, which opened in September 2005, show that in 2006, 20 per cent. of adult and 15 per cent. of youth offenders failed to attend court.

	<p pid="b.1268W.2/1">Domestic violence is a cross-Government priority and formalised through the formation of the Inter-Ministerial Group for Domestic Violence. The Group comprises of Ministers from nine Government Departments and the three devolved administrations. In light of the assessments and priority need, the group prepares an Annual Delivery Plan and reports against progress each year. The report for 2006-07 will be published shortly together with the Delivery Plan for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/2">Domestic Violence proceedings are a priority area for legal aid funding. The Legal Services Commission's (LSC's) Funding Code Criteria for domestic violence cases are wider than for most other family and non-family areas; they are not limited to any specific definition of domestic violence or abuse. When appearing in a family court, persons of limited means will be funded in all but the most exceptional of circumstances. As a separate measure to the wider programme of legal aid reform as set out in &quot;Legal Aid Reform: The Way Ahead&quot; the financial eligibility limits for legal aid for domestic violence victims will be raised and both income and capital limits will be able to waived, by the LSC, on a discretionary basis from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-09">9 April 2007</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.1272W.2/1">Figures for those participating in apprenticeships funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) can be derived from the Individualised Learner Record (ILR). The work-based learning (WBL) ILR was collated as an interim collection for the first time in 2001/02 and figures are presented from that time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.2/2">The programme-led pathway (PLP) is an initiative to enable more learners to enter an employed status apprenticeship programme. When they achieve their agreed goals, learners cease to be on a PLP and then become mainstream apprentices. Learners could start their pathway in WBL or FE (completing their non-employed learning). Once they attain employed status they will transfer to mainstream WBL.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.2/3">It is possible to calculate participation for programme-led apprenticeships from the ILR data, but because it is difficult to accurately identify learners in mainstream WBL who started on a pathway, progression onto mainstream apprenticeships cannot be accurately calculated. The concept of framework achievement is not appropriate for programme-led pathways because an apprenticeship can only be completed in full, in employment. As the programme-led phase is not employment, learners on this pathway can only ever finish part of the framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.2/4">Non-completion is not a standard measure for apprenticeships. (A learner could complete all of their learning but not gain achievement.) One measure of performance is the success rate, which is calculated as the number of leavers who either meet all of the requirements of their apprenticeship framework, or achieve an NVQ required by the framework, divided by the number of learners who have either left training or successfully completed their programme.</p>

E2E funding is based on a single national weekly rate per place, with additional payments for achievement of qualifications and for progression into employment, learning or training. Because E2E programmes are developed to meet individual needs there are different lengths of stay and different achievements and progression. Based on the current average length of stay in learning of 19 weeks, and progression and achievement rates around 50 per cent., the average level of funding for E2E learners in Gloucestershire is &pound;2,875. Length of stay and achievement/progression rates in Gloucestershire are broadly in line with national figures, and as the funding rates are the same, the level of funding will also be broadly the same.</p>

We have also developed a two year training programme to increase the quality and consistency of language teaching at key stage 3, and have commissioned a two year research project into the provision and practice of language learning at key stage 3.

	<p pid="b.1290W.5/24">Exclusions data are collected retrospectively. Information on exclusions during the 2005/06 school year is expected to be published in June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.5/25">Exclusions in academies are high relative to national averages. However, academies are placing great emphasis on getting the basics right and improving behaviour in particular. Academies often inherit a large number of disruptive pupils and need to establish good behaviour in order to raise attainment. As the new ethos and behaviour policy are enforced in an academy's early days, the number of exclusions may rise, but it typically drops down as behaviour improves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.5/26">This phenomenon is not unique to academies&mdash;the same effect is often observed when a new head teacher transforms a struggling maintained school.</p>

Random allocation, use of catchment areas, or banding are all acceptable means of determining which children should be given priority for admission to oversubscribed schools.

Prior to the introduction of the DSG, funding for nursery, primary and secondary school aged pupils was through the Education Funding System (EFS) which was part of the local government finance settlement. EFS was based on what an authority needed to fund education whereas DSG is largely based on an authority's previous spending. EFS also included funding for an authority's central functions, this is still part of DCLG's local government finance settlement rather than DSG. For these reasons EFS and DSG are not comparable.<br/> 3. The DSG does not represent the totality of education funding; there are other grants that support the schools budget which have not been included in the table.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=9405</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1296W.2/4">Two technical changes to the school funding system for 2006-07 contributed to the total of 90 authorities who breached the central expenditure limit: local authorities were allowed to retain centrally funding which had in 2005-06 been distributed through teachers' pay grant; and school specific contingency within the individual schools budget (ISB) was abolished, leading to an increase in the amount of contingency held within the central budget for some local authorities. We thought it appropriate that local schools forums should approve these arrangements where they led to a breach of the central expenditure limit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> I was able to announce in the House our new policy on sprinklers. It is now our expectation that all new schools will have fire sprinklers installed. However, we do not intend to make this a compulsory measure as sufficient regulations are already in place covering life safety and we do not need to legislate further for property protection. There may be cases where local authorities or other promoters of schools consider that sprinklers are not needed. They will need to be able to demonstrate that such schools are low risk and that sprinklers would not represent good value for money. To do this they should use our new risk assessment and cost benefit analysis tools that I launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-26">26 February</phrase> at a parliamentary seminar.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.0/2">Where a school is undergoing extensive renovation, local authorities and other promoters should use the same tools to determine levels of risk and value for money, and therefore whether sprinklers are needed or should be considered. We are not suggesting that existing school buildings that are not undergoing refurbishment should have sprinklers installed. However, the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, implemented in October 2006, requires all schools to carry our annual fire risk assessments. Where risks are identified, measures must be taken to reduce or remove them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299W.2/1">The Department has not commissioned or supported research into the impact on governing bodies of a school that is placed in special measures.

	<p pid="b.1299W.2/2">This will inevitably involve a good deal of hard work, but a well organised governing body can spread its workload by setting up committees to consider various matters on, for example, curriculum, finance and management issues.

	<p pid="b.1299W.2/3">Where the Ofsted inspection finds that the governors are not discharging their responsibilities adequately and this failure contributes to the finding that the school requires special measures then the local authority should include in its statement of action how it will address governance issues at the school.</p>

Students generally ought not to need to work to meet their essential living costs. Nonetheless we recognise that many students undertake paid work and, providing excessive hours are not worked to the detriment of their academic studies, students can gain useful skills as well as supplementing their income.</p>

They do not show the number of NQTs living in Leeds who are not in full-time teaching posts. Also those who are in full-time teaching posts may not necessarily be teaching in Leeds. Not all qualifying teachers will seek employment in teaching immediately; some may travel, take further study or pursue other interests before doing so.  5.

	<p pid="b.1306W.2/2">For example, Ellis et al. (1996) conducted a research review to determine the principles of effective teaching. Ten principles were developed from the evidence base, of which one was teaching that highlights the similarities between topics and curriculum subjects. Askew et al. (1997) found that highly effective teachers of numeracy were those who, among other things, made connections between different areas of maths and different ideas in the same area of maths. Hall and Harding (2003) found that effective literacy teachers balanced direct teaching of basic literacy skills with wider, more contextually-grounded literacy activities, often linked with other curriculum areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306W.5/2">Truancy is generally considered to be unjustified absence from school, usually without parental knowledge or consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.5/3">The Department does not set targets for reducing truancy because we are concerned about all forms of problem absence, including parentally condoned or encouraged absence, and because there is no satisfactory direct measure of truancy. Unauthorised absence is often taken to be a proxy for truancy, but it is an imperfect measure because it also includes lateness, some term time holidays and absence which parents have not yet explained. It is also well known that unauthorised absence tends to rise when schools take a tougher line on absence generally, as it has done in recent years, without necessarily reflecting any underlying increase in truancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.5/4">That is why the Department has moved away from focusing narrowly on rates of unauthorised absence. We are now focusing our efforts on reducing persistent absence, including persistent truancy, in schools where this problem is most acute and where a small minority of pupils miss significant amounts of their schooling. This is proving highly effective. Last year, our targeted challenge and support in 198 secondary schools helped to reduce the number of pupils in those schools with high levels of unauthorised absence by 27 per cent. to reduce the average rate of absence in those schools by 0.63 percentage points and the average rate of unauthorised absence by 0.89 percentage points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.5/5">Building on that success, we are now focusing on providing challenge and support to 436 secondary schools with high levels of persistent absence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315W.8/1">UK Ministers and officials have had ongoing discussions with the European Commission and others, following the consultation launched by the Commission in 2006 on the Community Patent and other initiatives to improve the European patent system. The UK is committed to a business-friendly Community patent which imposes minimal burdens due to translations. A Community patent which is too burdensome will not be used by industry and, in a Europe with more than 20 official languages, full translation of Community patents will clearly impose high costs. We therefore hope that a reduced- or single-language solution can be found for the Community patent. However, language is understandably a highly sensitive issue, and a solution must be found which is acceptable to our European partners.</p>

The agreement will enter into force three months after ratification by the French Government. When the London Agreement enters into force it is estimated to almost halve the translation costs that must currently be paid to patent in Europe. A French parliament report in 2006 recommended ratification, and the agreement has been ruled compatible with the French constitution, but the French Government have not yet indicated their intention to ratify.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317W.5/1">The Chancellor keeps national tax matters under review through the Budget and pre-Budget report processes. However, some local authorities have implemented council tax discount schemes for local residents who invest in energy-saving installations. The Government's current assessment is that the Energy Efficiency Commitment, under which major energy suppliers have to reach targets for installing energy efficiency measures in their customers' homes, offers a flexible and cost-effective means of encouraging take-up of insulation and other improvements that reduce both energy bills and UK carbon emissions over time. It also allows targeting of vulnerable groups. The Government are committed to continuing an energy supplier obligation until at least 2020. As announced at the 2006 pre-Budget report, the Government are examining finance models that best support the Energy Efficiency Commitment and encourage take-up of energy efficiency measures and energy audits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1321W.2/1">There are seven millennium communities. Greenwich Millennium Village was the first to be announced in 1997. The others are at Allerton Bywater (near Leeds), New Islington (east Manchester), South Lynn (Kings Lynn), East Ketley (Telford), Oakgrove (Milton Keynes) and Hastings. In total the programme will bring forward over 9,000 eco-home 'Excellent' standard homes, plus other commercial and community facilities, providing inspiration to both the development industry and the general house-buying public and demonstrating how difficult sites can be brought back into use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321W.2/2">It is not possible to identify the costs linked only to the millennium communities themselves. To date, public expenditure related to the programme amounts to a total of &pound;131,565,732. This figure covers costs outside those that relate specifically to the seven millennium communities, because it is not possible to disaggregate costs retrospectively. It therefore includes elements of the remediation cost of the wider English Partnerships' 121 ha (300 acre) Greenwich peninsula site and not just the costs for the 13 ha (32 acre) section that is the Greenwich Millennium Village itself. The Greenwich Peninsula was previously the site of the largest gas works in Europe, and is one of the largest development sites in London and one of Europe's biggest regeneration projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321W.2/3">This expenditure by English Partnerships on the millennium communities will be offset by receipts as the land is sold through the usual competitive arrangements to the preferred developer on each site.</p>

The assessment team will give their first report to the PM before the summer, followed by regular six monthly reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1323W.2/3">Detailed guidance on the implementation of both new sets of protections will also be published in May, after the forthcoming elections. When the Commission for Equality and Human Rights opens its doors this October, it will offer further information, advice and support.</p>

	<p pid="b.1324W.3/1">Responsibility for fire service inspection was transferred to the Audit Commission following the publication of the Government's White Paper &quot;Our Fire and Rescue Service&quot; in June 2003 and the subsequent Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004. Since that time, Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate has not carried out any inspections of Fire and Rescue Authorities but has acted as an advisory body providing the Government, the Audit Commission and fire and rescue authorities with advice on professional fire service matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.3/2">The Audit Commission conducted a Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) of fire and rescue authorities and reported on their findings in July 2005. This assessment set a baseline for improvement in all fire and rescue authorities and the Audit Commission has subsequently developed a performance assessment framework for the service to measure improvement since CPA. This performance assessment framework consists of three elements&mdash;a direction of travel assessment, a use of resources assessment and a service assessment. The service assessment included an operational assessment, developed in conjunction with the Chief Fire Officers Association, and carried out by Fire and Rescue staff seconded into CLG for that purpose. Results of these assessments for 2006-07 are due to be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1329W.2/1">Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy is based on a notional measure of authorities' income (which is mainly rents) and expenditure. If need to spend is assumed to be greater than assumed income, then the authority is assumed to have a deficit and HRA subsidy is paid to the authority to make up that shortfall. If the assumed income is greater than the assumed need to spend, this negative subsidy is captured, recycled within the HRA subsidy system and used to help pay for the subsidy entitlement of the deficit authorities. Even with this recycling, in the most recent year for which audited data are available (2005-06), the Exchequer still made an annual contribution of over &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.2/2">Surpluses (and deficits) are not related to the efficiency of a council in operating its HRA. Surpluses rarely, if ever, occur where the need to spend is greatest; if those authorities that make surpluses retained them this would, within the total funding levels agreed, mean reduced subsidies and therefore higher rents, for all those authorities with a deficit. The alternative would be higher taxes or cuts in services. The surpluses that are being generated by some authorities also come from housing that has largely been funded by central Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.2/3">My Department is currently working with a group of local authorities to investigate the potential benefits, in terms of asset management, efficiency and better outcomes, of allowing some councils to leave the subsidy system. Self financing would involve a one-off settlement to replace future subsidy or surplus payments. As such, it would not be a means for surplus authorities to have a larger share of overall housing resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.1331W.0/2">The 2007-08 HRA Subsidy Determination calculates allowances that each local authority will receive and also makes assumptions on notional rental income. But to calculate the subsidy entitlement that a local authority will receive from, or pay out to, the Exchequer other authority-specific factors are required such as the average rate of interest on their borrowing. These specific factors are only applied when the local authority makes their claims for subsidy during 2007-08. We will not have a final audited subsidy figure for 2007-08 for each local authority until 2009. The most up-to-date audited actual subsidy entitlement figures we have are for 2005-06.</p>

Not everyone on the waiting list is necessarily in urgent housing need. The waiting list includes those who consider social housing as their preferred or one of a number of housing options, and those who decide to get onto the waiting list ladder before they need or want to move house&mdash;particularly where the priority system is heavily based on waiting time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1337W.5/1">Landbanking and option contracts were considered within Kate Barker's Review of Housing Supply, commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Deputy Prime Minister. Her interim report (December 2003) found little evidence, across the country as a whole, to substantiate concerns that these practices allow housebuilders to erect barriers to entry into the market; however, once land is acquired, competitive pressure and responsiveness in the industry are reduced and faster rates of production may be more socially beneficial.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337W.5/2">In December 2006 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced the Callcutt Review of Housebuilding Delivery. The Review will provide analysis of the acquisition, holding and disposal of land for housebuilding, the volumes of land held and the influence of land supply on levels of housebuilding production. This will include an assessment of the relationship between supply and demand for housing and any observed market failures and the means by which they may be addressed. We expect the Review to report in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1343W.14/1">Homeswap was the name given to a scheme for social housing tenants who transfer from one local authority or housing association property to another, across local authority boundaries, by advertising their existing property for an exchange with a similar tenant wishing to move in the opposite direction. We do not collect data on Homeswap specifically, but do routinely collect data on mutual exchanges which include those formally arranged through the Homeswap scheme as well as any other exchanges within the local authority. Information is available on number of dwellings rather than social housing tenants. Dwellings let through mutual exchanges within the local authority are shown for the last five years in <i> (a)</i> each English region and <i> (b)</i> each London local authority in the table.</p>

	<p pid="b.1357W.11/1">Information on how many regimental dinners took place in 2006 is not held centrally and could be provided only at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1357W.11/2">All Army messes are supported by contracts that include provision for a number of functions each year, for which attendees are charged the costs of food and drink. Some of these will be regimental dinners. If a regiment wants to hold additional functions, the drink and staff costs are met by private regimental funds and not the Defence budget. It is therefore not possible to provide the total cost of regimental dinners in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1361W.6/2">Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) is a potential way of screening for bowel cancer. A large clinical trial, funded by the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK, has looked into screening healthy people for bowel cancer using FS. The final results are not expected until 2008 but early results have been very promising and have shown that this type of screening will help to prevent bowel cancer and be cost effective. However, we do not know yet how many lives it could save. Based on these promising results, the Government are now funding a pilot study at St. Mark's hospital in London to examine the feasibility of FS screening performed by specialist nurses. The pilot is inviting 2000 men and women aged 58 and 59. The study is costing &pound;400,000, and is expected to report in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1363W.2/1">This information is not collected centrally in the form requested. However, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) conducted a United Kingdom wide survey of 'Care Homes For Their Care Homes For Older People in the UK' report, published in May 2005. The OFT found that the average care home in the UK had 32 places of which 29 were occupied. Of these, seven, around 24 per cent. were paid for by a combination of the local authority and a third-party top-up. The UK average third-party top-up was &pound;65.33p a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.2/2">The detail of contracting arrangements between local councils and care homes is a matter for local decision. The Government do not set or recommend rates at which councils contract with care homes. We think it is important that councils are able to tailor contracts to specific local circumstances. However, the Government have made available record levels of funding for social care. Since 1997, Government grants for local services, including social care, have increased by &pound;28.4 billion or 39 per cent. in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.2/3">This substantial funding is making a real difference. Although, in their annual 'Care of the Elderly: UK Market Survey 2006' report, independent market analysts Laing and Buisson reported that around half of local authorities increased the fees they pay to care homes by less than 3.5 per cent. This follows a three year period, 2002-03 to 2004-05 during which Laing and Buisson reported that payments increased at an unprecedented rate. This is clear evidence that local authorities have been using the additional resources provided by central Government to increase payments to care homes and rebalance the care home market.</p>

	<p pid="b.1366W.5/1">The Health Survey for England 2004 supplement, The Health of Minority Ethnic Groups, collected information from the seven largest minority ethnic groups in England including Black Caribbean, Black African, Indian, Pakistan, Bangladeshi, Chinese and Irish. The general population survey reported that cardiovascular disorder diagnosed by a doctor was most prevalent in Irish men and women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.5/2">The survey also looked at risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Significantly, it shows that Irish men were more obese and that their prevalence for smoking and drinking was higher than the general population. Irish women have higher blood pressure and both drink and smoke more than the general population. These are all risk factors for CVD which includes coronary heart disease (CHD).</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.5/3">The Department has an overarching target to improve mortality for CVD which incorporates a specific target for tackling health inequalities:</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.5/4" class="indent">To improve the health of the population by substantially reducing the mortality rates by 2010, (from the OHN baseline, 1995-97) from heart disease and stroke related diseases by at least 40 per cent. in people under 75, with at least a 40 per cent. reduction in the inequalities gap between the fifth of areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators and the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.5/5">Those areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators have been designated Spearhead primary care trusts. They are responsible for designing and delivering services to meet the needs of their local population, taking account of issues such as ethnic mix. Latest data show continued improvements in CVD mortality inequalities with a 27.9 per cent. reduction in the absolute CVD inequality gap. This has been achieved by promoting healthier lifestyles and with the increased distribution of preventative drugs such as statins.</p>

	<p pid="b.1367W.11/2">The definition of black minority ethnic (BME) in the DRE action plan is used to refer to all minority ethnic groups in England. It does not only refer to skin colour but to people of all groups who may experience discrimination and disadvantage, such as those of Irish origin, Mediterranean origin and East Europe migrants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1367W.11/3">Most of the Positive Steps guide is applicable to all these groups. The guide is intended to expand and develop over time. It currently includes information specific to two BME communities. Information on others, including the Irish, will be added shortly.</p>
