	<p pid="a.580W.9/1">The purchasing decisions of retailers are a commercial matter for them, and EU state aid guidelines on advertising specifically preclude publicly subsidised &quot;Buy British&quot; campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.9/2">However, we recognise the importance of providing consumers with information on a food's production and its provenance to enable them to make informed choices about the food they buy. That is why we have been encouraging retailers to comply with the Food Standard Agency's best practice guide on origin labelling, and recent evidence from the agency has shown that compliance has increased in recent years. More specifically, the Pig Meat Supply Chain Task Force which we established bringing together producers, processors, retailers, the food service industry, and a consumer representative has developed a voluntary industry code on the labelling of pork and pork products. This code, which was launched at the National Farmers Union conference last month, covers origin labelling, the use of breed names on labels and product definitions. Support from both the retail and food service sector has been strong.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.9/3">Retailers are putting in place policies aimed at sourcing more domestically-produced food and drink products. This in turn provides opportunities for UK farmers to capture a greater market share by becoming more competitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.9/4">We also appreciate the need to improve our food and drink producers' access to market in order to meet the growing demand for more food with a regional provenance. We have done this by providing funding for a range of measures including &quot;meet the buyer&quot; events with retailers and the encouragement of food hubs and shared distribution facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.581W.2/1">The European Commission and member states are currently compiling data to allow an assessment of progress against the targets in the EU Biodiversity Action Plan. We measure our progress towards the EU's 2010 target to halt biodiversity loss through the UK Biodiversity Indicators. Progress was reported in the National Statistics publication 'Biodiversity Indicators in Your Pocket 2007', which was updated most recently in April 2009. Statistics for wild birds were updated in October 2009 and those for Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are updated monthly.</p>

In particular, almost 91.2 per cent. of SSSIs are in favourable or recovering condition, agri-environment schemes are leading to significant improvements, and we have made great strides with the Marine and Coastal Access Act.</p>

This good position is due to a greater number of recruits entering training and passing out into the Field Army, coupled with an improvement in retention.

This involves a survey of 1,600 carers who receive the allowance, followed by in-depth interviews and focus group meetings with 90 individuals, selected as representative of the overall carer's allowance population, as well as discussions with professionals working with these customers.

The key specifications are that the jobs should be of a minimum of 25 hours per week; that they should be paid at least at the National Minimum Wage; provide enhanced training and support to the employee, as well as cover other costs incurred in the delivery of the Future Jobs Fund.

	<p pid="a.606W.3/1">We keep the transition of claimants from benefits to employment under regular review and have put in place a number of schemes that give people extra financial support on returning to work. For example, we introduced the job grant to specifically help customers who move into work manage until they receive their wages. It provides eligible customers a non-taxable payment of &#163;100 for single people and couples without children, and &#163;250 for lone parents and couples with children. In addition, housing costs are paid for four weeks after returning to work to customers who have been on income support or jobseeker's allowance for 26 weeks or more. As benefits are generally paid two weeks in arrears, this goes some way to filling any gap before payment of first wages.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/2">For all customers leaving jobseeker's allowance for work, Jobcentre Plus staff can help them make claims to working tax credit using a special fast track procedure, which means that in many cases tax credit is paid in advance of first wages. As a last resort, in cases of very urgent financial need, customers can apply for interest-free crisis loans from the social fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.0/2">The Department for Transport's proposals for policies to improve road safety for all road users, including cyclists, were set out in our consultation paper &quot;A Safer Way: Consultation on Making Britain's Roads the Safest in the World&quot;, which was published in April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/3">The Government want to see more people cycling, while at the same time minimising the risks of cycling. There are a number of initiatives under way at present, aimed at improving cycle safety. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/4" class="indent">promoting bikeability cycle training for children;</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/5" class="indent">using the Highway Code and the Think! road safety campaign to provide advice to child and adult cyclists on safe road use, including use of protective equipment such as high visibility clothing and cycle helmets;</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/6" class="indent">providing more safe cycle routes to schools and other locations;</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/7" class="indent">providing guidance to local authorities on the design of safer road infrastructure, including effective cycle-specific measures, as well as more general measures that benefit all road users, such as 20 mph zones;</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/8" class="indent">improving motor vehicle driver testing and training;</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/9" class="indent">enacting new measures on lorry mirrors to improve the visibility of cyclists and pedestrians.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/10">There are no plans to arrange a press conference in respect of the report commissioned by this Department on the potential for cycle helmets to prevent injury. The Department publishes numerous reports throughout the year and it is not usual practice to facilitate a press conference for each report's publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/11">The total cost of the research programme on Road Safety and Cycling is &#163;527,719 excluding VAT. The report on cycle helmets was published by TRL on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December 2009</phrase> alongside a report providing an understanding of the key causes of collisions involving cyclists. Research findings for both reports are available to download from the Department for Transport website and direct links to the full reports, which are free to download from TRL's website, are provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/12">Pre-publication copies of the reports were sent to the road safety and cycling research project's advisory group a week before publication. This group is made up of a wide range of road safety, health, and cycling interest groups. An e-mail link was sent to the advisory group and a wider group of stakeholders on the day of publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/13">TRL's research confirms conclusions from earlier work showing that cycle helmets can help to protect cyclists in the event of a collision. That is why the Department for Transport encourages cyclists-especially children-to wear helmets when cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/14">However, the Department has no plans to introduce legislation to make cycle helmets compulsory for children or for adults. Taking into account the practicalities of enforcing such an offence-particularly among children-as well as the possible impact on levels of cycling and the potential loss of wider health benefits, the Department is not persuaded that making helmets mandatory is the right option.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/15">TRL's research project estimated that between 10 and 16 per cent. of cyclist fatalities with a certain type of head injury could have been prevented if they had worn an appropriate cycle helmet. This estimate is based on an assessment of cyclist fatality reports and includes both adults and children. It is not possible to use this to estimate specific casualty savings for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/16">The Department for Transport's statistics show that a total of 12 cyclists aged 15 or under were killed in road accidents in Great Britain in 2008. The statistics do not show how many of these were due to head injuries, or how many were, or were not, wearing cycle helmets.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/17">TRL's research also found that of the on-road serious cyclist casualties admitted to hospital in England, 10 per cent. suffered injuries of a type and to a part of the head that a cycle helmet may have mitigated or prevented. 405 child cyclists aged 0 to 15 were recorded as seriously injured in road accidents in Great Britain in 2008, although this definition of serious injury includes a much wider range of injuries that were not sufficiently serious to lead to admission to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/18">The report also found that a further 20 per cent. of cyclists admitted to hospital suffered 'open wounds to the head', some of which are likely to have been to a part of the head that a cycle helmet may have mitigated or prevented.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.9/1">The Transport Act 2000, as amended by the Local Transport Act 2008, has provided a new policy framework benefiting all local transport authorities. The framework gives greater certainty of funding, while encouraging more strategic transport planning with local consultation, and increasing local flexibility and discretion over resources. It was accompanied by a significant increase in capital funding: support from my Department for transport investment in the City of Manchester, within which transport authority the Gorton constituency falls, has more than doubled over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.9/2">Investment in Greater Manchester's Joint Local Transport Plan, to which Manchester city council is a partner authority, has delivered a number of improvements to the quality, safety and accessibility of the local transport network. Between 2004 and 2008, bus patronage per head of population increased by 7 per cent. and the number of people killed or seriously injured on the local highway network decreased by 28 per cent. in the period 2001-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.9/3">In May 2004, Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority (ITA) launched the Local Link flexible transport service in Gorton, Beswick and Openshaw, following a successful bid for &#163;788,400 to the Department's Urban Bus Challenge fund. Local Link is a fully accessible demand-responsive bus service which provides access to health, education, retail and leisure facilities throughout the area seven days a week. In August 2004, an additional vehicle was allocated to the service due to exceptionally high demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.9/4">It was announced in July 2006 that the Department had approved Greater Manchester ITA's major scheme business case for the &#163;575 million Manchester Metrolink Phase 3a expansion. The project will expand the existing Metrolink network to Droylsden, Rochdale and Chorlton. The 3.9 mile extension to Droylsden will provide high quality public transport links between areas of deprivation in East Manchester and the major employment and leisure sites at Manchester Piccadilly and the City of Manchester Stadium. It is anticipated that construction of the Droylsden extension will be completed in spring 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.9/5">In 2009, the Greater Manchester ITA submitted a successful bid to the Department's Green Bus Fund. The &#163;3.1 million award will support the purchase of 66 low carbon vehicles, including a fleet of 20 diesel-electric hybrid buses to operate Metroshuttle services in Manchester City Centre, 16 hybrid Yellow School Buses, and 30 hybrid single deck vehicles for use on subsidised services in the city.</p>

	<p pid="a.620W.5/1">The Transport Act 2000, as amended by the Local Transport Act 2008, has provided a new policy framework benefiting all local transport authorities. The framework gives greater certainty of funding, while encouraging more strategic transport planning with local consultation, and increasing local flexibility and discretion over resources. It was accompanied by a significant increase in capital funding: support from my Department for transport investment in Gloucestershire, within which transport authority Stroud falls, has risen threefold over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.620W.5/2">Investment in the Gloucestershire Local Transport Plan has delivered a number of improvements to the quality, safety and accessibility of the local transport network. Between 2004 and 2008, bus patronage per head of population increased by 24 per cent., and the number of people killed or seriously injured on the local highway network decreased by 36 per cent. in the period 2001-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.620W.5/3">In 2002, Gloucestershire county council received a total of &#163;631,500 from the Department's Rural Bus Challenge fund to establish the Village Link rural bus service. Village Link is a demand-responsive bus service for the elderly, and those with disabilities or mobility problems, who have difficulty accessing employment, education, health care and leisure services due to a lack of transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.620W.5/4">The Stroud Valleys Car Club was launched in June 2003 with grant funding from the Countryside Agency, Gloucestershire county council and Stroud district council. The Car Club is designed to reduce unnecessary car use by giving members flexible access to cars without the costs of car ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.620W.5/5">In April 2009, the Cotswold Lorry Management Zone Trial came into force. The scheme, developed by Gloucestershire county council, sets clear routes for lorries to use through the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and includes a 7.5 tonne weight restriction on all routes throughout the zone other than the two designated 'through-routes' (the A417 and A419). The scheme aims to achieve a 30 per cent. reduction in heavy goods vehicle flows on the B4008 between the junction 12 of the M5 and the A419, and on the A46 at Painswick near Stroud.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.6/1">The Speaker, on behalf of the Commission, discussed the future of the Portcullis Plan with the Interim Chief Executive of IPSA, Andrew McDonald, at their meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-16">16 February</phrase>. The Commission has agreed that the House Service will continue to administer the Portcullis Pension Plan, including making it available to new members of Members' staff, subject to review when IPSA takes on some responsibility for Members' pensions. Members will fund the employer's contribution from their staffing budgets and the Chair of IPSA has said these will be set at a level which allows for appropriate pension contributions to be made. IPSA will make the necessary deductions from the staff payroll. IPSA has agreed to follow the House's current arrangements for the plan, under which a single standard employer contribution rate of 10 per cent. of total salary is paid; and staff are automatically enrolled in the plan unless they opt out. The House's Pensions Unit will liaise with IPSA officials to ensure co-ordination of their work. The Commission believes this agreement will provide reassurance to existing and new Members' staff, and to Members themselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.8/1">The Department's consideration of applications for foundation trust status is about reviewing an organisation's readiness for proceeding to the final stage of assessment. This final stage of applying to become a foundation trust is a detailed assessment undertaken by the independent regulator of foundation trusts in accordance with the relevant legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.8/2">When the Department considered the application from Mid Staffordshire General Hospitals NHS Trust (now Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust) for foundation trust status, assurance was gained on the quality of care being provided via analysis of the trusts performance against key national standards. This included assessment against accident and emergency and hospital waiting time standards as well as the consideration of methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i> Clostridium difficile</i> rates at the organisation. The Department's review did not include an explicit review of hospital standardised mortality rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.8/3">The Department's assessment processes have since evolved and now include an explicit consideration of hospital standardised mortality rates, alongside other care quality indicators such as patient surveys and safety indicators. Since April 2009 the Department's assessment has also included the consideration of each application by the NHS Medical Director, whose support is required prior to an application being able to proceed to Monitor for assessment to foundation trust status. The NHS Medical Director considers a range of quality related intelligence, including hospital standardised mortality rates, in forming their view on each trust.</p>

	<p pid="a.650W.2/1">The Electoral Registration Data Standards Direction of April 2008 was made by the Secretary of State pursuant to the provisions of section 52(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 on the recommendation of the Electoral Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.2/2">The Direction requires all electoral registration officers to ensure that all data stored by them in electronic systems complies with a set of minimum standards from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase>. In order to comply with the standards, Electoral Registration Officers must ensure address data is formatted according to the requirement of British Standard BS7666:2006 and must match the detail of electors' addresses with the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG) in England and Wales, or in Scotland, the Corporate Address Gazetteers (CAG). The Government have made funding available to Electoral Registration Officers to enable them to meet the costs of compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.2/3">The Electoral Registration Data Standards can enable local authorities to make efficiency savings through the creation of a single source of addressing information for all of the authority's services. That is because where local authorities take advantage of this the need for multiple entry of address data can be eliminated, reducing costs and inaccuracy. Information about address changes gathered through electoral registration activity throughout the year also ensures that the addresses recorded in local authority systems and in the NLPG and CAG continue to be as accurate and up to date as possible. This can be of particular benefit where the NLPG or CAG are used by the emergency services.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.2/4">The maximum amount of funding made available to support implementation of the data standards nationally and locally is set out in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Local authorities in England and Wales and Valuation Joint Boards in Scotland are able to access the grant in aid through a claim process specified by the Secretary of State. Because this claim process will not be completed until <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>, the final amount paid out will not be known until after this date.</p>

	<p pid="a.661W.2/1">The amalgamation of the four probation providers into a single trust will yield savings of about &#163;1.5 million taken from non-delivery functions. This supports front-line delivery by allowing about 34 full-time equivalent probation officers' posts across Wales to be funded from these savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.661W.2/2">Under the planning assumptions for the trust, during 2010-11 improvements to the trust's workforce planning and case management may result in an overall reduction of up to 28 probation officer posts (POs) and up to two probation service officer posts (PSOs) across Wales. However, additional funding has been granted for offender service provision, which is currently under discussion between the Director of Offender Management in Wales and probation. Any new services agreed with probation would result in the retention of some posts to deliver the services. These discussions are being concluded as quickly as possible.</p>

The PSO does not provide guidance on particular disabilities as it is the intention that the individual needs of the offender are assessed and reasonable adjustments made to address the issues raised, rather than adopting a one size fits all policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.0/4">PSO 2800 requires prisons and YOIs to have a race equality communication strategy setting out how they will communicate and consult with staff, prisoners and visitors. Information on the management of equality in prisons and YOIs is collected quarterly through a questionnaire designed by the NOMS Race and Equalities Action Group. Every YOI reports having a race equality communication strategy. Data are not collected centrally on revision dates.</p>

A balanced approach to nutrition is being pursued in line with the Department of Health's guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.0/1">160 local planning authorities in England have at least one accredited Building for Life assessor as a result of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment's (CABE) Building for Life accredited assessor training programme. CLG's policies do not require local authorities to become accredited assessors. However, Planning Policy Statement 3 gives clear direction to local planning authorities to deliver well-designed housing and monitor and report on progress. Building for Life is a useful approach that enables local authorities to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.5/2">The Valuation Office Agency determined that Grimsby Fish Dock Enterprises should not form a separate assessment in 2002 on the back of information they were provided at the time. However the facts now show the fish market should be separately assessed for business rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.5/3">Where a change has been made to alter the rating lists this has been as a consequence of new information that alters the overall balance in terms of the decision on paramount occupation. The decision as to who is in paramount control, and therefore who should be rated, rests on the facts of each case.</p>

	<p pid="a.676W.2/2">Applying a rate of surcharge of 15 per cent. to individual's investment income above an exemption limit of &#163;19,800 would yield around &#163;3.7 billion in respect of the 2008-09 tax year, although most of this income would not be received until the following year.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/3">This estimate is based on the Survey of Personal Incomes 2006-07 projected forward in line with the 2009 pre-Budget report assumptions. The figure excludes any estimate of behavioural response which could be considerable given the extent of the change.</p>

	<p pid="a.677W.5/2">The conventions on uprating state pensions are concerned with maintaining their price value. Had we applied those rules this year, when inflation as measured by the September retail prices index was minus 1.4 per cent. pensioners would not have received a rise in their state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/3">We decided that the fairest and most effective way of getting help to the 11 million pensioners in the UK was to apply an above earnings increase of 2.5 per cent. to the basic state pension. Because of the statutory link between the additional state pension and public service pensions, any uprating of the additional state pension would impose a burden on taxpayers and also put pensioners with public service pensions at an unfair advantage over those with private sector pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/4">Leaving additional state pension at current rates this year has no bearing on an individual's decision on whether to contract-out of the state second pension because uprating applies only to additional state pension after a person is in receipt of their pension and does not affect the value of the additional state pension being accrued by people below state pension age. Information for individuals considering whether to contract out of the additional state pension into an occupational pension scheme or personal pension can be found in our leaflet entitled 'Contracted-out pensions' (PM7).</p>

This makes it unlawful for a person in the US or subject to the jurisdiction of the US to knowingly provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. It also requires any US financial institution that becomes aware that it has possession of or control over funds in which a designated foreign terrorist organisation or its agent has an interest, to retain possession of or control over the funds and report the funds to the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="a.702W.2/1">It is clear that initial teacher education programmes, schools and the quality of teaching and learning have all improved in recent years. However, we recognise that there is still more to do to ensure that every child experiences high quality teaching in every lesson, and that teachers are equipped to deal with the challenges posed by the 21st century schools system.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/2">Good CPD has a positive impact on teachers' practice and leads to improvements in pupil attainment and other outcomes and the Department is working with the Training and Development Agency (TDA) and other partners to take significant action to improve the quality and take up of CPD provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/3">In November 2009 TDA published a new professional development strategy (PDS) which includes plans to strengthen CPD leadership, impact evaluation and training for support staff, and is underpinned by three key priorities of embedding a learning culture within schools, increasing coherence and collaboration and improving quality and capacity. The PDS can be found on TDA's website:</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/cpd/pds_cwds.asp">www.tda.gov.uk/partners/cpd/pds_cwds.asp</a>x?keywords=professional+development+strategy</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/5">Teachers in the north-west and challenging schools are now eligible for enrolment for the new Masters in Teaching and Learning (MTL). The MTL builds on Initial Teacher Training (ITT) and induction and will have immediate relevance to teaching and learning in the classroom, focusing on developing and honing teachers' practice through inquiry and use of evidence. The MTL will also help schools to develop an increasingly collaborative culture of professional development.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/6">Additionally, the new Licence to Practise alongside a CPD entitlement will ensure that all teachers have access to the CPD they need to guarantee they continue to be effective in the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/7">Ofsted's 2006 report on CPD, 'The Logical Chain' found that the most effective CPD takes place in schools. With this in mind our White Paper 'Your Child, Your School, Our Future: Building a 21st century schools system' gave TDA and the National College a joint remit to provide advice on how a nationwide network of quality assured CPD can be delivered through school clusters, utilising existing provision such as Training Schools, Teaching Schools and Leadership Development Schools. Ministers have welcomed preliminary advice on how this can be achieved and further advice is expected in spring 2010.The ministerial advice can be found on TDA's website:</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/t/training_schools_ministerial_letter221209.pdf">http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/t/training_ schools_ministerial_letter221209.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/9">To help ensure that schools and teachers become more informed consumers in identifying effective and quality assured professional development TDA has now also rolled out a new national database with an associated code of practice. There are currently over 4,000 opportunities for professional development listed on this database:</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/10" class="indent"><a href="http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/cpd/cpdzone.asp">http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/cpd/cpdzone.asp</a>x? keywords=CPD+database</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/11">We are confident that our policies will ensure that schools and the school work force are equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st Century School and, thus, improve outcomes for children and young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.703W.10/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills routes funding through the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for the provision of Further Education (FE) and training for adult learners aged 19 and over.</p>
	<p pid="a.703W.10/2">For the 2009/10 academic year this included funding for all learners aged 19 and above with a learning difficulty or disability (LDD). For the 2010/11 academic year responsibility for funding learners with LDD aged between 19 and 25 with high level needs will pass to the Young People's Learning Agency and local authorities.

	<p pid="a.703W.10/3">Investing in FE and skills training for these learners remains a priority and we remain committed to maintaining future opportunities for them.

	<p pid="a.703W.10/4">The number of learners aged 19 and over learning in mainstream provision with a self declared LDD varies from year to year depending on demand, but has been around 200,000 each year from 2006/07 to 2008/09 academic year (the latest whole year for which data is available).</p>

	<p pid="a.704W.5/28" class="indent">The Insolvency Service is a public authority for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act. There are no requirements under the Act for a public authority to record or catalogue requests that are received, irrespective of whether the request refers to the Act or must be dealt with under the provisions of the Act. From January 2009 Cabinet Office instructions were incorporated within The Service's Security Policy Framework Document to fulfil HMG requirements for the central recording and reporting of Freedom of Information requests.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.5/29" class="indent">Any logging or recording of requests for information prior to January 2009 was done for administrative purposes, to meet the stated policy of the public authority and any existing requirements imposed by Central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.5/30" class="indent">The Insolvency Service has not centrally logged all requests received across The Service for the period from January 2005 to December 2008 and individual Directorates within The Service were responsible for responding to the requests they received. Consequently the figure provided below may well be a slight understatement of actual requests received and dealt with by The Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.5/31" class="indent">In the period March 2005 to February 2010 The Insolvency Service has recorded a total of 1,238 requests.</p>

	<p pid="a.710W.6/1">There have been two meetings of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills' (BIS) anti-Semitism and higher education group, in April 2009 chaired by me and in November 2009 chaired by my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Postal Affairs and Employment Relations and by Martin Williams, the Director for Higher Education in BIS. At each meeting a ministerial private secretary was present and also a policy official (higher executive officer). A further meeting is due to be arranged for spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.6/2">The first meeting discussed anti-Semitic incident monitoring in higher education (HE), and how this was reported by students. The second meeting included updates from members of the group on their wider work on equality and diversity, including tackling anti-Semitism, and on the recent guidance for students, &quot;A Student's Guide to Antisemtism on Campus&quot;, produced by the Union of Jewish Students and the Community Security Trust. Both meetings resulted in agreement to a number of practical actions which are being taken forward by HE stakeholders and the Jewish community.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.6/3">We are committed to encouraging higher education institutions to ensure discrimination has no place in any of their policies or practices and to act swiftly when incidents or complaints are brought to their attention. One of the most important ways of tackling any form of racism in our universities is to ensure there is a dialogue between the universities, students and minority communities and this Department has been instrumental in fostering communication between the Jewish community and higher education. An important part of this work has been the establishment of the BIS anti-Semitism and higher education group, which brings together student representatives, representatives of the Jewish community and key HE sector bodies.</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.11/1">For universities, the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) agrees and reviews the standard requirements of the Student Record, to be completed on enrolment. HESA is a private company, established in 1993 to meet requirements for uniform and reliable statistics across the Higher Education system in the United Kingdom. Although not all fields need to be completed for every enrolment, the current set of fields comprising the Student Record can be accessed here:</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.11/3">For Further Education colleges, the Information Authority agrees and reviews the content of the Individualised Learner Record (ILR), to be completed on enrolment and used to allow the college to draw down the appropriate level of funding to support each learner. The Information Authority was established as an independent body in 2006, to set and regulate data and data collection standards for Further Education, and to reduce the data burden on Further Education colleges and training organisations in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.11/4">Further Education provision is diverse, and the range of data collected varies accordingly. The ILR contains up to 45 data fields for each learner and up to 56 for each learning aim. The fields which will be filled in will vary, however, depending on the learner and the learning being undertaken. Under a reciprocal arrangement with the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and HESA, further fields are collected for the small proportion of learners studying higher education provision and/or funded by HEFCE. Further information on the ILR can be found here:</p>
