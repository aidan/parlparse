	<p pid=".633W.3/1">The Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General have the power (under sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1998) to refer a sentence for certain categories of offences to the Court of Appeal for review, if it appears to be not merely lenient but unduly so.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/2">The law requires a reference to be lodged with the Court of Appeal within 28 days of the date of sentence. This period cannot be extended.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/3">During the last year (from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>) the Crown Prosecution Service sent 191 cases to the Law Officers for a review of the sentence as an unduly lenient sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/4">In addition the Law Officers received similar applications in 17 cases from members of the public, and a further five cases from Members of Parliament. The Law Officers have also received three ULS referral cases from HM Customs and Excise.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/5">In all, during the relevant period, the Law Officers have received applications for a referral in 216 cases.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/6">Two (out of the 17) cases referred by members of the public were received beyond the 28-day time limit for referral and therefore could not be considered for a reference to the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/7">Of the 216 cases sent to the Law Officers, 110 were referred by the Law Officers to the Court of Appeal for a review of the sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/8">According to our records, of these, to date, the Court of Appeal has heard 49 cases. Of the 49 cases heard, the results known to date indicate that the Court of Appeal granted leave in 45 cases and found the sentence to be unduly lenient in 44 cases. Despite concluding that a sentence is unduly lenient, the Court of Appeal can, in the circumstances of a particular case, apply its discretion and decide not to increase the sentence. In eight of the cases the Court of Appeal, applying its discretion decided not to increase the sentence. However it increased the sentence in 36 cases.</p>

To have their course included on the database providers simply apply via the learndirect website. There is no charge for this service. Inclusion on the database does not imply endorsement, quality assurance or accreditation of providers or their provision and there are no plans to change this approach.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.2/3">ILA providers were encouraged to list their courses on the learning opportunities website to ensure that Individual Learning Account holders could get information and advice about the learning that was available through learndirect. However, this did not constitute an ILA accreditation process. Full integration of the ILA and learndirect databases was not pursued because of the technical difficulties surrounding data incompatibility.</p>

Schools can hold this grant in their own suitable bank accounts, on request.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.0/3">The Chancellor also included school standards grant in his examples of what typical schools will receive in 2002&ndash;03. This recurrent funding is again passported to schools through local education authorities, which must pass on 100 per cent. of the grant. Schools can use this grant for their priorities to improve educational attainment.</p>

We take very seriously the need to raise the status and morale of the teaching profession. The assessment of further education staff morale is a matter for further education colleges, as independent employers, to address in consultation with the relevant unions, just as the terms and conditions for staff are a matter for colleges to determine in discussion with relevant unions. We acknowledge that colleges need help to ensure that they have the right arrangements to recruit, reward and retain excellent teachers. Over the period 2001&ndash;04, significant extra resources amounting to an additional &pound;311 million have been made available to the further education sector to reward high calibre staff through our Teaching Pay Initiative.</p>

The main pay scale now has nine points from &pound;16,599 to &pound;25,713. This will reduce to six points from &pound;17,595 to &pound;25,713 with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September</phrase>. The upper pay scale for post-threshold teachers has five points from &pound;27,861 to &pound;32,217. The pay spine for advanced skills teachers runs from &pound;28,917 to &pound;46,131. The pay spine for the leadership group runs from &pound;30,531 to &pound;85,671. Further education sector colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. Colleges are free to establish pay scales that meet their needs and can be agreed with their staff. We continue to encourage employers and unions to work together to ensure that further education staff receive reasonable pay given the substantial extra funding that has been made available for the further education sector.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/2">The figures for school and college funding have not been calculated on the same basis and cannot therefore be used to make comparisons. The further education unit funding figure includes total public funding allocated for further education, while the schools' figure does not. It is based only on delegated funds and excludes other funding the school receives centrally from LEAs which impacts on post-16 students. The latest estimate of the average delegated funding per sixth form student in schools per year in England for 2001&ndash;02 is &pound;3,330. The total funding per full-time equivalent student in further education sector colleges per year in England for 2001&ndash;02 is estimated to be &pound;3,660.</p>

	<p pid=".641W.8/1">Education and Skills policy is central to achieving the Government's objective of raising the UK's sustainable rate of productivity growth. The Department's objectives and targets have a crucial role to play in achieving this.</p>
	<p pid=".641W.8/2">The DTI UK Competitiveness Indicators Report suggests that economic performance has been held back by poor basic skills and a shortage of intermediate-level qualifications. Our targets to raise the proportion of 19-year-olds achieving level 2 and level 3 qualifications will help to address this.</p>
	<p pid=".641W.8/3">By 2010, it is forecast that 80 per cent. of new jobs will be in higher level occupations, which are the ones graduates are most likely to fill.

	<p pid=".641W.8/4">Isolating the effect of education and skills policy on productivity is not straightforward, but productivity is strongly linked to earnings. We are committed to reducing the number of adults who have poor literacy or numeracy skills by 750,000 by 2004. The returns to better numeracy skills are estimated to be between 6 per cent. and 10 per cent. of earnings, and the returns to better literacy skills up to 6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".641W.8/5">In addition, there are significant social returns to post-compulsory academic and vocational qualifications. For example, the social rates of return to A levels and first degrees are estimated to be in the range of 14&ndash;21 per cent. and 8&ndash;10 per cent. respectively.</p>

In addition, we are examining the early results of six pilots, testing the effect of new approaches to improving the basic skills of those on jobseeker's allowance, which ran from September 2001 to March 2002. These measures, together with the continued training of Jobcentre Plus staff, will ensure that the number of referrals from Jobcentre Plus to providers of basic learning skills will continue to increase and that by working effectively across Government, we can together achieve our target of 750,000 adults with better basic skills by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".647W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>, the Special Commission for Convening the Emergency Loya Jirga announced the criteria for the selection of delegates for the Loya Jirga, including the arrangements for selection of candidates by regional ballot. These include a quota of seats reserved for women (100 out of the 1,051 seats being decided by regional ballot). A further 60 seats will be reserved for women out of the quotas reserved for members of the Interim Authority, refugees, members of civil society, internally displaced persons and professionals. This will give a total allocation of 160 out of 1,450 seats.</p>

	<p pid=".648W.0/1">It is not possible to provide figures for the cost of criminal damage to FCO buildings in each of the last four years for the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid=".648W.0/2" class="indent">(a) Repairs to buildings following such incidents are funded from many different sources among them local budgets, command budgets, estates budgets and occasionally from Estate Strategy Unit's (SSU) budget. They would be in most cases identified as routine maintenance charges, rather than specifically connected to an incident of criminal damage in the accounts.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.0/3" class="indent">(b) Many posts do not report minor incidents of criminal damage, but simply get on with the job of repair required, funding them from their local budget. Centrally held records within SSU are, therefore, only indicative of reported incidents, and do not accurately reflect the true picture.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.0/4" class="indent">(c) Records of damage caused by criminal activity to HQ buildings in the UK are kept, but logged only as an incident in the normal incident logs. To identify the cost involved, after the fact, would involve trawling through all the incident logs, then checking jobs logged to the Facilities Management Helpdesk during the same period and finally comparing any related jobs with invoices, presented by the relevant service provider, from the same period. This is a highly labour intensive process, far in excess of the cost where it becomes disproportionate to the answer.</p>

A further consultation document was issued by the Governor at a public meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-10">10 April</phrase>. This outlined two options: a county/district model of government, or an Advisory Island Council with provision for regular consultation with St. Helena representatives on areas of mutual interest. We hope that a decision on the form of democratic representation, based on the preferred choice of the residents of Ascension Island, will be taken shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.12/1">The Queen's Golden Jubilee Award (for voluntary service by groups in the community) is announced today. This new, annual award is for groups and teams in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, rather than for individuals. The award will be given in recognition of outstanding voluntary activity that enhances and improves the quality of life and opportunity for others in the community. Groups must be nominated for consideration, for example by beneficiaries of their work, members of the public, representatives of public bodies, or other voluntary groups. Initial selection will be by local panels in the devolved Administrations and Government regions, with final selection being done centrally by the Queen's Golden Jubilee Award Committee. The award illustrates the importance the Queen places on community and voluntary service by dedicated and committed teams and groups, and provides an opportunity for communities to nominate and celebrate the invaluable contribution they make. Up to 200 awards will be given each year and the first ones will be announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-02">2 June 2003</phrase>. I have placed details in the Libraries of both Houses and will be writing to all hon. Members later this week enclosing further information.</p>

	<p pid=".662W.2/2">My Department has allocated support of &pound;29 million to solid biomass crops through the Energy Crops Scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme. Working with other Departments we are putting in place schemes with funding of &pound;70 million which will develop markets for biomass, including purpose grown energy crops and material from forests, in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. We are also working closely with the Countryside Agency which has launched the Community Renewables Initiative to help local communities develop renewable energy projects. The Renewables Obligation permits the co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels. In the Budget my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, confirmed the new duty rate for biodiesel set at 20 pence per litre below the rate for Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel. The Government are considering carefully the recommendation of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food that duty on biofuels should be reduced to the rates applied to other clean fuels. The Government have also welcomed the publication of the Energy Review by the Performance and Innovation Unit, which draws attention to the key role of renewable energy sources, including energy crops, in moving to a low carbon economy. The Government plan a public consultation on the key recommendations of the report leading to a White Paper in the autumn.</p>

However we are awaiting the results of independent research into the health and environmental implications of using IBA in construction (including roads and the manufacture of building blocks). Initial indications are that exposure to dioxins from roads constructed with material incorporating IBA is negligible.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.3/4">The Environment Agency is currently carrying out a full investigation into the destination of ash from incinerators, the environmental implications of its use and what steps may be needed in the light of these findings. The results of the investigation will be made public and any necessary action will be taken.</p>

S74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 placed a duty on Ministers and Government Departments to have regard to the purpose of conserving biological diversity in accordance with the Convention. 436 action plans have been published for individual priority species and habitat types. Each of the Action Plans contains goals and targets for the conservation, enhancement and sustainable management of these habitats and species within their eco-systems in the UK.

	<p pid=".665W.8/34">Information on air quality levels in Teesside and the rest of the country is also available at <a href="http://www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual">www.aeat.co.uk/ netcen/airqual</a>. This information is updated on an hourly basis. Figures for the year 2001 show that across the country as a whole the average number of days of moderate or poor air quality recorded by individual monitoring stations in urban areas of the UK was 21 days. This total has declined steadily over the last decade as measures to deliver cleaner air have started to take effect.</p>
	<p pid=".665W.8/35">There are four automatic air quality monitoring sites in Teesside affiliated to the national air quality monitoring network. These are at Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, Redcar and Middlesbrough. The average number of days of moderate or poor air quality recorded in 2001 at each of these four sites was 16 days. This figure is lower than the national average.</p>

The last boundary variation was made to Dedham Vale AONB on <phrase class="date" code="1991-09-19">19 September 1991</phrase>. Establishing AONBs, and varying their boundaries, is the responsibility of the Countryside Agency. They have no plans to create any new AONBs or to vary the boundaries of any of the existing ones, except in so far as a National Park in the South Downs might replace two AONBs.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.3/3">Boundary reviews are very time consuming and expensive: So the Countryside Agency believes it is better to focus resources on managing existing AONBs, and maximising the opportunities offered by the new Countryside and Rights of Way Act, rather than pursuing minor variations.

	<p pid=".670W.2/1">Tomorrow I will publish the first Marine Stewardship Report-Safeguarding Our Seas: A Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of our Marine Environment.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/2">The report sets out our vision for the marine environment&mdash;clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas. It is underpinned by the principles of sustainable development, integrated management, the conservation of biological diversity, robust science, the precautionary principle and stakeholder involvement.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/3">It outlines how we are adopting an ecosystem-based approach to marine management to better integrate marine protection objectives with sustainable social and economic goals. It covers the broad spectrum of policies that affect the marine environment. As well as describing past achievements and progress made, it contains new ideas and initiatives to turn our vision into reality.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/4">Our initiatives will improve marine conservation. We will undertake our proposed regional seas pilot scheme in the Irish Sea as the next stage of our review of Marine Nature Conservation. The report also commits us to consult later this year on the regulations to extend the Habitats and Birds Directives out to limit of jurisdiction of UK waters. It also contains a commitment to explore with other countries the case for, and feasibility of, marine protected areas on the high seas.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/5">The report announces our intention to review the regulations that affect development in coastal waters with a view to simplifying the regulatory system and protecting the marine environment. It also includes initiatives to explore the role of spatial planning for our seas at the regional level and provide a focal point to build on existing seabed mapping.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/6">In addition, Safeguarding Our Seas commits us to review current arrangements for marine scientific research to ensure that we have the proper science base to deliver our vision. It underlines our commitment to develop our framework for environmental monitoring and that we will produce an integrated assessment of our seas by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/7">The report emphasises the importance of involving stakeholders in making the decisions that affect them. It announces that we will hold a joint conference of the English, Scottish and Welsh coastal fora, together with stakeholders from Northern Ireland, on how to implement the EC Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/8">Some policy matters covered in the report are the responsibility of the devolved Administrations. The Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales were integral to the preparation of the report. The Northern Ireland Executive has monitored progress of the report and will consider the implications for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/9">The report is a valuable first step in turning our vision into reality. I will place copies of the report in the Library of the House. It will also be available at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".671W.2/2">The Government are committed to working in partnership with developing countries with large numbers of poor people to tackle poverty and promote sustainable development. It is essential that developing countries lead the process of reform and poverty reduction. My Department is seeking to focus the efforts of all international development agencies on supporting the development and implementation of nationally owned and led poverty reduction strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.2/3">My Department also continues to work internationally to promote a more favourable environment for sustainable poverty reduction in developing countries. At both the World Trade Organisation Conference in Doha and the UN Financing for Development Conference in Monterey, agreement was reached on the nature of the partnership between developed and developing countries. Developing countries have committed to actions on good governance and the creation of a domestic enabling environment. Developed countries have committed to support these efforts with action on aid volume, aid effectiveness, building capacity, investment and competition. We are contributing to preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August to help ensure better understanding of the links between poverty reduction and globalisation, and more effective management of environmental resources.</p>

The remainder of the fleet consists of vessels which are deemed to be 'non-trading'. Examples of non-trading vessels are dredgers and trawlers, but vessels which were constructed for 'trading' purposes can also come into this category, if they have been converted to a non-trading use, e.g. storage or a floating restaurant.</p>

	<p pid=".676W.5/4" class="indent">For OFTEC the annual fee is &pound;36 for an individual, and &pound;20 for a company, payable five years in advance. An individual must be employed by an OFTEC registered firm.</p>

It was also noted that this process would &quot;allow synergies to develop with the quality mark initiative . . .&quot;. We have started this process. In relation to the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme (FENSA), quality mark members are eligible for a discount on initial membership, and further discussions are currently taking place between the Department of Trade and Industry and FENSA over how the two schemes can work more closely together over the coming months.

Hydrogen looks likely to be a key component in the long-term shift to low-carbon transport. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget announced that the Government intended both to exempt hydrogen from fuel duty for a period to encourage its further development and early take-up, and also to provide enhanced capital allowances for installing hydrogen fuel infrastructure. Additionally, the Government is already providing financial support for the pilot trials of hydrogen fuel cell buses to be carried out next year by Transport for London, including the hydrogen refuelling station to support the initiative.</p>

The final wording was intended to be more concise than earlier versions but did not change national planning policy guidance as it applies to mineral development in the Peak district. Thus paragraphs 70 and 71 of Minerals Planning Guidance Note 6 advise that major developments should not take place in national parks, such as the Peak district, save in exceptional circumstances. All minerals applications must be subject to the most rigorous examination, and should be demonstrated to be in the public interest before being allowed to proceed. The factors to be taken into account in considering minerals applications in such areas include:</p>
	<p pid=".679W.0/3" class="indent">a) the need for the development in terms of national considerations of mineral supply; and the impact of permitting the development, or refusing it, on the local economy;</p>
	<p pid=".679W.0/4" class="indent">b) whether alternative supplies can be made available at reasonable cost; and the scope for meeting the need in some other way;</p>
	<p pid=".679W.0/5" class="indent">c) any detrimental effect of the proposals on the environment and landscape and the extent to which that should be moderated; and</p>
	<p pid=".679W.0/6" class="indent">d) in the case of extensions to existing quarries, the extent to which the proposal would achieve an enhancement to the local landscape.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.0/7">Minerals policies in the RPG for the east midlands should be read within that context.</p>

	<p pid=".680W.2/4" class="indent">I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the A43 between the M40 and the M1.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/5" class="indent">To help traffic during the British Grand Prix weekend on Saturday 6th and Sunday 7th July, at least two lanes of the new Silverstone Bypass between the A413 junction and Dadford Road (the main access to the Circuit) will be available for access by coaches and official race traffic to and from the north.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/6" class="indent">In addition, we aim to use existing A43 through Silverstone, to Towcester Bypass, as a one-way system as we did last year, making four lanes between the A413 junction and Dadford Road available to traffic to and from the north.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/7" class="indent">The new Whitfield Turn and Brackley Hatch section is not sufficiently advanced to be used so we intend to make the existing A43 at Syresham and Pimlico one-way to ensure two-lane access to and from the Circuit from the south on Saturday 6th and Sunday 7th July.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/8" class="indent">Traffic not intending to travel to the Grand Prix will be advised by signs, including the variable message signs on the motorway network, to use alternative routes. Traffic using the A43 between Brackley and Towcester, and not going to and from the Grand Prix, will be diverted.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/9" class="indent">The improved A43 between the M40 and B4031 Barley Mow Roundabout will be operating as a two-lane dual carriageway. Junction 10 on the M40 should still be operating in its present form.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/10" class="indent">Overall, there should be at least two lanes between M1 and M40 available for traffic going to and from the Grand Prix.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/11" class="indent">The existing lengths of dual carriageway between M1 (Junction 15A) and the Abthorpe Road roundabout at Towcester and from the Barley Mow roundabout, around Brackley Bypass to Whitfield Turn are unaffected and will operate in their normal way.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/12" class="indent">Ministers consider it important to support the Grand Prix as a showcase for an important UK industry whose success reflects positively on the UK. The Agency, the race organisers, the police and the contractor have successfully adopted a partnered approach to developing an accelerated programme to complete and use as much of the scheme as is required to allow a successful event.</p>

However, the Strategic Rail Authority has recently written to all train operating companies requiring them to review their disabled peoples protection policies (DPPPs). As part of the review, operators will be required to identify the work that needs to be done at their stations to meet the standards of the authority's Code of Practice &quot;Train and Station Services for Disabled Passengers&quot;. Following the review a programme of works to improve facilities for disabled passengers will be developed, part funded by the authority.</p>

This was a further meeting to discuss the handling of claims against Chester Street Insurance Ltd.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.4/2">This was a productive meeting. ITMS produced statistics showing the progress of claims since I chaired a previous meeting on Chester Street on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-06">6 March</phrase>. These figures showed that, at the end of February, 10.6 per cent. of settled claims against insolvent policyholders had been paid. By <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-19">19 April</phrase>, 40.7 per cent. of these claims had been paid.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.4/3">The meeting agreed that a service standard would be laid down covering claims against Chester Street where the original policyholder is insolvent. Under this service standard, acceptance documents will be sent to claimants' lawyers within 20 working days of a claim being agreed. Once claimants' lawyers return the acceptance documents, cheques will be released within five working days.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.4/4">Payments totalling over &pound;3 million have now been made by the Association of British Insurers and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, who are the two bodies responsible for organising payments of claims where the policyholder is insolvent.</p>

	<p pid=".684W.12/1">The Budget showed our continued determination to tackle child poverty. Around 450,000 families in Scotland will benefit from the introduction of the new working tax credit and the new child tax credit in 2003. The children's allowance in income support and job seeker's allowance will increase by &pound;3.50 a week from October 2002, benefiting around 113,000 workless families in Scotland. We have also announced improvements to the new deal for lone parents, which has already benefited almost 15,000 people in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid=".690W.12/1">Co-operation on this aspect of inter-agency work takes place in a number of ways. HM Magistrates Courts Service Inspectorate, jointly with the Inspectorates for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, are undertaking a joint thematic inspection of listing. Fieldwork has commenced and their report is expected in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".690W.12/2">Sir David O'Dowd is chairing the Reducing Bureaucracy Task Force that has been set up to identify and reduce bureaucratic burdens in the criminal justice system and in particular on police officers. This includes work on the role of the courts. Fieldwork through this task force has commenced and a final report is due in July. There is close co-operation between the Inspectorates and the work being done by the O'Dowd task force.</p>
	<p pid=".690W.12/3">In 2001, the national Trials Issues Group issued guidance to all criminal justice areas, pointing out the huge cost implications of calling officers to court on their rest days, or at the end of a late turn of duty, etc. The advice raised awareness of the cost and manpower implications of court listings and it is hoped that the good practice advice contained therein has led to further improvements. At a local level, there is on-going consideration in relation to the efficient use of all court users' time through local Trials Issues Group meetings and the Area Criminal Justice Strategy Committees.</p>
	<p pid=".690W.12/4">The Crown court are currently running the Xhibit pilot project in Chelmsford which is look to use IT better to inform parties to a case on how the case is progressing. This includes sending electronic messages from the courtroom to pagers and mobile phones and means that witnesses do not have to wait in the court building to give evidence but can be contacted as and when needed. Although not specifically targeted at police officers, it allows the officers to remain in their station (if it is relatively close to the court building) and carry on with other duties while they are waiting.</p>
	<p pid=".690W.12/5">In relation to &quot;cracked and ineffective&quot; trials in the Crown court, a study commenced in Manchester on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-16">16 April</phrase> in conjunction with other agencies and is looking at the best ways to avoid unnecessary attendance at court by the parties and their witnesses. In the magistrates courts, a new data collection exercise commenced in April 2002, which will consider the reasons for &quot;cracked and ineffective&quot; trials and this will also impact upon police officers' role in court.</p>

The Review has just been completed and will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".692W.2/45">It is not possible to determine how many of these are &quot;net additional staff&quot;. Many of these recruits will be to replace staff who have left the Department, through resignation, retirement, transfer etc., and only a small proportion will be to fill new vacancies. A more accurate measure would be to compare the numbers of staff from one year to another, as shown in the annually published Civil Service Statistics, but even that would include transfers from other Government Departments as well as new recruits.</p>

	<p pid=".693W.5/1">Child contact centres are run by the voluntary sector. Many contact centres are affiliated to and trained by other organisations, principally the National Association of Child Contact Centres (NACCC). The Lord Chancellor's Department is working with NACCC, and other key organisations in this field, to develop more consistent and safer referral processes which includes training of staff. The Department provide grant-in-aid funding during 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02 to assist these organisations in developing their respective models of contact which included training packages. The Government are also currently considering as a matter of priority the recent recommendations on contact centres made by the Children's Act Sub-Committee, of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Board on Family Law, in its report &quot;Making Contact Work&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-08">8 February 2002</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".698W.7/1">The United Kingdom ratified the United Nations convention on the rights of the child in 1991. The reservation in respect of article 22 in no way inhibits the discharge of our obligations under the convention. It is there to safeguard the right of the United Kingdom to determine its own immigration and nationality laws. We have carefully reviewed the reservation in the light of recent requests that it should be withdrawn. However, we are convinced that it remains necessary in the interests of maintaining an effective immigration control.</p>

	<p pid=".699W.2/2">The total cost of running the Home Office press office in 1996&ndash;97 was &pound;1,229,000. This does not include the cost of the then separate Prison Service Media Relations Unit, for which no detailed central records exist. The costs for the year 2001&ndash;02 were &pound;2,415,606 including a cost of &pound;358,399 for media relations for the Prison Service, now integrated into the Home Office press office.</p>
	<p pid=".699W.2/3">Staff numbers increased when a 'breaking news' press team was established in 2000. This was one of the recommendations from the independent external consultants who carried out a review of the structure and operation of the press office in 1999. One of the benefits has been that media calls to the press office, one of the busiest in Whitehall, are now being answered within four rings 90 per cent. of the time. Previously there were occasions when up to 40 per cent. of media calls were being 'lost'.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has not met police representatives to discuss the drug policy in Brixton, but he has been following the progress of the Lambeth cannabis pilot very closely. I have met officers in Brixton additionally, officials from the Home Department meet regularly with representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Metropolitan police to discuss this and other issues.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/3">The Home Secretary recognises that it is important to address policing cannabis issues such as those raised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, so as not only to bring consistency to policing practice on the streets but also to make the most effective use of police time.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/4">I understand that the Metropolitan police are continuing their evaluation of the policy being operated in Lambeth to assess more accurately its precise impact. I further understand that the Metropolitan police have no plans to extend the operational pilot to other areas in advance of a full evaluation of all the issues being available.</p>

	<p pid=".707W.0/1">Currently there is one induction centre in Dover. Generally speaking asylum seekers requiring accommodation will spend approximately one week in the induction centre before being dispersed. Other asylum seekers requesting either subsistence only support or who do not require support will spend between one and two days at the centre. We are proposing to open further induction centres over the coming months close to major ports such as Heathrow and Gatwick and a small number in the regions. There is no ceiling on the number who can be accommodated in an induction centre but typically there are between 200 and 500 in the centre at any one time.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/2">There are no accommodation centres at present but we intend to establish a number of these with a total capacity of 3,000 to accommodate a proportion of new asylum seekers from application through initial decision and any appeal. This will be taken forward on a trial basis. We have identified eight potential sites for accommodation centres. Six of these are in England, one in Scotland and one in Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/3">They are located as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".707W.0/12">The Government are committed to ensuring that the long-term mix of facilities for the support of asylum seekers and management of the asylum processes is based on evidence of what works. The operation of the trial accommodation centres will be thoroughly evaluated, taking account of a number of factors including costs, processing times, ease of access to integration programmes for those granted refugee status and the rate of returns in cases which are refused.</p>

Organisations in the voluntary sector receive funding under contract to the Department for delivering a range of our employment and training programmes, including for example elements of the New Deal. We also have key relationships with, and make grants to, the voluntary sector in: helping people with disabilities to live more independently in the community; providing mobility related assistance; and free help and advice to members of the public regarding their company, stakeholder or personal pension scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.6/1">We have no plans to introduce proposals requiring employers to contribute to a joint insurance policy to underwrite employees pension schemes. Compulsory mutual insurance to support the pension fund of an insolvent company was among the options considered when we consulted on the future of the minimum funding requirement in September 2000, but it received little support. Such an arrangement could lead to schemes neglecting their obligations knowing that their liabilities would still be met in the event of insolvency. Many employers sponsoring well-funded schemes would object to subsidising firms which neglected their obligations.</p>

	<p pid=".712W.2/2">Pension schemes are set up voluntarily by employers for the benefit of their workforce, and the financial commitment this involves means they have a legitimate interest in the running of the scheme. Where decisions made by trustees have a direct implication for the financial position of the employer, it is understandable and right that the employer wants to be part of that decision making process.</p>

It is a key part of the strategy in Patrick Carter's report to encourage small employers to use the services of intermediaries if they find that more helpful than personally handling the completion and submission of their returns. Employers who wish to complete and submit their own returns can use PAYE online forms which are accessible from the Inland Revenue's website using any Internet connected computer, including those available in libraries and Internet cafes.</p>

Secondly, where several other factors (e.g. alcohol, other blood-borne viruses) contributed to fatal chronic liver disease, the certifying doctor may judge that one of the other factors is more important. And finally, because deaths with an underlying cause of primary liver cancer are not included here, even if certified as being the result of hepatitis C infection. This is because international coding rules in use at the time (ICD-9) do not accept cancers being due to infections, except in the case of HIV/AIDS.</p>

	<p pid=".732W.8/1">As part of Skills for Life, our national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy skills, pathfinder areas were established in September 2001 to pilot a range of approaches including financial incentives for learners and fixed rate replacement costs for employers to release low skilled staff for training. In addition, the Employment Service, now Jobcentre Plus, has recently completed piloting alternative approaches to identify and meet the literacy, language and numeracy skills needs of jobseekers. These pilots included the use of financial incentives. Evaluations of all these approaches are currently underway.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.8/2">In addition to these pilots, Budget 2002 announced details of six new Employer Training Pilots which will test, among other things, how financial incentives can support employers and individuals to tackle the problem of poor basic skills and attainment of an initial level 2 qualification. It is intended that the pilots will become operational by September 2002. The pilots will provide information about how different measures might impact on UK skills, and will gather evidence, which will contribute to the Government's consideration of workforce development policy. Further details can be found in 'Developing Workforce Skills: Piloting a New Approach', which was published alongside the Budget and is available in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid=".736W.7/2">The Bill will enable those harmed by anti-competitive practices to follow a decision establishing a breach of competition law with a claim for damages before a specialist competition body&mdash;the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The tribunal offers the advantages of being a quicker and more streamlined route for consumers and businesses to obtain redress from companies that have broken the law. In addition, representative bodies will be able to bring claims for damages in front of the tribunal on behalf of groups of named consumers, thus helping consumers obtain redress where a large number of parties have each suffered a relatively small level of harm.</p>
	<p pid=".736W.7/3">The Government are also providing a faster and fairer route to an independent review of a decision under the Competition Act by allowing third parties to appeal direct to the Competition Appeal Tribunals instead of first having to ask the Director General or one of the sector regulators to withdraw or alter his decision.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.12/1">My noble Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation has today announced the outcome of the Second Stage of the Quinquennial Review of the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC).</p>
	<p pid=".737W.12/2">The first stage of the review recommended that the second stage of the review should focus on the issues associated with the implementation of a strategic ownership model, to encourage collective ownership by the user research councils of CCLRC's large facilities, addressing in particular the implications for the status of CCLRC and its accountability to Ministers and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.12/3">The second stage of the review has been led by the chief executive of the CCLRC, Professor John Wood and conducted under the guidance an external review board chaired by Sir Peter Williams, and the Office of Science and Technology. The review has been conducted in accordance with the latest Cabinet Office guidance and Cabinet Office and Treasury officials have had an opportunity to comment on the draft report and its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.12/4">The principal recommendation is that for its core business the CCLRC should remain a non-departmental public body (NDPB) and a research council. In addition, CCLRC should be given a strategic role, as identified in stage one, to act as a national focus for large facilities for neutron scattering, synchrotron radiation and high power lasers on behalf of the research councils UK. Further, it should also co-ordinate the development for research councils UK of policies and strategies for the provision of access by UK scientists to leading edge large-scale facilities in these scientific areas, both nationally and internationally. The co-ordination and provision of strategic advice would be carried out separately from the day-to-day operation of CCLRC owned facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.12/5">There should be a common scheme for access to the large facilities for researchers sponsored by all the research councils. For those proposals that successfully undergo competitive peer review, there will be a &quot;free at the point of access&quot; arrangement.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.12/6">CCLRC's funding arrangements should alter so that CCLRC receives direct funding from the Office of Science and Technology for providing, operating, maintaining, developing and upgrading its large facilities and their instrumentation. This would be on the basis that, a rolling medium term plan for the operational requirements of the large facilities be prepared by CCLRC and endorsed by research councils UK. This arrangement would ensure that the chief executive of CCLRC as accounting officer is clearly and visibly accountable for the value for money of all aspects of the delivery of science from these large facilities. In addition, there will be an external review of CCLRC's cost base and financial processes in advance of the changes to the funding arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.12/7">I warmly welcome these recommendations and offer my thanks to Professor Wood and the review board.</p>

	<p pid=".740W.0/1">Implementing the age strand of the Employment Framework Directive (2000&ndash;78) is a significant undertaking and we need to allow time to get it right. Unlike sexual orientation and religion, differences of treatment on the grounds of age are capable of objective justification under the Directive in certain circumstances.

	<p pid=".742W.3/1">Bidders in the competition for a strategic sealift service were invited to tender on the basis of a crewing option that they considered would offer best value for money and to provide details that would facilitate an assessment of sponsored reserve crewing of all six ships. AWSR initially expected to be using sponsored reserve crews on the six ships when they were in Ministry of Defence use, with British officers and multinational crews when the ships were on commercial work. Negotiations with AWSR in 2001 were able to take account of the implications and benefits of the Government's &quot;British Shipping Charting a New Course&quot; which had been published the previous year. As a result, when working for MOD ships will be manned by British crews who will be eligible to be called out as sponsored reserves and, although not mandated by MOD, British crews will man the ships being used in commercial trade.</p>

	<p pid=".743W.3/2">The Army and the RAF latest continuous attitude surveys include over 200 questions each, while the Royal Navy survey has over a hundred. The questions are on a wide variety of subjects with the following broad categories: personal circumstances; quality of life; job satisfaction; career development; operational tours and postings; pay and allowances; accommodation; welfare; families; facilities; communication and equal opportunities. The questions are structured around the Armed Forces Overarching Personnel Strategy; however, they are not fixed and are varied to determine attitudes to particular conditions of service.</p>
	<p pid=".743W.3/3">Each of the three services has conducted its own continuous attitude surveys of serving personnel since the 1980s. The Royal Navy conducts surveys three times per year, the Army twice yearly and the Royal Air Force conducts surveys quarterly.</p>
	<p pid=".743W.3/4">Each survey is designed to ascertain the attitude of personnel towards a range of service conditions and to gather intentions with regard to their remaining in the service. Senior staff and policy makers use the information gathered to identify which policies are seen to be working and inform subsequent policy development work. The three services also periodically survey spouses of serving personnel to gather evidence on the effects of service life on families.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.6/2">British military involvement in Kosovo will be decided in the light of the major review currently being undertaken by NATO of its operations in the Balkans. The review, entitled the Joint Operational Area Review, will be discussed by NATO Foreign Ministers in May 2002. We welcome the review and remain committed to maintaining a military contribution to NATO peacekeeping in the Balkans. The form that this contribution will take has yet to be decided.</p>

	<p pid=".747W.3/1">There are currently 17 different separate licensed anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs which can be used in a variety of combinations. Moreover, different countries use different types of drugs and treatments to help treat people living with HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.3/2">The retail cost of all three classes of drugs in developed countries averages between $10,000 and $14,000 per year. Costa Rica has negotiated a price equivalent to $7,000 per patient per year for ARV. Nigeria has launched the largest ARV treatment programme in Africa, using a generic form of ARV at a cost of $350 per patient per year. In Brazil, where some ARV drugs are produced locally, triple combination therapy costs $1,460 per patient per year, whereas in Thailand the cost of triple combination therapy is over $4,100 per patient per year. In addition to drugs costs there are laboratory monitoring costs (estimated at around US$400 per annum in Uganda) and other associated service delivery costs.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.3/3">My Department is working with the international community to facilitate a framework for differential pricing, which would provide essential medicines to the developing world at substantially lower cost. However, the cost of ARV represents only part of the cost of treatment for people living with HIV. For example, an essential pre-requisite to any programme to increase access to medicines is widespread availability of voluntary counselling and testing. Adequate access to treatment for opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, is also crucial. Furthermore, building capacity to use ARVs effectively cannot be achieved overnight, and will require substantial and sustained investment in health systems to reduce resistance to the drugs and to maximise the utility of the drugs in the short and long term.</p>

We believe that cost effectiveness is very important, and one of the key indicators monitored is the cost per condom sold. Higher sales reduce the cost per condom, and although final cost figures for 2001 are not yet available, last year saw the highest sales since the project began. An evaluation of the project is planned for the third quarter of this year, when cost effectiveness and value for money will be among key issues examined.</p>

	<p pid=".751W.9/1">The provision and maintenance of water, transport and energy infrastructure underpins much of what we do to eliminate poverty and encourage pro-poor economic growth. In all programmes we will try to include an element of strengthening and training into the institutions which provide the engineering services. Our Knowledge and Research programmes regularly look at projects which try to improve the technical standards and the quality of decision making for the engineering profession in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".751W.9/2">However more specifically the Strengthening Professional Engineering Associations Project (SPEAP) has been using the Institution of Civil Engineers to study the particular needs of the engineering profession in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
	<p pid=".751W.9/3">Infrastructure services consume a very large proportion of public funds in developing countries. The rationale for the project lies in the recognition that poor quality engineering often leads to the inefficient use of those funds and the rapid deterioration of facilities. Earthquake disasters result in loss of life which could be mostly avoided by implementation of simple engineering good practice. As we move away from donor supervised project level support towards budget and sectoral support the quality of local professional services becomes increasingly critical. A strengthened profession will help to maintain higher standards and improve decision making to the benefit of the whole community.</p>
	<p pid=".751W.9/4">The project will also address the impact of strengthened professional standards on professional integrity and corruption and look at the potential impact of the GATS 2000 decisions in respect of the worldwide trade in engineering services. If engineering qualification and standards are not raised to internationally accepted norms then the full benefits will not be realised.</p>
	<p pid=".751W.9/5">Throughout our work in engineering we are continuously emphasising the broader responsibilities of engineers towards the social and environmental issues associated with infrastructure developments.</p>

	<p pid=".755W.9/2">This study examined approximately 500 children with childhood (278) or atypical (195) autism born between 1979 and 1998 in five health districts in north-east London. Of these children, 25 per cent. were reported to have regression and 17 per cent. to have had bowel problems. There was no significant difference in the rates of bowel problems or regression in those who had had MMR vaccine before onset of problems, after onset or who had never had the vaccine. In addition the proportion of autistic children with regression or bowel problems did not change significantly over the period from 1979&ndash;98, which included the introduction of MMR in 1988. This study found no evidence to support a 'new variant' form of autism, where MMR vaccination is associated with developmental regression and bowel problems.</p>

	<p pid=".758W.2/1">The available information is shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.2/2">We recognise and fully understand the distress that cancellations can cause for patients and their families. This is reflected by the fact that from the end of this month, any patient who has their operation cancelled by the hospital on the day it is due to happen will be guaranteed treatment within 28 days, or else the hospital will have to fund their treatment at the time and place of their choice.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.2/3">The NHS is carrying out more operations than ever before&mdash;up by more than half a million between 1996&ndash;97 and 2000&ndash;01. But cancellations are a long term problem which can only be resolved through the investment and reform that is now taking place in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".759W.2/2">The changes to the process do not impact on the liability for a product. Where the liability for the use of a product lies will vary according to the circumstances of each individual case but will be the same for products with an existing legal status as for those which have been newly reclassified.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.2/3">Patient safety remains paramount and any application to consider a change of legal status for a particular medicine will continue to require an applicant to demonstrate its safety in use, including without medical supervision, and that the patient information is suitable for the medicine to be made more widely available.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.2/4">Making more medicines more widely available when it is safe to do so is a key part of the national health service objective to empower patients. Many patients are expert on their own conditions and early access to treatments for known conditions can have a significant public health benefit where early intervention would not otherwise be possible.</p>

	<p pid=".760W.3/2">Waiting times for radiotherapy treatments are not collected centrally. The NHS Cancer Plan set out maximum waiting time targets for first definitive cancer treatment which will come into effect over the next few years. Arrangements to monitor these targets are currently being put in place and will cover radiotherapy where this is the first treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".760W.3/3">From December 2001, there is a one month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for children's, testicular and acute leukaemia. By 2005, there will be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers. Monitoring of these targets is being introduced and figures will be published as the targets apply.</p>

	<p pid=".768W.0/2">The Health Survey for England 2000 reported that 45 per cent. of men were overweight and 21 per cent. obese, and 34 per cent. of women were overweight and 21 per cent. obese.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/3">The Health Survey for England 1995&ndash;97 reported that 22 per cent. of six-year-olds and 31 per cent. of 15-year-olds are overweight. The prevalence of obesity ranges from 10 per cent. at age six years to 17 per cent. at age 15 years.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/4">The National Audit Office publication 'Tackling Obesity in England' reported that in 1998 30,000 deaths (of which 9,000 were before the age of 65 years) were attributable to obesity. There is an estimated direct cost to the national health service (NHS) of at least &pound;0.5 billion a year, or about 1.5 per cent. of NHS expenditure. There is also an estimated direct cost of &pound;2 billion a year to the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/5">Obesity is a complex condition, but is largely preventable through addressing the risk factors of diet and physical inactivity. The Government are committed to tackling this rising trend in obesity and are taking positive steps to improve prevention, treatment and management of obesity through the NHS Plan, Cancer Plan and national service frameworks.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/6">We have put in place cross-Government work and local action is under way to promote physical activity and healthy eating and tackle overweight and obesity. Specifically, these include a national school fruit scheme, a wider five-a-day programme to increase access to and consumption of fruit and vegetables and work with industry to improve overall balance in diet, including salt, fat and diet. Among children, there has been significant investment in primary physical education (PE) and sports facilities, including &pound;581 million from the new opportunities fund for a PE and sports programme.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/7">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has provided guidance on the anti-obesity drugs orlistat and sibutramine for the NHS. Treatment with these drugs will be supported by advice, support and counselling on diet, physical activity and behavioural strategies. NICE are also reviewing surgical interventions to treat morbid obesity, the findings of which are expected in summer 2002. Referral to NICE of further guidance topics remains under consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/8">We welcomed the Public Accounts Committee report on 'Tackling Obesity in England', published in January 2002, the official response to which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-21">21 March 2002</phrase> and has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/9">No specific targets are set for reductions in the levels of overweight and obesity. However, the coronary heart disease national service framework sets standards and specific milestones for action on local programmes of effective policies on reducing overweight and obesity. Meeting these standards will contribute to achieving on of the four targets set in Our Healthier Nation, to reduce deaths from coronary heart disease by 40 per cent. in people in people under 75 by 2010.</p>

Valves which do not bear the CE marking can also be used (on a restricted basis) as part of controlled clinical trials. Approval by the US Food and Drugs Administration is not a prerequisite for the use of artificial heart valves by the NHS, regardless of their country of origin.</p>
