	<p pid="d.2056W.11/1">Data on the video and computer games sector is not regularly collated or in fact readily available to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, particularly as the sector has not had its own separate Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. A new SIC code for computer games has now been agreed though it will not be possible for this to deliver data until 2010 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="d.2056W.11/2">However in 2002 the Department of Trade and Industry published &quot;From Exuberant Youth to Sustainable Maturity&quot;, a full competitiveness analysis of the computer games sector commissioned from independent consultants, Spectrum Strategy. This report showed that in 2000 there were approximately 270 games development companies in the UK, the vast majority independent (and indigenous) studios with fewer than 22 employees. Four overseas-owned companies with games studios in the UK were identified in the report.</p>
	<p pid="d.2056W.11/3">In October 2007 UKTI published &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, a report commissioned from independent consultants Games Investor which included a range of valuable new data on the competitiveness of the UK games development sector compared to key competitor territories including the US and Canada. This report showed that in 2006 there were 160 independent (indigenous) games development companies in the UK. The report also identified two UK-owned games publishers which have one or more games development studios here. However, the number of games development studios in the UK owned by overseas companies was not specified.</p>

	<p pid="d.2064W.3/1">Prior to the launch of the Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator, there was no mechanism in place to permit Service personnel easily to identify their total worth. The Armed Forces' Pay Review Body has previously commented that Service personnel lack awareness of the total value of their armed forces remuneration package, and that more should be done to assess and communicate the value of the package. In addition, the introduction of Joint Personnel Administration has inevitably placed a greater emphasis on the need for clear and easily accessible internal communication on pay and allowances matters. Her Majesty's Treasury has also, over the years, challenged the MOD about not communicating effectively to staff the value and merits of the armed force total reward package.</p>
	<p pid="d.2064W.3/2">Although some progress had been made in this area (a fact sheet is available on the Defence intranet) the information is very generic, non-interactive and not particularly accessible. The vast majority of personnel, while aware of their annual salary and allowances packages, continue to view each of these elements in isolation, and many other financial benefits remain 'invisible' (such as medical/dental care, and physical education opportunities). Building on the success of the existing Armed Forces Pension Calculator, the new Benefits Calculator was thus created to provide greater clarity of the 'total reward' package incorporating basic pay, specialist pay, individual allowances, pension, and other benefits where a realistic financial value can be attributed.</p>
	<p pid="d.2064W.3/3">The range of remuneration and allowance-based benefits included in the Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain relevant to comparable rates in civilian life and continue to be retention and recruitment positive. In addition, the calculator includes other benefits (such as dental care and health and fitness facilities) which are not strictly remuneration or allowance-related but are included to convey the extent of the total benefits package available to Service personnel in return for military service, and to provide an indication of what replicating these benefits might cost in civilian life. The terms and conditions governing the use of the Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator state that the Calculator is for guidance purposes only, and that it is not intended to provide formal financial advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.2064W.3/4">Initial feedback on the operation and utility of the Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator has been very positive, and at the time of writing over 14,000 calculations had been completed. The effectiveness of the Calculator will be reviewed over the coming months, including an assessment of the relative benefits of including links to other sites/pages providing information on a variety of related matters, currently including:</p>
	<p pid="d.2064W.3/5" class="indent">a. Discounts&mdash;principally through the Forces Discount Brochure.</p>

	<p pid="d.2065W.2/1">The Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator was developed to provide Service personnel with a quick and convenient way of working out the indicative value of their total remuneration and benefits package. The introduction of the Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator has, therefore, made it easier for personnel to make a direct comparison between their current remuneration and that being offered by civilian employers&mdash;and by doing so to demonstrate the value of their benefits package as a whole. The Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator has been developed also to provide potential recruits with a means of investigating the type of remuneration and benefits that might be available should they choose to join the armed forces. The Calculator uses a combination of existing pay rates and allowances details of which can be found at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk">http://www.mod.uk</a> and some new values, which have been agreed with subject matter experts and the single Services. These new values are included to provide a broad indication of what some of the other benefits personnel receive in return for military service (such as dental care, and health and fitness facilities) might cost to replicate in civilian life.</p>

The Standard Learning Credit (SLC) scheme supplies financial support, throughout the Service person's career, for multiple, small-scale learning activities. The Enhanced Learning Credit (ELC) scheme is designed to complement the SLC scheme by providing larger scale help to personnel who qualify to pay for higher level learning at Level 3 (GCE A level and equivalent) and above. For both schemes a wide variety of vocational and academic courses may be undertaken which lead to or facilitate the award of a nationally recognised qualification as defined by the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) (England and Wales to be superseded by the Qualifications Credits Framework (QCF)), or the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). The SLC and ELC schemes aim to motivate full time members of the armed forces to pursue their personal development during their service career to the benefit of both the Service and the individual. Any unused ELC benefit, however, may be used for up to 10 years afterwards, subject to the qualifying criteria being met.</p>

	<p pid="d.2072W.2/1">Government officials held regular discussions with coalition partners, including those in the Coalition Provisional Authority, on issues concerning the reconstruction of Iraq. As Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers and I have explained previously, events moved very quickly in the aftermath of the removal of Saddam Hussein and it should be remembered that by the end of initial hostilities, the Iraqi army had effectively dissolved itself. There was at the same time overwhelming popular pressure throughout Iraq for de-Ba'athification to begin, reflecting the suffering and resentment among ordinary Iraqis arising from three decades of repression by Saddam Hussein's regime. Policy and plans therefore remained fluid in light of developments on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="d.2072W.5/1">The MOD made a payment of &pound;41,000 to J P Morgan in 2003-04 for consultancy services associated with the implementation of an economic offset programme with a foreign government. No other payments were made centrally to the company in the years 1997-98 to 2007-08 inclusive.</p>
	<p pid="d.2072W.5/2">We only hold centrally information on transactions made by our Financial Management Shared Service Centre, representing about 95 per cent. of all MOD payments. We have, therefore, not included payments which may have been made on behalf of other Government Departments, by the MOD's trading funds (which lie outside our accounting boundary), locally in the Department, or in support of joint venture/alliance or international collaborative projects.</p>

Figures from the academic years of 1997-98 to 2001-02 was published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), and figures from the 2002-03 academic year onwards were published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).

	<p pid="d.2078W.2/5">For each institution, the performance indicator is shown against a benchmark. This is a sector average which is adjusted for each institution to take into account the following factors: subject of study, qualifications on entry and age on entry. The benchmarks can be used to show how a university is performing compared to the sector as a whole, and also help to determine whether a meaningful comparison can be drawn between two or more universities.

	<p pid="d.2084W.2/5">We continue to support the work of universities and colleges through the Department's own communications activity and make efforts to raise awareness of bursaries alongside all other elements of the higher education student finance package.</p>
	<p pid="d.2084W.2/6">More broadly, post campaign research shows that currently 81 per cent. of students and 80 per cent. of parents are now aware that there is financial support available for students.</p>
	<p pid="d.2084W.2/7">The most recent campaign has shown a marked increase in the awareness of the specific messages relating to non-repayable maintenance grants.</p>
	<p pid="d.2084W.2/8">The latest tracking research shows that 93 per cent. of parents and 88 per cent. of students had watched the campaign on TV. And that 99 per cent. of parents and 94 per cent. of students had seen the campaign on any of the media used. Although the campaign has non repayable grants as its focus it uses messages on all elements of the student finance package and therefore works to promote bursaries.</p>
	<p pid="d.2084W.2/9">One of the main calls to action by the campaign is to visit the campaign website which contains the bursary map. Visitors can use this tool, which is actively updated by DIUS, to find out what bursaries are available from the HEI's they are interested in attending.</p>

	<p pid="d.2090W.5/23">The average fine per conviction is based on the results where fines were imposed by the courts for individual charges laid before the courts. Prosecution cases can contain one or more charges. Only one offence may be charged in any one information laid before the courts. There may be one or more hearings of the charge in court before the court delivers a verdict on each particular offence. Each conviction is a single breach of a specific piece of health and safety legislation.</p>

These experts will deliver one to one and group-based support to parents as well as supporting local parenting commissioners in the implementation of their Parenting Strategy. In 2008-09, over &pound;8 million has been allocated to fund these posts and we expect to spend around &pound;12 million each year over 2009-10 and 2010-11.</p>

As a first step, a stakeholder working group has been established to consider reforming governance in this way. Good governance and leadership is essential if we are to achieve better outcomes for all children and young people.</p>

Although this target applies to offices only, the Prison Service, which became part of the new Ministry on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May 2007</phrase>, has been working for some years towards reducing energy consumption (and, consequently, carbon emissions) across the prison estate. The service has achieved reduction of 4 per cent. in energy use as against the 1999 baseline, a decrease in the consumption of fossil fuels by about 7 per cent. (both against a rising prison population) and currently obtains 18 per cent. of electricity from renewable resources. It will continue this work in 2008 by introducing a Carbon Management Programme working with the Carbon Trust.</p>

	<p pid="d.2116W.8/3">Since the report was published, the DELMIS system, to which it referred, has been superseded by a different system known as the case information database (CID). This is designed for use within all areas of the Agency as opposed to just the detention service directorate. It is through CID that the Agency is able to ensure that it keeps accurate records on all individuals' immigration cases as well as ensuring that caseworkers are aware of where an individual resided or whether they were detained.</p>
	<p pid="d.2116W.8/4">The chief executive of the UK Border Agency has written to the Home Affairs Committee on several occasions over the past 18 months and explained that we have reviewed and strengthened our processes in identifying those foreign nationals serving custodial sentences and should be considered for deportation following the events of April 2006.</p>

Special autonomy legislation allows for the use of Papuan symbols and anthems, but the local legislation that is required to confirm the chosen symbols and anthems has yet to be passed.</p>

ICPD also affirmed that in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning. These agreements also recognise the health impact of abortion complications&mdash;unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death and injury&mdash;and agree that, where permitted by national law, abortion should be safe and that in all cases women should have access to quality services for the management of complications following abortion.</p>

	<p pid="d.2129W.3/1">There is no standardised format for a vascular risk assessment currently in use within the primary care system. However, we do know that many of the elements of the vascular check proposed in &quot;Putting Prevention First&quot; are offered to patients. Copies of this publication are available in the Library. These are not recorded under the heading of vascular risk assessment, but it is possible to make some estimates on the basis of samples of primary care data sets. For example, using a sample of 1.14 million general practice records for adults aged 40 to 74 provided by Q Research, relating to 2007, we can estimate numbers in that age group in England who have records of the four measures we are proposing should form part of a vascular risk assessment. These measures are cholesterol, smoking status, body mass index and blood pressure.</p>
	<p pid="d.2129W.3/2">We estimate that in the five years between 2002 and 2007 an average of 620,000 adults per annum will have undergone all four measures. This excludes people who already have one or more vascular diseases because they would not be eligible for primary prevention, which is what the vascular risk assessments are intended for. In addition, from the same data we estimate that 1.2 million people are being prescribed statins for primary prevention of disease and we can assume that each of these is likely to have undergone at least some of the elements of the proposed vascular risk assessment when the initial decision to prescribe statins was made.</p>

To minimise variation in interpretation of the principles outlined in the Framework and to inform consistent decision-making, the Department has developed the national decision support tool in conjunction with stakeholders. The decision support tool supports practitioners in obtaining a full picture of needs and indicates a level of need that could constitute a primary health need as set out in the Framework. The decision support tool, combined with practitioners' own experience and professional judgment, will enable them to apply the primary health need test in practice, in a way that is consistent with the limits on what can be lawfully provided by local authorities. It is too soon to gauge the Framework's impact. We will review the Framework and the decision support tool in September 2008.</p>

	<p pid="d.2135W.0/1">The old arrangements were related to Whitley staff groups and pay scales, and there is no easy read across to agenda for change pay bands. The changes to the unsocial hours payments have an effective date from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, the impacts will vary but in headline terms:</p>
	<p pid="d.2135W.0/2" class="indent">any time on Saturday (midnight to midnight) and any week day after 8 pm and before 6 am is time plus 50 per cent. for band 1, time plus 44 per cent. for band 2, time plus 37 per cent. for band 3 and time plus 30 per cent. for bands 4 to 9; and</p>
	<p pid="d.2135W.0/3" class="indent">all time on Sundays and public holidays (midnight to midnight) is double time for band 1, time plus 88 per cent. for band 2, time plus 74 per cent. for band 3, time plus 60 per cent. for bands 4 to 9.</p>
	<p pid="d.2135W.0/4">It is not possible to identify what this means by role, payment depends on their band. However, it is important to note that all staff employed in ambulance organisations will remain on the original prospective agenda for change system, as it has worked well in early implementers and for national roll-out.</p>

	<p pid="d.2135W.6/1">The Department received an allocation of &pound;84 million over three years from HM Treasury to fund the establishment and costs incurred by local involvement networks (LINks). The allocations to local authorities (LAs) were based on two elements used in many similar cases to take account of key geographical factors such as deprivation, sparsity, area costs, etc. The first was a general baseline payment of &pound;60,000 awarded to each LA. The second was calculated according to the relative needs formulae (RNF), which is used to allocate funds to LAs in other areas of work.</p>
	<p pid="d.2135W.6/2">The RNF relates to three population groups: children, younger adults (aged 18-64) and older people (aged 65 and over). The RNF includes needs components and costs components that are specific to the three age groups. The children's formula consists of a basic amount per resident child aged 0 to 17, and top-ups for deprivation, fostering cost and area costs. The older people's formula consists of a basic amount per person aged 65 and over and top-ups for age, deprivation, sparsity, low income from fees and charges, and area costs. The younger adults' formula consists of a basic amount per person aged 18-64 and tops-ups for deprivation and area costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.2135W.6/3">The formulae is therefore defined in terms of need and costs. There is not a weighting component that could be extracted from the calculations because the calculations use local values ('weights') for 'needs' and for 'costs', and removing them would make it impossible to calculate the funding allocations. Extracting weights from the calculation would have the effect of each local authority receiving an equal funding allocation.</p>
	<p pid="d.2135W.6/4">Using the allocations for LINks for 2008-09, we have been able to calculate the amount of local funding per 100 people (&pound;) for 2008-09 and this is shown in the following table.</p>

It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) in partnership with local authorities (LAs), strategic health authorities (SHAs) and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, and to commission services accordingly. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of school nursing services.</p>

	<p pid="d.2156W.5/3">It is the intention that the admission of domestic passengers into the lounge will be controlled by means of biometric fingerprint enrolment together with a digital photograph, the details of which will then be validated at boarding. This system will ensure that only those individuals entitled to travel within the UK as a domestic passenger can do so. However, to ensure that the proposed system is fully validated by the Information Commissioner, it has been agreed that the system will operate using only digital photography until such validation is given.</p>

	<p pid="d.2159W.8/1">It is not possible to identify those offences which are knife-related from the data centrally collected on recorded crime. However, since April 2007, police forces have been providing separate aggregate data on serious violence involving knives. Home Office statisticians will assess the quality of these data and it is planned that figures for 2007-08 will be published in the main crime bulletin in July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.2159W.8/2">Available data from the Homicide Index relate to offences currently recorded as homicide where the apparent method of killing is 'sharp instrument'. Between 1997-98 and 2006-07 police in England and Wales recorded 2,333 such homicides, 635 of which were recorded by the City of London or Metropolitan police forces. These data cannot be broken down to a more local level than police force area.</p>
	<p pid="d.2159W.8/3">The Government fully recognise the importance of tackling knife crime. This is a complex issue and we are using a variety of measures, encompassing legislation, enforcement, education and prevention, to address it. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February</phrase> we published a new Tackling Violence Action Plan, outlining plans to tackle serious violence, including knife crime.</p>

	<p pid="d.2162W.2/1">The information requested is not available centrally. Offences of criminal damage to bus shelters would be recorded under the Home Office classification 'Other criminal damage' and such offences cannot be separately identified from other offences recorded within that classification. For the same reason, statistics for prosecutions and convictions are not available from the court proceedings database held by the Ministry of Justice.</p>
