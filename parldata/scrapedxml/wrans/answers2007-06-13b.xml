	<p pid="b.1026W.3/1">Under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, it is a legal requirement that all new buses, coaches and rail vehicles comply with relevant accessibility regulations. Access to transport infrastructure is also covered by the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.3/2">The Government have made a commitment that access for disabled people will be a condition of new public investment in transport.

	<p pid="b.1027W.3/21">Few other countries outside Europe, the USA and Australasia have published estimates regarding cetacean deaths. However the report, 'Bycatch of Marine Mammals in U.S. and Global Fisheries', published in Conservation Biology, Volume 20, No. 1, February 2006, which relies heavily on extrapolations from data in the USA, provides some estimates. I have arranged for copies to be placed in the Library of the House. The authors recognise any efforts to provide estimates are hindered by the fact that very few countries have reporting systems in place to provide accurate data. The UK is one of the few countries that have established such systems.</p>

I have recently introduced an additional measure for 2007 to permit licence holders of 10 metre and under vessels to lease in-year quota from producer organisations. This is in recognition of the increased pressures faced by the inshore fleet and the need of some fishermen to access quota above the quantities they may fish each month from the 10 metre and under &quot;pool&quot; quota allocation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1036W.3/3">The matter is not straightforward. We do not believe that any potential domestic benefits justify the resources that would be required, given that the UK has no issues with trans-boundary water management. However, we need to do more work to determine whether or not there is a development case for accession. We need to be clear on real benefits on the ground and ensure that this does not just place a further burden on governments in our partner countries. We will reach a view on this in the autumn and feed this into cross Whitehall consultations with DEFRA and FCO.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043W.6/1">The number of public library closures is not centrally recorded. However, the net change in library service points can be calculated using the Public Library Statistics published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). These show that for 2005-06 (the latest year for which figures are available) the total number of public library service points open for 10 hours or more per week, and including mobile libraries, was 3,500. The comparable figure for 2004-05 was 3,474. This reveals an increase of 26 in the total number of service points. These net figures take into account openings of new libraries as well as closures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1047W.2/1">At the conclusion of the inquest concerning the inquest into Terry Lloyd's death, where a verdict that Mr. Lloyd was unlawfully killed was recorded, the coroner, Mr. Andrew Walker wrote to the Attorney-General to ask him to consider any steps that might be taken to bring those responsible for the death of Mr. Lloyd before a court.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047W.2/2">As it is alleged that Mr. Lloyd was killed in Iraq by American military personnel the relevant offence capable of being tried in a UK court is section 1 of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957. The Attorney-General has to consent to any prosecution which may be brought. Any decision to prosecute is made by the Crown Prosecution Service using the same code for Crown prosecutors test they use in every case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047W.2/3">Accordingly the Attorney-General sent the coroner's letter and enclosures to the CPS for them to consider. The CPS has the case under active review and is briefing the Law Officers regularly. They have decided that they need further information before they can make a decision and are taking steps to obtain that information.</p>

	<p pid="b.1049W.0/18">The care provided in these facilities is multidisciplinary in nature. Teams comprise consultant psychiatrists, community mental health nurses, psychologists and specialist social workers; the individual's medical condition dictates which disciplines are involved in their care. The approach to assessment and treatment is delivered in accordance with national guidance (issued through NICE) and is delivered in conjunction with the patient's general practitioner and where appropriate, key individuals in the patient's chain of command.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/19">If a service person's condition requires a period of in-patient assessment and/or treatment, patients can be admitted to an in-patient facility under the MOD's contract with the Priory Healthcare Group. This contract provides specialist assessment and treatment in a facility proximate to their home unit or home. During a period of in-patient care, the Defence Mental Health Services continually liaise with the patient and their medical team through a nominated service liaison officer (SLO) who is a senior mental health nurse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/20">The primary aim of assessment and treatment, be it community or hospital based is correct diagnosis (as early as possibly), treatment and stabilisation, rehabilitation and return to work. If the patient's condition and prognosis dictates that he/she can no longer service in the armed forces, the focus is on a seamless transfer of care and support from the military medical and welfare services to the NHS and other relevant bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/21">The MOD also provides a care programme for recently demobilised reserve personnel called the Reserves Mental Health programme (RMHP). Under the RMHP, we liaise with the individual's GP and offer a mental health assessment at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre in Chilwell. If diagnosed to have a combat-related mental health condition, we then offer out-patient treatment via one of the MOD's 15 Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs). If more acute cases present, the DMS will assist access to NHS in-patient treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1051W.6/2">Following recommendations on mental health services for veterans made in 2005 by the independent Health and Social Care Advisory Service, officials from the Ministry of Defence, the UK Health departments and Combat Stress have been working together to develop and implement a new community-based model for mental health services for veterans; this is designed to provide health professionals with access to expert understanding of veterans' mental health problems and appropriate treatment options. Based on NHS practice and procedures, the new service would deliver culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions through a network of public, private and charitable providers; an aim of the new model would be to integrate Combat Stress into NHS commissioning arrangements. It is planned that, beginning in the summer, the model will be piloted at sites across the UK. The pilots are likely to last two years and, if successful, will be rolled out nationally. We have established separately an arrangement for the assessment and treatment of mental health problems that may have affected Reservists as a result of deployment on operations since 2003.</p>

	<p pid="b.1062W.11/2">The Government welcomed the Leitch review, published in December 2006, and its analysis of the growing importance of skills in a modern economy. A significant part of the Government's role, as set out in more detail in the Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004:2014, is to ensure that the UK produces a healthy supply of people with science, engineering and technology (SET) skills. These skills are vital in helping to achieve the ambition of making Britain the most attractive location in the world for science and innovation. The Government accept there must be a shared responsibility for delivering this ambition; employers, individuals and the Government must all improve their efforts and investment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1064W.3/2">Analysis by IPA Energy Consulting Ltd., carried out for DTI, estimates the potential for an increase in wholesale generator profit of &pound;800 million a year as a result of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. This is based on the assumptions that electricity generators pass on the full costs of carbon allowances through to higher electricity prices, a carbon price of &euro;15 and the current Phase I annual allocation to the sector of 130MtCO2. However, this figure is dependent on modelling assumptions and is subject to considerable uncertainty. In particular, the current price of Phase I ETS allowances is significantly lower than &euro;15, so the potential for increased profits will be less than &pound;800 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1069W.2/1">It is for each Fire and Rescue Authority to determine appropriate response times as part of its integrated risk management plan. The Government have no plans to introduce national targets. As part of the process of introducing Regional Control Centres the Department has developed a set of benefits indicators, one of which will enable it to show the impact of Regional Control Centres on response times. Two features of the fire control system, Automatic Vehicle Location Systems (AVLS) and the ability to dynamically mobilise fire appliances directly, even when they are not in a fire station, are expected to put a downward pressure on response times. There are a number of other factors affecting response times, including the number and location of fire appliances as well as the control arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1070W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/2">Health based air quality standards have been set both at a domestic and EU level on a range of air pollutants, including particulate matter. Action to improve air quality is underway across Government at national, international and local levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/3">The introduction of the &quot;Euro&quot; series of progressively tighter emission standards has been underway since 1992, and has drastically lowered the permitted limits for particulate matter emission from new diesel vehicles. This has been complemented by improvements in product standards for petrol and diesel, which have lowered the permitted amounts of certain pollutant-forming substances in these fuels. Further &quot;Euro&quot; vehicle emission standards, with even tighter emission limits for particles, are due to be introduced between now and 2014. This is supported by other Government action, including the promotion of cleaner, less polluting fuel and vehicle technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/4">Local authorities are also taking forward their duty to review and assess air quality in their areas against objectives for a range of pollutants. If there is a likely chance of failure in meeting any of these objectives, an authority is required to declare an Air Quality Management Area and take forward action plans within its remit to address the problem. Such action is progressed in coordination with other agencies, including the Highways Agency and Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/5">The content of action plans varies from one authority to another, and depends upon the sources of the pollutants of concern. However, common elements where emissions from roads are a particular problem include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/6" class="indent">(i) A commitment to working closely with the Highways Agency on possible emissions reduction measures where trunk roads are major local sources of pollutants;</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/7" class="indent">(ii) Local traffic management measures to limit access to, or re-route traffic away from, problem areas. Low emission zones are a possible solution that some authorities have been looking at in this context;</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/8" class="indent">(iii) Commitment to developing green travel plans and/or to using cleaner-fuelled vehicles in the authority's own fleet;</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/9" class="indent">(iv) A strategy for informing members of the public about air quality issues, via local newsletters or other media;</p>
	<p pid="b.1070W.5/10" class="indent">(v) Quality partnerships with bus or fleet operators to deliver cleaner, quieter vehicles in return for the provision of better bus lanes or more flexible delivery arrangements; and</p>

	<p pid="b.1073W.9/1">Planning Policy Statement 3 (PPS3) &quot;Housing&quot; asks local authorities to identify specific sites which will deliver their housing numbers and brownfield targets. In doing so it makes clear that allowances for windfalls should not be included in the first 10 years of the plan. This is intended to help achieve, within the plan-led system, the twin aims of giving certainty that land will come forward, and of demonstrating to local communities and developers where development will be accepted. The plan process, with its community involvement and public examination, gives the opportunity for an open debate about local authorities' policies and strategies for development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.9/2">However, where local planning authorities can provide robust evidence of genuine local circumstances that prevent specific sites being identified, a windfall allowance may be justified. The circumstances, by their very nature, will vary depending on local factors relevant to individual local planning authorities. And the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment will be key to this. In PPS3 we have also said that any such allowance should be realistic having regard to evidence of land availability, historic windfall delivery rates and expected future trends.</p>

CLIFF is an investment fund mechanism for assisting organisations working with the urban poor to access private finance to undertake infrastructure initiatives in partnership with municipalities.

Most have fled to the nearby Beddawi refugee camp and some to other refugee camps in South Lebanon. Indications are that there are between 3,000 and 5,000 refugees remaining inside the camp.

We will continue to watch how the situation in Lebanon develops and remain ready to provide additional support as appropriate based on humanitarian need and the country's and agencies' ability to respond. The EC is providing &euro;370,000 of humanitarian assistance of which the UK share is &pound;45,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.1083W.0/1">DFID is planning to spend &pound;60 million on education in Nepal between now and 2015. We plan to gradually increase our support to education from its current level of &pound;5 million a year as the political environment in Nepal improves following the recent peace agreement between the government and the Maoists. DFID currently puts all of its support into the Government's Education for All programme, which is supported by other donors and which has resulted in increases in enrolment to primary education, despite the ongoing conflict, including for girls and disadvantaged groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1083W.0/2">Education for All will finish in 2009 and will be superseded by a new government programme that covers both primary and secondary education, which DFID will support. We will work with other donors and the government of Nepal to continue to improve access at all levels, especially for socially excluded groups. We will also help the Government to improve the quality of education, in particular by increasing teacher numbers in overcrowded schools and increasing classroom building.</p>
	<p pid="b.1083W.0/3">Education has a vital role to play in stabilising the peace in Nepal after the recent conflict, much of which was motivated by inequality, including inequality in gaining access to government services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1084W.2/1">At the start of 2006 the World Bank predicted that the Palestinian economy would contract by 27 per cent. during the year. The latest estimates are that the economy in fact contracted by 5-10 per cent. in 2006. Increased EU funding through the temporary international mechanism (TIM) alongside other donor funding, mostly from Arab states, made a substantial contribution to slowing this economic decline. The World Bank and the European Commission are currently assessing the impact of the TIM. The results of this review are expected to be available soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.1084W.2/2">However, despite increased donor funding, poverty rates have almost doubled, up from 22 per cent. to 56 per cent. in the West Bank and from 43 per cent. to 87 per cent. in Gaza. The main reasons for this are the effects on the Palestinian economy of Israel's suspension of the transfer of Palestinian tax revenues and Israeli security restrictions on Palestinian movement and access to markets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1086W.3/1">The Aral Sea has been recognised as the world's worst artificial ecological disaster. From 1960 to 2000 it lost 75 per cent. of its volume and 50 per cent. of its surface area. Its degradation has been ruinous to the people, plant and animal life in the region. None of the twenty species of fish once found in the Aral have survived. However, a dam has now been placed between the northern and southern part of the Aral Sea, built with international assistance from the World Bank. Since completion in 2005, the World Bank reports that the water-level in the northern part of the sea has gradually risen and, between 2003 and 2006, increased by 13 per cent. in surface area (from 2,850 km sq to 3,250 km sq).</p>
	<p pid="b.1086W.3/2">A spillway passing excess water from the northern to the southern part of the Aral Sea has been operational since February 2006 and the water level in the southern part is also now likely to increase in the future, though probably only marginally. Salinity levels of both parts of the sea have been reduced over the last two years and several freshwater fish have been returned to the sea. As such, fish harvests have considerably increased during the past two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1086W.3/3">According to the World Bank, the next step is to improve the irrigation efficiency of the land in the Kazakh part of the Aral Sea basin. Additional waterworks are also planned to restore wetlands and fishing lakes in the delta region. A World Bank project to this end began in 2007 and a project monitoring mission to the Aral Sea is currently underway.</p>

Committee members put questions to the Uzbek delegation including on the issue of child labour in the cotton fields. The Uzbek authorities are preparing new legislation, including a draft law on childrens' rights which we hope will address the Committee's concerns.</p>

	<p pid="b.1094W.7/1">National health service trusts must follow European Union procurement regulations under which private finance initiative (PFI) contracts are always awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender overall to the NHS, following a competitive bidding process. New EU regulations to decide the most economically advantageous bid, specifically applying to complex contracts such as PFI and other public private partnership (PPPs), were implemented in the United Kingdom from <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase> (known as the competitive dialogue procedure, succeeding the previous negotiated procedure). The Department is currently trialling this new process by shortlisting up to three bidders from which final priced bids will be invited from no less than two. In recognition of the additional work now required on the part of bidders to achieve full commercial and price certainty whilst still at this competitive stage, the EU legislation has specifically introduced a discretion to pay bid costs with the aim of ensuring that the costs of bidding are no greater then they would have been under the negotiated procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1102W.8/2">The Government stated in the White Paper &quot;Review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act: Proposals for revised legislation (including the establishment of the Regulatory Authority for Tissue and Embryos)&quot;, published in December 2006, that it is persuaded that sex selection for non-medical reasons within treatment services should be prohibited<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1102W.8/3">Such a provision, as envisaged by clause 18 and schedule 2 of the draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill would, in effect, put existing restrictions applicable to non-medical sex selection onto a statutory footing. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's (HFEA) code of practice makes clear that licensed centres should not, for social reasons, (a) select embryos of a particular sex, or (b) separate sperm samples, or use sperm samples which have been separated, for the purpose of sex selection<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1102W.8/4">Allowing sex selection for non-medical reasons found very little support in responses to the Department of Health's consultation on the review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, which ran from <phrase class="date" code="">16 August</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-25">25 November 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1102W.8/5">The Government also took into consideration the recommendations resulting from the HFEA's extensive review of sex selection and options for regulation conducted in 2002-03, which revealed widespread public opposition to non-medical sex selection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1102W.8/6">As stated in the White Paper, the Government's position reflects, in part, the strength of public opinion on this matter and also takes account of the possible effects&mdash;including internationally&mdash;on cultures where there are marked preferences for male children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1102W.8/7">Permitting sex selection for family-balancing reasons would also run the risk of opening the door to sex selection for other non-medical reasons.</p>

	<p pid="b.1105W.0/1">The Department is concerned about the amount of unused medicines and supports a range of initiatives to help patients get the most from their medicines, while at the same time minimising the amount of unwanted medicines returned to pharmacies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1105W.0/2">The new contractual framework for community pharmacy includes repeat dispensing as an essential service, which means that all community pharmacies in England must be in a position to dispense a repeatable prescription if presented with one. This service together with medicines use reviews, an advanced service provided by accredited pharmacists in premises that have been accredited, should both help to reduce the amount of medicines wasted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1105W.0/3">The National Audit Office in their recently published report &quot;Prescribing costs in primary care&quot; focused on the potential savings that could be achieved by reducing the amount of medicines wasted. It has recommended that the Department conduct some research to estimate the scale of medicines wastage, and provide better information on why patients do not take their medicines. This is a complex area and we intend to commission research to establish the extent of medicines waste and the complex and varied reasons for it. This may include the part played by patients and the pharmaceutical industry. We have not issued any guidance on over-prescribing.</p>

The Agency offers bonuses to Senior Civil Servants as part of performance related pay deals, based on year long performance measures. Bonuses are also offered to Senior Civil Servants in recognition of considerable additional work. There is no statutory requirement to keep accounting records longer than 6 years.

	<p pid="b.1108W.2/17" class="indent">The increase in the size of average bonuses in 2005-06 compared with 2004-05 reflects the substantially improved performance of the Agency over that period. In particular, comparing 2005-06 with 2004-05:</p>
	<p pid="b.1108W.2/18" class="indent">55,000 more children were in receipt of maintenance;</p>

	<p pid="b.1117W.5/1">Although a small proportion of people who survive to 65 will die before reaching the new state pension age as proposed under the pension reforms, the proportion of those surviving to the new state pension age is still projected to be higher than the proportion who survive to state pension age now. Those retiring at current state pension age of 65 for men and 60 for women are estimated to constitute about 82 per cent. of their generation, but those retiring at 68 in 2055 are expected to be more than 88 per cent. of their generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.5/2">Over the 30 year period between the financial years 2024-25 and 2054-55, a total of 24,463,000 people are projected to reach age 65 in the UK. Of these, about 1.6 per cent. of the total (about 238,000 males and 163,000 females) would subsequently die before reaching the new state pension age.</p>

	<p pid="b.1127W.8/2">Student loans repayments are not transferred to the Student Loans Company. They reduce the net assets, representing outstanding loans, on the Department for Education and Skills balance sheet. It is only information about repayments made by individual borrowers that is passed to the Company to allow it to issue annual statements. Once that information is received by the Company, repayments are attributed to each month of the tax year in which they were made by the borrower and monthly interest is calculated accordingly. This ensures that even if there is a delay in repayment details reaching the Company, the borrower does not pay any additional interest. No borrower pays too much interest as a result of the time lag in updating their account and nor does the Department or the SLC gain any additional income from the interest paid.</p>

	<p pid="b.1131W.3/1">Fixed and graduated fees have been operating in many areas of legal aid for many years and have been shown to control costs and encourage efficiency, and hence to improve access to justice. The Legal Services Commission (LSC) currently expects to extend the application of these fees to nearly all areas of legal aid from October 2007 as a precursor to best value tendering, which is expected to be rolled out from October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.3/2">While greater efficiency will allow us to help more people within a limited budget, the new fee schemes will not impact directly on demand for legal aid. Full regulatory impact assessments have accompanied each of the new fee schemes as they have been announced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.3/3">We expect the long-term trend of fewer legal aid providers helping more people to continue. Nevertheless, 94 per cent. of civil providers signed the new unified contract in April this year. The LSC will closely monitor the state of the supplier base as the reform programme progresses. The LSC is also working closely with Her Majesty's Courts Service and other justice agencies to ensure that the reforms are implemented smoothly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.3/4">We do not expect any delays to follow the implementation of fixed fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.3/5">My Department and the LSC regularly meet solicitors, other providers and their representative bodies to discuss issues of concern.</p>

	<p pid="b.1132W.9/1">As mediation services are provided by a number of local and national commercial mediation organisations, it is not possible to assess the true level of referral to mediation involving personal injury claims across England and Wales. However, the Ministry has recently conducted evaluations of our court-based mediation schemes based at central London, Birmingham, Guildford and Exeter. The results show that, although personal injury claims represent over half of the cases allocated to the fast and multi-track, these claims make up less than 6 per cent. of the cases that undertake the mediation process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1134W.2/1">There has been no formal assessment of levels of abuse of enduring powers of attorney (EPAs). It is particularly difficult to make judgments in this area because of the potentially high numbers of unregistered EPAs in existence. The Public Guardianship Office and Court of Protection have no knowledge of unregistered powers and only become aware of their existence if and when third parties raise direct concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.2/2">Under the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, EPAs will be replaced by new lasting powers of attorney (LPA). Because of concerns around the potential for abuse of such powers, the Act introduces a number of additional safeguards that will provide greater protection for people making them in the future:</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.2/3" class="indent">From October 2007 EPAs and LPAs must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) before use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.2/4" class="indent">An independent party must provide a certificate confirming that the person making the LPA understands what they are doing and that they are not acting under undue influence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.2/5" class="indent">When an application to register an LPA is made, the OPG must contact up to five people named by the donor to be notified. If no one is named, then a second independent party must have provided an additional certificate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.2/6" class="indent">Attorneys will have a duty to have regard to a statutory code of practice. Failure to follow the guidance in the code can be used as evidence in court proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.2/7" class="indent">If the public guardian has concerns about the way an attorney is carrying out their role, he has the powers to ask for accounts and an explanation as to why particular decisions are being made.</p>

However, in addition the Ministry of Justice undertakes public consultation in respect of significant prison proposals including new prisons. Such public consultation will invariably involve presentations to councillors (including parish councils) and the holding of a public exhibition (usually over a two to three day period) close to the site in question where officials are present to explain proposals and to answer questions. This is preceded by a leaflet drop in the surrounding area advertising the exhibition and explaining the proposals.</p>

The proposed University of the Arts in Cornwall should contribute to economic regeneration and provide new opportunities for students across the south-west region. As autonomous bodies which are independent of Government control, it is for higher education institutions and the funding bodies which support them to take account of the needs of students and the regions they serve and I am confident that they will do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.1151W.2/1">We will be publishing a detailed report of the three year evaluation of the full service extended schools programme at the end of June. This report will show that full service extended schools have a positive impact on the attainment of pupils and their engagement with learning, family stability and enhanced life chances, and are generating positive outcomes for families and local people. Further evaluation of impact and activities of extended schools is planned, covering the increasing number of schools which will be offering extended services by 2010. This will include the extent to which different groups of pupils and families such as social class, ethnic composition and children with disabilities are taking up extended services. This information is not currently collected by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES).</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.2/2">The DfES has a range of strategies to assess and monitor the extent to which schools are providing extended services. The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) monitor the extent to which the schools they are working with are providing access to services and activities. To date 1,175 secondary schools are providing all aspects of the core offer of extended services. In addition to these, 958 secondary schools are providing a varied menu of study support activities beyond the normal school day; 208 are providing parenting support programmes; 929 have in place swift and easy referral arrangements to targeted and specialist services; and 579 are providing community access to their facilities, including adult learning. In 2005 the DfES commissioned its own independent survey of activities in primary and secondary schools. Undertaken by BMRB Social Research, it is available on the DfES's website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR681.pdf">www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR681.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.2/4">In addition to this, questions about what services schools are offering have been included in the 2007 school census which is completed by all schools and which is due to be available in September 2007. Finally, the DfES monitors extended school related research and surveys carried out by other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.2/5">Secondary schools are not required to provide childcare as part of their extended schools offer. However, we know that from the 2005 BMRB social research survey 61 per cent. of secondary schools provided before school activities and or child care, 95 per cent. provided after school activities and or childcare and 65 per cent. provided holiday activities and or child care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.2/6">The TDA has undertaken research to examine demand for formal childcare for the 11 to 14 age range. This involved a small year long pilot to test demand as well as a bigger sample survey of schools to investigate what is already happening in schools for this age range. The research concluded that that there was insufficient parental demand for formal child care at secondary schools. It also showed that parents saw the varied menu of activities element of the extended schools core offer as providing a safe place for children to be both before and after school, 8 am to 6 pm and during school holidays.</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.2/7">The forthcoming report on the evaluation of full service extended schools will contain a section on cost benefit which will include some analysis of charging. It will show that there is considerable variability in the method of charging. It will also show that schools tend to charge for regular child care but after that charging is often ad hoc and relatively low level. The Government have issued guidance to schools on charging through the 'Planning and Funding Guidance: a guide for schools, local authorities and their partner organisations'.</p>

	<p pid="b.1158W.5/1">The Department's guidance, 'Drugs: Guidance for Schools (DfES 2004)', makes clear that drug education should start in primary schools and outlines the issues that should be covered at key stages 1 and 2, having regard for the age and maturity of the pupils concerned. As part of their drug education, pupils should learn how to make informed choices about their health, how to resist pressure to do wrong and to take more responsibility for their actions. The Government intend to consult shortly on proposals for a new drug strategy, and education in primary schools will be considered as part of that wider process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161W.0/1">The DfES launched a strategy for English as an additional language (EAL) in October 2003 as part of its Aiming High initiative for raising achievement of minority ethnic pupils. Central to this strategy was the professional development of teachers and teaching assistants in primary and secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/2">Key initiatives since 2003 include an extensive EAL programme delivered through the primary national strategy involving a package of professional development for mainstream staff. Professional development materials on EAL have been rolled out as part of this initiative and are available to all primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/3">A secondary national strategy programme for EAL was launched in June 2006 which builds on from this work to promote awareness of best practice in EAL teaching in secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/4">Local authorities also receive additional funding from the ethnic minority achievement grant (EMAG). EMAG is distributed to local authorities by formula which includes the number of EAL pupils in each LA, with locally determined formulae devolving at least 85 per cent. to schools. The grant is &pound;179 million in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/5">EMAG provides resources for schools to employ specialist EAL support teachers and teaching assistants and for local authorities to maintain a small advisory team. Some local authorities employ a team of specialist EAL teachers whose services are bought in by schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/6">The DfES will launch a New Arrivals Excellence Programme in July 2007. This aims to build capacity in local authorities and schools in England to deliver good quality provision and point towards the best training opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/7">The Department has published two documents designed to support school assessment of EAL pupils and funded accredited specialist training in EAL for teachers and teaching assistants between 2004 and 2006. These courses have continued despite no longer being funded by the Department.</p>

Harassment and bullying at work can cause fear, stress and anxiety and even sickness among employees. It can lead to serious legal consequences for both the harasser and the employer. As such, we do not tolerate unacceptable behaviour towards others. Formal complaints are investigated quickly and thoroughly and, where complaints are upheld, appropriate disciplinary action is taken. All cases are treated seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.3/3">The overall aim of our harassment and bullying policy is to prevent such unacceptable behaviour occurring but, where it does occur, to ensure that appropriate and effective action is taken to deal with it and prevent it happening again. This applies to everyone in the Department. Every individual is personally responsible for their own behaviour, and every manager is responsible for enforcing the policy in accordance with the guidance and procedures set out in our Staff Handbook.</p>

	<p pid="b.1163W.3/2">The number of primary and secondary schools being placed in special measures is now considerably less than in 1997/98, despite a tougher inspection regime. So far during the current academic year 116 primary and 28 secondary schools have been placed in this Ofsted category. The figures for the 1997/98 academic year were 210 primaries and 43 secondaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.3/3">Schools in special measures are now also being turned around more quickly. Primary schools now spend an average of 16 months in special measures and secondary schools 22 months, compared with 23 months and 28 months respectively in 1997. Our reforms in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 will reduce turn round times further. Under the new arrangement authorities will be expected to be more active in preventing school failure and more decisive in tackling it where it occurs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1166W.2/1">In order to be awarded qualified teacher status, all trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the statutory special educational needs code of practice, know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN, and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.2/2">We are proposing that from September 2007 the standards for qualified teacher status will be strengthened to require teachers to know and comply with current legislation on the well-being of children and young people, to know and understand the role of others when dealing with children who have SEN or disabilities, and to communicate effectively with parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.2/3">The current induction standards require newly qualified teachers to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement. The standards also demand that they work collaboratively with both other teachers and specialists to ensure that provision is suitable for SEN pupils. The revised standards framework will reinforce, build on and strengthen the current standards surrounding SEN.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.2/4">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to discuss their own development needs in performance management reviews, and to address development priorities. This could include strengthening knowledge and understanding of SEN. Where schools have identified a need to strengthen knowledge and understanding of SEN, as a school improvement priority, this should be addressed through their school improvement and development plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.2/5">All schools receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. A wide variety of courses are available covering SEN, ranging from awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers and their schools to determine their own particular training and development needs. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.2/6">The Department's published SEN strategy, 'Removing Barriers to Achievement' recognised the importance of training and committed us to work closely with the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) to ensure that initial teacher training and programmes of continuing professional development provide a good grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN. We have commissioned the TDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trainee, newly qualified and established teachers. These initiatives are being implemented and evaluated over the period 2005-08 at a cost of approximately &pound;1.1 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.2/7">Ofsted will be undertaking a thematic review of the journey the intending teacher takes in terms of acquiring SEN and disability knowledge and skills during their initial training and induction. It is envisaged that the fieldwork for this will begin in September 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1167W.2/1">Student loans repayments are not transferred to the Student Loans Company. They reduce the net assets, representing outstanding loans, on the Department for Education and Skills balance sheet. It is only information about repayments made by individual borrowers that is passed to the Company to allow it to issue annual statements. Once that information is received by the Company, repayments are attributed to each month of the tax year in which they were made by the borrower and monthly interest is calculated accordingly. This ensures that even if there is a delay in repayment details reaching the Company, the borrower does not pay any additional interest. No borrower pays too much interest as a result of the time lag in updating their account and nor does the Department or the SLC gain any additional income from the interest paid.</p>
