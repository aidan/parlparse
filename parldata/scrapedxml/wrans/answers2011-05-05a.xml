	<p pid="a.859W.10/1">Churches play an important and often essential role in rural community life. As well as organising church-based activities and events, members of rural congregations take part in a wide range of other non-church community organisations, events and activities, contributing their time and skills to groups that help deliver the big society in rural places.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.10/2">A 2006 study carried out by the university of Coventry, &#8220;Faith in Rural Communities: contributions of social capital to community vibrancy&#8221;, looked at six different rural settlements and several different church denominations. It found that in several of the places studied church members made such a significant contribution to non-church activities and events that in many cases the community would cease to effectively function without their activities. Other research reports that explore the contribution of rural churches to rural community life include: &#8220;Faith in the Community&#8212;the contribution of faith-based organisations to rural voluntary action&#8221; (NCVO, 2007) and &#8220;Building Better Neighbourhoods&#8212;the contribution of faith communities to Oxfordshire Life&#8221; (university of Coventry, 2010).</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.10/3">Informal networks and relationships are among the most important contributions that rural church congregations make to rural community life. As well as offering regular opportunities for collective worship and prayer, rural church congregations can give care and support to those suffering isolation and loneliness. Church buildings often act as places where barriers are broken down between different social groups and people have the opportunity to meet together on equal terms, and provide spaces in which events, activities and meetings can take place. Though not all rural churches are suitable for the purpose, some already run formally constituted projects or initiatives, such as pre-schools, youth clubs or facilities for older residents. In some places the church building has been adapted to house specific services such as a SureStart centre, post office, a community owned shop or library.</p>

The Government keep these matters under review and the Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport remains in regular touch with the principal regulatory bodies in the media whose responsibility it is to ensure that matters of serious public concern continue to be addressed by their codes.</p>

	<p pid="a.868W.2/1">No. The purpose of allowances is to reimburse service personnel for justifiable expenditure incurred either when on duty or as a result of the unique nature of service life, rather than to supplement income. The current financial position has placed pressure on the level of allowances that are affordable. While there will be some reductions and changes, appropriate allowances will continue in the future. Operational allowances are not affected by these changes. We accept that changes to the allowances package will be unpopular and that some of them may require adjustments to lifestyle, but they are a necessary part of the Department's contribution to the overall Government's programme to reduce the UK deficit we inherited. Nevertheless, we have concentrated on ensuring, where possible, that no group is disproportionately affected by any changes, and have sought to mitigate effects by phasing in some changes by up to two years. The Service Chiefs of Staff and their Principal Personnel Officers have been fully engaged in this process.</p>

	<p pid="a.871W.5/4">Departments have been required to publish all new ICT tender documents over &#163;10,000 since last summer and we recently launched Contracts Finder to publish additionally procurement opportunities and awarded contracts.</p>

It is for the people of Yemen to determine their future. We recognise the urgency with which a political settlement in Yemen must be reached to avoid further violence and a deepening economic crisis.

Our officials have been working intensively alongside EU missions in Sana'a and European capitals to garner support for the latest initiative. Individual member states, including Italy, France, the Netherlands and Germany, have issued their own messages in support of faster progress to overcome Yemen's political impasse. We will continue to liaise with our EU counterparts to ensure further progress towards a democratic, peaceful and inclusive transitional process.</p>

	<p pid="a.883W.3/2">Officials in this Department and in the ERDF teams have worked closely together to align, where practical, the respective funds&#8217; bidding processes. Most ERDF programmes will be managing a simultaneous call for proposals to compliment the timing of the RGF&#8217;s second round, with the aim of encouraging applicants to maximise the available public resource. Applicants seeking to access ERDF will however need to comply with the application process and the ERDF specific project selection criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.884W.5/1">In 2006 the Department for Trade and Industry undertook a major study of work-life balance among British workplaces with five or more employees. The Third Work-Life Balance (WLB3) Employer Survey was designed to collect data on awareness, provision, take-up and demand in relation to work-life balance arrangements and on employers' perceptions of positive benefits and detrimental impacts arising from the provision of these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.5/2">The survey asked respondents about the effect flexible working practices had on employees and human resource management at their establishment. For each of six criteria, employers were asked whether they thought flexible working and leave arrangements had a positive, negative or no effect. Details are shown in a chart which will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.5/3">Over half of workplaces felt that flexible working had had a positive effect on employee relations and motivation and commitment at the workplace. Just over 40% felt the effect on recruitment, labour turnover and productivity had been positive while 38% perceived a positive effect on absenteeism.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.5/4">The 3rd Worklife Balance Survey surveyed both public and private sector organisation; however no specific assessment has been made of the benefits of flexible working on the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.895W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Darra Singh</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.5/3">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to reply to your questions asking what allowance Jobcentres make for genuine oversights in respect of non-attendance at jobseeker interviews; whether good character and previous history are taken into account; and what entitlement to benefit claimants have who fail to attend an interview due to an oversight but contact the jobcentre to rectify this within five working days. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.5/4">Jobcentre Plus is responsible for ensuring customers remain eligible to receive Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance (JSA). Under section 8 of the Jobseekers Act (1995) and Regulation 27A of the Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance Regulations (1996), customers who fail to attend an interview will be asked to explain in writing the reason for the failure. Where it is immediately clear that there was good cause for not attending their interview (for example the customer was at a job interview, or was attending a hospital appointment) then payment of Jobseekers Allowance continues unaffected. An oversight, in itself, would not normally be considered to be good cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.5/5">More complex cases are referred to a specialist Decision Maker who considers whether or not the customer had good cause for failing to attend. Jobcentre Plus Decision Makers act on behalf of the Secretary of State to make decisions on entitlement to benefit, using Social Security Legislation and established case law. They consider all the individual circumstances of the case on their merits when determining whether or not there was good cause for failure to attend and whether a sanction is applicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.5/6">Where the Decision Maker determines that the customer did not have good cause then a benefit reduction is imposed. If a person in a vulnerable group has been sanctioned access to a hardship payment is immediately available.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.5/7">An individual&#8217;s previous failure to attend history is taken into account when determining the length of the benefit reduction. The Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance Regulations provide that failure to attend an interview attracts a fixed period sanction of 1 week on the first occasion, rising to 2 weeks for the second, and each subsequent occasion during the same jobseeking period.</p>

It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example they do not include applications which were processed clerically and have not yet been entered on to the Social Fund Computer System. 2. Figures are for applications received, not for the number of people who made an application, and for initial awards made, not the number of people who received an initial award. (Some people made more than one application or received more than one initial award.) 3. If an applicant receives an initial award and this award is increased on first review in the same month as the initial award was made, then the Policy, Budget and Management Information System (PBMIS) does not count the initial award and the review award separately, but counts one award on the one application. However, if a first review award is made in a later month than the initial award, then PBMIS counts two awards on the one application. Similarly, if an initial or first review award is increased by the Independent Review Service, then all awards made in the same month on one application count as one award. However, if an initial award or any review award(s) on one application are made in different months, then PBMIS will count one award for each month in which an initial or review award was made. Because of this counting method, only the numbers of initial awards have been given. 4. Figures have been rounded to the nearest 100 and figures may not sum due to rounding. <i>Source</i>: DWP Social Fund Policy, Budget and Management Information System</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.900W.2/5">However, I am aware of a case in 2002, where a customer was allocated financial support to have tattoos removed. This was made possible as District Managers have the discretion to make funds available to provide additional support to help customers overcome things standing directly in the way of securing employment. This can be used where there are no alternative sources of funding. There is no automatic entitlement, but where an Adviser deems the removal of tattoos as necessary to facilitate the take-up of a specific job offer and the cost represents good value for taxpayer&#8217;s money, an award could be made. I envisage this only being in exceptional circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.902W.2/1">The Government have made a commitment that there will be no cash losers purely as a result of the move to universal credit. At the point of change a comparison will be made between current amount received in tax credits and/or benefits and the household entitlement under universal credit. If the universal credit entitlement is less, and no other circumstances have changed, a cash amount will be paid in order to make up the difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.902W.2/2">Details of this protection have yet to be fully worked out but we would expect future increases in universal credit entitlement to reduce the need for transitional protection. Estimates on a year-by-year basis during the transition period are not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.7/1">The impact on bank levy yield of such a change would be dependent upon the behavioural response of the levy payers, therefore it is not possible to assess the total yield.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.7/2">If the bank levy allowance of non-chargeable equity and liabilities was set at &#163;10 billion with a threshold triggering the application of the levy remaining at &#163;20 billion, a bank crossing the threshold would face an immediate tax charge of between &#163;3.75 million and &#163;7.5 million on the current rates of the bank levy. However, the exact charge on an individual institution would depend on the proportion of their taxable liabilities that were subject to the full and half rates for the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.7/3">As part of the consultation on the design of the levy, respondents were generally of the view that a threshold would create potent incentives for banks around the margin to structure their business in certain ways, or disincentives to grow, in order to avoid crossing the threshold. Indeed some argued that a threshold would probably not achieve any higher yield than an allowance because of these effects with consequent impact on both economic activity and other tax receipts, such as corporation tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.7/4">The Government's decision to set an allowance of &#163;20 billion instead of a &#163;20 billion threshold did not alter the overall expected levy yield, as the levy rates were determined after such design details were finalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.912W.8/1">The Government have announced a moratorium exempting micro-businesses and start-ups from new domestic regulation. The moratorium will apply for three years from April 2011. The intention of the moratorium is that it will apply to new initiatives in primary and secondary legislation made by Government. The Government will be publishing guidance on the application of the moratorium in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.8/2">The Financial Services Authority is an independent rule-making regulator with existing powers to make rules under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and therefore the moratorium will not automatically apply to rules it makes under these powers. Therefore it will be for the Financial Services Authority to decide whether not to apply new regulation to micro-businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.8/3">The FSA is clear that it has an obligation to assess the impact of its rules on business, including small businesses, and seek to make its rules proportionate. The FSA has announced in its 2011-12 business plan that, recognising the difficult economic circumstances for many firms, it is not planning any new initiatives under its Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 powers beyond those which were already under way.</p>

	<p pid="a.915W.3/1">The Department is due to publish four research reports relating to childhood delinquency on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-26">26 May 2011</phrase>. The reports will be published on the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.3/2"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk">www.education.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.915W.3/3">The first report is &#8216;Prevention and Reduction: A Review of Strategies for intervening Early to Prevent or Reduce Youth Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour&#8217; (by the Centre for Analysis of Youth Transitions). This report provides an overview of the key characteristics of &#8216;what works&#8217; to prevent or reduce crime and antisocial behaviour among children from age eight. The report will help commissioners to identify more effective early interventions to support vulnerable young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.3/4">The second report is &#8216;Monitoring and Evaluation of Intensive Intervention Projects for Young People&#8217; (by the National Centre for Social Research). These projects were based on an intensive family support model and addressed the problematic behaviours of young people with particularly complex needs. This report presents the overall numbers of young people working with the projects, a baseline assessment of their needs and details of the progress made.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.3/5">The third report also looks at the Intensive Intervention Projects and is a qualitative evaluation by Sheffield Hallam University. This report complements the National Centre report by providing longitudinal, in-depth case studies of 15 young people who worked with the projects, including the experiences of their parents and project workers. The report also provides a brief economic evaluation of the projects, which concludes that the intensive support model appears to represent good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.3/6">The final report is &#8216;Understanding Vulnerable Young People: Analysis from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England&#8217;. The report identifies young people experiencing six particular vulnerabilities at age 16 to 17, including: low attainment; teen parenthood; not being in education, employment or training; emotional health concerns; criminal activity; and substance misuse. The report explores how these issues overlap, including the related risk factors and outcomes at age 19 to 20. This research helps to estimate the potential numbers of vulnerable young people who are in most need of targeted, supportive interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.3/7">In 2010 the Independent Commission for Youth Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour reported their findings in &#8216;Time for a Fresh Start&#8217;. Background evidence for the Commission's work, including essays from a number of international experts, was published in the book &#8216;A New Response to Youth Crime&#8217;, edited by David J. Smith. These studies contribute to this wider evidence base.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.2/2">The national framework for personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education currently includes teaching primary school pupils about basic emergency procedures and where to get help; and secondary school pupils to develop the skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic first aid procedures, including, at ages 15-16, resuscitation techniques. These provide opportunities for children to learn how to act in an emergency to help others who are injured; ill, or otherwise in danger. External expert organisations such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance support schools in teaching about first aid and dealing with emergency situations.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.5/1">The Department has a limited amount of evidence on this issue from evaluations of the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme. This programme was promoted by the then Department for Children, Schools and Families to support the development of children's emotional intelligence. The coalition Government wants to place more trust in school staff to drive improvement and exercise their professional judgment over which approach they adopt and has therefore ceased promoting this particular programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/2">A national evaluation of SEAL in secondary schools conducted by Manchester University, published by the Department in October 2010, found that SEAL failed to impact significantly upon pupils' social and emotional skills, general mental health difficulties, pro-social behaviour or behaviour problems. The evaluation can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="a.924W.6/1">There is no direct information on this. However, as part of their evaluation of the four national health service 111 pilot sites, the university of Sheffield will shortly publish their interim report. A copy will be made available in the Library. This will contain data on the proportion of people who call NHS 111 who are recommended to attend an accident and emergency department, the proportion of people who call NHS 111 for whom an ambulance is dispatched and the total number of calls to NHS 111.</p>

In addition, under the proposals for GP commissioning, there will be a duty to improve continuously the quality of services and outcomes for patients.

	<p pid="a.931W.8/1">The White Paper, &#8220;Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health&#8221; in England, sets out the Government's vision for public health, including the creation of a new public health service&#8212;Public Health England&#8212;with a renewed focus on disease prevention, health protection and improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.8/2">The Government have reinforced their commitment to tackling the preventable causes of ill-health by announcing its intention to give local authorities ring-fenced public health budgets to improve the health of their local population. A new health premium will reward progress on specific public health outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.8/3">The Government are taking a number of actions in order to provide the public with the information and support they need to make healthy choices and lead healthier lives. The Change4Life campaign still helps influence and shift behaviours around diet and physical activity, by giving families helpful advice on eating well and being more active. More than 1 million mothers say they have made changes as a result of the Change4Life campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.8/4">The National Child Measurement Programme enables and encourages families to make healthier lifestyle choices by routinely providing parents, whose children have been weighed and measured, with feedback on their child's height, weight and body mass index centile, alongside advice on healthy eating, physical activity and local weight management services.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.8/5">The introduction of Out of Home Calorie Labelling, as one of the pledges of the Public Responsibility Deal, is also intended to empower people to make healthier choices more often, specifically when eating out.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.8/6">The Department has also been working with the four United Kingdom chief medical officers to develop revised UK-wide physical activity guidelines. These guidelines are primarily aimed at policy makers and health professionals. However as they provide information on the types and amounts of physical activity for health benefits, when incorporated into existing campaigns and messages they will help individuals to take personal responsibility for their health and well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.8/7">All healthcare professionals have a responsibility to ensure that they make every contact with patients/the public count. This should include highlighting the impact of people's lifestyle choices and their health and wellbeing, as well as providing advice and support on how they can change these behaviours.</p>

The Department recommended in the &#8220;Consultation on a Strategy for Services for Chronic Respiratory Disease (COPD) in England&#8221; published in February 2010 that all people with acute respiratory failure should be offered treatment with non-invasive ventilation with access to mechanical ventilation, if required.</p>

	<p pid="a.937W.6/1">The number of animals used for the testing of substances used in household products in the United Kingdom is low. The Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, published annually, record that in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 (the most recent year for which we have figures) the numbers used in this category of testing were, respectively, 234, 272, 111, 0, 1, 132 and 0. The coalition agreement includes a commitment to end the testing of household products on animals and we are working on a strategy to deliver this commitment. We have held discussions with manufacturers, contract research organisations and the European Union Institute for Health and Consumer Products in connection with this work.</p>

	<p pid="a.938W.2/1">Following the report of Phase 1 of the independent review of the criminal records regime, measures have been included within the Protection of Freedoms Bill to increase the portability of Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) disclosures. This will enable employers to check whether any new information has come to light since a previous disclosure was issued. The review has not looked at specific occupations, but increased portability will be available to all those who apply for enhanced CRB disclosures, including dentists.</p>
