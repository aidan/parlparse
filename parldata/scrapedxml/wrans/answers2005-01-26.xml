	<p pid=".332W.5/1">No research has been commissioned in respect of air launched cluster munitions as they are gradually being withdrawn from service over the next five years. Recent statistics show an overall failure rate which is in line with expectations. For Ground Launched systems, the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is due to be replaced by the future GMLRS Area Effects Munition (AEM) with a planned in service date of early 2007. The new system has bomblets fitted with a self destruct faze giving a failure rate of less than 1 per cent. Whilst the Shell 155mm HE L20A1 Extended Range Bomblet Shell (ERBS) has a maximum failure rate of 2 per cent. at the 95 per cent. Confidence LeveL The bomblet fuze has a self destruct mechanism. Analysis shows that for a significant percentage of likely targets the bomblet remains the most effective munition.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.2/1">We do envisage a level playing field for intra-EU aviation flights and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. As outlined in the 2003 Air Transport White Paper, &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, the Government are actively pursuing the inclusion of intra-EU aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and progress on this policy will be a priority for the UK Presidency of the EU in 2005. If the UK is successful, it is hoped that intra-EU aviation could be included within the second phase of the Scheme, from 2008 or soon after.</p>
	<p pid=".337W.2/2">Dealing with all matters maritime, including emissions from ships, is a competence at IMO (the International Maritime Organisation). The nature of international shipping is such that it needs to be treated very differently to all other modes of transport. This is important, as most ships are registered outside of the EU (e.g. Panama). We continue to lobby member states of the IMO to tackle this issue. To date this has met with little success, as the political discussions surrounding environment issues are often blocked outright.</p>

	<p pid=".338W.8/1">Aerosol pollution cools the climate and partially offsets some of the warming due to greenhouse gases but we don't know with certainty by how much. Defra's Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre has been investigating the impacts of aerosol on climate change and the risks of acceleration of climate change for some time. Good climate models already include the effects of aerosol and look at how climate change could be affected if the whole range of uncertainty in aerosol is included in model calculations. The result is an increase to the uncertainty range of climate sensitivity both globally and in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.8/2">The climate change could therefore be greater than previously thought, with changes in global temperature of up to10&deg;C by 2100, compared to 6&deg;C as represented by the IPCC. However, this is based on the highest emissions scenario, so should be seen as being at the extreme end of the projected range of future climate change.</p>

The conclusions of this work, including provisional data for 2004, are due for publication in the next two months.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.6/2">There are no general requirements for such spillages to be reported, although the Environment Agency (EA) encourages their reporting and has an emergency hotline for this purpose. In addition, the water companies are required to notify the Drinking Water Inspectorate of any incident which affects drinking water quality or where there may be a risk to consumers' health. This includes all instances of chemical contamination including oil leakage/spillage.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.6/3">The EA has the power to serve a Works Notice in order to prevent the immediate threat of water pollution or to ensure that remedial action is taken following an incident. However, in most cases, the necessary action is secured without recourse to the formal issuing of a notice.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.6/4">The estimated cost of such incidents to public funds is not readily available. However, the EA expects to be able to provide some indicative costs at the same time as the incident data.</p>

The Government of Israel needs to ease the system of restrictions on the movement of people and goods imposed since the beginning of the &quot;intifada&quot;. The Palestinian Authority also needs to invigorate its programme of governance reforms in order to create an internal environment more attractive to private investors. The UK is working closely with international partners on both these issues. Economic issues will be a key theme of the London meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase>. This will be an opportunity to support the new Palestinian leadership in strengthening its institutional capacity and will also help stimulate progress on the Road Map towards a settlement which will allow the Palestinian economy to grow again.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.3/1">In England, there are five areas where older people (men and women aged 60 and over) are offered free concessionary travel on local bus services. These are the London boroughs, Merseyside, Crawley, Redditch and Thurrock. Reading and the West Midlands offer free local bus travel to residents aged 65 and over. Free local bus travel is also offered by Bournemouth and Plymouth to residents aged 80 and over and by Rossendale to residents aged 90 and over.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.3/2">We estimate that 1.96 million older people are eligible for free bus travel in these areas, representing 18.9 per cent. of older people in England. The remaining 8.42 million older people in England are entitled to at least the statutory half-fare minimum requirement on bus services, with no charge for the pass, though local authorities can offer more generous schemes and many provide concessions between half fares and free travel, such as flat fares. There are 9.19 million pensioners in England (men aged 65 and over, women aged 60 and over) of which 1.79 million are eligible for free local bus travel. This represents 19.4 per cent. of pensioners in England.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.3/3">Some other authorities offer the choice of free travel with a charge for the annual concessionary travel pass as an alternative to the statutory minimum half fare with a free annual pass. Some local authorities also extend their concessionary fare schemes to cover other forms of public transport&mdash;including the free schemes in the London boroughs, Merseyside, and Crawley and the partially free scheme in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.3/4">Figures are based on Office of National Statistics 2003 population estimates.</p>

	<p pid=".348W.5/21">Overall the decrease in costs from 2002&ndash;03 to 2003&ndash;04 is 4 per cent. although the figures for costs alone can be misleading if not placed within the wider context of changes in unit price, areas measured, levels of consumption and improved record keeping. The DfT estate comprises some 1,680 properties of varying size, use and nature of occupation and is therefore not possible to make any comprehensive or definitive statements about energy cost changes on such a diverse estate, which may be attributable to these and other factors.</p>
	<p pid=".348W.5/22">Increases and decreases in unit charges and area occupied can also mask efforts to improve energy efficiency so a better measure of performance is consumption at those properties where energy monitoring is both possible and carried out where the overall usage was down 2.2 per cent. over the same period. For more details on consumption I would refer the hon.

	<p pid=".350W.15/1">The UK has played a key role in both the International Maritime Organisation (MO) and the EU in negotiating an acceleration of a programme to phase out single hull tankers from world trade, while ensuring continuity of energy supply. The IMO has recently agreed to an accelerated programme, under which the large majority of single hull tankers will have been phased out by the end of 2010. Single hull tankers which will be under 25 years of age at the end of 2010 will be allowed to continue in service until the end of 2015, or on reaching age 25 if earlier, but only if they first pass a rigorous assessment of their condition. Based on the IMO agreement, there is a EU Regulation, now in force, which prohibits single hull tankers entering or leaving EU ports and anchorages when carrying heavy grades of oil as cargo.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.15/2">The United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, to which the UK acceded in 1997, gives rights of innocent passage though territorial waters for ships which comply with internationally agreed standards governing their construction and use, which includes single hull tankers which have yet to reach their phase out date. Secretary of State has no powers to curtail such rights, which benefit UK ships when participating in world trade.</p>

	<p pid=".357W.2/1">The Operational Programme of the Council for 2005 submitted by the incoming Luxembourg and United Kingdom Presidencies and based on the Multi-Annual Strategic Programme for 2004&ndash;06 sets out priority areas of work in all policy areas, including education, youth and culture. A copy of the Annual Operation Programme for 2005 is available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".357W.2/2">The focus of the programme is on the on-going handling of EU business. What will fall to the UK Presidency depends on the progress made by the Council, European Parliament and Commission under the Luxembourg Presidency. The programme reflects the main UK Presidency objectives and provides the basis for us to take forward our priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".357W.2/3">Key issues for the UK Presidency generally are likely to include progressing the delivery of the Lisbon agenda of more and better jobs, sustainable economic growth and greater competitiveness. In the Education part of the Council, we will aim to make good progress on the proposed new Integrated Lifelong Learning programme 2007&ndash;13. We will also begin work on the preparation of a report to the 2006 Spring European Council on the implementation of the detailed work programme 2010 for education and training systems agreed at Barcelona in spring 2002. In the Youth part of the Council, we will continue our negotiations on the Youth in Action programme for 2007&ndash;13. In the Culture and Audiovisual part of the Council, we will seek to move towards agreement on the proposed new culture programmes (2007&ndash;13) and the new Media programmes (2007&ndash;13). We will also seek to make progress on priority initiatives flowing from the new Culture Council work plan, in particular those on digitisation of cultural heritage and mobility of museum collections. In addition, we will take forward the preparatory work for a review of the Television without Frontiers (&quot;TVWF&quot;) directive.</p>

	<p pid=".364W.2/1">The Government do not provide guidelines specifying how much time non-resident parents should have with their children. The Government believe that children benefit from a meaningful relationship with both parents following divorce or separation, where it is safe to do so. The Children Act 1989 supports this and, most importantly, it makes the welfare of the child concerned, rather than the rights of the parents, its paramount consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.2/2">In 2002 the Government published the Parenting Plans which contained a checklist of issues for parents to consider in making contact arrangements. We are currently developing a new edition of the Plans. The new Parenting Plans will contain a set of templates which seek to show parents the sort of contact arrangements that work well for children of different ages and who are living in a range of circumstances. They will describe, in practical terms, arrangements that are generally beneficial for children. They are intended to be used as practical aids, both by parents themselves and by solicitors, conciliators and mediators, to help parents to reach reasonable agreements. These will be made widely in solicitors' offices as well as through advice and mediation services.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.6/1">16 to 19-year-olds attend a range of establishments&mdash;schools, FE colleges, work-based learning providers. There is some harmonisation of the data collected&mdash;which allows the Department to report on participation rates. However, that harmonisation does not stretch to analyses about learners migrating into and out of LEA and LSC areas.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.6/2">As the information regarding 16 to 19-year-olds who attend maintained secondary schools with sixth forms is contained in a number of large tables, I have placed the tables in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.6/3">Additionally, it is possible to analyse LSC funded Further Education by migration across boundaries.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.6/4">This is a matter for the Learning and Skills Council. I have therefore asked Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, to write to the hon. Gentleman with the information requested and to place a copy of his reply in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".366W.2/1">Before the introduction of the Education Act 2002 the number of each category of school governor on a school's governing body was fixed according to the type and size of school.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.2/2">Governing bodies can now choose their own size and the proportion of membership of the various stakeholder groups with an interest in the school: parents, staff, the local authority, the community, and the school's foundation body if it has one; in accordance with guiding principles. In all categories of maintained schools parents must constitute at least one third of the total governing body membership. This compares favourably with the proportion of governors of maintained schools required to be parents in 1997. The Academies programme was launched in March 2000 and the first Academies opened in 2002. Academies have different governance arrangements to maintained schools. Their Funding Agreements have required that at least one parent governor is represented on the Governing Body.</p>

I am going to reply, as I have ministerial responsibility for student support, to explain that this is now administered through a new system called &quot;Protocol&quot;, aimed at improving the administration of the system and in particular streamlining the application and assessment process. However, as with any new system, there were initial difficulties to overcome and we are now reviewing with the Student Loans Company what worked well and what could be improved.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.11/1">Botox is the trade name for one of the products containing botulinum toxin. International and UK regulations concerning safety and efficacy of medicines require testing for botulinum toxin products at various stages of their processing, from harvesting through to marketing as a finished product for use as a prescription only medicine.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.11/2">The Home Office and all others concerned with conducting and regulating such testing are committed to moving to less severe testing procedures as soon as it becomes practicable to do so. The laboratories involved in ensuring that botulinum toxin products</p>
	<p pid=".377W.11/3">are safe for therapeutic use (the only use for which animal tests are licensed) are already gaining expertise in non-animal methods to this end.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.11/4">The European Pharmacopoeia states that the potency of the toxin as a reconstituted product is determined by an LD50 assay in mice (the reference method), or by a method validated with respect to the LD50 assay. Unfortunately there is at present no accepted and validated alternative to the LD50 test for determining the potency of botulinum toxin at the production stage. Other methods, including an in vitro test, can additionally be employed, and are being used, for example when confirmatory assay of potency is needed.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.11/5">Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 only the test method which causes the least animal suffering, while achieving the scientific objective, can be licensed in the UK. This means that in vitro tests must be used wherever possible and, when there is no non-animal alternative, animal suffering must be minimised by use of the mildest procedures available. Conditions on project licences require this, so that when a less severe validated alternative to the LD50 test becomes available, it must be used.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.0/1">The Home Office Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU) produces Country Reports on the 20 countries that generate the largest number of asylum applications in the UK. They are issued twice a year, at the end of April and October and are published on the Home Office website. The reports are used by Home Office officials involved in the asylum and human rights determination process.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.0/2">The reports are compiled from a wide variety of well respected, independent and publicly available sources. These sources include intergovernmental organisations (such as the UN), governmental sources (including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) and human rights organisations (for example Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch). All information in each report is attributed, throughout the text, to the original source material. The Country Reports do not contain any Home Office opinion or policy&mdash;they are essentially a compilation of material produced by other organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.0/3">We are firmly committed to ensuring that the country information material produced to inform asylum decisions meets the highest standards. Under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, we have established the independent Advisory Panel on Country Information (APCI) to provide rigorous independent external scrutiny of country information material produced by the Home Office and make recommendations to help ensure that it is of the highest quality. The APCI is proving to be very effective in fulfilling its function.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.8/1">The new biometric passports (ePassports) will have a chip that is to be read by readers located at airports. While all ePassports should conform to a number of international standards, there remains room for interpretation, and thus there will be differences in the way the passports are presented to, and read by, the readers. The time taken to read an ePassport will therefore depend upon the nationality of the ePassport presented and the make/model of the scanner to which it is presented. Trials to assess the interoperability of nations' ePassports and candidate readers are being conducted by some 20 nations. UKPS is fully involved in these. In addition we will be conducting our own tests in UK on a variety of ePassport/reader combinations.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.8/2">Until satisfactory interoperability can be demonstrated between UK preferred readers and a range of ePassports from other nations, the time to check biometric passports at UK airports cannot be accurately determined. However, current test results indicate that the average reading time is likely to fall in the range 7&ndash;10 seconds. It is difficult to make direct and meaningful comparison with non-biometric passport checks since this depends on the actual processes involved.</p>

PMI initially advised the Immigration Nationality Directorate (IND) that the timescale was not feasible but, after discussion, it was agreed that tenders would be issued to provide the first centre at Yarl's Wood. If the marketplace in general came back with the answer that the timescale for the programme was impossible re-assessment would have to be made. In the process, tenders returned documents offering to complete the project within the required timescale by adopting a modular building solution.

Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

For example, since May 1997, claimant unemployment has fallen by 55 per cent., long-term unemployment has fallen by 87 per cent. and long-term youth unemployment has been eliminated, having fallen from 125 in May 1997 to 0 in December 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.6/1">I attended ECOFIN in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.6/2">The Presidency briefly introduced its work programme, emphasising its three priorities: Lisbon Mid-Term Review, Reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and negotiation of the Financial Perspectives 2007&ndash;13. The Commission welcomed the work programme.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.6/3">Further to discussions between Foreign Ministers at the extraordinary meeting of the General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-07">7 January</phrase>, ECOFIN discussed the economic consequences of the South-Asian Tsunami. The Commission noted that the macroeconomic consequences of the Tsunami are likely to be contained, although with significant differences across affected countries. Worst hit in macroeconomic terms are likely to be the Maldives and Sri Lanka. EU financial support could be up to 1.5 billion euros, which will include 100 million euros in humanitarian aid, 350 million euros in reconstruction aid and a proposed EIB loan facility of up to 1 billion euros guaranteed by the EC budget. The size and structure of the facility have yet to be decided and will be dependent on the outcome of the needs assessment being carried out by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The UK emphasised the challenge of long-term reconstruction, and stressed the importance of completing the needs assessment before deciding the terms of the EIB package. The Presidency said they would return to this at the February ECOFIN.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.6/4">ECOFIN noted Presidency conclusions for France and Germany. The Council reviewed measures taken by Greece to correct its excessive deficit. Greece pointed to continued reforms on both the expenditure and revenues sides of the budget. The Commission noted that despite this corrective action by the Greek government, this was still insufficient for Greece to correct its excessive deficit in 2005. The Council conclusions were approved without discussion, and the 104(8) decision, that Greece has not taken effective action to correct its excessive deficit in line with its convergence programme, was adopted.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.6/5">The Commission noted that Hungary has exceeded its deficit target for 2004 by 1 percentage point, and that the same outcome was likely for 2005. It recommended that Hungary, in line with article 104(8), had not taken effective action to correct its excessive deficit in line with its convergence programme. Council conclusions and an article 104(8) decision with respect to Hungary were adopted without further discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.6/6">As regards the excessive deficit procedures against the new member states, the Commission confirmed that the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Cyprus and Malta were in line with the targets set by their convergences programmes. Council opinions on the stability programmes of Austria, Luxembourg, Sweden and Netherlands and on the convergence programme of the Czech Republic were adopted without discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.6/7">Discussion of Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) reform options took place, on both the preventative and the corrective arm of the SGP. The UK highlighted that proper account needed to be taken of the economic cycle, of debt sustainability and of public investment.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.6/8">The Council endorsed the Annual Report on Structural reforms 2005, prepared by the Economic Policy Committee (EPC), which focussed on employment and growth as a core priority. The Council agreed to forward it as a contribution by the Council to the Spring 2005 European Council.</p>

	<p pid=".410W.0/2">As with all medicines, the safety of human insulins is monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with independent expert advice from the committee on safety of medicines (CSM). All information on the safety of these products is evaluated as it becomes available.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.0/3">Insulin glargine (Lantus) is a long acting insulin licensed throughout the European Union. As with all new medicines, it is currently under intensive monitoring by the MHRA and the CSM. Prescribers are asked to report through the yellow card scheme all suspected adverse reactions for products under intensive monitoring, which are identified by an inverted black triangle symbol in the British National Formulary. When reports are received they are added to the database of adverse drug reactions. All reports of serious adverse drug reactions are evaluated by a member of the professional staff of the MHRA with particular responsibility for that product. These reports are then discussed in the context of all reports for the product at a weekly meeting of professional medical and scientific staff of the MHRA to identify any new safety issues.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.0/4">A total of 142 reports of suspected adverse reactions were reporting through the Yellow Card Scheme in association with all human insulins in 2003. The most common adverse drug reactions reported related to decreases or increases in blood sugar, headache, injection site reaction and pruritis (itching).</p>
	<p pid=".410W.0/5">In 2000, the CSM's sub-committee on Pharmacovigilance (SCOP) considered a systematic review of the literature on the safety of human insulins (Airey et al Diabetic Medicine 2000). A total of 52 randomised controlled trials were identified, in addition to 56 studies of other designs and case reports. The SCOP advised that although some patients have experienced problems on transferring to human insulin and are better suited to animal derived insulins, there is no clear evidence of safety problem specific to human insulin. This advice was communicated to prescribers in an article in the drug safety bulletin, &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot; in September 2000. In 2002, SCOP considered a review of human insulin versus animal insulin in people with diabetes mellitus published by the Cochrane Library. This review included randomised controlled trials of at least one month in duration until May 2002. No significant differences in metabolic control or hypoglycaemic episodes between various insulin species could be elucidated. The patient information leaflets for insulins provide detailed information about the risk of hypoglycaemia and the advice on action to take should it occur.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.2/2">We have no plans to change the residential charging arrangements relating to the savings element of pension credit. Those people in residential care receiving &pound;4.65 or less savings credit have all of their award disregarded when the local authority assesses what they can afford to pay for their care. In addition, care home residents with weekly incomes so great that they do not qualify for savings credit also receive a savings disregard of &pound;4.65. Only where a resident has an award above &pound;4.65 is the amount above &pound;4.65 taken into account in their assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.2/3">This solution ensures that the receipt of savings credit by care home residents does not create an anomaly in the system of care home charges.

	<p pid=".416W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/2">The Government's teenage pregnancy and wider sexual health strategies reflect the complex reasons behind England's high rate of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Key aspects of the Government's response to these issues are:</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/3" class="indent">information campaigns highlighting: the importance of under-16s delaying sexual activity (evidence tells us that delay results in lower rates of regret and improved contraception use); resisting peer pressure to engage in early sexual activity; and&mdash;for young people who are sexually active&mdash;the importance of using condoms to protect against unplanned pregnancies and STIs. This final message is reinforced through the Department of Health's sexual health campaign which, as highlighted in the recent Public Health White Paper, will be expanded, with an emphasis on reaching young people and other hard to reach groups;</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/4" class="indent">support for parents to help them discuss sex and relationship issues with their children (which is proven to result in more openness, later first sex and better contraception use);</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/5" class="indent">improving both the quality of sex and relationships education in schools and out of school settings, and young people's access to contraception and sexual health advice services in community settings and general practice;</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/6" class="indent">provision of enhanced support to teenage parents, to provide a pathway out of social exclusion, in particular through re-engagement in education and training; and better partnership working between local health and education partners through the &quot;Healthy Schools&quot; programme and the establishment of Teenage Pregnancy Partnership Boards in each top tier local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/7">This multi-faceted approach was recommended in the Social Exclusion Unit's report on teenage pregnancy, published in 1999, The plan reflects the best international evidence of what works in reducing teenage pregnancies and supporting teenage parents. A subsequent review by the Health Development Agency in 2003, confirmed the evidence base for the strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/8">Between 1998 (the baseline year for the teenage pregnancy strategy) and 2002 (the latest year for which data are available) the rate of under-18 conceptions has fallen by 8.6 per cent. and the rate of under-16 conceptions by 11.2 per cent. The proportion of teenage parents engaged in education, employment or training has increased from 23.1 per cent. (average for 1997&ndash;99) to 29.7 per cent. (average for 2002&ndash;04).</p>

A vacancy currently exists for a Centre Director, which is being filled on an acting basis by a senior haematologist, but this has no direct impact on the service to patients.</p>

This is provided for in UN Security Council resolution 1528 (2004). With UNOCI, French forces have helped preserve the peace by maintaining the zone of confidence separating the two sides, and have helped restore order after the recent violence; we value their continued support of UNOCI.</p>

	<p pid=".430W.7/1">Antisocial behaviour response courts are magistrates courts, which have a particular focus in dealing with antisocial behaviour cases as effectively as possible, in co-operation with local agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.7/2" class="indent">The key features of antisocial behaviour response courts are:</p>
	<p pid=".430W.7/3" class="indent">Dealing with cases swiftly and efficiently;</p>
	<p pid=".430W.7/4" class="indent">Providing high-level witness care;</p>

	<p pid=".430W.7/7" class="indent">Identifying an individual with specific responsibility for co-ordinating the courts' response; and</p>
	<p pid=".430W.7/8" class="indent">Holding specialist sessions, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.7/9">Within this framework, it is a matter for local management to decide how the courts should operate in their areas.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.7/10">Antisocial behaviour response courts were originally established in summer 2004 in 12 areas, including Merseyside. The location of these courts was chosen to link up with the appointment of specialist Crown Prosecutors in these areas. Since then antisocial behaviour response courts have been identified across England and Wales. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-21">21 January 2004</phrase> Lord Falconer announced the identification of the 100th antisocial behaviour response court. Lessons learned from the original 12 courts have also been circulated to courts across England and Wales, to ensure that all courts are aware of best practice in their handling of ASB cases.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.7/11">Further antisocial behaviour response courts will be identified in areas where there is a need.</p>
