	<p pid=".377W.3/2">The joint Environment Agency and HSE investigation surrounding the fire of October 2000 is principally complete. However, the agency is undertaking excavations beneath concreted areas at the site to investigate allegations that hazardous waste was buried below the transfer station in the early 1990s. Excavations at the site commenced in mid March. Given the co-operation of the company, the agency expect to complete the excavations and associated investigations next month. In the light of which we will make a decision on whether or not to hold a public inquiry.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.6/1">&quot;Waste Strategy 2000&quot; announced challenging targets to increase the amount of municipal waste recycled and composted in England and Wales. These targets are:</p>
	<p pid=".377W.6/2" class="indent">To recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005</p>
	<p pid=".377W.6/3" class="indent">To recycle or compost at least 30 per cent. of household waste by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.6/4">To ensure that local authorities contribute to achieving these targets, the Government have set Statutory Performance Standards for recycling and composting for individual authorities. These can be found in the Government's &quot;Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies&quot;, published in March 2001. Copies are available in the House of Commons Library and from the DEFRA website: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ waste/management/guidance/mwms/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".377W.6/5">The Government have increased funding for the Environmental Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) block, which includes waste management, by &pound;1.1 billion over the SR2000 period. There is also a ring-fenced fund of &pound;140 million for local authority recycling and &pound;220 million for waste Private Finance Initiative projects over the same period. Councils will also benefit from the &pound;40 million to the Waste and Resources Action Programme to overcome market barriers to reuse and recycling of waste.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.6/6">Following a recent consultation on the &pound;140 million fund, DEFRA has opted for a selective distribution. At the end of March this year we issued guidelines and formally invited applications from local authorities. These guidelines can be downloaded from the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/wastefund/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/wastefund/ index.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.0/1">The Government set out its targets for safeguarding people's health and protecting the environment from air pollution in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in 1997 and revised in January 2000. It includes health-based standards for eight pollutants of main concern and objectives for their achievement between 2003 and 2008 together with objectives to be met by 2000 for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems. Good progress has been made towards achieving most of the targets as a result of the measures put in place by central Government and local authorities. We are, for example, broadly on track to meet our policy objectives for carbon monoxide, benzene, 1,3 butadiene, lead and sulphur dioxide, but we will need to do more to meet our targets for nitrogen dioxide, particles and ozone. We have met the objectives for vegetation and ecosystems. The strategy is kept under continuous review and last year we consulted on proposals to tighten several of the current objectives and to add a further objective.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.0/2">The Government have successfully negotiated and adopted various agreements, both with our partners in Europe and internationally, which will reduce emissions of harmful substances to the air. We are committed to meeting all of the mandatory limit values prescribed by EU legislation. To comply with the EC Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) the UK Government passed the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) regulations which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-01">1 August 2000</phrase>, under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999. Separate arrangements apply the IPPC Directive to Scotland, Northern Ireland and the offshore oil and gas industries.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.0/3">IPPC applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of industrial activities. Emissions to aid, water (including discharge to sewer) and land, plus a range of other environmental effects (including noise, vibration and odour) must be considered together. IPPC aims to conserve energy, prevent emissions and waste production and, where not practicable, reduce them to acceptable levels. IPPC also takes the integrated approach beyond the initial task of permitting, through to the restoration of sites when industrial activities cease.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.0/4">On resource productivity the Government commissioned a major study headed by the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit. Its recent report, &quot;Resource Productivity: Making more with less&quot;, identifies the scope for significant environmental and business benefits. We are committed to following up the report, which includes recommendations on establishing a long-term strategy with indicative targets, policy to encourage innovation in sustainable technologies, and action to integrate sustainable development objectives with the business of Government procurement.</p>

SCIMAC's agronomist will provide their rationale for recommended herbicide usage in the GM part of each study field. Farmers will provide a report of actual herbicide use in both the GM and non-GM parts of each study field. All this information will be submitted to the independent research consortium carrying out the FSE study, thereby allowing a comparison of the agronomist's advice with actual herbicide usage and thus substantiating whether or not cost-effective weed control has been met.</p>

The independent team carry out the FSE research audit as to whether cost-effective weed control has been practised by analysing herbicide application records, the weed burden at each trial site and records of crop yield. My Department does not have this management data, but it is planned to make relevant details publicly available at the end of the FSE programme when the research results are published. I can confirm that glufosinate ammonium is the only herbicide being used on the GM maize in the FSE trials.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.2/1">The UK was one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The convention is implemented throughout the European Community through EU regulations by means of a system of licensing, to ensure that any trade is carried out at levels which species populations can sustain. Populations of endangered species and levels of trade are under continuous review, and the degree of protection afforded to particular species (which can include a complete ban on all trade) can be changed as a result.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/2">Specimens of some endangered species command high prices on the illegal market. There is a huge incentive to evade trade controls and examples of illegal imports which have been intercepted by HM Customs and Excise are well-documented. It is difficult to assess the full scale of the illegal wildlife trade and thus the impact on species conservation, but reports published by the CITES Secretariat, Interpol, and by respected scientists and other conservation experts show that these are matters which we must continue to take very seriously indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/3">The UK has a good record of CITES enforcement. HM Customs and Excise Wildlife and Endangered Species Officers (including the internationally respected CITES Enforcement Team at Heathrow airport) and Police Wildlife Liaison Officers are at the sharp end of wildlife law enforcement and work with great commitment and determination. This has led to a number of successful prosecutions, including one resulting in a custodial sentence of six and a half years for the illegal import of certain birds. The Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime&mdash;a multi agency organisation comprising the main Government Departments, statutory enforcement agencies and voluntary organisations with an interest in wildlife law enforcement issues&mdash;works hard to support the networks of police and customs officers at the strategic level. In addition, our major information campaign &quot;Souvenir Alert&quot; increases awareness of CITES controls among the general public. The campaign is aimed at tourists who may unwittingly bring back from their travels souvenirs made from endangered species. Over the past six months we have distributed a quarter of a million leaflets publicising the campaign, which has attracted considerable media and public interest.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/4">Our work to combat the illegal wildlife trade took a significant step forward on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-22">22 April</phrase>, when I announced the establishment of the National Wildlife Criminal Intelligence Unit. The unit, which will be part of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, is well placed to make a real difference in countering organised wildlife crime at a national and international level.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/5">Wildlife criminals are finding ever more sophisticated ways of avoiding detection. The unit will be using equally sophisticated techniques to track down, prosecute and punish these criminals.</p>

	<p pid=".386W.3/2">The UK Climate Change Programme and Third National Communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change were published in November 2000 and October 2001 respectively. These set out the policies by which the UK will meet its Kyoto commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. relative 1990 levels over the period 2008&ndash;2012, and move towards our domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide relative to 1990 by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".386W.3/3">Actual emissions in 1997 were estimated to be 152.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC), or about 7 per cent. below the level in 1990. In 2000 (the most recent year for which final data are available) carbon dioxide had fallen by a further 0.4 MtC, but provisional 2001 data show an increase of 1.9 MtC. This increase reflects higher power station emissions (plus 4.1 MtC relative to 1997), colder outside temperatures (plus 2.1 MtC) and trends elsewhere in the economy (minus 4.2 MtC). The increase in power station emissions is due to gas price fluctuations, and colder outside temperatures increased demand on space heating requirements. We do not expect longer term trends to be affected, particularly since trends elsewhere in the economy are tending to reduce emissions. Our estimated reductions set out in the UK Climate Change Programme and the Third National Communication are therefore unchanged.</p>

	<p pid=".387W.2/2">No such grants are available centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.2/3">There are statutory requirements for the provision of noise insulation in specified circumstances, in respect of noise from various sources. Under the Noise Insulation Regulations 1975 the appropriate highway authority will provide insulation in the form of secondary glazing to the windows and glazed doors, of dwellings and other buildings used for residential purposes, or payment of grants for this purpose, where such properties are not more than 300 m from the nearest point of a new highway, including an additional carriageway added to an existing highway, or an alteration affecting the line or level of an existing highway. The provision of insulation or grant is subject to there being an increase, or expected increase, in noise on the fa&ccedil;ade of the property attributable to the traffic on the new or altered highway from that prevailing before construction started, provided this is above a prescribed level.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.2/4">Under the Noise Insulation (Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems) Regulations 1996 an authority responsible for constructing a new railway, tramway or other guided transport system, or for adding to an existing system, has a similar duty to provide insulation for dwellings and other buildings used for residential purposes, or to pay grant for that purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.2/5">Similar statutory schemes have been made under s79 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, and previous powers, requiring provision of noise insulation in respect of aircraft noise at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. At other airports, noise insulation may be provided on a voluntary basis or in accordance with planning conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.2/6">Noise insulation schemes under any of these statutory provisions are subject to qualifying dates: they are not open-ended.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.2/7">Local housing authorities could consider whether it would be appropriate to award a discretionary Home Repair Assistance grant to private home owners and tenants for noise insulation. The Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002, if enacted, will provide authorities with a new general power which they could also use to this end.</p>

	<p pid=".398W.2/1">The East Lancashire Housing Forum submitted in December 2001 a proposed programme to tackle the problem of low demand and abandoned housing in the area. The Government is considering the proposal in the context of the spending review, along with the proposal from various northern housing bodies for a housing market renewal fund.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-10">10 April</phrase> that nine areas where the problems of low demand housing are most acute, of which East Lancashire is one, were being invited to work with Government to establish pathfinder projects to tackle low demand. Their aim will be to provide lasting solutions for communities blighted by derelict homes through investment and innovation. They will do this by developing a strategic approach for regenerating their sub-regional housing markets that will bring together key stakeholders, inform future investment, and test out new and innovative approaches to combating low demand.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.2/3">A key element of the pathfinder projects' approach will be a unified agenda. Experience shows that it is not sufficient to tackle the housing problem alone. Local authorities must work closely together with their partners&mdash;the police, the health authority, the Regional Development Agency, Housing Corporation and private sector&mdash;to rejuvenate our towns and cities.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.2/4">Low demand and abandoned housing is a major problem. But it also provides a unique opportunity to restructure and rebuild our cities for the twenty-first century. We must now seize that opportunity. The Government will work with local people to deliver the change necessary and bring hope to those communities.</p>

	<p pid=".406W.6/2">We are determined to widen access as we expand numbers. The latest UCAS figures show a 9.5 per cent. increase in the number of mature students from the UK who entered higher education in September 2001 and UCAS has reported a 4.6 per cent. increase in the number of mature applicants from the UK for September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.6/3">We have put a number of initiatives in place, including foundation degrees which are new vocational qualifications to address the skills gap, as well as New Technology Institutes which are being set up in each English region. They are partnerships between higher education (HE), further education (FE) and business to provide specialist information and communication technology (ICT) and other high technology learning programmes. We are also developing new ways to access higher education through the &quot;e-Universities&quot; project, which will provide the flexibility many mature students need.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.6/4">In addition we have provided substantial extra resources for mature students including a child care grant, travel, books and equipment grant and access bursaries for student parents. A single parent with two young children can now get over &pound;16,000 with full student loan and other grants. Our measures have contributed towards the welcome increase in mature student numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.6/5">Institutions receive a funding premium for all students aged 25 and over in recognition of the additional cost of supporting such students. We are also encouraging the important role that FE has to play in delivering HE, where FE colleges are already significant providers. They offer degree and other provision to wider groups, many of whom are mature students who may not be able to attend a university but can attend the local college.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.12/1">Our target is for all children with special educational needs (SEN) to receive excellent provision which meets their needs. Maintained schools are under a duty to use their best endeavours to make the special educational provision children's learning difficulties call for, including children with autistic spectrum disorders. Teachers have a crucial role in meeting this duty. As part of the continuous improvement we seek in teaching standards, we want to see the support given by teachers to children with special educational needs (SEN), including those with autistic spectrum disorder, brought up to the standards of the best throughout the country and in all schools. Ofsted has a regular cycle of inspection of maintained schools, non-maintained special schools and independent schools which cater wholly or mainly for children with SEN, including schools which make provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders. In determining their judgments Ofsted inspectors have to consider the extent to which pupils with SEN are making progress and how well the teaching meets pupils' diverse needs.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.12/2">As part of their initial teacher training, all student teachers must show that they understand their responsibilities under the SEN Code of Practice, and know how to seek advice. During induction teachers must demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. &pound;91 million of supported expenditure is available under the SEN category of the Department's Standards Fund. Training is an important sub-head under this category and training in autism is specifically mentioned in guidance on the SEN category as something which local education authorities (LEAs) may wish to support. Grant support has also been made available to voluntary organisations and higher education training providers to create new training opportunities and, again, autistic spectrum disorders are mentioned in the bidding criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.12/3">The forthcoming publication of guidance from the Department's Autism Working Group will further raise teachers' awareness of the disorder. The guidance will emphasise the benefits of staff who come into contact with children with autistic spectrum disorders having an understanding of the condition. The guidance will help schools and LEAs to make best use of the increasing resources available annually for the education of school children when making provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders. Currently more than &pound;23 billion is available for the education of children in school of which over &pound;1 billion is used by LEAs to provide additional support for children with SEN and some &pound;1.9 billion is identified by LEAs as notionally allocated in schools' budgets towards meeting children's SEN. The guidance will emphasise the benefits of LEAs collecting data on the numbers of children with autistic spectrum disorders. The Department is also examining whether data on different types of SEN could be collected, probably from January 2004. At present there are 12 commonly used categories of SEN. These categories include pupils with autistic spectrum disorders and this would be one of the categories we are likely to collect.</p>

	<p pid=".414W.2/1">It has been agreed with the Department of Health that, from academic year 2002&ndash;03, undergraduate medical and dental students should in year five and any subsequent year of their course become eligible for a means-tested NHS bursary of up to &pound;2,640 a year in London and &pound;2,148 elsewhere and a reduced-rate student loan of up to &pound;2,365 a year in London and &pound;1,915 elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.2/2">For the first four years of their course, medical and dental students will be entitled to loans from the Student Loans Company like other higher education students and they are assessed for a contribution to tuition fees. However, from year five they will not pay any contribution to tuition fees.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.2/3">In addition, they will also continue to receive extra weeks allowances throughout the course to take account of their longer academic year.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.2/4">This enhanced package of support recognises that medical and dental training programmes are longer than average; and it should help to guarantee the supply of newly qualified staff.</p>

	<p pid=".414W.5/4">The only data available on parental contributions to tuition fees come from the Student Income and Expenditure Survey in 1998&ndash;99 when only first-year students were liable to pay tuition fees. In that survey four in five students, whose parents had been assessed for a contribution, said that they had received the full amount. However, the survey also showed that the parental contribution to students' maintenance was on average &pound;348 more than the assessed amount.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.2/2">The average debt of a borrower with a mortgage-style student loan taken out under the previous Government's student support arrangements starting repayment status in 1999&ndash;2000 was &pound;3,210. The amount available to students through student loans has increased under the loan-based support system introduced in August 1998. So the average debt of a borrower with a new income-contingent loan entering repayment status in April 2002 has increased and is estimated to be some &pound;6,100. Repayments of income- contingent loans will be linked to graduates' income after leaving higher education so they repay only when their income exceeds the threshold of &pound;10,000 per annum. Interest on student loans is linked to inflation so that borrowers repay, in real terms, only the amount borrowed. The data are not available by social class.</p>

	<p pid=".418W.6/1">The principal aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by children and young people. The Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for most youth prosecutions in England and Wales and prosecutes all youth cases according to the aim and principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.6/2">A youth will be prosecuted if a Crown Prosecutor is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and that the public interest requires a prosecution, irrespective of the type of offence that has been committed. Crown Prosecutors must consider the interests of a child or young person when deciding whether the public interest requires a prosecution but should not avoid prosecuting simply on the basis of the age of the offender. The seriousness and prevalence of the offence and the youth's past behaviour are recognised factors in favour of prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.6/3">Youths who admit an offence and have not previously been convicted of an offence will usually not be prosecuted but will be reprimanded or warned by the police. This system of reprimands and final warnings was introduced by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and is designed to stop offending at an early stage and enables a young person to take part in a rehabilitation programme. The police have issued a matrix of &quot;gravity factors&quot; which is used to assess the appropriate action to be taken with reference to the seriousness of the offence under consideration and the offender's previous record.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.6/4">&quot;Car related crime&quot; is a wide term that covers a range of offences of varying seriousness. Therefore, offences of car related crime will be graded at different levels of seriousness within the police guidelines, leading to different decisions concerning the appropriate way to proceed depending on the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances of the youth offender involved.</p>

	<p pid=".419W.0/1">The key to reporting rape is the confidence that the victim has that the criminal justice system will take the allegation seriously. That involves concerted action by the criminal justice system as a whole in the investigation and prosecution of rape. One of the important issues in the appropriate referral of cases by police to the CPS is early legal advice to police preferably before charge.</p>

	<p pid=".419W.3/1">Each case which the police send to the Crown Prosecution Service&mdash;involving an allegation of incitement to racial hatred&mdash;is reviewed by a Crown Prosecutor. All cases are carefully considered to make sure that they meet the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.3/2">There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. The first stage is the evidential test. The Crown Prosecutor must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a &quot;realistic prospect of conviction&quot;. He must consider objectively whether the evidence can be used and is reliable. The Crown Prosecutor must also consider what the defence case may be and how it is likely to affect the prosecution case. A &quot;realistic prospect of conviction&quot; means that a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.3/3">If the case does not pass the evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how important or serious it may be. Ordinarily, if the case does pass the evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the second stage test to decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest. In cases of any seriousness, a prosecution will usually take place, unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour. The Crown Prosecution Service will start or continue a prosecution only when the case has passed both tests.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.3/4">However, offences brought under Part III of the Public Order Act require the Attorney General's consent to prosecute&mdash;so whether or not the public interest requires a prosecution is a matter for the Attorney-General.</p>

The assistance includes, for instance, search and rescue, and support to the police in the identification and disposal of explosive devices. The assistance provided to the Police Service of Northern Ireland also falls under the general heading of MACA. The total number of individual tasks undertaken since July 1998 runs into the thousands. Detailed records of many of these activities are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. There have, however, been a number of large-scale and high profile emergency tasks, details of which are in the table.</p>

We announced, as part of the Strategic Defence Review, our intention to declare the full range of our rapidly deployable forces, additional strategic lift and logistics capabilities as potentially available to the UN. This new declaration was incorporated into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which the Government signed with the UN in June 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.2/2">The MOU makes it clear that we would be prepared to consider the provision of forces up to a full brigade size to meet the specific needs of a UN operation. It is not possible to say precisely which of the forces listed in the MOU are available at any one time. The exact availability of the forces for peacekeeping depends on a range of factors, not least other continuing and known future commitments. The decision to commit United Kingdom forces to any UN operation will continue to be a national one.</p>

	<p pid=".425W.2/1">Since my statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-23">23 January 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-01-23.891"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 891&ndash;902</phrase>, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency has been conducting a review to establish more clearly the exact extent of the problem with the mistaken taxation of service invaliding and attributable pensions. This work is not complete, but has revealed that some Royal Navy invaliding and attributable pensions awarded between 1973 and 1999 have also been mistakenly taxed. We will be reviewing all the case files of those who might have been affected and arranging for refunds to be made as appropriate. This will be done as quickly as possible but is expected to take some months given the need to review several thousand pension files. We will also be providing appropriate national publicity to allow those who think they might have a claim to apply for a tax refund.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.2/2">Our research has not so far revealed any cases where Royal Air Force pensions were wrongly taxed and there is evidence that the RAF has had in place checks which would have uncovered cases where attributable pensions should have been exempt from tax. However, we will include the RAF in our continuing work to ensure that no error is left unidentified.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.2/3">Our further work to date has confirmed that the problem was more extensive than originally understood but has also shown the complexity of the issues involved as, over time, changes have been made to the organisations responsible for administering the pensions and to the rules governing the schemes. We have therefore concluded that we should set up an internal review, completely independent of the staffs involved, to establish the precise extent of the current problems and to expose any other problems that may exist. This independent review will look across all three services, be launched as soon as possible and is likely to take a number of months to complete. The review team will be headed up by a senior civil servant and consist of staff drawn from the Defence Internal Audit. In order to provide external confidence, the NAO will be invited to validate the procedures. I will report the findings to the House.</p>

	<p pid=".428W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. We are currently undertaking a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent. This is making a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of:</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/2" class="indent">eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10;</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/3" class="indent">promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need; and</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/4" class="indent">combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and future pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/5">Child benefit is now worth &pound;15.75 a week for the eldest child and &pound;10.55 a week for other children: nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in Bristol, East 11,455 families benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/6">The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.2 million. Nearly three quarters of working age people are in employment and in Bristol, East the proportion in employment currently stands at 76.3 per cent. Unemployment is at levels last seen in the early 1970s. Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. Nationally well over 600,000 people have been helped into work by the New Deals and in Bristol, East over 1,300 have been helped into work.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/7">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2001&ndash;02) we have made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household to help with their heaviest fuel bill. We estimate that around 16,600 older people in Bristol, East will have received a payment this winter.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/8">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. Our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/9">From this April we will be spending an extra &pound;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. This includes &pound;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/10">3,000 pensioner families in Bristol, East are receiving the minimum income guarantee which helps our poorest pensioners. Some 15,300 pensioners in Bristol, East will benefit from this year's increases in the basic state pension of &pound;3 a week for single pensioners and &pound;4.80 for couples. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 7,300 in Bristol, East, may qualify for free TV licences.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.3/11">Other reforms include the new pension credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings and the introduction of the state second pension from this April. Both of these initiatives will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners. We have also announced that from October 2003 benefits currently reduced after a hospital stay of 6 weeks will not be reduced until 13 weeks. This will benefit both pensioners and people of working age.</p>

This information is currently being collated. The boards will also be required to report on the achievement of their efficiency savings for 2001&ndash;02 in their annual reports. A summary will also be included in the annual report and accounts of the National Probation Service.</p>

	<p pid=".434W.2/1">The working group was established and first met in July 2000. The group is made up of Home Office officials and representatives of the National Association for the Care and Re-settlement of Offenders (NACRO) and the Society of Voluntary Associates (SOVA), two national voluntary sector organisations with considerable interest and experience in criminal justice and resettlement issues. The group's terms of reference are to consider and report to Ministers on what assistance might be given on release to ex-prisoners who successfully appeal against conviction and how that assistance might best be delivered within the available budget. No target date was set for the report but the working group is due to report to Ministers shortly. The group commissioned an independent scoping study to inform its work, which identified and canvassed views from a number of interested parties. After consideration of the scoping study the working group decided that a pilot project was appropriate. As there is no procurement exercise or competition for service delivery during the pilot phase, expressions of interest have not been invited. However, it has always been open to those who wish to contribute views to send them direct to the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid=".435W.8/16">The number of proven adjudications of assault expressed as a proportion of the average prisoner population is a key performance indicator (KPI) for the Prison Service.While the number of assault adjudications has risen recently, all prisons now have an active anti-bullying strategy and there is some evidence that this leads, at least in the short term, to an increase in reported incidents.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.0/2">The European Court of Human Rights (the Court) found the United Kingdom in breach of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the case of Christopher Edwards who was murdered by his cell-mate, Richard Linford, in Chelmsford prison in November 1994.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.0/3">The Court found breaches of Article 2 in respect of the circumstances of Mr. Edwards' death (the failure of various agencies to pass on information about Mr. Linford's mental health and the inadequate health screen given to Mr. Linford at the prison) and the failure to provide an effective investigation. They ruled that there had been a breach of Article 13 due to the lack of an effective remedy available to Christopher's family either through an effective investigation or the payment of compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.0/4">Mr. Edward's death was the subject of an independent investigation commissioned by the Prison Services and other agencies. The Court has not ordered a further investigation. Although it considered that there were defects, the investigation was regarded by the Court as having been thorough and useful. The Court found that the family were not eligible for compensation under United Kingdom civil law and awarded the sum of &pound;20,000 plus costs (a further &pound;20,000) by way of redress.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.0/5">The Court recognised the changes that have taken place since Mr. Edwards's death. These include introduction of the Prison Escort Record completed before a prisoner enters a Prison Service establishment and improved health care screening. The system of investigating deaths in Prison Service custody is currently under review as part of the Service's new suicide prevention strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.5/1">Mandatory drug testing (MDT) figures show that, overall, drug misuse in prisons has declined significantly over the past five years. The statistics suggest that much of this decline has been down to reductions in the use of cannabis, with opiate use static. Deterrence, supply reduction and treatment have been the key elements of the Prison Service's drug strategy and the decline in MDT rates gives evidence of its success.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/2">Available research evidence does not support the assertion that prisoners have switched from cannabis to other drugs which can only be detected for a shorter period. The Prison Service is continuing to look at this issue. The Institute of Psychiatry and the Office for National Statistics are currently reviewing the MDT programme, including the issue of switching. Their findings are expected in May 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".442W.2/1">Allocation of such funding is a matter for the Strategic Rail Authority. To assist the Strategic Rail Authority in delivering the 10-year transport plan targets, the Government are providing it with an extra &pound;155 million over the next two years. I will shortly be meeting Richard Bowker, Chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, and will be discussing their Strategic Plan, and in particular the Welsh dimension.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/2">Welsh travellers will benefit from investment in improved rail links outside Wales, just as those from elsewhere in the UK will benefit from investment in Wales. In these circumstances a simple population share division of investment could be disadvantageous to rail travellers in Wales and I have no intention of pressing the SRA to adopt such an approach.</p>

	<p pid=".447W.3/3">The Treasury Guidance for the 2002 Spending Review emphasises that Departments must consider key cross- Government agenda, including equality and sustainable development, and how to implement them in their submissions to the review. The guidance explicitly states that Departments' analysis should also highlight any significant distributional effects&mdash;e.g. between regions, types of environment, generations or gender&mdash;in their proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.3/4">Moreover, several of the cross-cutting reviews in the 2002 Spending Review have remits, which include promotion of equality, such as reviews of the public sector labour market and tackling health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.3/5">The Treasury has worked closely with organisations such as the Women and Equality Unit and the Women's Budget Group (WBG)&mdash;and an independent UK organisation of gender experts&mdash;in order to improve its understanding of gender impact and its analytical capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.3/6">Analysis is included in internal advice put to Ministers during the development of policy. Policy makers are required to look at the impact legislative proposals may have across the range of equality issues&mdash;e.g. race, disability, age and gender.

	<p pid=".450W.0/3">The amount of the tax relief is 5 per cent. of the amount invested for the tax year (or accounting period for a corporate investor) in which an investment which qualifies for the scheme is made, and for each of the following four years or periods, making a total of 25 per cent. of the amount of the investment in all. The tax relief is set against the investor's income tax or corporation tax liability as appropriate. So for example, an individual investing &pound;10,000 in an accredited CDFI for at least five years could obtain a reduction in their income tax liability of &pound;500 for the tax year in which the investment was made and for each of the four following years, making a total tax reduction of &pound;2,500 over five years.</p>

	<p pid=".454W.11/1">In line with the recommendation from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence we have concluded an agreement with five companies on an innovative scheme which allows patients with multiple sclerosis meeting the criteria of the Association of British Neurologists to be treated cost-effectively with disease modifying therapies on the national health service. The companies have agreed terms for the supply of their products under the scheme. Patients will be monitored to confirm whether the drugs are working. Prices will be reduced if patients do not benefit as expected. The scheme starts on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-06">6 May 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.11/2">Multiple Sclerosis sufferers in the East Surrey area will, from then, have access to beta interferon on the same basis as other NHS patients. NHS bodies are expected to fund any treatment within this scheme prescribed by clinicians for eligible patients, in accordance with statutory directions. Consultant neurologists, in consultation with patients, will have a choice of treatments within the scheme taking into account expected benefit and potential side effects. The products included in the scheme are Avonex (Biogen), Betaferon (Schering), Copaxone (Teva/Aventis), Rebif 22 mg and 44 mg (Serono).</p>
	<p pid=".454W.11/3">Patients whose condition does not come within the ABN guidelines and who are currently receiving treatment with these drugs will continue to do so in line with NICE's recommendation on this point. I am also taking steps to ensure that those patients who have funded their treatment privately because the drug was not available to them locally on the NHS have had the costs of their prescription met since <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-04">4 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.11/4">Copies of the health service circular issued to the NHS to explain the scheme have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".457W.3/2">The booklet 'Moving into a Care Home' was published in October 1996. It focused on financial issues for residents. At today's prices, it would cost approximately &pound;10,000 to produce and distribute 3,000 copies of the original booklet free of charge to councils and other interested parties. The booklet was drafted and consulted upon by departmental staff. These and related costs were absorbed within the Department's running costs and are not separately identifiable, and therefore not included in the cost given above.</p>
	<p pid=".457W.3/3">A voluntary organisation called 'Counsel and Care' has been commissioned to produce a new booklet for people both entering and in residential care that will be much more detailed and cover a much wider range of topics in addition to residents' finances. It will be distributed on the same basis. In addition, an electronic version will be placed on the internet. The Department awarded a grant of &pound;80,000 for Counsel and Care for this work, which will also include the costs of dissemination events in the form of conferences and seminars.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we intend to increase resources for personal social services by an annual average of 6 per cent. in real terms from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06.

	<p pid=".459W.5/1">There is currently no evidence that this is a widespread national problem and in fact current data indicate a rise of about 16 per cent. over the past two years of those drug misusers entering treatment. These figures mean that the Government are on track to meet the target of increasing the number of drug misusers in treatment by 100 per cent. by 2008. The Government are of course aware of the negative impact that refusal of planning permission locally could have on the Government's aim of increasing the number of drug misusers accessing treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".459W.5/2">Local authorities are autonomous bodies, accountable to their electorates, and the Government do not routinely comment on, or intervene in, their day-to-day administration of the planning system. Nor would it be appropriate for a Minister to comment on the merits of an individual planning decision, because of the appellate role of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. It is for the local planning authority to assess each planning proposal on its individual merits, in the light of the authority's development plan and of any other considerations material to planning.</p>
