The money is being used by Registered Social Landlords, in partnership with local refuge providers and local authorities to provide 273 units of accommodation in all regions in England.

All authorities were required to have a homelessness strategy in place by <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-30">30 July 2003</phrase>. The Homelessness Directorate is providing &pound;260 million between 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 in support of local housing authorities' efforts to tackle homelessness. A number of authorities are using this funding to improve the support available to victims of domestic violence in order to prevent homelessness among this client group.</p>

More generally, as part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's drive to create sustainable communities, we are working to improve the supply of housing in those regions where high demand is causing prices to rise beyond the reach of those on modest incomes. Regional Housing Strategies, produced for the first time this year, which will be considered, are important in highlighting problems of affordability at regional and sub-regional level.

General consents have been issued so that local authorities can, in certain circumstances, dispose of land for less than the market value without having to apply to the Secretary of State for specific consent.

In the short term, a fast-track appraisal process was piloted recently for applications seeking less than &pound;15,000 under the Rural Enterprise Scheme. The indications are that such an approach can substantially reduce the time taken to confirm the decision over an award of grant and we hope to introduce new arrangements generally, over the coming months. For the longer term, we are engaged in a major programme to improve ERDP delivery radically, and support the delivery of new agri-environment schemes. These benefits, facilitated in part by a completely new IT system, will begin to come on stream in early 2005.</p>

Under section 85 of the Water Resources Act 1991 (as amended by the Environment Act 1991) it is an offence to cause or knowingly permit polluting matter to enter &quot;controlled waters&quot;, that is rivers, estuaries, coastal or groundwaters without permission. This is obtained as a discharge consent granted by the Agency. The Agency sets consent conditions which control volumes and concentrations of particular substances or imposes broader controls on the nature of the effluent.

The Government's target is that by 2004, 28 per cent. of young people will start a Modern Apprenticeship by age 22. The expansion of Foundation Degrees will enable the progression into higher education from vocational programmes. Young people not yet ready to enter a Modern Apprenticeship will be able to join Entry to Employment, to benefit from help in developing basic skills as a means of entering a Modern Apprenticeship or employment.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.2/1">The Department of Trade and Industry publishes annually estimates of oil and gas reserves on the UK Continental Shelf. The latest estimates are that, as at the end of 2002, remaining proven and probable discovered recoverable reserves amounted to 920 million tonnes of oil and 1,000 billion cubic metres of gas. A further 425 million tonnes of oil and 330 billion cubic metres of gas are classified as possible reserves in discovered fields. There are a further 90 to 490 million tonnes of oil and 70 to 265 billion cubic metres of gas in potential additional reserves in smaller undeveloped fields. Furthermore, it is also estimated that additional reserves of between 270 and 1,770 million tonnes of oil and between 235 and 1,390 billion cubic metres of gas could exist in fields that had not been yet discovered.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.2/2">A study carried out by IMC Group Consulting Ltd. for DTI which was published in December 2002 assessed UK coal reserves in the 15 deep mines operating at that time at around 150 million tonnes, with further known mineral potential of around 260 million tonnes, mainly in 7 mine licence areas. The UK opencast reserve is estimated to be around 230 million tonnes.</p>

Park managers specify what tasks require doing and how they are to be done. Where pesticides and herbicides are required, park managers approve which ones should be used and the information is not, therefore, held centrally. We could only find out which types have been used by asking contractors to obtain the information from each job order they have had from park managers for the past two years. Even that would say what type had been approved but not what quantities had been used.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.12/1">We are not aware of any specific proposals to discuss this issue in the EU Council of Ministers or in G7 or G8 meetings in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.12/2">The Government are committed to helping to eliminate all abusive labour practices. These include bonded labour, forced labour and child labour. These abusive practices persist where poverty denies people their rights and a decent livelihood. All the programmes of the Department for International Development (DFID) are intended to contribute to improving the livelihoods of poor people and helping them realise their rights. We also support projects targeted at particular abusive practices. Examples have included a programme in India to eliminate child labour, including bonded child labour; collaboration with the Asian Development Bank in Pakistan on rural development strategies that include tackling bonded labour and support for Action Aid's Poverty Reduction Project which has been working with bonded labourers in the Kailali district of Nepal to help them achieve secure livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.12/3">The United Kingdom has played a leading role in, ensuring that the international framework to promote workers' rights and to tackle abuses of those rights, including bonded labour, is in place, particularly through its work with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the UN specialised agency responsible for labour rights. The UK fully supports the ILO work to help end forced and bonded labour, which we see as both a cause and result of poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.12/4">Through DFID's Partnership Framework arrangement with the ILO, the UK provides support for technical assistance designed to eliminate forced labour. DFID is also supporting ILO programmes in West Africa and South East Asia to tackle forced labour and trafficking.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.12/5">The Government strongly support the ILO's core labour standards and are actively seeking to raise awareness of voluntary codes of conduct based on these for the working of business in developing countries. In particular we helped to set up and fund the Ethical Trading Initiative, which is an alliance of UK retail companies, non-governmental organisations and trade unions that works to improve labour conditions in the supply chain of its corporate members. The employment standards adopted by ETI members come from the Core Conventions of the ILO. The combined annual turnover of the corporate members amounts to over &pound;100 billion and is expected to rise significantly.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.12/6">We are also supporting Anti-Slavery International to raise awareness of the issue and stimulate action by trade unions, business and other civil society organisations and governments.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.0/1">DFID recognises that secure rights to land and property are fundamental to poor people's ability to act as citizens and pursue their livelihoods within a democratic society and open economy. The absence of systems to establish property ownership holds back development. In many cases it excludes the poor from accessing basic services and participating in formal markets for land and property, limiting social mobility and economic opportunity. The rights of large numbers of people living in informal settlements (which make up between 30&ndash;70 per cent. of populations of urban centres in developing countries) and those of rural people dependent on natural resources are frequently not recognised by the authorities. As a result they are vulnerable to eviction and loss of physical and natural assets. Many developing countries are seeking to address these problems by remodelling their systems of land and property administration, but lack the financial resources and technical capacity to do so effectively.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.12/1">The Government have already brought forward a range of legislative measures designed to help tackle anti-social behaviour associated with drinking alcohol. The Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000 makes it an offence for any person to sell alcohol to a person aged under 18 on licensed premises, or knowingly to allow another person to do so. It also created the offence of buying, or attempting to buy, alcohol on licensed premises on behalf of a person aged under 18.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.12/2">The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 provides the police and local authorities with increased powers to tackle under-age drinking. The Act contains measures to make it easier for local authorities to designate areas where restrictions on anti-social drinking will apply. It also created a positive duty on licensees and their staff not to sell alcohol to persons aged under 18s.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.12/3">Section 155 of the Licensing Act 2003, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-10">10 September 2003</phrase>, extends existing police powers relating to the confiscation of alcohol from people who are drinking and causing a nuisance in public places, so as to allow for the confiscation of sealed containers, in addition to opened containers, in defined circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.12/4">In addition, anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been used to prohibit individuals from consuming alcohol or being under the influence of alcohol in public. Such orders can also be used to prohibit individuals from entering licensed premises or off-licences and buying alcohol. ASBO prohibitions can cover any geographical area up to and including the whole of England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.12/5">For the future, the Home Office is working with the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit on their project to develop a national alcohol harm reduction strategy. The project is looking at the wide range of alcohol harms including alcohol-related crime, anti-social behaviour and community safety. A report setting out the cross-governmental alcohol harm reduction strategy for England is due for publication during autumn 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.2/1">The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis informs me that the Borough Commander for Havering and his senior management team continue to police Havering borough using intelligence-led policing, focusing on crime hot spots within the borough. An example of one of these initiatives, which began on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-05">5 September 2003</phrase>, is an operation which targets street robbery, disorder and assault and involves the co-operation of Havering borough council and the British Transport Police. A further initiative has been introduced whereby one sergeant and seven constables patrol outside nightclubs in Romford on both Friday and Saturday nights to reduce disorder. The Metropolitan police believe that this has helped to reduce disorder and provide reassurance in the town centre.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.2/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, figures provided by the Metropolitan police indicate that total notifiable offences in Havering borough have been reduced by 4.3 per cent. and burglary has been reduced by 25.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.0/1">The Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 set out at Schedule 1 a Code of Conduct, the principles of which guide police officers' behaviour. The Code applies to the conduct of police officers in all ranks while on duty, or while off duty, if the conduct is serious enough to indicate that an officer is not fit to be a police officer.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.0/2">Any breach of the principles in the Code may result in an officer facing misconduct proceedings under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999. Chief officers are responsible for applying the Regulations to their own forces.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.0/3">The investigation of complaints by the public relating to the conduct of a police officer falls under Chapter I, Part IV, of the Police Act 1996 (the Act). Under those provisions the police authority is the appropriate authority for handling complaints against senior officers (those above the rank of chief superintendent) and the chief officer of the force is the appropriate authority for recording and investigating complaints in respect of all other ranks.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.0/4">The Secretary of State for the Home Department does not have the power to intervene in either the recording or investigation of individual complaints, whether they concern on or off duty conduct, or in any disciplinary proceedings.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.0/5">Under Section 72 of the Act, the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) will supervise the investigation of certain types of complaints and it is within that process of supervision that it will have access to all the necessary evidence, primarily by way of the Investigating Officer's report. In such cases, the PCA may also impose such additional reasonable requirements as to the conduct of the investigation as appear to them necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.0/6">There is currently no statutory requirement for a force to disclose information to a complainant. The Secretary of State for the Home Department does not assess the extent to which police forces release information to a complainant regarding the outcome of a complaint.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.0/7">A new police complaints system will be introduced from April 2004 under provisions in the Police Reform Act 2002. This new system will operate under the guardianship of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p>
	<p pid=".669W.0/8">The new system will not change the Secretary of State for the Home Department's role in regard to the handling of complaints or disciplinary proceedings taken against police officers. Similarly, although it does not change the handling with regard to supervised complaints, it does provide for a managed investigation by the IPCC and for an independent investigation by the IPCC. As these two new types of investigation will put the IPCC in full control of the investigation, they will have unrestricted access to all the necessary evidence. Finally, with regards to the disclosure of information, the new complaints system places a clear duty on the police to keep the complainant properly informed during, and at the end of, an investigation, subject to a sensitivity test.</p>

	<p pid=".670W.8/2">In March 2000 the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) embarked on a three-year programme to help employers, including those in the public sector, to tackle assaults on staff, with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of violence at work. So far the programme has resulted in the publication of new guidance specifically aimed at small businesses, the development of new National Occupational Standards on work-related violence, a programme of inspections in the health care sector, and new research to establish good practice for lone workers, including those in the public sector.</p>

	<p pid=".673W.0/1">Under the Crime Reduction Programme CCTV Initiative, around &pound;170 million has been spent on 684 CCTV schemes across England and Wales, covering town centres, car parks, residential and rural areas. Of these schemes, 675 are already operational with the remaining schemes due to go live later this year.

In addition, a special &pound;50 million Basic Command Unit (BCU) fund has been distributed to local police commanders to help tackle the problems that matter most in their communities. Police will be able to target the extra resources at local level problems, like anti-social behaviour and drugs, deploying CCTV where appropriate.</p>

However, we have now been advised that the Russian proposals were forwarded to the NATO Political Committee in 1997.

	<p pid=".678W.2/1">I have received few representations regarding the level of visa fees for students. Visa fees are set at a level to ensure that the full cost of providing the entry clearance service worldwide is met from fee income and that the UK taxpayer does not have to meet any of the costs. From <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase>, the visa fee for students has been set at &pound;36. Student visas are issued for the duration of their course regardless of its length. Charges for leave to remain are administered by the Home Office and I have therefore not received representations on this matter.</p>

	<p pid=".678W.5/1">We deplore the actions of the rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army, in northern Uganda. In their 17 year war against the Government of Uganda they have been responsible for the abduction of over 20,000 children, many of whom become child soldiers, and massacres of thousands of local civilians. We are also concerned about reports that the Ugandan Army has been involved in recruitment of child soldiers, arbitrary arrests and mistreatment of detainees and have failed to protect the local population. The conflict has resulted in over one million displaced persons now living in refugee camps. We have raised these issues with the Ugandan government. The UK has responded to the worsening humanitarian situation by working with the international donor community and the World Food Programme (WFP) to bring relief to the affected region. Total UK support was &pound;2.5 million in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

While we recognise the Government of Uganda's need for a security response to the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, we are concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the region caused by the fighting. We have raised our concerns with the Ugandan Government and have encouraged them to consider other solutions to a military one. The UK is also liaising with EU partners and members of the donor community to consider how to help the Government of Uganda resolve the conflict.</p>

The MOD letter was answered, although the International Commission of Inquiry did not have enough time to follow up on it. The letter to HM Customs and Excise was unanswered at the time of the report, but it is very unlikely that any information about alleged criminal activity or any investigation could be made available.

	<p pid=".683W.0/1">We are currently investing over &pound;500 million pounds a year in revenue funding to raise the aspirations and achievements of young pupils in deprived areas through the Excellence in Cities programme. The programme covers 58 authorities as well as Excellence Clusters which tackle smaller pockets of deprivation. It includes some 1,000 secondary schools and over 1,000 primaries. In addition to providing Learning Mentors Learning Support Units enhanced opportunities for Gifted and Talented pupils and EiC Action Zones and City Learning Centres, the funding also provides for the delivery of Behaviour Improvement Plans, Leadership Incentive Grant and Aim Higher which is specifically designed to raise aspirations and widen access to Higher Education.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.0/2">OFSTED's recent report on Excellence In Cities found that: schools and teachers had been helped to meet the needs of disaffected and vulnerable pupils more effectively; exclusions are being reduced; attendance is improving at a faster rate in the schools involved in the programme; and the introduction of the programme has been associated with a faster rise in standards in secondary schools in EiC areas than nationally .</p>
	<p pid=".683W.0/3">As well as the additional support provided through the Governments targeted initiatives we are aiming to raise the aspirations and educational performance of pupils in deprived areas through mainstream programmes. The mainstream Primary and KS3 National Strategies are built on the principle that all children are capable of attaining high standards.</p>

	<p pid=".683W.3/1">Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is currently running as a pilot scheme in 56 Local Education Authority (LEA) areas in England. The pilots have tested eight variants of payment arrangements for EMA, two of which concentrate on the costs of transport. The maximum weekly payments vary from &pound;20 to &pound;40 assessed on income levels up to &pound;30,000. Guidance on the pilot arrangements is made available through the LEAs.</p>

Young people may also receive bonuses if they remain on their course and make good progress with their learning. A leaflet explaining the national EMA scheme was published in August this year and copies are available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.2/1">The success rates for Modern Apprenticeships (MA) published in July were issued for the first time in this form. The rates vary widely between sectors and some will need to improve markedly if we are to achieve our ambition to revitalise and expand apprenticeship programmes. However, the latest figures we have do show that overall MA success rates have increased to 39 per cent. in the year to January 2003. While this improvement is significant and sustained we and the Learning and Skills Council are not complacent. We need to do more.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.2/2">We have asked the Modern Apprenticeship Task Force, chaired by Sir Roy Gardner, to focus on this issue. They and the LSC are doing so sector by sector.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.2/3">In addition as part of the 'Success for All' programme the LSC has introduced minimum performance levels from 2003/04 for all providers, including those of MAs. These should be achieved by 2005/06. The LSC will rigorously monitor and review progress with each of its providers against these targets. Where performance is not satisfactory the LSC will take decisive action with the provider concerned up to and including the withdrawal of contracts.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.5/1">The Department and partner bodies do already monitor participation levels, and other factors such as attitudes and experiences of learning, through a number of sources including the Labour Force Survey, the Learning and Skills Council's Individualised Learner Record, the National Adult Learning Survey and NIACE surveys. Age of learner is an important factor in all of these sources and the Department regularly undertakes analyses based on age. Many of the publications based on these sources do contain breakdowns by age. Results from the 2002 NIACE survey on adult participation showed that the proportion of 35 to 44-year-olds who were current/recent learners had increased from 43 per cent. in 1996 to 49 per cent. in 2002. Participation among 45 to 54-year-olds increased from 36 per cent. to 44 per cent. over the same period. These increases are greater than for younger age groups.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.5/2">The Government recognises the importance of encouraging all people, regardless of age, to participate in learning and increase their skills and is committed to safeguard the provision of a wide range of earning for adults for culture, leisure community and personal fulfilment purposes with a better choice of opportunities to encourage adults back into learning. Through our Success for All reforms we will raise standards, increase participation and improve outcomes for learners and employers. We have introduced targets for learner numbers and learner success rates, including new national floor targets which set out the minimum acceptable levels of performance for colleges and other providers to be met or exceeded by 2006. These are aimed at improving the responsiveness and quality of provision to meet the needs of learners at all ages. The recently published Skills Strategy includes the new guarantee of free tuition for any adult without a good foundation of employability skills to get the training that they need to achieve such a qualification, known as a Level 2 qualification&mdash;explicitly noting that a higher than average proportion of older workers do not possess a Level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.5/3">The Government has set itself stretching targets to increase the basic skill levels of 1.5 million adults by 2007 and to reduce by 40 per cent. the number of adults without a qualification at NVQ level 2 or its equivalent by 2010. These targets will only be achieved if those over the age of 40 increase their participation and attainment in learning. Government believes that targets focused on ensuring all individuals achieve minimum levels of skill are the most appropriate for meeting the needs of the economy and society.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.2/1">Our Skills Strategy, &quot;21st Century Skills&mdash;Realising Our Potential&quot;, explained that we are committed to removing the age cap on Modern Apprenticeships in response to industry's concern that it constitutes a barrier to meeting their skill needs. As a first step, we have changed the rules so that, from <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-01">1 August 2003</phrase>, young people who start their Modern Apprenticeship at any point up to their 25th birthday can complete it. Beyond that, we will invite the Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) to put forward their proposals to design and implement a Modern Apprenticeship programme for adults in their sector as part of the new Sector Skills Agreements. It will be for individual SSCs, the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) and key partners including employers to assess the implications of this change for particular sectors. They will do so taking account of the need to maintain high standards; current budget limitations; and forthcoming European age discrimination legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.5/1">Schools have never been fined for excluding pupils. Between 1999 and 2003 they received more than &pound;350 million in specific funding for preventive work with pupils at risk of exclusion in addition to the normal delegated funding for those pupils. If a pupil was excluded LEAs were able to recover between &pound;2,000 and &pound;6,000 from schools to help pay for alternative provision. LEAs were not required to give the Department details of such recoveries. Funding for preventive work and provision for permanently excluded pupils is now mainstreamed so LEAs and schools determine resourcing arrangements locally.</p>

In addition, discounts apply to alternatively fuelled cars under the carbon dioxide emissions based company car tax and graduated Vehicle Excise Duty regimes.

	<p pid=".693W.6/1">The Government's Green Paper&mdash;&quot;Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and saving for retirement&quot;, (CM5677) issued in December 2002, outlined a number of incentives to help people continue in work up to and over state pension age.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.6/2">From 2003, we will introduce a package of intensive back to work help for people aged 50 and over including extending the support available through new deal 50 plus. The working tax credit now includes additional elements for eligible people aged 50 or over who move into work for 16 hours a week or more.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.6/3">From 2005, we will be looking at changes to the tax rules to allow people to continue working for the sponsoring employer while drawing their occupational pension and consulting on best practice to ensure that occupational pension rules do not discourage flexible working.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.6/4">The Government's Green Paper also recognised that the state pension has a role to play in encouraging flexible retirement. We therefore published proposals to improve the reward for deferring state pension from 2006 by increasing the rate at which weekly increments can be earned, and offering an alternative to increments in the form of a taxable lump sum payment. We will be announcing our plans on this proposal in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.6/5">In October 2006, we will implement anti-age discrimination legislation covering employment and vocational training. This will include making compulsory retirement ages unlawful except in those cases where employers can show they are objectively justified.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.6/6">And from 2010, as state pension ages start to equalise, as well as looking at policies to treat men and women aged between 60 and women's new state pension age as active labour market participants, we also propose to raise the earliest age that a pension may be taken from age 50 to age 55, to further promote the benefits of extending working life for both employee and employer.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.6/7">Alongside the implementation of these policies, we will continue to work to change employers' attitudes through our Age Positive campaign, and through the development of good practice guidance materials with employer organisations and other external partners. This work will help ensure opportunity for all and remove discriminatory practices, which encourage involuntary withdrawal from the labour market and early retirement.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.6/8">The Government are currently consulting on options for outlawing age discrimination in employment and vocational training under the European Employment Directive. The Age Matters consultation document launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-02">2 July</phrase> includes proposals for tackling employers' mandatory retirement ages&mdash;that is, the ages employers set for the compulsory retirement of their employees. Under the directive, compulsory retirement ages will be unlawful unless they can be objectively justified. The Government will decide how to tackle this once it has analysed and considered the responses to the consultation. Age Matters also explains that we shall take advantage of the directive's provisions that allow occupational pension schemes to set ages for admission or entitlement to retirement benefits. Such normal pension ages are necessary for the operation of defined benefit schemes.</p>

In Crosby, claimant unemployment has nearly halved since 1997, while the number of long-term unemployed claimants has fallen by 70 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".697W.3/1">We have recognised the need to reform the pension system of the UK. Our approach has been, in the first instance, to focus additional spending on the poorest pensioners. This means achieving a balance between providing a solid foundation of support for all while targeting support at those who need it most. Pension Credit will, from October guarantee everyone (who applies and qualifies) aged 60 and over an income of at least &pound;102.10 a week for single pensioners, (&pound;155.80 for couples). These amounts will be more if pensioners have caring responsibilities, are severely disabled or have housing costs.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/2">For the first time, Pension Credit will reward people aged 65 with modest savings or income. In the past, those who had managed to save a little were left no better off than those who had not saved at all. People who had capital of &pound;12,000 or more could get no help however low their income.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/3">Pension Credit will change this by giving new money to those 65 and over who have saved. This will be worth up to &pound;14.79 for single pensioners, &pound;19.20 for couples.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/4">Pension Credit is radically different from the Minimum Income Guarantee in that pound for pound deductions will be scrapped. And the credit will reward those over 65 with total weekly incomes up to &pound;139 for single pensioners, &pound;203 for couples. Around half of all pensioner households will be eligible and stand to gain around &pound;400 a year on average.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/5">The basic State Pension will remain the foundation of income in retirement on which to build. Between April 2000 and April 2003 the basic State Pension has increased by almost &pound;10 a week for a single pensioner and &pound;16 a week for a couple. This represents an increase of over 7 per cent. in real terms. We will continue to uprate by either 2.5 per cent. or RPI, whichever is higher for the remainder of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/6">We have recognised the importance of a good second pension by reforming SERPS. From April 2002, 20 million people&mdash;2.5 million carers, 2.5 million long-term disabled people and 15 million low to moderate earners&mdash;begin to benefit by building up a State Second Pension.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/7">The Government also introduced Winter Fuel Payments (WFP) for people aged 60 and over. The WFP is &pound;200 a year for qualifying households and will continue to be paid at this rate throughout this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/8">People aged 80 or over who are entitled to a Winter Fuel Payment will get an extra &pound;100 per household. This is the 80+ annual payment which will be paid as part of the Winter Fuel Payment, to those who are aged 80 or over in the qualifying week (15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-09-21">21 September</phrase> this year).</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/9">The Government have also introduced free TV licences for the over 75s and there have been increases above the rate of inflation to the Pensioners' Tax Allowances.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/10">In 2003&ndash;04, the Government will be spending around &pound;8 billion extra a year on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes &pound;3.75 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners. This is almost six times more than an earnings link to the basic State Pension since 1998 would have provided.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/11">We have also recognised that there is a need to address reform of private pension provision. Our Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement' set out our proposals to radically simplify the pensions system including reducing eight tax regimes into one, ensure that individuals have access to the right information to make informed pensions savings choices and ensure that older workers can access the employment opportunities they deserve and balance this with flexible retirement choices.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/12">To build on this, after the largest consultation on pensions ever, we published 'Working and Saving for retirement: Action on occupational pensions' in June which introduced a balanced package of measures to assist employers in providing occupational pension schemes while ensuring protection for pension scheme members. We will set up a Pension Protection Fund, the first ever protection scheme for defined benefit pensions, bring in measures to ensure that where a solvent company chooses to wind up its scheme it will fully buy-out members benefits and establish a pensions regulator that will target badly run and high risk schemes in order to put consumers first.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/13">There is a need to engage with employers to re-invigorate the pensions partnership and that is why we have set up the Employer Task Force to identify and promote employer lead solutions. We also have accepted that there is a need to consider the voluntarist system in the longer term and to monitor progress independently. Therefore we have set up the Pensions Commission to monitor and keep under review the system of private pensions and long-term savings.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/14">There is also a need to make individuals aware of their pension provision&mdash;both from the State and private saving. That is why we are extending combined state and private pensions forecasts through a concerted and targeted campaign. We will continue to develop a web-based retirement planner and will pilot a scheme for employer-based information. All these measures will seek to enable individuals to make the right pensions choices from a more knowledgeable position.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.3/15">We have recognised the need for pension reform from both a State and private perspective and will continue to press ahead with our proposals of targeting resources and expanding provision.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.6/1">In the Strategic Defence Review published in 1998, it was envisaged that the two new Future Aircraft Carriers would be in the order of 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes and be capable of carrying up to 50 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The intention, as with any other new equipment project, has always been to refine the design during the Assessment Phase in order to best meet our developing capability requirements. The Carrier programme is currently in this assessment phase. The key specifications in capability terms will be determined prior to the award of the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&amp;M) contract, currently planned for spring 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.6/2">Our target in-service dates for the two carriers remain 2012 and 2015 respectively.</p>

	<p pid=".703W.12/5">The development costs, which mainly represent costs incurred prior to the commencement of production of the asset, are capitalised in the accounts in accordance with the HM Treasury Resource Accounting Manual. The Department's accounting policy on capitalisation and amortisation of the development expenditure is stated in the Departmental Resource Accounts 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.12/6">The detailed analysis of tangible and intangible fixed assets is produced every three years in the form of the National Asset Register, the current publication being in respect of 1999&ndash;2000. This publication does not require the break down of the development expenditure in respect of assets in use by individual assets, but the range and type of assets in use by the Department are identified. At <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>, development expenditure for fixed assets in use amounted to &pound;11.4 billion. Similarly, development expenditure relating to assets in course of construction is not analysed by asset type, but the main projects under construction are identified in the 1999&ndash;2000 National Asset Register under Assets In Course of Construction. At <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>, this development expenditure totalled &pound;8 billion. Other intangible assets amounted to some &pound;80 million as at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>.</p>

It is not yet possible to say either what percentage of British unexploded munitions have been cleared or when all the work will be completed. To date, UK and other coalition explosive ordnance disposal teams in the UK area of operation have completed over 1,500 tasks and destroyed over 500,000 individual munitions. Those munitions include not only those dropped or fired by coalition forces, but also many from the Iraq-Iran war as well as mines laid, ordnance fired or dropped, and stores of ammunition and other ordnance left by Iraqi military and paramilitary forces.</p>

The Department for Social Development also provides funding for the Northern Ireland Co-Ownership Housing Association which, through its equity sharing scheme, gives those on low incomes an opportunity to gain a foothold on the home ownership ladder and has, since its inception in 1978, helped over 17,500 participants to become home owners on an equity sharing basis, with over 13,000 of these eventually moving to full home ownership.</p>

	<p pid=".719W.14/2">The Plan is based primarily on the need to increase the extent, and improve the quality, of habitats favoured by the Irish Hare. While there are specific plans in place for these habitats, demonstrable effects on hare numbers cannot be expected for several years.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.14/3">At this stage it is not possible to predict whether the target to double the population by 2010 will be achieved. Estimates of the Irish Hare population were made in 1997 and 2002 and suggested that the population remained stable between those dates. Further estimates will be made as the Plan progresses, but it should be recognised that the margin of uncertainty associated with these estimates is high, and the detection of population trends is therefore difficult.</p>

	<p pid=".722W.0/1">Pressures on the neurosurgery service have arisen mainly as a result of a need for more theatre time, and shortages in experienced nursing staff. This is not a problem unique to Northern Ireland&mdash;there are similar problems with this service throughout the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/2">The Royal Group of Hospitals, in liaison with the four boards, has been working hard to improve the situation, both in the short-term, and with regard to the longer-term development of the service.A task force was established by the trust to lead the effort in addressing the problems faced by the service;</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/3">Extra theatre lists have been introduced;</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/4">A twin-track approach to enhance the recruitment and retention of nurses has been implemented to restore nursing levels and enable more beds to be opened. This has involved:</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/5" class="indent">the appointment of a 'clinical educator' to enhance training</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/6" class="indent">opportunities and to support and increase the number of nurses in training; and</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/7" class="indent">the recruitment of additional nurses, allowing the phased opening of beds from June 2003, with all beds re-opening by January 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/8" class="indent">A clinical careers framework for nurses has also been launched to improve opportunities for personal development and career pathways;</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/9" class="indent">In addition, treatment has been provided for some suitable patients in units outside Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/10">These measures should make a significant contribution to addressing the problems in this service. I have asked my Department, in liaison with the boards and the trust, to keep me apprised of progress.</p>

	<p pid=".726W.6/1">The Northern Ireland Waste Management Strategy, published by the Department of the Environment in March 2000, provides a framework for developing waste management practices to increase recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. A key element of the Strategy is the preparation of Waste Management Plans by District Councils. Plans covering all of Northern Ireland are currently being implemented and are geared towards achieving a primary target set out in the Strategy of recovering 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.6/2">The Plans were adopted following extensive public consultation throughout each district council area. They set out the full range of activities and facilities to be put in place to provide a recycling service, taking account of the needs and circumstances of individual councils areas. These activities and facilities to be put in place include a mix of kerbside collection for individual households, home composting schemes and the development of new and enhanced civic amenity sites and recycling centres. Under its Waste Management Grant Scheme, the Department provides significant financial assistance to district councils to assist with the cost of implementing the Plans. The Scheme commenced in April 2001 and up to March 2003 some 20 Councils used the assistance for the purchase of bins to enable householders to segregate waste for recycling.</p>

In relation to the use of taxis it states clearly that their use should be strictly controlled in order to minimise costs. Trusts have to ensure that when taxis are used to support fleet operation for regular or ad hoc work, that there are proper management protocols and monitoring arrangements in place.</p>
	<p pid=".730W.3/33">Trusts must have mechanisms in place to ensure relevant directors are notified of expenditure on taxis. Also taxi services obtained from commercial taxi companies are subject to a process of tender through Regional Supplies Services.</p>
