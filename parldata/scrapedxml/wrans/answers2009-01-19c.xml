	<p pid="c.1004W.2/1">As of April 2008, the remaining potential for insulation measures in Great Britain totalled 7.75 million wall cavities; 6.33 million lofts (where less than 100 mm of insulation is already present); and 6.3 million homes in need of solid wall insulation (excluding homes in conservation areas).</p>
	<p pid="c.1004W.2/2">We project that, if all remaining measures were installed (with solid-wall insulation achieving a 'U' value of 0.45 W/m2K), this would save 20.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) per year. In terms of energy savings (comprising gas, electricity and oil), this would represent 230.89 TWh per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1004W.2/3">The savings delivered from treating 80 per cent. and 60 per cent. of homes would depend on the combination of measures installed. The following table therefore provides the figures for savings from insulating cavities, lofts and solid walls separately for each of these percentage scenarios.</p>

	<p pid="c.1011W.2/1">The waters around the British Antarctic Territory are wholly within the area covered by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). It is mandatory for all long-line fishing vessels to undertake measures to minimise seabird by-catch and to deploy an international scientific observer to monitor compliance with these requirements. In recent years, there has been no by-catch of seabirds in legal fisheries in these waters. There has thus been no need for the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) to work to reduce by-catch in these waters and it has instead focused its efforts on by-catch reduction in other parts of the oceans. In those areas the Parties to the Agreement have begun to work with regional fisheries management organisations to advance the use of mitigation technologies as well as to improve by-catch monitoring and have agreed a strategy to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.1011W.2/2">The UK's ratification of ACAP includes all UK Overseas Territories in the range of the albatrosses and petrels covered by ACAP, for example, the Falkland Islands, Tristan da Cuhna, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and British Antarctic Territory.</p>

	<p pid="c.1013W.2/1">It is established Government policy that the needs and interests of rural people, businesses and communities should be appropriately reflected in all Departments' mainstream policies and delivery plans. Rural proofing is one of the main tools available to departments to achieve this. DEFRA works with other Government Departments to advise and encourage them to take account of rural interests in developing and implementing their policies, including meeting the requirement to address rural implications in published impact assessments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1013W.2/2">DEFRA also sponsors the Commission for Rural Communities which publishes detailed rural proofing guidance, and works closely with Departments on the rural implications of their policies. DEFRA and the Commission for Rural Communities are currently working together to refresh and relaunch the support arrangements and materials available to national, regional and local government to improve rural proofing.</p>

	<p pid="c.1024W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide my hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Ruth Owen:</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked Mel Groves to reply to your question concerning what steps he plans to take to maintain the level of employment in Yorkshire and Humberside. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr Groves as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. Mr Groves is currently on annual leave. I am replying on his behalf as Chief Operating Officer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a key role in helping both individuals and employers in the current economic situation. Our priority is to ensure people receive the benefits they are entitled to and the support and training necessary to get back to work as soon as possible and help employers fill their vacancies with suitably qualified people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/5" class="indent">As you know we have seen a rise in the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance across the region. Jobcentre Plus is very well placed to help people who have recently lost their jobs to move back into work as soon as possible. While around 28,000 new customers claimed Jobseeker's Allowance in November across the region, over 34,000 new vacancies were notified to us and 21,700 customers moved off the register.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/6" class="indent">We continue to actively engage with employers across the region to help them meet their local recruitment needs. We have had a magnificent response through our Local Employment Partnerships initiative with 3,120 employers now signed up to offering work opportunities for our most disadvantaged customers and newly redundant people, resulting in 6,417 jobs. We are also working closely with local employers and partners, for example, in the call centre, care and retail sectors to offer bespoke pre employment training to fill their significantly increased vacancies. We also offer a wide range of support for people facing redundancy. This includes helping support employers to retain their staff through retraining; and encouraging staff to gain vocational qualifications to prepare for the economic recovery rather than having to make staff redundant. We also support employers where they need to go into short time or temporary stop working and we are tailoring our advice to meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/7" class="indent">A strengthened Rapid Response Service was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-12">12 November 2008</phrase>, doubling national funding from &pound;3 million to &pound;6 million. Through the Rapid Response Service, Jobcentre Plus has access to funds to enable those individuals made redundant to receive the necessary help to get them back into work. Such measures could include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/8" class="indent">Skills Transfer Analysis (to help identify an individual's transferable skills and training needs relevant to the local labour market);</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/9" class="indent">Job-Focussed Training (to assist individuals with appropriate training and certification linked to employment or self-employment linked to the needs of the local labour market).</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/10" class="indent">We will also visit employees facing redundancy at their place of work to explain the support and benefits available to them. Employees can also access the vacancies we hold nationally by visiting our website at <a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a> or by telephoning us on 0845 6060 234 and by using the jobpoints at their local Jobcentre. Additional information is also available through our 'Job Kit' which provides guidance and support for customers on benefits and how to look for a job and our 'Find your way' leaflet for employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/11" class="indent">The Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January 2009</phrase> that it is enhancing the support available to customers who are unemployed for six months from April 2009. This includes further support from Jobcentre Plus advisers, plus options to take up subsidised employment, self employment, training or voluntary work. This will all be available in the Yorkshire and Humber Region, delivered through Jobcentre Plus and partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/12" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is also represented on the Regional Economic Delivery Group, chaired by the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Minister Rosie Winterton. The group is working to secure and coordinate public sector infrastructure investment and steer the regional response to the economic climate. Reporting to this group is the Yorkshire and Humber Financial Services Task force led by Yorkshire Forward (the Regional Development Agency). This group is co-ordinating the region's response to potential job losses and producing a long term strategy to secure the future of high skilled employment in the sector. This working group is currently developing an action plan to support Bradford and Bingley Building Society. The group will be widening its remit to cover other industrial sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/13" class="indent">In addition to this support we recently decided that our customers in Yorkshire and the Humber can have access to CV writing, Jobsearch advice and support through our Programme Centres immediately rather than waiting 6 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/14" class="indent">I have asked Ian Hunter, District Manager West Yorkshire, to meet with you to discuss the help Jobcentre Plus are providing to maintain the level of employment across the region.</p>

	<p pid="c.1038W.2/1">The Department uses three indicators to monitor levels of child poverty; they were established in 2003 following a lengthy period of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.2/2">Absolute low income measures whether the poorest families are seeing their income rise in real terms. The threshold is fixed as equal to the relative low income threshold for the baseline year of 1998-99 expressed in today's prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.2/3">Relative low income measures whether the incomes of the poorest families are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the economy as a whole. This indicator measures the number of children living in households below 60 per cent. of contemporary median equivalised income. This is the indicator which is used to measure performance against the public service agreement target to halve child poverty by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.2/4">Material deprivation and low income combined provides a wider measure of people's living standards. This indicator measures the number of children living in households that are both materially deprived and have an income below 70 per cent. of contemporary equivalised median income. More details can be found in the consultation conclusion document, Measuring Child Poverty, available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.2/5">Since 1998 progress has been made against all of the indicators. 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative low income between 1998-99 and 2006-07, a shift from 3.4 million children to 2.9 million children. The number of children living in absolute low income has halved from 3.4 million to 1.7 million. Between 2004-05, the first year data was available, and 2006-07 the number of children in the UK defined as poor using the combined indicator of relative low income and material deprivation fell by 200,000 from 2.2 million to 2.0 million on the particular material deprivation threshold that was chosen.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.2/6">Low income is not the only dimension to poverty and a child's quality of life, including access to health care, education and a safe environment, are critical. The three indicators are therefore underpinned by the broader Opportunity for all indicators. Opportunity for all is the Government's report on poverty and social exclusion which includes a wide range of poverty and social exclusion indicators for children and young people (as well as working age adults, older people and communities) including health, education and housing.

	<p pid="c.1038W.2/8">While we have made substantial progress in tackling child poverty we are not complacent. Despite the scale of the challenge the Government's commitment is stronger than ever. The Prime Minister's recent announcement of our intention to legislate on child poverty gives us renewed impetus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.2/9">The Secretary of State meets regularly with Cabinet colleagues and others on the issue of child poverty. The Child Poverty Unit was established at the end of 2007 to put a sharper focus on cross-Government working to develop a truly integrated approach to tackling child poverty. The Government are committed to working with stakeholders to develop a strategy and move forward with legislation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1040W.4/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) holds no comprehensive record covering all offences in which a knife was a factor. Relevant offences may be prosecuted under a range of legislation, and cannot be distinguished as a discrete body of information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.4/2">CPS records do provide a count of the number of offences of possession of an offensive weapon, including knives and other bladed articles, in respect of which a prosecution commenced. Figures for the last three calendar years are summarised on the table below. The figures also include offences of possession of weapons other than knives and bladed articles, but CPS records do not allow these proceedings to be identified separately. Figures are shown separately for CPS Northamptonshire, for England, and for England and Wales in total.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.4/3">The level of prosecutions for these offences in total has risen somewhat over the last three years. In Northamptonshire the number of offences in which a prosecution commenced rose by 25, or 12.3 per cent. between 2006 and 2008, although there was no change between 2007 and 2008. In England, prosecutions rose over the three year same period by 1,648 (7.2 per cent.), and in England and Wales they increased by 1,656 (6.9 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid="c.1046W.5/1">The Warrior Fightability and Lethality Improvement Programme is part of the wider Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme (WCSP), which will upgrade the Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle to meet the current and future requirements of the British Army. The programme is in the early stages of its Acquisition Cycle and, as it progresses into its Assessment Phase, it is planned that bidders will develop hardware demonstrators of their turret proposals, along with supporting technical and commercial submissions for further consideration. As the programme has not yet passed the Initial Gate approval point, I am unable to comment further on the proposed procurement arrangements or on the programme's effect on the Defence Support Group at this time.</p>

	<p pid="c.1052W.9/1">Reservations and/or interpretative declarations in respect of the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities are being considered by four Departments: Home Office, Ministry of Defence, DCSF and DWP. This information is in the public domain and was most recently referred to in an answer to Lord Morris of Manchester by Lord McKenzie of Luton, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Department for Works and Pension on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-18">18 December 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-12-18.65"><i> Official Report</i>, column WA65</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1052W.9/2">The precise details of the reservations/interpretative declarations are being finalised by the four Departments, and will be subject to clearance by DA Committee before the necessary Explanatory Memorandum for ratification of the convention is laid for parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="c.1052W.9/3">The Ministry of Defence has indicated that there is a need to enter a reservation in respect of the armed forces reflecting the relevant provisions of EC Framework Directive Employment (2000/78/EC) and the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). MOD officials are working closely with DWP officials to finalise the wording of the armed forces' reservation which is required to preserve the combat effectiveness of the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.1053W.11/1">We are in the middle of a very large programme of investment in new warships, centred on the Type 45 Destroyers, the Future Aircraft Carriers and the Astute Class submarines.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.11/2">Of the six Type 45 Destroyers on order, two, Daring and Dauntless, have been built and commenced their sea trials. The other four vessels, which are in various stages of build, are expected to reach similar stages in the coming years: Diamond in 2009, Dragon in 2010, Defender in 2011 and Duncan in 2012. Daring is expected to enter into service next year with the other five at a rate of approximately one a year thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.11/3">The two new Aircraft Carriers, Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales, were originally due to enter service in 2014 and 2016 respectively. The Equipment Examination found that there is scope to improve alignment with the Joint Combat Aircraft project. This is likely to mean delaying the in-service dates of the new carriers by one to two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.11/4">The four Astute Class submarines that have been ordered (Astute, Ambush, Artful and Audacious) are in various stages of production. The planned in-service dates are subject to ongoing detailed review. There has, however, been some delay to the programme and we are in the process of re-baselining the programme timetable and an announcement will be made in due course. We intend to note a further three submarines in this class.</p>

	<p pid="c.1072W.5/1">This is an operational matter for the Audit Commission and I have asked the chief executive of the Audit Commission to write to the hon. Member direct.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Steve Bundred, dated January 2009:</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/3" class="indent">Your Parliamentary Question on what reasons the Audit Commission has requested councillors of Arun Council to provide details of their personal bank accounts has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/4" class="indent">This matter relates to the data collected for the Audit Commission's data matching exercise, known as the National Fraud Initiative (NFI). The NFI is designed to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud and is one of the ways in which the Audit Commission meets its responsibility of promoting economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public money. We estimate that since it started in 1996 the NFI has helped to detect around &pound;450 million in fraud and overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/5" class="indent">The processing of data by the Commission in a data matching exercise is now carried out under powers in Part 2A of the Audit Commission Act 1998, which were enacted in the Serious Crime Act 2007. The Audit Commission does not itself investigate instances of fraud; this is the responsibility of the bodies participating in the NFI and supplying data sets for matching.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/6" class="indent">Mandatory participants such as local councils, police authorities, probation boards, fire and rescue authorities and NHS bodies are required to submit a number of different dataset types for NFI. One of these datasets is payroll data, that is, all individuals currently being paid a salary/wage/members allowance on a payroll at a particular point in time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/7" class="indent">The data sought is limited strictly to those fields that are required for data matching plus any that will assist the investigator in selecting matches where an inconsistency is indicated from the data match that requires further investigation. The fields are set out in a 'data specification'. The bank account and sort code are included on the payroll data specification; however the name in which the bank account is held is not collected so the Audit Commission cannot make a connection to other account holders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/8" class="indent">Bank details (bank account number and sort code) are important for the investigation process, but they are not displayed in the reports that NFI participants receive; instead the matching process looks at whether the bank account number and sort code is the same or different across the sets of data provided for NFI and then converts this information into a flag (Yes or No). It is then the flag that is included in the NFI reports. This intelligence helps investigators prioritise investigative resources on cases where employment income has, for example, potentially been withheld (e.g. in an undeclared bank account). This data is highly significant in the fight against fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/9" class="indent">The Audit Commission's Head of NFI has met elected members at Arun Council to explain why these fields are collected, referring to a number of case studies that not only involve public sector employees but also elected members who have been guilty of benefit fraud by not declaring allowances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.5/10" class="indent">A copy of this letter will be placed in <i> Hansard</i>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1076W.5/1">Application of the working time directive, by setting a 48-hour maximum to the working week, would be likely to greatly reduce the hours which firefighters working the retained duty system could be available for duty, especially the substantial numbers who work full-time for their primary employer. The UK Government therefore places great importance on retaining its opt-out from the directive, a position that was acknowledged by the European Union Council of Ministers in June when it agreed in the Common Position that it should be retained, and will continue to defend it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.5/2">The amendments to the Common Position voted by the European Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-17">17 December</phrase> are the latest step in a complex negotiation, the next phase being for the Council of Ministers to consider the amendments, followed by a process of conciliation between both parties, the presidency and the Commission. Officials from my Department will be consulting a range of fire and rescue service stakeholders to ensure that the potential impact is assessed fully; and working with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which has the UK lead on the working time directive, to inform the ongoing debate and ensure MEPs and EU member states are briefed appropriately.</p>

	<p pid="c.1079W.2/1">According to the liquidators for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, local authorities held deposits of &pound;77.243 million on the date the bank entered liquidation in January 1992. This was approximately $143 million at the rate of exchange in January 1992.</p>
	<p pid="c.1079W.2/2">Dividends have been paid out in US dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between dollars and sterling means that local authorities (and other claimants with funds originally held in sterling) have received almost 97 per cent. of their original balance, if converting their US dollars back into pounds at the rate applicable on the date of the declared dividend. This is higher than the 86.5 per cent. set out in my previous answer, which is the percentage in US dollars.</p>

	<p pid="c.1084W.9/2">DEFRA sponsored the Countryside Agency, now partly superseded by the Commission for Rural Communities. The Countryside Agency ran the Vital Villages programme from 2001 until 2004. In 2005, they published 'Judging the success of the Vital Villages grants programme'. It concluded that it had been a successful scheme which had achieved its aims and brought a wide range of benefits to people in rural communities. Consequently, the lessons learnt from this programme are now being mainstreamed by Government and the third sector at the central, regional and local levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.1088W.9/2">Sport England invested &pound;2 million in the Cricket Foundation's 'Chance to Shine' programme between November 2005 and March 2007. The formation of the National Sports Foundation led to an agreement that 'Chance to Shine' would receive investment of &pound;2.5 million for the 2007-08 financial year. The National Sports Foundation has now been wound-down and its funds integrated with the new Whole Sport Plans. As a result 'Chance to Shine' will be funded through the ECB's Whole Sport Plan. The details of this plan, like the plans of all national governing bodies, are still under discussion and will be finalised in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.1097W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) began its programme of bilateral support to Helmand in 2006, committing to spend &pound;30 million in the province from 2006-07 to 2008-09. DFID spent &pound;23.7 million from 2006-07 to 2007-08, and will spend around &pound;23 million in 2008-09, meaning a spend of around &pound;46 million over the three-year period. Itemised details of spend are listed. For security reasons, a number of our implementing partners prefer to keep a discreet profile and therefore we maintain confidentiality about their identities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1097W.3/2">The primary channel for DFID support is the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (HARDP). The programme is implemented by the government of Afghanistan (both the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development and the Ministry for Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock). &pound;14.8 million has so far been disbursed through this programme in 2006-08. The government of Afghanistan is responsible for the allocation of funds to, and evaluation of, the hundreds of individual projects under HARDP. Once complete, each phase of HARDP is subjected to a formal DFID Project Completion Report. An independent review published in September 2008 concluded that the programme's accomplishments had been significant.</p>
	<p pid="c.1097W.3/3">DFID has been funding UN Habitat since early 2007 to undertake community and municipal development work in central Lashkar Gah. UN Habitat works directly with the government of Afghanistan's municipal authority and with locally-selected Community Development Councils: a two-year programme worth &pound;2.4 million is being implemented until 2010, including the creation of community development councils and projects such as drainage ditches, gravelled roads and waste disposal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1097W.3/4">Monitoring and evaluating activity in Helmand brings particular challenges. Many parts of the province remain insecure, and access by international staff to many areas is impossible. DFID has consequently developed a range of strategies to ensure programmes are properly monitored. These include working closely with military colleagues to access insecure areas, and identifying implementing partners from local communities, who can travel relatively freely within the regions where they live. We are in the process of contracting a third-party organisation to provide independent evaluation of our work and its impact.</p>

Given the number of projects involved, we assess our impact through broader programme outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1098W.2/2">Our support has resulted in the construction of 2,451 wells, benefiting over 400,000 people. Irrigation has been restored to 13,800 hectares of land, 5,800 hectares have been newly irrigated and 59 km of road completed. These government of Afghanistan-led programmes have delivered cleaner water and better sanitation for 1,500 families in Lashkar Gah. DFID's &pound;1.5 million commitment to the Governor of Helmand's wheat seed distribution programme this year helped the government to offer over 30,000 families a viable alternative to poppy cultivation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1100W.5/5" class="indent">Turning off electrical appliances when not in use&mdash;we carry out awareness campaigns among staff, and unused PCs are turned off at weekends by security staff.</p>

The programme was shaped by meetings of DFID's Leadership Group, including the directors responsible for DFID's 13 divisions. There are board level champions or director-level Senior Responsible Offices for each element of 'Making it Happen'. Progress is discussed on a monthly basis by DFID's Management Board, and by the Leadership Group, both chaired by the Permanent Secretary. All members of the senior civil service whether based in the UK or overseas have been encouraged to discuss various Making it Happen themes with their staff making clear what this means for them in practice and providing feedback to the central Change Unit.</p>

The CICIG aims to increase the number of investigations and prosecutions of violent offences, including those against women. The objectives of the project are to support, strengthen and assist state institutions responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes, and to contribute to the dismantling of illegal security forces and clandestine security organisations and the criminal prosecution of individuals involved in their activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1103W.6/2">In addition, the British embassy in Guatemala City is providing Oxfam GB with &pound;10,000 this financial year for two projects which aim to educate women (mainly indigenous women) on their human rights and specifically on their rights of access to justice within the Guatemalan legal system. The embassy is also funding a project with the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ). While this is not specifically targeting women, it does aim to strengthen the administration of justice and the rule of law. It involves training for judges, lawyers and prosecutors on international human rights law with the objectives of increasing judicial independence, decreasing impunity and abolishing the death penalty. The embassy is providing the ICJ with &pound;10,000 in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="c.1105W.12/1">Deliberate aid obstruction (in the form of a government ban on NGO activities) was a feature of the election period in 2008. This coupled with long-term policy failures and economic mismanagement by the government of Zimbabwe means that the country is facing its largest ever cholera epidemic and over five million people&mdash;in this highly fertile country&mdash;are receiving international food assistance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1105W.12/2">Occasional localised instances of humanitarian obstruction can never be entirely ruled out but, according to latest UN reporting, there have been no impediments to humanitarian access reported by partner organisations on the ground in recent weeks. The UN monitors this situation closely and is quick to respond to any problems with obstruction or political interference in aid delivery.</p>

However, there have been a number of reports of international NGO workers being refused or having difficulty in securing temporary employment permits which allow for longer stays.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.2/2">This kind of behaviour is unfortunately symptomatic of a Government which has little or no regard for the welfare of its people. We are working as part of a co-ordinated international effort to tackle the worst cholera crisis in Zimbabwe's history, to provide food aid to over 5 million people and to meet other basic humanitarian needs. As part of this, any obstructive behaviour by the Government of Zimbabwe will be raised with them directly through UN channels.</p>

These are however only part of the overall savings HMRC expects to achieve from the restructuring of its business and estate. The main reason for the reorganisation is to allow HMRC to achieve operational efficiencies and better customer service across the UK by consolidating staff and work in fewer locations and introducing new and more efficient working practices.</p>

	<p pid="c.1113W.6/1">HMRC is reorganising its business across the UK so that it can operate more efficiently, and provide better customer service, with fewer staff. Its offices in Yorkshire and the Humber have been reviewed as part of the programme to align estate with future business requirements. Staff in offices that are due to close will wherever possible relocate to one of the long-term locations. If they cannot do so, alternative redeployment options will be considered, including redeployment to another public service employer.</p>

	<p pid="c.1121W.5/3">The information is set out in the table and is subject to important qualifications. The NOMS Incident Reporting System processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide an indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute.</p>
	<p pid="c.1121W.5/4">Assault information is recorded at establishment level in four categories: Prisoner on Prisoner, Prisoner on Officer, Prisoner on Other and Other (which may include non-prisoner perpetrators e.g. visitors). The recorded incidents of assaults on prison officers are not completely exclusive to officers; establishment recording sometimes includes assaults on other prison staff in this category. Rises or falls in reported numbers from one year to the next are not a good indicator of an underlying trend for a particular prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.1121W.5/5">The numbers supplied refer to the number of individual assault incidents. The numbers refer to all incidents recorded as assaults; these may also include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact events and allegations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1121W.5/6">Ministers, NOMS and the Prison Officers' Association are collectively committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form. Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy and since mid 2007 this has been applied to the public and contracted out estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety.</p>

	<p pid="c.1126W.6/1">NOMS officials meet with NAPO officers and officials on a regular basis to discuss a wide range of Probation Service issues. Several recent meetings have included the subject of NOMS resources for (i) 2009-10 and (ii) 2010-11. In particular the chief operating officer briefed the trade unions, including NAPO, on budgets in November and the director general and chief operating officer met and discussed budgetary issues with NAPO full-time officials last week.</p>
	<p pid="c.1126W.6/2">The NOMS Management Board meet on a quarterly basis with the POA NEC to discuss all matters relating to the operational management of the Prison Service and staff. The director general informs the POA NEC of any issues in relation to resources, during the course of the meeting. Issues are then subsequently discussed. There have been no specific meetings to discuss NOMS resourcing.</p>

	<p pid="c.1127W.3/1">The Ministry of Justice is seeking efficiency savings over the next three years as set out in the Department's annual report for 2007-08. As is the case across Government, the Probation Service will need to make efficiency savings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.3/2">The NOMS agency is providing guidance that will help achieve the savings by simplifying processes and reducing administration overheads but ultimately, staffing projections and decisions on the size and scope of any-staffing reductions will rest with the 42 areas and trusts who manage probation business at the local level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.3/3">The Greater Manchester probation area is expected to achieve approximately 5.2 per cent. of national efficiency savings required from the Probation Service. No efficiency savings expectations have yet been set for probation areas and trusts for 2010-11 or 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.3/4">Although some areas of the budget have yet to be finalised, the current indicative budget allocation for the Greater Manchester probation area for 2009-10 is approximately &pound;51.1 million compared to &pound;52.6 million in 2008-09. The difference of &pound;1.5 million consists of &pound;0.3 million training provision not yet allocated due to a full review of Probation Officer training currently underway and efficiency savings of &pound;1.2 million. No indicative budgets or efficiency savings expectations have yet been set for probation areas and trusts for 2010-11 or 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.3/5">The efficiency savings requirement for 2009-10 for the Greater Manchester probation area is in line with the national efficiency savings programme for the Probation Service and the NOMS Agency. The NOMS Agency is working to determine how the saving can be achieved in ways that protect front line services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1129W.0/1">The information requested is not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Many prisoners instigate legal proceedings, of these a proportion include reference to alleged breaches of human rights. In some cases the claim will be brought wholly on a Human Rights Act (HRA) basis and in others an HRA basis of claim will be one of a number of alleged grounds of claim. Whether HRA is relied upon entirely, or in part, or not at all legal proceedings, is to a considerable extent a choice of approach on the part of the claimant's lawyers as there is a considerable overlap between pre-existing domestic law rights and human rights.</p>

	<p pid="c.1132W.7/13">The capital spend that is being brought forward from 2010-11 to 2009-10 relates to local authority devolved capital funding. It has no effect on Building Schools for the Future or on schools sixth forms. The returns received from local authorities so far indicate that the funding brought forward will be used to improve and extend existing schools at an earlier date than previously possible, rather than to build new schools which would take longer to procure. In some authorities, some of the primary programme capital expenditure may also be brought forward, but we do not expect that to affect the number of new schools built.</p>

	<p pid="c.1133W.2/1">The Government are committed to improving safeguards for children and have taken a range of actions over the past year. This includes making significant progress towards the implementation of the new vetting and barring scheme, which will further strengthen the system for preventing unsuitable adults from working with children, including in schools. In October 2008 Sir Roger Singleton, chair of the Independent Safeguarding Authority, was asked to lead a review of safeguarding arrangements in independent school, non-maintained special schools and boarding schools. The review will examine the practical operation of the current statutory and non-statutory safeguarding arrangements that apply to independent schools, non-maintained special schools and boarding schools in the maintained, non-maintained and independent sectors in England. Sir Roger expects to conclude his work in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.1133W.2/2">In April 2008, Ministers wrote to local authorities and schools to remind them of their responsibilities in relation to the issue of forced marriage and of the materials and guidance already available. In June new materials on forced marriage were launched specifically for schools and for young people. These were sent to all secondary schools, pupil referral units, local authorities and Local Safeguarding Children Boards. New statutory guidance on forced marriage was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1133W.2/3">Within schools, staff have powers to bar people from their premises if they consider them a threat or a nuisance. The DCSF, in addition, has an ongoing programme of work to prevent and tackle the bullying of children. This includes a suite of overarching and specialist guidance for schools under the title &quot;Safe To Learn&quot; which advises schools on preventing and tackling bullying related to race, religion, special educational needs, disability, homophobia and cyberbullying. New guidance on out-of-school bullying is to be launched in February 2009. The Department is also funding the Anti-Bullying Alliance and National Strategies to ensure this work is embedded in schools effectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1136W.2/4">Last October it was announced that the launch of local authority pilots in Oldham and Suffolk to allow the development of a detailed scheme for national rollout. They will become operational at the end of February 2009. In addition, the Department and Becta have taken action to support those learners for whom the local authority is their corporate parent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1136W.2/5">We have so far made available &pound;17.8 million capital funding to 109 local authorities which will benefit over 20,000 learners over the next few months. We expect to roll the grant scheme out nationally in late 2009 and will embed the rollout of technology within a programme to support parents, schools and local authorities in understanding the benefits of having technology available at home and how to make the best use of it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1140W.2/1">The Department has benefited enormously from the positive working relationship with the 23 regional pathfinders. They were particularly influential in helping to develop, test and refine the guidance we issued to local authorities in December 2007 on the requirement to develop and agree a Primary Strategy for Change. Most pathfinders have confirmed that they remain on track to complete their projects by the end of September 2009. They have also been very helpful in terms of developing and sharing good practice both nationally and regionally: the primary capital programme area of the teachernet website currently includes a range of good practice examples and case studies developed by the pathfinders. Further materials will be added over the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/2">Going forward, we will continue to work closely with pathfinders to ensure that the lessons learned in terms of design quality, sustainability and impact on outcomes informs the future development and roll out of the programme nationally.</p>

	<p pid="c.1141W.5/1">The Department has made major developments to efficiency measures over recent years and research carried out in summer 2006 indicated that the measures currently used are effective in identifying schools which achieve high levels of performance from the resources available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1141W.5/2">Building on these developments, the Department worked with three local authorities to pilot the use of efficiency benchmarking, thus strengthening the critical link between allocation of resources and pupil outcomes.</p>

We want to see more schools making the transformation from special measures to become either good or outstanding schools within one or two academic years. The report shows that if schools placed in special measures are willing to face up to the need for change and take appropriate action, they can improve very quickly and become outstanding schools</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.0/2">Several common themes were identified as having a significant impact including strong leadership and setting high expectations, the creation of a school identity which takes in the views of all members of the school community and sustaining improvement by using honest and accurate self assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.0/3">The report recommended that the Department should ensure that schools clearly understand how any external support can contribute to school improvement and consider ways to capitalise on the experience and expertise of head teachers who have successfully made the journey from special measures to good or outstanding provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.0/4">In partnership with local authorities, the Department ensures that support is carefully matched to each school's requirements and the National Strategies closely monitors the impact of the support provided.

	<p pid="c.1151W.2/1">The Department's Star Chamber has been in existence for 10 years, and assesses requests for new or revised data collections, with the aim of ensuring that they are feasible, necessary, value for money and add as small a burden to the front line as possible. In 2006, the process was enhanced with the addition of an external panel comprising local authority and head teacher representatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.1151W.2/2">The Star Chamber has performed a valuable role in ensuring burdens on schools and authorities are kept to a minimum, by scrutinising data collection plans. They have made an input into other, related, areas, including advising us about information that should be collected to inform the National Indicator Set. They have also input their views into how the Department's Simplification Plan can best fulfil the aim of cutting the data requests to the front line. In recognition of the balanced approach they have shown, the external panel have now been given the power to make the decisions about whether collection requests should go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="c.1151W.5/1">Since it began in 2003, the programme has attracted over 1,000 graduates into teaching. The programme was extended to Manchester and the Midlands in 2007; to Liverpool in 2008 and will extend to Yorkshire in 2009. In June, the Prime Minister announced an expansion in the programme from 370 places per year in 2008/09 to 850 per year in 2013/14.</p>
	<p pid="c.1151W.5/2">In its inspection report published in 2008, Ofsted reported very favourably on the teacher training provided by the programme; noting that some of the trainees were the best that it had seen in any inspections.</p>

	<p pid="c.1154W.5/1">The co-location of services is a useful way of providing a single point of access for children, young people and families, and a more effective and efficient way of professionals working together. While many areas are working hard to co-locate services and achieve the benefits this can bring, feedback suggests there are some barriers that are preventing services from co-locating as a matter of course. In response to this, we announced in the Children's Plan: One Year On progress report that we will be setting up a dedicated &pound;200 million fund to support co-location of services. This fund will run from April 2009 and will assist local areas to move ahead rapidly on capital investment projects where the co-location of services will help join up work between professionals and promote better outcomes for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.5/2">To support local areas prepare high quality applications to this fund, and to promote ongoing co-location of services through existing capital investment programmes including Building Schools for the Future, we expect to issue additional guidance on co-location during the first half of this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1155W.6/1">As part of the integrated approach to employment and skills, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and Jobcentre Plus in the North East are closely aligned to provide a range of opportunities for workless people. Through the Skills for Jobs strategy the main programmes are: The Sector Routeways Programme, providing accredited learning for those furthest from the labour market; the Personal Best Programme, which encourages long term unemployed people to learn skills through volunteer work on 2012 Olympics projects; and the Skills Solution Fund, to respond to local redundancies. An enhanced careers and advice service also provides more intensive support for workless people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.6/2">The LSC in the North East, and in the rest of England, delivers the legal right for all adults to get training up Level 2, and the guarantee of fee funding for every 18-25 year-old until they reach 25 or achieve Level 3 qualifications. Skills for Life literacy and numeracy learning&mdash;up to Level 2&mdash;are also free to the learner.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.6/3">The LSC in the North East works closely with the public, private and voluntary sector partners through the regional employability framework. The framework represents a set of principles that bring together the LSC, Jobcentre Plus, local authorities the Regional Development Agency, and a range of other partners with a shared objective to get people back into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.6/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-17">17 December 2008</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced details of a &pound;158 million package of enhanced skills support for people affected by the economic situation in England. Implementation of this package will happen at a regional level to ensure that support is tailored to local needs. Regional Ministers are co-ordinating the response, working closely with Directors from the LSC, including Chris Roberts, the Director for the North East, and Jobcentre Plus.</p>

Immediate action was taken in some areas such as the enactment of new powers for trading standards officers to search and seize copyright infringing goods. However in other areas it has been appropriate to carefully consider and work through the policy and legal issues sitting behind the recommendations. Work is continuing on the remaining recommendations and significant progress is being made.</p>

	<p pid="c.1164W.2/1">The Maritime Skills Alliance is the standard setting body for the shipping industry, and works with the Learning and Skills Council as a key stakeholder. The marine industry have apprenticeships that encompass a wide range of skills and pathways. These include pathways for those navigating and driving ships, as well as engineering, electronics, boat building and maintenance. Colleges and training providers that offer skills training also have a role in highlighting employment prospects for trainees. With about 95 per cent. of Britain's trade arriving and leaving by sea, there will be a continuous demand for skilled seafarers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1167W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1167W.5/2">The UK Government are in discussions with the provincial Government of Katanga, three international mining companies and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) about a joint development initiative to improve operating standards and capacity in the provincial mining sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and to ensure that local people benefit from Katanga's mineral wealth. One of the aims of the initiative will be to improve transparency in the mining sector by, for example, linking to implementation of the extractive industries transparency initiative (EITI) in the province. However, the initiative will not directly address the award of new mining contracts in DRC. The initiative is currently in the planning phase and we expect to begin implementation later this year. We understand the World Bank may include strengthening national government capacity to negotiate mining contracts as part of their planned mining sector reform programme.</p>

Our current information technology infrastructure is being replaced by a system with advanced power saving settings which should also offer a significant energy saving.</p>

	<p pid="c.1170W.3/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) posts overseas derive income from visa fees and consular services, and incur expenditure in running costs, programme and capital expenditure. The figures in the table represent the net running costs of missions calculated by deducting income from expenditure figures. Fluctuations in the figures from one year to another can result from changes in income from visa fees as well as increases or decreases in post expenditure. Increased expenditure in Ottawa in 2004-05 is attributed to higher than usual Programme Expenditure of &pound;4.6 million in that year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1174W.5/2">The investigation into Major-General Alavi's death is a matter for the Pakistani authorities. We do not normally interfere in another country's judicial proceedings, unless under special circumstances that country asks for our assistance. We do not normally have any consular involvement in cases concerning dual-nationals in their other country of nationality, except in cases where we judge there is a special humanitarian reason to do so, for example, cases involving minors, forced marriage or a conviction involving the death penalty, but even then only where the state of other nationality agrees. Our Commission would, however, be able to register interest in the case with local authorities if contacted by the family of Major-General Alavi.</p>

	<p pid="c.1177W.6/2">Consular staff in London, and around the world, can offer advice and support to the families of those whose relatives are either taken ill or die while they are overseas. In the case of illness or injury, with the individuals' permission, we can inform family and friends when a British national has been hospitalised, keep them up to date with developments and help transfer money from friends or relatives in the UK to meet any necessary costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.6/3">In the event of a death overseas, we ask the UK police to contact the next of kin as soon as possible. Consular staff do their best to ensure that the family's wishes are carried out, for example, regarding burial, cremation or bringing the body home. We can put the family in touch with local lawyers and local and international funeral directors. As with hospitalisation, we cannot pay expenses, but can help transfer money from friends or relatives in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.6/4">If the death occurred under suspicious circumstances, we can assist the family in dealing with the local police&mdash;and staff are available to meet family representatives in London. When there is an ongoing investigation overseas, we can ask a local UK police force to consider providing a family liaison officer, who advises and helps the family in dealing with the investigation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1191W.0/1">In the White Paper &quot;Pharmacy in England: Building on strengths - delivering the future&quot;, the Government stated that they consider that chief pharmacists of provider organisations, primary care trusts (PCTs) and other commissioners should have the lead role in ensuring that safe medication practices are embedded in patient care. To support this, and at the request of the Department, the National Patient Safety Agency hosted an event for senior pharmacists. This took place in London on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-15">15 October 2008</phrase>. The primary outcomes from the event were agreement by senior pharmacists to take on this role and the establishment of a virtual medicines safety forum where best practice can be shared. The White Paper also announced the appointment of two National Clinical Directors in pharmacy. Now in post, the National Clinical Directors will champion safe use of medicines as part of supporting the implementation of the pharmacy White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.1191W.0/2">Communications between PCTs and local pharmacy committees are typically part of the role of PCT pharmaceutical advisers and chief pharmacists. The pharmacy National Clinical Directors will take opportunities to help improve communications between PCTs and local pharmacy committees where this is necessary. NHS Employers has been commissioned by the Department to convene and lead a working group of pharmacy, medical and public representatives to formulate a series of actions to promote more effective professional relationships. This work is ongoing.</p>

	<p pid="c.1193W.2/20">The rate has dropped steadily over the past 10 years&mdash;this is partly as a result of changes in lifestyle factors (such as reductions in the numbers who smoke) and partly as a result of improvement in treatment and services for heart disease, led since 2000 by the programme set out in the National Service Framework (NSF) for CHD.</p>
	<p pid="c.1193W.2/21">While it is not possible to make a precise attribution between these two factors, research studies indicate that around approximately half of the reduction in mortality results from changes in lifestyle factors and around half to improvements in treatment and services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1193W.2/22">A key target of the NSF is to contribute to the reduction of premature mortality from CHD and other cardiovascular diseases by at least 40 per cent. by 2010. This target was met five years early. The mortality rates fell 40.3 per cent. between 2004-06 over the 1995-97 baseline. This equates to the saving of 31,000 lives when comparing 2006 with 1996.</p>

	<p pid="c.1197W.2/1">The Department has not commissioned research on the impact of the economic recessions on levels of mental health. However, we recognise that there are links between poor mental health and difficult economic circumstances and, in the current climate it is understandable that people might worry more about their finances and employment. Mental health services in England are now better prepared than ever before to provide help for people with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/2">Since 2001-02, real terms investment in adult mental health services increased by 44 per cent. (or &pound;1.7 billion) putting in place the services and staff needed to transform mental health services. The national health service spent &pound;5.53 billion on these services in 2007-08 (&pound;3.844 billion in 2001-02).</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/3">We now have 64 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists, 71 per cent. more clinical psychologists and 21 per cent. more mental health nurses than we had in 1997, providing better care and support for people with mental health problems. (Full-time equivalent).</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/4">Because of the National Service Framework and increased funding, we now have over 740 new community mental health teams offering home treatment, early intervention, or intensive support for people who might otherwise have been admitted to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/5">Further, we are investing significantly in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme with annual funding rising to &pound;173 million in the third year (2010-11), to train 3,600 extra therapists and treat 900,000 more people in those three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/6">This programme is relieving distress and transforming lives by offering effective intervention and treatment choice to people with depression and anxiety disorders and improving the collection, recording and measuring of patients' health outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/7">There were 35 new services launched last month, with more than 800 therapy workers now offering this support to people who need it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1202W.5/1">Regulations do not allow for schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs to be provided through a repeat prescription, but schedule 4 and 5 controlled drugs may be provided. Guidance to care providers, entitled &quot;The handling of medicines in social care&quot; is published by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB). This includes guidance about obtaining prescribed medicines in general; it is not specific to controlled drugs. It also includes general information about the use of controlled drugs in care services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.5/2">Regulation 13 of the Care Homes Regulations 2001 requires registered providers to make arrangements for the recording, handling and, safe keeping, safe administration and disposal of medicines received into the care home. This applies to all medicines, including controlled drugs. The National Minimum Standards (NMS) contain detailed requirements, governing the protection of service users, the safe receipt, administration, recording, storage and disposal of medicines in the home. Controlled drugs are specifically referred to in the NMS, which also refer providers to the RPSGB Guidance, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations 1973 and other relevant legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.5/3">The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) does not provide specific guidance to care providers about repeat prescriptions for controlled drugs. During regulatory inspections, CSCI looks for a robust procedure within a care home to request repeat prescriptions residents, irrespective of whether they are for controlled drugs. Failure to obtain prescribed medicines, or occasions when a care service orders more prescriptions than a person needs&mdash;for example when the medicines are prescribed for use as and when needed it would be identified to the registered provider/manager and included in the inspection report.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.5/4">CSCI's most recent guidance on reports about serious incidents in care homes includes a requirement to report every error involving a controlled drug. However, these are identified to individual services and are not collated nationally. CSCI pharmacist inspectors look at the handling of controlled drugs in the services they visit. CSCI recently carried out an analysis of its findings between April and December 2008; overdose was not an issue identified as a problem area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.5/5">If a serious incident is reported to CSCI under regulation 37 of the Care Homes Regulations, which governs notification of death, illness and other events in care homes, it is followed up by the Regulation Inspector/Regulation Manager associated with that service. Depending on circumstances, they may refer the issue to the pharmacist inspector. It is one of CSCI's referral criteria to contact a pharmacist inspector and this may result in inspection of the care home and a resulting report with requirements and recommendations. If the overdose is a result of an incorrect prescription from the general practitioner, the pharmacist inspector will liaise via the Local Intelligence Network through the NHS Accountable Officer at the relevant primary acre trust, who will deal with the issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.1222W.8/1">The police can require a person to take a screening breath test if they reasonably suspect that person of drink driving, or of committing a moving traffic offence or of driving a vehicle involved in a road traffic accident. Use of this power is an operational matter for the police. The percentage of tests which are positive can be affected by various factors, including the numbers drink driving, the number of tests administered and where, when and on which motorists the police administer them.</p>

	<p pid="c.1225W.3/1">The purpose of the national DNA database (NDNAD) is to match DNA profiles taken from individuals with those taken from crime scenes. It therefore holds only the information necessary for this function, and does not contain criminal records or information on whether those on it are in prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.1225W.3/2">There are good reasons for believing that the great majority of the prison population has a profile on the NDNAD. Police forces have had the power to retain DNA taken from those convicted of recordable offences since the establishment of the DNA database in 1995. For the first few years this power was exercised in relation to more serious offenders, but from 2000 onwards additional funding was made available under the DNA expansion programme to make it standard practice to take samples from all offenders. In April 2004, an amendment to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 came into effect which extended powers to take DNA samples to all those arrested for recordable offences. Following this, taking a DNA sample in the custody suite has become routine procedure. In addition, two prisoner sampling projects have been undertaken, most recently in 2003, to take DNA from any prisoner who had not already been sampled, for example because they had been imprisoned before DNA sampling was widely practiced.</p>

	<p pid="c.1226W.2/1">Raising awareness of human trafficking is central to our approach to combating human trafficking. This is an issue that is being led by the UK Human Trafficking Centre through the development of its Blue Blindfold campaign and its work to increase awareness among law enforcement agencies. Any costs associated with this work has been met from within the overall budget of the UKHTC. Additionally, much work has been undertaken to raise awareness within the relevant law enforcement and other agencies which are likely to come into contact with victims of human trafficking. The costs associated with this work have been met from within existing budgets.</p>
	<p pid="c.1226W.2/2">In addition to these costs we have spent &pound;136,000 on raising awareness through a project run in conjunction with the International Organisation for Migration in Romania and Bulgaria and on the &quot;Walk in a Punter&quot; poster campaign in Nottingham and London in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1229W.6/1">No asylum claim from a person claiming to be of Eritrean or Somali nationality has been refused on the basis of language analysis alone. Language analysis is a tool used by asylum case-owners in the UK Border Agency to help in the decision making process. It is only one of several factors that contribute to grant or refusal.</p>

	<p pid="c.1239W.2/1">Under the provisions of the Serious Crime Act 2007, the Serious Organised Crime Agency was not given the remit or powers to assist partner agencies with criminal confiscation cases in the same way as the Assets Recovery Agency. As a consequence SOCA is not in a position to support partner agencies by taking criminal case referrals in the same way that ARA did. SOCA considers requests from partners for advice or investigative assistance in criminal confiscation cases on a case-by-case basis, but there is no referral or adoption process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1239W.2/2">ARA's criminal confiscation cases were transferred to SOCA with the merger. SOCA has retained ARA's full powers in relation to these specific cases, up until the point of the completion. SOCA does not however have ARA's full powers in relation to criminal confiscation cases for SOCA-initiated cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.1240W.0/1">The enforcement of any speed limit is an operational matter for the police, and the Department has not issued guidance in this area. We would however expect 20 mph zones to be largely self-enforcing through traffic calming measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1240W.0/2">The decision to introduce a 20 mph zone and the installation of traffic calming measures are matters for individual local authorities. The Department for Transport issues guidance to local authorities on the factors to take into account in reaching such decisions, including the need to consult with the police and other interested parties.</p>
