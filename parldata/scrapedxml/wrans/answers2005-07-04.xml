	<p pid=".1W.6/2">In order to avoid confusion, I should explain that the Environment Agency has refused to issue a Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) permit for the site in question, rather than a licence. Under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002 all landfill sites operating under the terms of a waste management licence are required to apply for a PPC permit which places more stringent requirements on the operator, in line with the EU Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/3">The Environment Agency has refused the application for a Pollution Prevention and Control permit for Beddingham landfill site, as submitted, on two grounds. Firstly, leachate from the landfill currently poses an unacceptable risk to groundwater surrounding the site. The application as submitted does not adequately address this issue. Secondly, improvements to the site's liner system (intended to control the escape of leachate and gas from the site) are required. This has not been adequately addressed in the application either. It should however be noted that the site poses no significant risk to human health.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/4">Under the regulations, the operator has six months to appeal the refusal or make a fresh application. Under the regulations, the site may continue to receive waste in the meantime. In the event that the operator decides to appeal the decision or makes a fresh application, the site can also continue to receive waste while these matters are dealt with. Negotiations between the operator and the Environment Agency are ongoing to resolve the reasons for refusal. It is likely that these negotiations will conclude with a new application for a PPC permit for this site.</p>

	<p pid=".2W.2/2">Directive 2004/28/EC amends directive 2001/82/EC, which sets out requirements for the authorisation and control of veterinary medicines. It was published by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase> following a major review of EU medicines legislation. Member states are required to implement its provisions by <phrase class="date" code="">30 October 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.2/3">During negotiations in Brussels, a requirement to restrict the distribution of veterinary medicinal products for food producing animals, including honeybees, to prescription supply was presented with the intention of strengthening the control of these medicines and related consumer safeguards. While there are valid reasons for restricting some veterinary medicines to prescription supply, we do not consider this appropriate for all medicines for use in food-producing animals. Neither the commission nor the majority of member states supported the UK view and the requirement was consequently taken forward in the amending directive. We are aware that this provision has the potential to increase the costs to beekeepers of obtaining medicines by incurring additional veterinary charges.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.2/4">However, the UK successfully negotiated the inclusion of a provision that allows medicines that meet certain criteria, to be agreed subsequently, to be exempt from the prescription requirement. This provision also allows the current distribution arrangements to remain until a list of exemption criteria is agreed, or until January 2007 if no list has been agreed by then. This exemption list is to be proposed by the commission and voted on by the member states. Officials at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) are well aware of the concerns expressed by beekeepers and continue to argue strongly for medicines authorised for use in bees to be included on this list. The commission has not yet proposed a list and it may be some time before the outcome is known.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.2/5">In addition to pressing for bee medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement, we have proposed new distribution categories for the UK that include tiered categories of prescription only medicines (ROMs). If adopted, these will comply with the directive's provisions while allowing veterinary medicines for food-producing animals that are currently available without prescription to continue to be supplied by pharmacists or registered merchants without the need to involve a veterinary surgeon.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.2/6">VMD officials are working closely with beekeeper representatives and are making arrangements for the beekeepers to speak to a meeting of EU medicines regulators under the UK presidency.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.8/2">The placement of materials in the maritime area (which includes geological structures under the seabed) is regulated internationally by the London Convention and the 1996 protocol to the Convention, and by the OSPAR Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic. The 1996 protocol to the London Convention is not yet in force, but has been ratified by the United Kingdom and we would expect to abide by its provisions.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.8/4">Under both conventions, there is no bar on the use of carbon dioxide for operational purposes. This implies that carbon sequestration in association with enhanced oil recovery would be permitted.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.8/5">The contracting parties to the OSPAR convention agreed a position statement on carbon sequestration in 2004. This established that in other certain circumstances carbon sequestration is compatible with the convention. The position is set out in full in Annex 12 to the summary record of the 2004 meeting of the OSPAR Commission. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House, and it is also available on the OSPAR web site, <a href="http://www.ospar.org">www.ospar.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.8/6">The United Kingdom raised the issue of the carbon sequestration during the 2004 consultative meeting of the parties to the London Convention. The legal position has not yet been established. It was agreed to set up an inter-sessional correspondence group to consider the legal issues raised under both the convention and the 1996 protocol. The UK is coordinating the work of this group. The issue will be discussed again at the 2005 consultative meeting in October, when results of the inter-sessional work will be considered.</p>

	<p pid=".5W.3/1">The Environment Agency's assessment is that Canvey Island is protected by sea defences to a standard which is among the highest in the country. The sea walls around Canvey Island currently provide protection against coastal flooding in all but the most extreme conditions (those with a probability of occurrence of less than 0.1 per cent. in any one year). By the year 2030, on the assumption of no further improvements to the current defences, it is estimated that protection would be slightly reduced to a level effective against events with a probability equal to 0.1 per cent. in any one year.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.3/2">The Environment Agency has initiated a project, 'Thames Estuary 2100', to address the impacts of future climate change and sea level rise on the Thames estuary (including Canvey Island). More accurate assessments of the standards of sea walls in the Thames estuary are being undertaken as part of this overall project. Once this work has been completed, the need for any greater protection can be assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.3/3">The final Plan of the Thames Estuary 2100 project is due in 2008.</p>

	<p pid=".5W.6/1">I understand the Environment Agency has not itself issued any specific national guidance on single-storey development in areas susceptible to flooding. However, it has worked closely with the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA), who have recently issued guidance on the development of bungalows and single-storey dwellings in areas at risk of flooding, as part of CIRIA Guidance &quot;Development and flood risk&mdash;Guidance to the construction industry&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.6/2">Government policy for effective national management of flood risk is to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 &quot;Development and Flood Risk&quot; cautions planning authorities to take particular care in respect of proposed single-storey developments behind existing sea defences because of the speed of flooding in such circumstances combined with no means of escape to an upper floor.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.2/1">It is an offence under section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to thrown down, drop or otherwise deposit any litter in any place in the area of a principal litter authority which is open to the air. A person found guilty of the offence may be fined up to &pound;2,500 in a magistrates court. Section 88 of the 1990 Act also enables local authorities to issue fixed penalties for the offence as an alternative to prosecution. The level of fixed penalties in England is currently set at &pound;50.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.2/2">Government have recently introduced new legislation to discourage the dropping of litter through the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. Until <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase> this year, it was only an offence to drop litter on land to which the public have access. This has now been extended to cover all types of land, including private land and land covered by water, sending out a clear message that the dropping of litter anywhere is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.2/3">The Act also contains changes to the fixed penalty notice regime which will be brought into force in April next year. It will enable local authorities to authorise officers other than their own employees to issued fixed penalties for litter, and additionally, will extend this power to parish councils. This will help to discourage littering by widening the range of officers that are able to take immediate enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.2/4">At the same time, local authorities will be given the freedom to set the level of fixed penalties themselves within a range set out by the Secretary of State in regulations, and to offer discounts for early payment. A standard default amount of &pound;75 will apply if the local authority chooses not to exercise this power. The Act will make it an offence for someone to fail to supply their name and address or to give a false name or address, when requested to do so by an authorised officer serving an FPN. This will deter people from dropping litter by increasing on-the-spot fines and giving enforcement officers more effective powers.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.2/5">The Government are seeking to discourage littering not only through improved legislation and enforcement, but also by educating people about the responsible disposal of litter and highlighting the link between irresponsible disposal, poor health, a degraded local environment, and levels of anti-social behaviour. It is for this reason that Defra provides grant-funding to the environmental charity ENCAMS to conduct public awareness campaigns on its behalf. These are targeted at specific groups to reduce types of littering that have been identified as particularly problematic or prevalent. For example, the focus this year is on youth littering and smoking-related litter.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.8/1">The are currently two sets of Regulations which cover packaging in the UK; both of which encourage producers to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Producers can therefore save money if they use less packaging. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the packaging volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.8/2">Both Regulations have led to decreases in the amount of packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging that is produced in the first place. The Government's Advisory Committee on Packaging is working with industry to find ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.8/3">Although legislation is one way of reducing packaging consumers also have a part to play. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought 'loose food' rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers would be more inclined to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.2/1">The management of packaging waste is already addressed in the UK through the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended). As an extension of the 'polluter pays principle', the Regulations oblige businesses in the packaging chain, which have an annual turnover of more than &pound;2 million and which handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year, to recover and recycle a specified amount of packaging waste each year which is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. These Regulations are intended to drive minimisation of packaging and packaging waste, encourage reuse of packaging and increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. They have succeeded so far in raising the recycling rate for packaging waste from around 27 per cent. in 1997 to 49.5 per cent. in 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.3/1">The Environment Agency and its predecessor organisations have performed a biannual qualitative fisheries survey on the tidal River Thames since 1992. However, the dynamic nature of estuaries, with highly mobile and widely dispersed fish populations means that no quantitative data is available to estimate fish numbers using currently available methodologies. This is the case throughout Europe for estuarine fish populations. Recent EC FAIR (June 2000) research <sup>1</sup> identified our current fisheries monitoring programme as 'Best Practice'. The primary objective of this survey programme is to provide a consistent data set to detect trends and new species in the Thames.</p>

	<p pid=".16W.11/1">The coming into force earlier this year of EU Regulation 785/2004 obliged almost all UK operators of non-commercial aircraft to meet minimum requirements for passenger and third party insurance. In some cases aircraft operators have had to raise their level of cover, which has resulted in an increase in premium. We are aware of only one case where this has caused difficulty in relation to classic aircraft, but through the efforts of the' insurance industry and a commercial sponsor, this problem has been resolved. The European Commission is aware of the difficulties faced by some owners of classic aircraft and has agreed to consider an amendment to the Regulation.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.6/1">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency performs to a high standard and has the resources it needs for the functions it carries out. The Chief Executive and his Management Team keep the skills of staff under review as part of the Agency's approach to learning and development. Specifically in relation to those working in coastguard rescue co-ordination centres, the Agency uses a concept of &quot;Training Ahead of Need&quot; for Coastguard Watch Assistants aspiring to be Watch Officers, which has the support of the PCS Union. Peer reviews are also used to test, develop and support the core skills of search planning and co-ordination.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.3/1">Concern has been expressed to DCMS by village halls as to the duties of an individual who is specified on a premises licence as the designated premises supervisor (DPS). The role of a DPS only applies when a premises licence authorises the supply of alcohol. It is not relevant in respect of other licensable activities such as regulated entertainment. While the DPS has certain responsibilities under the 2003 Act, it is important that this is kept in perspective. The main purpose of having a DPS is to provide a primary point of contact for authorities investigating problems, and to ensure that any necessary preventative measures are taken to promote the licensing objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.3/2">For example, we have clarified that the DPS does not have to be physically present at the premises for sales of alcohol to take place there. In addition, regular users can take out their own premises licence with their own named DPS or other hirers could be asked to use temporary event notices and there would therefore be no need to have a DPS for those events.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.3/3">These arrangements are important in the interests of those living near village halls. It is vital that there is a proper balance between the needs of local residents and of those conducting licensable activities at such halls. We believe that the Act strikes the correct balance, but we continue to discuss with representatives of village halls in ways in which the burdens involved can be best managed.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.2/1">Technical issues relating to the graphite cores of advanced gas-cooled reactor power stations are complex technical matters for British Energy and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. Therefore, I have asked the Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations to write to the hon. Member. The Government's position on new nuclear power stations remains the same as stated in the 2003 White Paper&mdash;we are keeping the option of new build open. Before any decision were taken to proceed with the building of new nuclear power stations there would need to be the fullest public consultation and the publication of a further White Paper setting out our proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/2">The 'West Midlands Regional Energy Strategy' published in November 2004 by GOWM, The West Midlands Regional Assembly and Advantage West Midlands, also recognises the need for the increased use of renewable energy resources as one of its four key objectives and sets out four priorities under this banner along with identifying those organisations with a lead responsibility and milestones.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/3">The Regional Planning Guidance for the West Midlands published in June 2004 by the GOWM includes a chapter on Energy Policies which includes renewable energy, base lining its use in the region at 0.1 per cent. in 2000, identifying the potential to increase this to at least 15 per cent. and encouraging local authorities to encourage renewable energy proposals in their development plans. This includes location guidance and the environmental impact of its generation.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.0/1">The Air Travel Organisers' Licence (ATOL) regulations use the same definition of &quot;package&quot; as the Package Travel Directive and the UK regulations which implement the Directive to define their coverage in respect of package travel organisers. Any tour operator which provides flight-based packages has no choice but to hold an ATOL or to be acting for a disclosed principal which holds an ATOL. If a tour operator were to legally operate outside of the ATOL scheme they would need to alter their products in such a way that they no longer constituted a package. Since the definition in the ATOL Regulations and the Directive is the same, it follows that if a product falls outside of one it will fall outside of the other and the UK would have no obligations under the Directive in respect of that business.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.0/2">I am very aware of the views of consumer representatives' on this high profile issue for the leisure travel sector. I understand they have made those views known to both the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport as they consider the arguments for change to the current regime.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.0/3">The Civil Aviation Authority has undertaken extensive work in order to assess consumers' understanding of financial protection in this market. This assessment was reported in the CAA's advice to the Government (Financial Protection for Air Travellers and Package Holiday Makers in the Future, CAA Advice to Government, July 2004) and in their consultation document of July 2003. These reported the results of their consultation with consumer organisations and also the results of research carried out for the CAA into customer expectations and their perceptions of protection in the holiday market (Financial Protection for Air Holiday, Final Report: NFO Transport and Tourism). These documents and reports are available at <a href="http://www.atol.org.uk">www.atol.org.uk</a>.</p>

Officials tracked the progress of negotiations with China Brilliance Automotive, TATA, Proton and the owners of the former Daewoo plant in Warsaw and Ministers made representations at the company's request to assist in certain of these negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".55W.8/2">During 2004 it became clear that the proposed alliance with SAIC was critical to MG Rover's future. Ministers and officials did everything possible to secure the deal when it became clear that matters were coming to a head earlier this year. Senior officials flew to Shanghai for discussions with SAIC and the Government stood ready to provide a bridging loan of over &pound;100 million. It was a devastating blow to all those involved, but particularly the workers and their families, that those efforts proved unsuccessful&mdash;with the company's entry into administration being the inevitable consequence.</p>

This to be achieved through the reduction or elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers. Our commitment to sustainable development underpins our rating stance. Consistent with the Doha trade negotiations mandate the UK also fully supports the reduction or elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods. The UK does not support any steps in the NAMA negotiations that would deny us, or others, the ability to enforce or implement necessary and proportionate environmental protection measures.</p>

	<p pid=".64W.6/1">In the civil bid round held in April 2004 for the award of new solicitor General Civil Contracts with the Legal Services Commission (LSC) over 90 per cent. of solicitor firms applied to renew their contracts. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, 2,643 solicitors' offices operated under a Criminal Defence Service contract compared with 2,669 as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".64W.6/2">Reasons cited by those solicitors' firms that are withdrawing from legal aid work have included remuneration and profitability. However, the Department's Review of Supply, Demand and Purchasing Arrangements concluded that the legal aid market&mdash;for both civil and criminal work&mdash;could absorb a small increase in demand for services without the need for an increase in remuneration. Independent research contained in the &quot;Financial Benchmarking Survey 2004&quot; produced by the Law Management Section of The Law Society suggests that there may be a positive correlation between the profitability of a firm and it's handling of a moderate amount of legal aid work. This indicates that the discipline of undertaking legal aid work could result in operational efficiencies, which extend across the firm.</p>

	<p pid=".70W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Charlotte Copeland to Mr. Paul Goodman, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-04">4 July 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about The Rent Service, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, about the criteria used to set the broad rental market areas in the housing benefit pathfinders, how often they will be reviewed, how they will be monitored, and how up-to-date information used by rent officers is when setting rents for Housing Benefit purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/5" class="indent">The criteria used by rent officers to set the broad rental market areas are covered in the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) (Local Housing Allowance) Amendment Order 2003 [Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 2398]. This defines the broad rental market area as:</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/6" class="indent">&quot; . . . an area&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/7" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> comprising two or more distinct areas of residential accommodation, each distinct area of residential accommodation adjoining at least one other in the area;</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/8" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> within which a person could reasonably be expected to live having regard to facilities and services for the purposes of health, education, recreation, personal banking and shopping, taking account of the distance of travel, by public and private transport, to and from facilities and services of the same type and similar standard; and</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/9" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> containing residential premises of a variety of types, and including such premises held on a variety of tenancies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/10" class="indent">The broad rental market areas are reviewed on a monthly basis, with a more in depth review carried out each quarter.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/11" class="indent">The broad rental market areas are monitored through the monthly and quarterly review process and The Rent Service's own internal quality assurance processes.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/12" class="indent">Rent officers continually research the private rented sector for market evidence of lettings of property and accommodation where the rent is being paid without the aid of housing benefit. The Rent Service's market evidence database is therefore continually being updated with the latest information available.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/13" class="indent">Rent officers use the most up to date market evidence available when setting Local Housing Allowances, Local Reference Rents and Single Room Rents. The Rent Service's guidelines are that market evidence used should be, in the main, no more than 3 months old, but with a maximum of six months if this is necessary in some cases.</p>

As the work from various locations was transferred to the centre there was an increase in the number of telephone enquiries from customers, which caused a backlog of work. Interim measures were put in place to alleviate the immediate problems; these included the opening of additional telephone lines and the deployment of staff from outside the BPC to speed up the processing of claims. The situation at the BPC was monitored daily by local management to ensure any telephone delays were minimised.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.2/8" class="indent">The increase in the number of telephone lines coming into the office helped to improve the situation and it will continue to improve as more staff become available in the BPC over the coming weeks and as more work is done to further increase the telephone capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.2/9" class="indent">As the figures show there has been a significant improvement over the past month in processing new applications reflecting the hard work of local management and staff.</p>

	<p pid=".76W.6/4" class="indent">The most recently available information is for deaths registered in 2004 and deaths occurring in 2003. Relevant figures are only readily available for deaths where the underlying cause was either related to drug poisoning or directly related to alcohol (alcohol abuse, dependence and poisoning, and diseases directly related to alcohol use). It is not possible to identify from death certificates which substance was the primary cause when more than one was involved.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.6/5" class="indent">Figures for alcohol-related deaths to usual residents of Stroud and Gloucestershire registered in the years 2000 to 2004 are given in the table below. ONS compiles a special database to analyse mortality from drug-related poisoning adding more detail than is available on routine annual extracts. This database is compiled using the annual occurrences extract of mortality data. Figures showing deaths related to drug poisoning involving controlled drugs occurring in the years 1999 to 2003, to usual residents of Stroud and Gloucestershire, are given in the table below. Information on deaths involving illegal drugs is not available, as how the deceased obtained a particular drug is not recorded at death registration.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.6/6" class="indent">It should be noted that the figures on drug-related poisoning are not directly comparable to the figures on alcohol for the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid=".76W.6/7" class="indent">The figures on drugs do not include long-term effects of drug taking, whereas the figures on alcohol include cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.6/8" class="indent">Deaths from poisoning which involved both drugs and alcohol are coded as due to drug poisoning, in accordance with international rules for coding cause of death.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.6/9" class="indent">The figures on alcohol include only those where the underlying cause was alcohol-related. The figures on specific drugs include any mention of a substance on a death related to drug poisoning.</p>

	<p pid=".79W.3/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="1993-04-21">21 April 1993</phrase> the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Tom Sackville announced in Parliament that the Registrar General would be willing to consider particular applications for information to be extracted from the 1901 Census and the 1911 Censuses if it would enable the applicant to establish a legal entitlement such as an inheritance. Such authority would be given only where the information was not available from any other source and was clearly requisite for establishing the entitlement in question.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.3/7" class="indent">Mr Sackville went on to say that the Registrar General would wish to be satisfied from documentary evidence as to the identity of the applicant. Where the desired information from the census form related to a living person other than the applicant, that person's consent would be required before the information would be released.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.3/8" class="indent">The census records to which the concessions applied were held by the Public Record Office (now National Archives) and under the legislation existing at the time&mdash;the Public Records Act Section 5(4) it was not unlawful for the Keeper of the Public Records to permit a person to inspect any records if he had obtained special authority in that behalf from the Registrar General. The Registrar General gave authority for searches to be made in respect of those applications which satisfied the conditions of the concessions.</p>

	<p pid=".82W.2/1">The updated drug strategy 2002 sets out HMG's approach to tackling drugs in the UK. Responsibility for driving forward the supply side activity rests with those law enforcement agencies and other bodies engaged in tackling drug supply, working together as the concerted inter-agency drug action group (CIDA).</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/2">CIDA agencies recently agreed a new delivery strategy, which aims to improve our performance and to achieve a sustained impact on the availability of class A drugs in our communities, thereby reducing the harm that drugs cause. It broadly covers four areas:</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/3" class="indent">Harm reduction in UK communities: Measuring the impact of supply side activity in terms of the outcomes in UK communities.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/4" class="indent">Intelligence process: Adopting an intelligence led process to target activity more effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/5" class="indent">Zonal linkages: Prioritising efforts across and within geographical &quot;zones&quot; of action, trying to maximise our impact.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/6" class="indent">Street level up: Testing a new approach of tracing the supply chain back from street level problems (called &quot;street level up&quot;), and then hitting it in a co-ordinated way.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/7">As for drug detection technology, until recently expenditure on proven drug detection technologies had been limited by their capability and value for money. However, technology research in port and airport security dramatically increased post 9/11, and in the last 18 months we established that systems primarily built for this purpose were readily adaptable for identifying drug concealments. Working in partnership with manufacturers we have established a project aimed at purchasing new systems and providing testing opportunities, at border controls to inform further development and enhance workable solutions.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/8">Post 1998 and prior to the project we spent in the region of &pound;10 million on technology and scientific aids to provide additional tools for front line officers in the fight against drugs smuggling. In these early stages of the new project we have contributed &pound;300,000 to the research and development of two new technologies, including capital for the purchase of a prototype.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/9">The project has identified a number of new technologies for the short, medium and long-term, which will see further substantial investment in new and more reliable product-specific technology to combat drug importations more successfully.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.2/1">There are no unfunded pension liabilities of the European Community Institutions. Like almost all member states, the European Union has a funded pension scheme for its civil servants. The pension scheme for civil servants of European Community Institutions is funded partly by the officials themselves, who contribute to one third of the scheme's financing, with the balance funded by member states through the annual European Community Budget. The Staff Regulation (Council Regulation 723/2004 amending the Staff Regulation) governs the funding of the pension scheme for civil servants of European Community Institutions. The Financial Regulation (Council Regulation 1605/2002) requires the Commission to keep accounting records. In the Commission's balance sheet, a provision is entered on the liabilities side in respect of the estimated amount of pension rights (the amount is based on an actuarial study); however this is balanced by an entry on the assets side to reflect the undertaking given by member states to the Communities to pay Community pensions.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.3/1">Substantial progress has been made on both aid and debt relief in recent months. The EU has made an historic commitment to double its aid from current levels of around US$40 billion to over $80 billion in 2010 and on debt G8 Finance Ministers have agreed debt relief worth up to $55 billion. The total debt service (principal and interest) of the 18 HIPCs due to the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank in 2005 is $560 million.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.3/2">Finance Ministers agreed that the G8 debt relief proposal should be put forward for agreement at the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in September. Once it is agreed it will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.3/3">The UK believes that debt relief should be funded through additional resources. In this way, it is an important source of additional funds for countries to spend on poverty reduction and the investments in health, education, water and infrastructure that are essential if the MDGs are to be met. We continue to lobby others to support this view.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.3/4">Our share of the G8 debt agreement will be funded through the additional resources allocated to DFID in the recent Spending Review: by 2007&ndash;08, total UK aid will rise to nearly &pound;6.5 billion a year, representing 0.47 per cent. of GNI, a real terms increase of 140 per cent. since 1997. Part of the increase in DFID's budget was earmarked for the provision of further debt relief, and it is these earmarked funds that will be used. Our multilateral debt assistance will be in addition to generous UK contributions to the IDA 14 and AfDF X replenishments.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.3/5">It is essential that the resources freed up by debt relief are used to support poverty reduction. For this reason, the G8 debt agreement provides debt relief only to those countries that have demonstrated their commitment to reducing poverty through implementing a successful Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). PRSPs include strategies for investment in health, education and water and sanitation to help countries to reach the Millennium Development Goals. The countries that qualify for the G8 debt agreement have reached completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative have demonstrated their commitment to poverty reduction and sound financial management.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.3/6">In order to reach completion point, a country must maintain macroeconomic stability under a PRGF-supported program, carry out key structural and social reforms, and implement a PRSP for one year upon which Bank and Fund staff prepare recommendations to their respective boards for consideration. The final determination is made by the boards of the two institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.3/7">The World Bank and IMF are both undertaking reviews of their approach to conditionality this year. In the context of these reviews, the UK will work to ensure that these institutions only support programmes which are agreed rather than imposed, and where benchmarks to assess progress are focussed on the impact of a country's overall policy programme rather than any particular policy decision.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.0/4" class="indent">In the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), deaths involving enterocolitis due to <i>Clostridium difficile</i> can all be identified from the code A04.7. Enterocolitis is the commonest illness caused by <i>C. difficile</i> infection. For causes other than enterocolitis that are also known to be associated with <i>C. difficile</i>, it is not possible to identify from ICD codes alone the number of deaths where <i>C. difficile</i> actually contributed to the death. For this reason, the only routinely available mortality statistics on <i>C. difficile</i> are those where it was associated with enterocolitis. These figures were provided in answer to a question from Mr David Lidington MP, Hansard Written Answer 3764, page 49W.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.3/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) are responsible for enforcement of controls in respect of smuggling of illegal firearms into the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.3/2">To detect and prevent the smuggling of firearms HMRC deploy resources according to risk, through intelligence-led and targeted activity with teams, including national and regional strike forces, that work flexibly to match any changing threat and whose training includes recognition of firearms and their component parts. HMRC target all types of traffic arriving at UK ports and airports both from other EU member states and from non-EU countries.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.3/4">In all cases where such goods are detected HMRC will seize them, share the information with NCIS and police and agree with police the arrangements for any follow up investigation. HMRC will normally seek to prosecute in any case involving a deliberate attempt to smuggle a firearm into the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.3/5">As part of the Government's commitment to reduce gun crime, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 included a provision to increase the maximum term of imprisonment for smuggling prohibited weapons (other than stun guns and self defence sprays) from seven years to 10.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.3/1">The personal allowance for income tax and the primary threshold for national insurance contributions would have to be raised to over &pound;9,000 to exempt all individuals earning the national minimum wage and working a full working week of 35 hours.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.3/2">This would cost tens of billions of pounds and would provide the greatest benefit to higher rate taxpayers, for whom any increase would be worth four times as much to them as starting rate taxpayers. It would also remove millions of individuals from building up entitlement from benefits such as the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.3/3">The Government prefer to use measures that provide benefits to those that need it most.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.3/4">Unlike the personal allowance tax credits can reduce a family's net tax bill below zero through payments and can provide support tailored to the family's circumstances, such as the number of children in a family.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.3/5">Together with child benefit the system of tax credits offsets income tax liabilities so that the effective point at which a family with two children starts paying tax on net is now &pound;21,200 and from April 2007 will be over &pound;22,000.</p>

	<p pid=".98W.5/1">Overpayments of tax credits are not identified until family circumstances and income are finalised after the end of the financial year. However, tax credit awards can be adjusted during the year to take account of a change in circumstances or income. Where the amount payable is reduced, payments are adjusted with the aim of paying out the right amount for the year as a whole. This is explained in HMRC's Code of Practice 26 &quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?&quot;, available on our website at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/leaflets/cop26.htm">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/leaflets/cop26.htm</a>.This is part of the normal operation of the tax credit system, and no count of such occurrences is maintained.</p>

	<p pid=".106W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.0/2">The Home Office budget to promote volunteering and the wider voluntary and community sector has increased almost tenfold from &pound;16 million in 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;153 million in 2005&ndash;06. Some examples of the initiatives that the budget has been used for, include:</p>
	<p pid=".106W.0/3">The Time Limited Development Fund (TLDF)&mdash;a &pound;13.5 million boost for volunteering in deprived communities. 113 voluntary organisations were selected in May 2002 for funding over the years 2002&ndash;03 to 2004&ndash;05. The organisations worked in deprived areas across England to help build the capacity of local communities by significantly increasing the number of local people involved in voluntary services and community support.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.0/4">ChangeUp&mdash;a capacity building and infrastructure framework for the voluntary and community sector. ChangeUp is being supported by an initial investment of &pound;80 million to be spent by March 2006, and a further &pound;70 million for years 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.0/5">Futurebuilders&mdash;the Government set up the &pound;125 million Futurebuilders Fund, an innovative programme designed to assist front line voluntary and community organisations to build their capacity to deliver public services by providing tailored loan based funding packages.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.0/6">The Russell Commission&mdash;the Government are allocating &pound;45 million between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08 to support the implementation of the Commission's recommendations. This will be supported by a matched volunteering opportunities fund, which aims to attract at least &pound;55 million from private sector sources.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.0/7">International Year of the Volunteer&mdash;The National Centre for Volunteering, in consultation with the Home Office and key volunteering-involving organisations, agreed a structure for the delivery of the International Year of the Volunteer which took place in 2001. Those involved in the programme considered the Year to be a success. The Active Community Unit at the Home Office provided &pound;297,229 core funding for the Year. Furthermore, 2005 is the Year of the Volunteer. The aims and objectives of the Year are to create awareness of, increase the opportunities for and encourage more people to get involved in volunteering. The Year is owned by volunteers, led by a partnership between Community Service Volunteers (CSV) and the Volunteering England consortium, and supported by the Home Office. The Volunteering England consortium consists of Volunteering England, community sector. TimeBank, YouthNet UK, The Media Trust, Business in the Community (BitC) and Youth Action Network. The Home Office spending on the Year is illustrated in table one. The devolved administrations are funding and hosting their own campaigns and initiatives to support the year and these differ in each country.</p>

	<p pid=".108W.3/1">The Home Office has provided more than &pound;13 million over three years until March 2006 with the aim of kick starting abandoned vehicle removal in London. From the outset, it was agreed that the scheme would be funded for three years, with the long-term goal for all partners to have in place good procedures and practice to continue vehicle removal after the funding ended.</p>
	<p pid=".108W.3/2">We are delighted with the success of the Scrap It scheme which has enabled more than 30,000 (98 per cent.) vehicles confirmed as untaxed or abandoned to be removed within 72 hours of reporting. This has made a significant impact on the numbers of vehicles reported as abandoned, which fell to 220,000 vehicles in 2003&ndash;04. In April 2005, the British Crime Survey also recorded a significant reduction in people perceiving abandoned or burnt out cars as a very or fairly big problem in their area.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.8/2">Asylum and human rights claims by Zimbabwean nationals, like those from nationals of every other country, are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN refugee convention and the European convention on human rights (ECHR). We do not consider it appropriate to grant indefinite leave to remain purely on the basis of a person's nationality.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.8/3">As with any other nationality, Zimbabweans who meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 convention are granted asylum. If they do not qualify for asylum, but there are other circumstances that make them particularly vulnerable and engage our obligations under the ECHR, they are granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave. If their application is refused, they have a right of appeal to the independent asylum and immigration tribunal. If an asylum and human rights claim is refused, and any appeal to the independent asylum and immigration tribunal is unsuccessful, that means that it would be safe for that particular individual to return to Zimbabwe. It is in this way we ensure that we provide protection to those Zimbabweans who need it.</p>

	<p pid=".126W.2/2">The Advisory Council found that there were several serious consequences of prolonged cannabis use, which included that repeated cannabis use leads to a significant proportion of regular users becoming dependent upon the drug.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/3">The health risks of using cannabis are also described in guidance commissioned by the Department of Health, published in September 2003, and entitled &quot;Dangerousness of Drugs&mdash;A Guide to the Risks and Harms associated with Substance Misuse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/4">The smoking of cannabis presents a health risk with an increased incidence of bronchitis, asthma and lung cancer as well as disorders of the heart and circulation. Preliminary studies of lung function in regular cannabis smokers have not found a major cause for concern in the majority, but some severe cases of lung damage have been reported in very heavy users.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/5">Cannabis use can worsen existing mental illness, such as schizophrenia, and it slows recovery.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/6">We continue to monitor the health effects carefully. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary asked the Advisory Council in March to consider all the relevant evidence from recent studies into the links and associations between taking cannabis and developing mental health problems. He wants to be clear whether the evidence would alter the council's overall assessment of the appropriate classification of cannabis. He also asked for advice on the claims of greater prevalence of increased strength cannabis. It is intended that the council will have concluded its assessment in time to report back to my hon. Friend by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid=".127W.8/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding English nationality. (8533)</p>
	<p pid=".127W.8/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics collects information on national identity and advises organisations on the collection and classification of national identity data (<i>Ethnic Group Statistics: A guide for the collection and classification of ethnic data (2003)</i>, Office for National Statistics: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/ethnic_group_statistics">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/ethnic_group_statistics</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".127W.8/6" class="indent">With the new devolved administrations, there has been an increasing interest in 'national' consciousness with many people wanting their 'national' identity to be acknowledged. Many people in the White British ethnic group feel that their national identity is English. The Office for National Statistics encourages organisations to collect data on national identity and recommends the following question:</p>
	<p pid=".127W.8/7" class="indent">What do you consider your national identity to be?</p>
	<p pid=".127W.8/8" class="indent">Please choose your answer from this card. <i>Choose as many or as few as apply:</i></p>

	<p pid=".127W.8/15" class="indent">The question allows respondents to choose more than one identity (if they think of themselves as having more than one). This is because national identity is self-defined, i.e. it is something that is subjectively meaningful to the person concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.2/1">There are no plans to create an EU joint border force.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.2/2">The EU's Hague Programme refers to a feasibility study into a &quot;European system of Border Guards&quot; but makes no commitment to establishing one. The feasibility study will take place in 2007, as part of the review of the recently-established European Border Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.2/3">Like many EU member states, the Government remain unconvinced of the need for a European Border force. The case for a centrally managed, multi-national European Corps of Border Guards has not yet been made. There are many practical actions and concrete measures that can be taken forward with EU partners without the need to go as far as creating a European Border Guard.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.2/4">But we fully support the Border Agency, which will play a key role in co-ordinating joint operations between EU member states to strengthen the EU's external border. The UK supports the increased number of joint activities and co-operation between member states at the EU external borders where that activity is conducted on an operationally focused, intelligence-led basis. Such action has the potential to enhance the security of the EU's external borders to the benefit of all member states. It should complement, not replace, the work of national border services.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.2/5">We also welcome the statement in the Programme that the control and surveillance of external borders falls within the sphere of national border authorities&mdash;this is a matter of sovereignty.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.2/6">During the UK presidency we will continue to contribute actively to EU work on strengthening the EU's external borders and make it a priority to achieve progress in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.0/1">International and UK regulations relating to the safety and efficacy of medicines require the testing of botulinum toxin products at various stages of their processing, from harvesting through to marketing for use as a prescription-only medicine. The European Pharmacopoeia states that the potency of the toxin as a reconstituted product is determined by an LD50 assay in mice, the reference method, or by a method validated with respect to the LD50 assay. Unfortunately there is at present no accepted and validated alternative to the LD50 test for determining the potency of botulinum toxin at the production stage. The Home Office and all others, including the laboratories and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, concerned with conducting and regulating such testing are committed to moving to less severe testing procedures as soon as it becomes practicable to do so.

	<p pid=".134W.3/1">The mouse LD50 test is used to determine potency, for example, of botulinum neurotoxins used for the medical treatment of patients with certain neurological and other conditions. We pay close attention to technical progress in the field of alternatives and are aware that refined and replacement tests for the LD50 have been developed. Once they have been validated and published in the European Pharmacopoeia as alternatives to the mouse LD50 test, we will stop licensing the mouse LD50 test for this purpose, except where there is specific scientific justification for its continued use.</p>

	<p pid=".135W.0/1">Psilocin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms, is a class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It is a powerful hallucinogen, placed by the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971 in schedule 1, the highest level of control. Magic mushrooms are also already controlled as a class A drug under the 1971 Act if they have been prepared (e.g. dried) or are in the form of a product. Section 21 of the Drugs Act 2005 extends the existing classification to such mushrooms whatever form they are in. The Home Office discussed what is now section 21 of the Drugs Act with the Department of Health, HM Revenue and Customs, the Crown Prosecution Service and the police. We maintain that it is already unlawful for magic mushrooms to be sold as a product. It has proved difficult to satisfy the courts on what constitutes a product, hence this clarification of the law. Section 21 is not a new control on a new substance and consequently it was not necessary to carry out or commission new research. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) was informed of the proposed change to the law on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May 2005</phrase>, the ACMD agreed the need for regulations to make an exception from the offence of possession in certain circumstances. The chair of the ACMD, Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, wrote to me on two June setting out the ACMD's support for the measures.</p>

	<p pid=".139W.2/2">IT training for new police officers is a requirement under the national curriculum of the Initial Police Learning and Development Programme, under which we are modernising the training given to new police officers.

	<p pid=".139W.2/3">There will be new IT training available in critical areas such as Airwave. Airwave provides modern, secure and efficient digital radio communications for the police service in England, Wales and Scotland. The clarity of voice transmissions and the ability to send instructions in text form aids speed and efficiency. Mobile data can help to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on police officers and enable them to spend more time out on patrol.</p>

The aims and objectives of the Year are to create awareness of, increase the opportunities for and encourage more people to get involved in volunteering. The Year of the Volunteer 2005 is owned by volunteers, led by a partnership between Community Service Volunteers (CSV) and the Volunteering England Consortium, and supported by the Home Office. The Volunteering England Consortium consists of Volunteering England, TimeBank, YouthNet UK, The Media Trust, Business in the Community (BitC) and Youth Action Network. The Home Office is investing &pound;7.1 million in the Year of the Volunteer. The devolved Administrations are funding and hosting their own campaigns and initiatives to support the year and these differ in each country.</p>

Where an existing school is to be replaced by an Academy, the local education authority is under a statutory duty to consult on the closure proposals; and we actively encourage consultation with local parents where a new Academy is to be established.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.2/6">The programme is still in its infancy and, as PWC state, principals are concentrating on ensuring that the basics of school provision are in place. Academies will increasingly spread best practice and their lessons learned. For example, a number of academies have a specialist focus on business and enterprise, which is raising the profile of enterprise education nationally in their localities.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.5/1">We have had correspondence with the GTC about the Council's concerns at the lack of requirement for Academy teachers to be registered with them. We have also answered a range of correspondence, from various sources, on this issue, including questions here in the House&mdash;but have received no direct representation from teaching unions.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/2">Academies are registered independent schools. Like all independent schools, they are not bound by the legislation which requires teachers in maintained schools to register with the GTC. Academies are replacing some of our weakest under performing schools; it is right, therefore, that they are given the flexibilities and freedoms from bureaucracy to be able to take radical and innovative approaches to governance, staffing and the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/3">That is not to say, however, that teachers in Academies will not be registered with the GTC. The vast majority of teachers within Academies have moved across from the maintained sector and will already be registered with the Council. We will continue to promote the unencumbered movement of teachers between schools and Academies&mdash;most teachers are, therefore, likely to remain registered with the GTC. There would be little incentive for them not to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/4">There is certainly no bar on teachers in Academies registering with the Council if they decide it is in their interest to do so. I can also confirm that many Academies have decided that it is right actually to require that their teachers should be registered. The Government will continue to encourage Academies to register new and existing staff with the Council.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.2/1">We have recently issued an extended schools prospectus, which sets out our expectation that schools will need to consult with parents, young people and the wider community on making the best use of their facilities to the community. We want all schools to enable pupils, parents, families and the wider community to access a core range of services by 2010. The core offer will include schools providing wider community access to ICT, sports, arts and other facilities including adult learning. The prospectus gives some helpful pointers to schools as to how to start developing services, including the need to consult with the wider community to ensure they provide services that meet local needs and demand. Schools can play an important role in supporting their local communities, on key issues such as poverty, community cohesion and neighbourhood regeneration. The prospectus is available on our Teachernet website, together with further guidance, practical advice and case studies. We are adding to this material all the time as work develops. We have committed additional funding to support schools in developing extended services. The Department has made approximately &pound;160 million of funding available since 2003 and we will be making a further &pound;680 million available over the 2006&ndash;08 period including &pound;250 million that will go direct to all schools.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/2">The Department has also asked the National Remodelling Team to take a lead role in supporting local authorities and schools through the development of extended services, and we are also funding &quot;ContinYou&quot; to run the Extended Schools Support Service, to offer further practical help.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.5/1">The priorities for adult and community learning provided through local education authorities remain (i) to sustain a wide range of learning opportunities to gain skills for personal and community development and (ii) to provide opportunities for those who want a &quot;first step&quot; on the learning ladder before committing themselves to further learning leading to qualifications. There are no specific targets for adult and community learning.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.5/2">The Department for Education and Skills will shortly receive proposals from the LSC on the reform of the funding and planning arrangements for learning which does not lead directly to qualifications. This includes First Steps and Personal and Community Development Learning for Adults. The proposals will cover such provision both by local education authorities and further education colleges. The objectives of the reforms are: to maintain the safeguard for the continued availability of courses for personal and community development set out in the 2003 and 2005 Skills White Papers; to fund &quot;first steps learning&quot; on the same basis regardless of the provider; to ensure an equitable distribution of public funding between geographical areas; and a proper balance between public funding, and financial contributions by individuals.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.2/1">The Department supports schools in helping them decide which resources to choose when educating children about the effects of alcohol, for example through the resources referenced in the PSHE section of the Department's Teachernet website. However, it is up to individual schools and teachers to determine the resources that are appropriate to assist them in delivering this teaching, having regard to the needs of their pupils and local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/2">The statutory national curriculum science order requires that all pupils should learn about the effects of alcohol and other drugs. The framework for Personal Social and Health Education (PSHE) provides the context for developing drug, alcohol and tobacco education beyond this.

	<p pid=".152W.0/1">My Department uses the following value for money procedures when considering the use of consultants.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/2">Firstly, we undertake a process to establish the most appropriate way of meeting a requirement. This includes a consideration of the options including using existing staff, fixed term appointments and secondees. Consultants will only be engaged when they can provide:</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/3" class="indent">specialist skills or expertise not available in house;</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/4" class="indent">additional skilled resource on a temporary basis;</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/5" class="indent">a broader perspective drawn from work with other organisations;</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/6" class="indent">an objective/independent change agent or facilitator; or</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/7" class="indent">an independent view of current issues.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/8">Secondly, if a decision is made to engage a consultant a further process is undertaken to establish the most appropriate way of selection. This may be through <i>(a)</i> a competitive tender, <i>(b)</i> selecting from either the Department's, Office of Government Commerce's or another Government Department's framework agreement, or <i>(c)</i> by single tendering where certain qualifying conditions are met. The conditions for single tendering are where:</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/9" class="indent">it is known (not assumed) that only one supplier can meet the requirement;</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/10" class="indent">the cost of open or selective tendering would exceed the potential for saving, e.g. based on the results of a recent tender exercise;</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/11" class="indent">the continuity of knowledge or synergy with previous work is an overriding consideration; or</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/12" class="indent">you have received an unsolicited proposal that contains ideas of concepts that you wish to use because it meets your needs, these ideas are the property of the tenderer and may be legally protected under intellectual property rights.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/13">In all cases proposals from consultants are systematically evaluated on a whole life cost basis with a view to obtaining best value for money using pre-prepared criteria. Evaluation looks at the economic, financial and technical capability of the consultant and includes among others, financial stability of the organisation, past experience, management structure, key personnel, ability to meet the requirement, level of quality and costs.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/14">As mentioned earlier my Department maintains a list of consultancy framework providers that have been tendered through the Official Journal of the European Union and which meets most of the external consultancy needs of the Department. These provide additional value for money savings through the competitive prices obtained during the competition and also by removing the administrative burden of each requirement being tendered separately. Office of Government Commerce and certain other Government Departments maintain similar lists.</p>

	<p pid=".153W.0/1">The evaluation of the education maintenance allowance (EMA) was one of the most extensive ever undertaken. It was piloted in 10 areas and 11 control areas and involved following two cohorts of young people over a four year period. The results showed that EMA increased participation in further education among eligible 16-year-olds in the pilot areas by 5.9 percentage points. This is equivalent to 3.8 percentage points across the whole cohort nationally. The impact was highest among groups with previously lowest participation rates, particularly young men, those with moderate or lower attainment at age 16 and those from lower socio-economic groups.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.0/2">EMA was rolled out for 16-year-olds in all areas from September 2004 and will be fully rolled out for all 16 to 18-year-olds by 2006/07. The DfES and LSC are carefully monitoring progress and will be undertaking continuing work to assess the effectiveness of EMA. To date, EMA has been paid to a total of 296,000 young people, including 216,000 16-year-olds, which is over 99 per cent. of the numbers projected.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.0/3">Evaluation information is not readily available to show the impact of EMA on participation separately in school sixth forms, sixth form colleges and colleges of further education. However, the latest participation figures which were published today (SFR 27/2005) show that, in 2004, of the 73.3 per cent. of 16-year-olds in full-time education, 29.5 per cent. are in school sixth forms, 10.4 per cent. are in sixth form colleges and 27 per cent. are in colleges of further education. A further 6.4 per cent. are in independent schools or HE institutions. The increases, in particular over 2003 across different post-16 providers, are similar.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.2/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your Parliamentary Question with reference to the number of young people who are participating in Entry to Employment (E2E) now and the expected number in July 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/4" class="indent">As at the end of April 2005, 24,467 young people were participating in E2E. I am able to report that over 30 per cent. of the participants declared themselves as having a Learning Difficulty or Disability and 19 per cent. as being from an ethnic minority background. This demonstrates that E2E is truly addressing the Government's inclusion agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/5" class="indent">In July we expect there to be a similar number of participants on E2E, indeed we would expect to maintain the programme at this level at least until July 2006. We have recently announced that the budget and funding rates for E2E have been increased by 2.5 per cent. support for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/6" class="indent">You will also, I am sure, be pleased to note that since E2E was introduced in 2003 the percentage of young people moving into a job, training or education place has improved by 11 per cent. from 32 per cent. to 43 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/7" class="indent">I hope these statistics reassure you that E2E is being maintained at the required level and that it is meeting the priorities the Government has set for it. Should you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact the LSC.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.2/1">As part of a development plan, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) enters into a funding agreement with each provider. The funding agreement sets out the funds for the provision of further education (FE) that the LSC has agreed to pay to the provider, and the education and training provision that the provider has agreed to provide in return.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.2/2">The level of funding is determined by the application of a national funding formula, and should reflect the directly incurred costs of efficiently delivered provision. As part of the funding formula, there is an 'area costs' element. This provides a funding uplift to reflect that in some geographical areas, higher salaries are needed to attract staff of a similar standard.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.2/3">Success for All, the strategy for reforming FE and training, makes clear that the Government's approach to pay is to enable local flexibility to meet local needs and to encourage a clear link between pay and individual performance, General FE colleges and sixth form colleges are autonomous institutions, and as such they negotiate their own pay and conditions of service with staff and their unions without Government involvement.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.5/1">The national curriculum sets out a clear, full and statutory entitlement to learning for all pupils up to the age of 16. It determines the content of what will be taught and sets attainment targets for learning. The programmes of study set out what pupils should be taught in each subject at each key stage, and attainment targets set out the knowledge, skills and understanding which pupils of different abilities and maturities are expected to have by the end of each key stage. Functional literacy and numeracy skills are embedded in the English and mathematics programmes of study.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.5/2">At key stage 4 (ages 14&ndash;16) GCSE qualifications are the principle means of assessing attainment, including functional literacy and numeracy. The changes to the assessment of functional skills in English and maths GCSE, announced in the White Paper &quot;14&ndash;19 Education and Skills&quot;, will ensure that no one can get a grade C or better in English and maths without mastering the functional elements.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.2/1">The White Paper &quot;14&ndash;19 Education and Skills&quot; announced that GCSEs in English and maths would be revised to ensure that students cannot get a grade C or better without passing a functional skills unit. We are working closely with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and other stakeholders to develop the content, assessment and teaching of the functional skills units and how they will fit within English and maths GCSE. This work will build on the best aspects of the Key Stage 4 National Curriculum, Skills for Life and the current range of English and maths-related qualifications.</p>

She asked that the review address in particular: the need for a consistent approach to coursework in similar subjects; fairness; the cumulative burden of coursework; and that coursework should be used to test skills and attributes that cannot be tested by a terminal examination.</p>

	<p pid=".165W.2/1">The Department of Health published 'Children Missing from Care and Home&mdash;a guide to good practice' with its related Circular LAC (2002)17 in November 2002. These were issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, which means that local authorities are obliged to follow their requirements, unless there are exceptional circumstances. The good practice guide requires that protocols for the management of 'missing from care' incidents are drawn up between the local authority and the police, that a senior manager is appointed to monitor these protocols and that there should be regular reports to council members with responsibility for &quot;corporate parenting&quot; on patterns of children going missing from care. The Guidance also suggests a similar model of protocols and a named manager for children missing from home.</p>
	<p pid=".165W.2/2">As part of the arrangements for performance management of local authorities, all local authorities in England were required to complete a Delivery and Improvement Statement (DIS) each spring, giving a self-assessment of their progress. From April 2004, the information provided by the DIS was returned to the Commission for Social Care Inspection and it provided part of the evidence base used to evaluate the performance of each local authority in delivering their services for vulnerable adults and children. In spring 2004, the DIS included questions about LA compliance with the Children Missing from Care and Home Guidance. The data on local authorities response to these questions indicated that 96 per cent. of local authorities had appointed a senior manager to monitor 'missing from care' incidents and that 88 per cent. of local authorities had protocols in place with the police for managing missing from care incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".165W.2/3">Data is not collected centrally on which local authorities have complied with the Children Missing from Care and Home Guidance, nor on local authorities which have produced annual strategic monitoring reports on children who go missing from home or care.</p>

	<p pid=".171W.2/1">The following table shows numbers of temporary buildings on primary, secondary and special school premises for each London borough. The figures are derived from data supplied to the Department by authorities in 2001 and 2003. No data were collected in 1997. New data have been requested at the end of this year. Not all temporary buildings are used for teaching. They may accommodate one or more classrooms.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/2">Central government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996&ndash;97 to &pound;5.5 billion this year and will rise further to over &pound;6.3 billion by 2007&ndash;08. Progress is being made year-by-year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/3">Modern, high quality mobile or demountable classrooms provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short term need. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid=".174W.2/1">Universities are bound by equality and diversity legislation and it is the responsibility of their governing bodies to ensure that non-discriminatory practices are followed. With regard to race relations specifically, governing bodies of universities have a positive duty have due regard to the need to eliminate racism and to promote equality. This duty applies to all functions exercised by governing bodies, including their regulatory function in respect of student unions. There is also the specific duty placed upon governing bodies to have in place a policy for promoting race equality and to monitor its effect. The CRE has prepared guidance for further and higher education institutions on their duties under the race relations legislation. Government's approach to pay is to enable local flexibility to meet local needs and to encourage a clear link between pay and individual performance. General FE colleges and sixth form colleges are autonomous institutions, and as such they negotiate their own pay and conditions of service with staff and their unions without Government involvement.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.8/65"><sup>(80)</sup> In 2002/03 the Joint Academic Subject Classification (JACS) replaced HESACODE as the basis for grouping by subject area. Although JACS and HESACODE look similar and are closely related, they are not by any means identical, and so are not directly comparable. It has accordingly been necessary for 2002/03 onwards to construct subject area definitions afresh in terms of JACS.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.8/66">The shift of numbers shown between 2001/02 and 2002/03 is largely attributable to the introduction of a new procedure of apportionment for dealing with students, notably those on combined/split programmes, rather than to the changes in the way subjects are classified. It can also be seen that improved reporting practice has led to further reduction in the numbers on combined programmes shown in 2003/04.</p>

	<p pid=".178W.2/4" class="indent">Funding for Work Experience is delivered as part of the Education Business Links funding which local offices receive to further the links and understanding between businesses, employers, young people and staff teaching in schools. A significant amount of the total EBL funding supports the 95% of Key Stage 4 pupils who go on placements each year. The majority of these placements are delivered through partnerships between schools and their local Education Business Partnerships. The evaluation of these placements forms part of the contractual arrangements for funding. A number of other agencies; for example QCA and NEBPN are working to ensure quality standards in the delivery of work-experience placements providing resources and support for teachers and students in the evaluation of their experiences.</p>

	<p pid=".181W.3/1">None. In assessing the military situation on the island, we continue to be guided by the assessment of the UN Secretary-General on the United Nations Operations in Cyprus. In his latest report of June 2005, the Secretary-General noted that there were no indications of an increase in defence spending on either side, nor of acquisitions of new major equipment. The Secretary-General further noted that the rotation of Turkish troops and their equipment did not imply a reinforcement and thus the number of Turkish troops and their equipment remained unchanged.</p>

The travel advice also explains that there are a number of potential practical, financial and legal implications, particularly for those considering buying property in the north&mdash;these relate to the non-recognition of the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;, the possibility of a future political settlement in Cyprus, and claims to ownership from people displaced in 1974. The advice also warns that there is a risk that purchasers would face legal proceedings in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as attempts to enforce judgments from the courts of the Republic of Cyprus elsewhere in the EU, including the UK.</p>

In recent months we have seen an increase in car bombs and improvised explosive devices used by the insurgents. These high profile attacks deliberately aim to cause higher numbers of casualties.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.11/1">My assessment is that no African country possesses nuclear weapons or is currently developing them.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.11/2">However, as the right hon. Gentleman will be aware, the former South African President, FW De Klerk, announced in March 1993 that South Africa had decided in 1974 to develop a limited nuclear deterrent capability, and that six of seven projected nuclear fission devices had been completed by the time it decided in 1990 to dismantle and destroy all the nuclear devices and accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). South Africa duly acceded to the NPT in July 1991, and its consequent comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) came into force in September 1991. The IAEA subsequently conducted a number of inspections to verify the completeness and correctness of South Africa's initial report of its inventory of nuclear material. In 1993 South Africa also asked the IAEA to conduct visits to confirm the abandoned status of its former nuclear weapon programme. As a result of these activities, the IAEA concluded that it had found nothing inconsistent with the South African account of the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.11/3">The right hon. Gentleman will also be aware that on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-19">19 December 2003</phrase> Libya announced that it had shown US and UK experts &quot;the materials, equipments and programmes which lead to the production of internationally proscribed weapons&quot;, including centrifuge machines, and that it had decided &quot;to eliminate these materials, equipments and programmes&quot;. Libya has since acknowledged to the IAEA that it received documentation related to nuclear weapon design and fabrication from a foreign source as well as some pre-assembled centrifuge machines and many components for other such machines. The United Kingdom has strongly welcomed Libya's renunciation of these activities, as well as its conclusion of an Additional Protocol in March 2004 to its existing Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, and strongly supports its continued co-operation with the IAEA.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.11/4">The United Kingdom is a strong supporter of the Treaty of Pelindaba, which seeks to establish a nuclear weapon free zone in Africa. We have ratified the relevant Protocols to the Treaty, and continue to call on enough states to ratify the Treaty for it to enter into force.</p>

	<p pid=".201W.7/3">Alliance Medical Ltd. demonstrated its ability to provide additional radiologists and radiographers to carry out the scans and reports, which was an important aspect to the procurement.

	<p pid=".202W.2/1">All carers, including those caring for people with dementia, are entitled to an assessment to determine their needs as carers and eligibility for support. This Government have supported legislation, which supports all carers in their caring role. The Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 strengthens the rights of carers to an assessment of their own needs as carers. The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 introduces new provisions that will ensure that carers are made aware of this right.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.2/2">The carers grant, worth &pound;185 million this year, provides money for local councils to provide short breaks and services to carers to enable them to continue in their caring role. Carers are also entitled to cash payments for carers' services to enable them to purchase the type of support they require and promote a better quality of life.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.2/3">At local level, Haringey Teaching Primary Care Trust has worked with London borough of Haringey, service providers, the voluntary sector and carers to create a carer's strategy for Haringey. The strategy addresses the needs of carers of all types of patients and incorporates the requirements of the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 in terms of opportunities for work, education, training and life-long learning. An action plan, based on the recommendations in the strategy, is being finalised at present and should be implemented shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".206W.2/1">In 2003&ndash;04, 81 per cent. of eligible women in England had a cervical screening test result at least once in the last five years <sup>1</sup> . 3.6 million women were screened <sup>2</sup> and laboratories reported four million tests. 128,000 women were referred following abnormal results.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.2/2">Following an appraisal by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2003, the cervical screening programme in England is currently being modernised with the introduction of liquid based cytology (LBC). LBC techniques offer a new way to prepare screening test samples for examination in the laboratory. NICE concluded LBC will reduce the number of unsatisfactory tests and improve the speed with which slides can be read. Due to a large retraining programme, full implementation is expected by 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.2/3">The Government are also committed to speeding up the results of cervical screening, and officials are working on the best way of taking this forward.</p>

	<p pid=".207W.0/1">The regulation of all medicines on the United Kingdom market is undertaken by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on behalf of Health Ministers. The MHRA is an executive agency of the Department. Its primary aim is to protect public health through the control of medicines on the UK market. This is achieved through a licensing and inspection system, which assures medicines conform to agreed standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and further ensures that licensed medicines are manufactured, stored and distributed to maintain these standards.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/2">In August 2004, two counterfeit products, purporting respectively to be Cialis, an erectile dysfunction treatment, and Reductil, an anti-obesity treatment, were discovered in the legitimate UK supply chain. This is the first time in 10 years that counterfeit products are known to have reached the legitimate UK supply chain.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/3">Over 600 million prescriptions are written annually in the UK. Therefore these two discoveries of counterfeit medicines in the small numbers that reached the legitimate UK supply chain, prior to recall, needs to be viewed in that context. However, the MHRA takes each and every such case very seriously and full investigation follows discovery.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/4">The number of boxes of counterfeit Cialis, including part-boxes, that were returned following the MHRA recall was 2,300. Each 20 milligrammes (mg) box of four Cialis tablets is valued at &pound;23.40 <sup>1</sup> . The number of boxes, including part-boxes, of counterfeit Reductil that were returned following the MHRA recall was 61. Each 10 mg box of 28 Reductil capsules is valued at &pound;41.29 <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/5">The MHRA intelligence unit coordinates a comprehensive agency-wide anti-counterfeiting strategy to apply an array of measures to ensure that counterfeit medicines do not penetrate the UK medicines supply chain.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/6">This includes regular liaison with all stakeholders including Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and other law enforcement agencies on all manners of pharmaceutical crime. HMRC collaboration focuses on tackling importations of counterfeit medicines through its border controls. Another key area of such collaboration with HMRC includes joint meetings with the pharmaceutical industry to identify ways to collectively deal with counterfeit medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/7">Educational aspects of the MHRA anti-counterfeiting strategy are primarily focussed on stakeholder education at a national and European level. The aim being to ensure that necessary procedures are in place throughout the supply chain to prevent counterfeit medicine penetration. Thus, a patient can confidently receive a safe, good quality and efficacious medicine through the regulated medicines supply chain.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/8">Educating patients to identify counterfeit medicines is considered counter-productive in that it could lead to the undermining of public confidence in the UK medicines distribution chain and perfectly safe treatment regimes. Also, potential checks by the public are likely to prove futile as most counterfeit medicines cannot be detected by the untrained eye and even trained personnel often have to rely on forensic laboratory testing to confirm counterfeits.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.0/9">The MHRA has launched an internet campaign to warn the public of the potential dangers involved with purchasing medicines over the internet where some, but not all, websites belong to unscrupulous vendors that sell counterfeit medicines. An education campaign is also being drafted to target those members of the public who purchase medicines through illicit means.</p>

	<p pid=".209W.8/1">Primary care provided by independent general dental practitioners (GDPs) forms the major element of national health service dental services. Most GDPs operate within the national terms of the general dental service (GDS), although some have opted to provide similar patient services under local contracts agreed with their primary care trust (PCT) as part of the recently introduced personal dental service (PDS). Under the GDS, the main costs are the individual treatment fees, including patient registration payments, payable to dentists. Under the PDS, dentists are usually paid a regular contract value for a defined level of NHS commitment.

	<p pid=".210W.2/1">Shropshire County Primary Care Trust (PCT) received &pound;256,000 to improve access to dentistry.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/2">The PCT has developed a dental action plan, which was approved by the Department's dental support team in June 2004. Funding of a further &pound;695,000 was also allocated to support the plan's implementation. The aim of the action plan was to deliver the capacity to provide national health service dental care for at least 50,000 more patients. Services are now in place to deliver care for almost 40,000 patients and other developments are in progress. For example, a primary care centre in Market Drayton will expand to include two dental surgeries in October 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/3">In the PCT area, four practices have opened recently, two of which are in Shrewsbury. The two practices have a combined capacity for around 15,000 NHS patients. Of four existing practices in the PCT area that have expanded, one is in Shrewsbury and it will provide capacity for an additional 3,000 NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/4">There has been a dental access centre in Shrewsbury since 1999. This was in the first wave of personal dental service pilots.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/5">Five Polish dentists were recruited as part of the first wave of overseas recruitment for Shropshire, two of whom are based in Shrewsbury.</p>

	<p pid=".210W.5/1">The contractual arrangements for a dental practice recruiting additional dentists to expand the numbers of national health service patients vary according to whether the practice is operating under general dental services (GDS) or personal dental services pilot (PDS) arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.5/2">Under GDS, a dentist or dental practice, which chooses to offer NHS services, register their participation with their local primary care trust and the Dental Practice Board and make claims for reimbursement for items of service performed in line with the statement of dental remuneration. If they choose to recruit an additional dentist to expand the numbers of NHS patients, the extra items of service performed for these patients would be included in the reimbursement claims made. As self-employed contractors, dentists are free to vary the extent of their NHS work as and when they choose.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.5/3">Under PDS, a dentist or dental practice who wishes to recruit an additional dentist to expand the numbers of NHS patients applies to their local PCT for a contract to cover the expanded NHS commitment. Local negotiations between the dental practice and PCT take place and when the proposed contract is agreed, it is referred to the national PDS team at the Department for approval under delegated powers from the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.5/4">The criteria for approving PDS contractual arrangements are designed to encourage growth in NHS services. Once approved, the dental practice and PCT sign a contract, which specifies the nature and extent of the NHS commitment, usually in terms of a practice list, the contract value and agreed arrangements for variations to the contract conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".214W.2/92">Finished in-year admissions</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/93">A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/94">Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/95">The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/96">Main Operation</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/97">The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/98">Ungrossed Data</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/99">Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/100">Time Waited (days)</p>
	<p pid=".214W.2/101">Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".218W.8/2">Population projections, produced by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), were used to inform the latest round of revenue allocations to PCTs for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. In addition, as population projections do not take account of changes in Government policy, such as the growth area initiative, the 2006&ndash;08 allocations include a growth area adjustment for PCTs in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) growth areas. This adjustment is based on the additional increase in population, over and above ONS population projections, which is due to the growth area initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".218W.8/3">PCT allocations reflect the demands of a growing population because the population figures used as the basis of PCT target allocations include the expected growth in population.</p>

	<p pid=".220W.2/1">In 1985, the Birmingham area was served by the Central Birmingham, East Birmingham, West Birmingham, South Birmingham and North Birmingham district health authorities (DHAs). In addition, Birmingham was also served by the Birmingham family practitioner committee (FPC) until 1990 when FPCs were superseded by family health services authorities (FHSAs).

Following the publication in February 2004 of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems, we advised all primary care trusts to offer a minimum of one cycle of IVF by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria, giving priority to couples with no children living with them, and to make progress to full implementation of the guideline in the longer term. The primary responsibility for the implementation of NICE guidelines rests with the NHS at local level and compliance with NICE guidance by NHS organisations will be considered by the Healthcare Commission during their review and performance assessment processes.</p>

	<p pid=".224W.3/1">In January 2005, the Department published Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care (ORE), a five-year action plan for improving services for black and minority ethnic (BME) communities. An important component of the plan is better engagement between mental health service providers and their local communities. To that end the National Institute for Mental Health in England will invest around &pound;2 million over the next two years in up to 80 local community engagement projects. An objective of each of the projects will be to secure longer-term funding. Applications from community organisations for funding to run projects in the current year will be invited shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.3/2">ORE is clear about the need for statutory national health service and local authority services to integrate the voluntary sector more fully and permanently into the planning and provision of mental health care for BME patients. As voluntary organisations take on that expanded role, we expect appropriate funding to follow from primary care trusts and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.3/3">In addition my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, through the section 64 general scheme of grants (section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968), has the power to make grants to voluntary organisations whose activities support the Department's policy priorities. In the current financial year, &pound;607,000 has been awarded to organisations working to meet the mental health needs of BME communities.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase>, a letter was sent to all health professionals in the United Kingdom from the Chairman of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) announcing the results of the review of the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) conducted by an expert working group of the CSM and providing prescribing advice for all SSRIs. A copy of the review is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.3/2">On the same day, the then National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, published guidelines on the management of depression in primary care. These guidelines state that antidepressants are not recommended for the initial treatment of mild depression because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.3/3">The expert working group of the CSM carefully considered the available data on a possible link between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour from published and unpublished trials, spontaneous reporting data from health professionals and patients, evidence from key stakeholders and data from the general practice research database (GPRD).</p>
	<p pid=".227W.3/4">The expert working group concluded that from the available clinical trial data, a modest increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm compared to placebo can not be ruled out. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is any marked difference between members of the class of SSRIs, or between SSRIs and other antidepressants, with respect to their influence on suicidal behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.3/5">Evidence from non-experimental studies based on the GPRD indicated that there is no increased risk of suicidal behaviour with SSRIs compared with tricyclic antidepressants. One of the GPRD studies was commissioned by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>
	<p pid=".227W.3/6">Information about the use of SSRIs during pregnancy is included in the prescribing information for healthcare professionals, the summary of product characteristics. This advice is based on pre-clinical studies, carried out prior to licensing, and continuous post-marketing surveillance of pregnancy outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".228W.2/1">Primary care trusts are responsible for providing sexual health services, which meet the needs of their local populations. To support them in this role, the Department has worked with leading professional bodies to produce the recommended standards for national health service HIV services (2003). These highlight the need to make post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) available to those who need it.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.2/2">The decision on whether to offer PEP for the purposes of preventing HIV transmission should be taken by clinicians in consultation with the patient, and will depend upon the particular circumstances. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, and the Government's expert advisory group on AIDS (EAGA) have both published guidance to help clinicians and EAGA keep the evidence on the effectiveness of PEP under review.</p>
