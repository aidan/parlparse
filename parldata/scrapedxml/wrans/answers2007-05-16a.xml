	<p pid="a.747W.3/1">An analysis of educational visits arranged through the Parliamentary Education Service in 2005-06 showed that 64 per cent. of schools were from London and the south east regions. New recording systems are currently being investigated that will allow the Education Service to provide regional breakdowns of visitors from the start of the next academic year in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.747W.3/2">Several Members have made representations that funding should be found to provide subsidies to encourage schools to visit Westminster as part of the Administration Committee's recent inquiry into visitor facilities at Parliament. As part of its evidence to the inquiry, the Education Service commissioned research with teachers to find out what obstacles might prevent schools from visiting Parliament. 46 per cent. of those teachers who indicated that they were unlikely to visit gave as their reason that the journey would be too expensive. The Committee recommended in its report, Improving Facilities for Educational Visitors to Parliament<sup>(1)</sup>, that the House of Commons Commission, working closely with the appropriate bodies in the House of Lords, should consider the case for subsidising school visits to Westminster from more remote constituencies. The Group on Information for the Public will be presenting proposals for consideration by the Commission later in the year.</p>

Consultation has taken place through the House of Commons Whitley Committee structure and also through an informal working group in which officials of both Houses and trade union representatives have taken part. Normally such exchanges would be treated as part of discussions carried out in confidence between the management and the unions. Since, however, these consultations relate to the subject of a Bill currently before the House, it was been agreed with the trade union side that copies of the formal letters exchanged to date should be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

Central to addressing this is to ensure supply of housing responds far better to need than it has in the past. That is why the Government have set a challenging ambition to increase the supply of additional homes in England to at least 200,000 per annum by 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.0/2">The draft Regional Spatial Strategy for Yorkshire and the Humber foresees raising current planned levels of building in North Yorkshire from 2,500 to 3,000 homes per annum, with a target of at least 40 per cent. affordable housing. An examination in public, led by an independent panel has just concluded on this draft. The panel has presented the draft to the Secretary of State, who will publish any 'Proposed Changes' for consultation in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.756W.15/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is the enforcement authority for export licensing controls on military goods. An exporter attempting to export military goods from the UK to any destination without a valid export licence is committing an offence under Section 68 of the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) 1979. The provisions of CEMA provide HMRC officers with wide ranging enforcement powers to investigate offences and to seize unlicensed. Should an investigation reveal sufficient evidence of an offence then the case will be referred to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO). The RCPO will then consider whether to commence criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.756W.15/2">EU and UN arms embargoes prohibit the export of military goods to Sudan. Military goods are defined as all goods listed in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods, Transfer of Technology and Provision of Technical Assistance (Control) Order 2003. Non-military goods which may have a military application are not subject to export licensing controls and therefore HMRC enforcement powers do not apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.756W.15/3">Section 18 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 provides that HMRC may not disclose information held in connection with a function of HMRC unless there is lawful authority. HMRC is therefore unable to disclose information in relation to specific campaigns.</p>

Despite extensive testing and piloting, the new system encountered difficulties when implemented country-wide, although in some areas it has worked well. Local authorities have therefore been given the option of using the new system or reverting to the previous system, which remains available.</p>
	<p pid="a.757W.2/5" class="indent">The public will be able to register events as normal in all areas. The new system is currently in use in just over half of the registration districts in England and Wales.

	<p pid="a.760W.3/11">DEFRA's sustainable procurement policy is to adhere to the highest standards of recycled paper. DEFRA currently buys paper that contains 75 per cent. recycled fibre for coated paper used in publications and for office paper (copier) and publications using uncoated paper there is a target 100 per cent. recycled fibre.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.3/12">The only exceptions to these standards are where recycled paper is not available for a specific process e.g. security paper. Meeting the targets owes much to the fact that a considerable proportion of DEFRA's printed publications are commissioned from a single central business unit using a centrally negotiated contract for recycled paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.760W.6/2">The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 protects workers from exploitation and reduces illegal activity. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) was set up to curb the exploitation of workers in the agriculture, horticulture, shellfish gathering and associated processing and packaging industries. It is now illegal to supply workers to the agriculture, food processing and packaging, and shellfish gathering sectors without a GLA licence.</p>

	<p pid="a.760W.6/5" class="indent">(ii) Engaging other government departments in joint investigative activity of mutual benefit to tackle illegal activity by Labour Providers</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/6" class="indent">(iii) Providing a visible presence to deter, disrupt, or displace illegal activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/7">Any person employed in the UK is entitled to be paid at least the appropriate minimum wage rate set out in minimum wage legislation. This includes all foreign nationals legally entitled to work in the United Kingdom. If a worker considers they might have been underpaid, they should contact the relevant minimum wage enforcement authority who will arrange for the matter to be investigated.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/8">In addition, compliance with minimum wage legislation represents one of the licence conditions that a gangmaster must meet in order to obtain a gangmaster's licence. Gangmasters who fail to meet this requirement will have their licences revoked by the GLA.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.2/4">Following a pilot of the Catalyst project, aimed at developing a central repository of electronic information for the whole of DEFRA, it was decided not to proceed to full roll out because the business benefits no longer demonstrated good value for money and Catalyst alone could not sufficiently meet DEFRA's long term information and knowledge management requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/5">The Catalyst system is still maintaining the documents and records deposited by pilot users and the lessons from the project have been built into a new approach to information and records management now being rolled out across DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/6"><i> (b)</i> &pound;4.0 million. The estimated costs at commencement of the project was &pound;2.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/7">The Phoenix project suffered a series of delays and cost increases. It reached a point where continued investment could not be justified relative to other priorities and so had to be cancelled.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.12/1">DFID is supporting an increase in food production and productivity in Africa in two main ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.12/2">Firstly, we are providing financial support to Africa's own efforts to increase agricultural productivity through our support to the African Union's New Partnership for Africa's Development initiative, the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Plan (CAADP), and through direct support to governments and partners to help poor farmers. Programmes include improving access to agricultural inputs, and transferring new technologies and skills to farmers to help them produce more. We will double to &pound;80 million per year our expenditure on agricultural, fisheries and forestry research by 2010. About two thirds of this will benefit Africa directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.12/3">Secondly, we are helping keep small-scale farmers productive after shocks like drought. With support from DFID, African governments are able to provide small, timely transfers of adequate amounts of cash, food or agricultural inputs. For example, in Ethiopia we have provided over &pound;70 million to the Productive Safety Net Programme&mdash;giving 7.2 million people cash and food transfers.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.12/4">The Commission for Africa recommended that donors should support a doubling of irrigated area by 2015. Irrigation is also an important element of the first pillar of CAADP. DFID is a strong supporter of CAADP and has provided &pound;5 million to speed up its implementation by African governments. DFID is also one of the main supporters of the Nile Basin Initiative, which is an African-led regional process for sustainable management of the Nile, including for irrigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.12/5">DFID recognizes the need to increase fertilizer use in many African countries so as to replenish the soils and improve food production in combination with complementary measures, such as improved seed varieties, irrigation and soil conservation. Improving fertilizer access is one component of CAADP. DFID co-funded an Africa Fertilizer Summit in July 2006. Over the past five years, DFID has committed around &pound;50 million to finance fertilizer-related programmes in Africa, which were executed through non-governmental organisations, government ministries and the UN. In Malawi, for example, DFID has provided support to help small-scale farmers acquire fertilizer. A recent evaluation has shown that the fertilizer and seed subsidy programmes in Malawi have led to additional maize production of 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes and 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes in 2005-06 and 2006-07 respectively, after taking into account better than average rainfalls. The value of the additional maize production in 2006-07 amounts to about $200 million based on import parity prices, about 9 per cent. of 2006 GDP.</p>

	<p pid="a.765W.2/1">The Commission for Africa highlighted poor infrastructure as a critical barrier to accelerating growth and reducing poverty. In response to this, DFID took a lead in establishing the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa in 2005. This brings together donors and African institutions to address critical constraints and increase investment in Africa's infrastructure. In 2006 Consortium members committed $7.7 billion to African infrastructure. The power sector is a particular priority&mdash;both to increase generation capacity and power transmission cable systems for greater regional connectivity. DFID provides no direct funding of power cables, for which finance is available from development banks such as the World Bank and African development banks. DFID has, however, provided $150,000 for preparation of the East African Submarine Cable System project. This fibre optic cable will link eastern and southern Africa to the international fibre optic system and will support high speed and high quality internet connections.</p>

DFID spent &pound;242 million in this area in 2005-06. We ensure that the water provided by us (multilaterally and bilaterally) meets approved national water quality guidelines or those of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Improving sanitation is a particularly effective way of reducing the number of pathogens in water sources and is usually included as a component of water supply programmes. More specifically, DFID has supported the preparation of WHO's water safety plans that take a comprehensive risk assessment and management approach to each step in the provision of water from the source of the water to the consumer. We have piloted these plans in India, Bangladesh, Kyrgyz Republic and Uganda.</p>

	<p pid="a.766W.5/1">Since the formation of the Hamas government in March 2006, the UK and other members of the EU have not provided support through the Palestinian Authority (PA). Instead, in order to help meet the basic needs of the Palestinian people, the European Union established a Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) in June 2006. Since then the UK has committed &pound;15 million and the European Community around &pound;140 million to the TIM. Other donors have also contributed. The TIM is providing almost &pound;10 million for educational materials to schools in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. This does not include textbooks.

The Public Accounts Committee took evidence from senior officials from DfES in January 2007 and we await their conclusions. We will be issuing guidance very shortly which contains the principles of good governance for children's centres and extended services and includes details of children's centres advisory boards which will support effective financial management and performance monitoring. In the summer we plan further guidance to accompany details of the additional funding for children's centres, resulting from our Comprehensive Spending Review, to help local authorities ensure that resources are effectively targeted, fairly distributed according to need, and achieve value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.6/1">The revised Sure Start Children's Centres Practice Guidance, issued last November, is for children's centre managers and practitioners, local authorities, primary care trusts and other delivery partners. It emphasises best practice in how to deliver services and tailor support to meet the individual needs of all young children and their parents, wherever they live, and contains examples of good practice. Many of the principles in the guidance are not new; they have been part of the Sure Start approach from the beginning. We want to see them consistently applied so that no parents or children miss out on the advantages that Sure Start Children's Centres can bring and good practice becomes common practice in all children's centres. The Together for Children consortium is working with local authorities to support effective networks that draw on evidence based practice and encourage shared learning and knowledge. It is too early to assess the impact of this guidance but it is being monitored through the children's centres performance management framework and future evaluation work.</p>

These three years will represent a crucial testing ground for exploring how best to increase the proportion of those in the workforce who engage in higher-level study, many of whom will wish to learn on a part-time basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.0/22">In total more than 500,000 civil servants are now covered by a Skills Pledge. Government Skills, the sector skills council for central Government are working with Departments on turning the commitment into action plans. At this stage no Department is expected not to participate.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.0/23">The Department is working with local authorities and other public sector representatives on how the Skills Pledge can be best delivered for their employees. To date, no commitments have been made, though local authorities and other public sector bodies have made a significant contribution to the basic skills agenda. We will be looking to build on that work for the Skills Pledge through the well-established network of basic skills champions in the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.2/1">In March the UN Secretary-General reported that there was mounting evidence that Hezbollah is rearming and smuggling arms across the Syria/Lebanon border. While the UN Secretary-General's report did not specifically identify Iran as the supplier of these arms we continue to judge that Iran provides Hezbollah with weapons and finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.2/2">The UK continues to have serious concerns about the role of Iran in the region, including Iran's continued and open support for Hezbollah. The UK has voiced these concerns on several occasions. UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747 introduced a ban on the export of arms from Iran. We continue to work, along with our international partners, to ensure that UNSCR 1747 is fully implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.8/1">The UK has been consistently committed to pursuing justice with regard to the assassination of Rafik Hariri. We were actively involved in negotiations on UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1595, which established the UN International Independent Investigation Commission to investigate the crime. We also supported UNSCR 1664 which called for the establishment of a tribunal to try those accused of committing the crimes.</p>

We are currently exploring with Security Council partners how the international community can assist Lebanon in setting up the tribunal.</p>

	<p pid="a.793W.2/1">The principal reason for any change to the capital values of the schemes at the Tees Esk and Wear Valley National Health Service Trust, the Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust, Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust and the North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust was that the review of private finance initiative schemes led the trusts concerned to reconsider how their schemes could best be structured in order to deliver services, in the most cost effective way and ensure their long-term viability. A key part of this work was an assessment of the capacity assumptions to ascertain if these were realistic and properly suited to the needs of the local health economy; and a review of the estate in terms of current and planned building stock to ensure optimal use.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/2">In consequence all the schemes, with the exception of that at the Tees and North East Yorkshire NHS Trust, underwent structural changes, details of which have been published and are available locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/3">In addition, the prices given in February 2006 did not reflect the fact that the schemes at both Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust and the North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust were still pursuing a number of options. This meant that by the time the review came to consider these schemes their capital values had increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/4">The figures given in the 27 of February press notice for Mid Yorkshire included &pound;37 million of public capital that was not included in the figure given in February 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.799W.5/2">The Sentencing Guidelines Council is responsible for issuing sentencing guidelines which criminal courts must take into account. In December 2006, after consultation, the Council issued a guideline on seriousness, which included a comprehensive list of aggravating and mitigating factors of offences. These factors include the use of weapons in the commission of an offence, and attacks made on those providing a service to the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.800W.0/2">No assessment has been made of the success of local child curfew schemes under section 14 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 as they have not been used.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.0/3">However, between January 2004 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, the police have used the power in section 30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act to disperse unruly groups in over 1,000 designated areas. In these areas, the police have succeeded in tackling underage drinking, joyriding, noise nuisance, the antisocial use of fireworks and the harassment and intimidation of residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.0/4">This is one example of our commitment to empowering local communities to tackle the blight of antisocial behaviour</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.0/5">Section 30 also gives the police power to return to their homes young people under 16 who are unsupervised in public places in such areas after 9 pm. A young person may have a legitimate reason for being out at night unsupervised and the power to return young people to their homes is discretionary: it is not a curfew.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.0/6">This power protects young people from the risks posed by being unsupervised at night in public places within particular areas where they might get involved in, or become victims of, antisocial behaviour and helps the police to protect local communities from the alarm and distress that unsupervised young people can cause. Statistics for police exercising the power to return home young people under 16 are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.0/7">The section 30 powers are not intended to be used in isolation, but should form part of an integrated response to tackling crime and disorder and antisocial behaviour in local areas. This includes work by YOTs to prevent young people getting involved in offending and antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.808W.2/2">Government have been negotiating a prisoner transfer agreement providing for the transfer of prisoners between member states of the European Union. This agreement provides for the transfer of EU nationals to their State of nationality in which they normally live without the consent of the individual concerned. It also creates, for the first time, an obligation on a member state to accept back its nationals. In February the Government participated in a general approach on this agreement. Subject to its formal adoption later this year we expect the agreement to come into force in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.808W.2/3">The Government intends to bring forward further amendments to the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984, to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The Additional Protocol provides for the transfer of a prisoner, without the consent of the individual concerned, where that prisoner would otherwise be deported at the end of the sentence. The Consent of the receiving State will still be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.808W.2/4">Further, the Home Office is working to identify those countries with which we already have bilateral arrangements who may be willing to renegotiate these arrangements to remove the requirement for prisoners to consent to transfer. The consent of the receiving State would, however, still be required.</p>

None of the measures have taken place as a result of any separate multilateral disarmament negotiations. The UK has for many years retained only the minimum nuclear capabilities we require and as a result we have the smallest stockpile of any of the nuclear weapon states recognised under the NPT. We believe it will only be useful for us to include our deterrent in multinational negotiations once further progress has been made in reducing global nuclear stockpiles.
