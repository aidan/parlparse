	<p pid="a.397W.0/1">Financial inclusion programmes supported by the Department for International Development (DFID) demonstrate the positive impact that microfinance can have on women's empowerment. For example, DFID supports the Kashf Foundation in Pakistan, which provides financial services to women from low income communities. An assessment of the programme found that: 60% of clients took out loans to start new businesses; 34% of long-term clients experienced improvement in their economic situation; two-thirds increased their savings; and women's increased ability to contribute to the family income improved their status within the household.</p>
	<p pid="a.397W.0/2">We cannot assume, however, that women's empowerment is an automatic outcome of microfinance programmes. DFID is producing a toolkit to strengthen the design, implementation and measurement of programmes to empower women through improved financial inclusion. The toolkit will be launched in spring 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.398W.6/1">The CPS has only awarded two single tender contracts since May 2010, the details of which are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.6/2" class="indent">A contract for the services of a Management Receiver was awarded to a firm in December 2010. At the time of the award specific details of the case were confidential, and an open tender may have jeopardised an ongoing criminal investigation. The firm was selected from a short-list of companies who were successfully appointed to a framework contract for Management Receivers in 2010. The firm chosen to complete the work was selected based on their experience of similar work. The value of the contract is dependant on the final value of the assets confiscated.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.6/3" class="indent">A contract for legal advisory services was awarded in September 2010. The timeframe and complex nature of the work meant that it was appropriate to award a single tender contract. The value of the contract is estimated at &#163;24,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.6/4">The Treasury Solicitor's Department (Tsol) internal threshold for applying a competitive process to the purchase of goods and services is &#163;3,000. Purchases with a value below this figure are subject to a single quotation/tender and value for money check, however it is not possible to identify most of the individual contracts which fall into this category without incurring a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.6/5">The majority, by value, of purchases made by Tsol are for legal services. Tsol uses the Attorney-General's Panel Counsel (barristers) and the Litigation Catalogue (solicitor agents and litigation support services) to call-off services-both of these have been subject to competition and are managed by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.6/6">Where legal services could not be commissioned from these two panels the work may have been awarded subject to comparable quotations. However, where the legal timetable or specific nature of the matter made it unrealistic, or significantly more costly, to seek more than one quotation the services will have been secured under a single tender arrangement. Legal services are classified as Part B services under the EU Procurement Rules which largely exempts them from the competition obligations under the EU Public Service Contracts Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.6/7">Tsol awarded a contract for the supply of additional office furniture under a single tender process in December 2010 to Herman Miller for office furniture with a value of up to &#163;30,000 over the next three years, this fell under the EU public procurement threshold. No other single awards have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.6/8">The remaining Law Officers' Departments have not awarded any single tender contracts during this period.</p>

	<p pid="a.405W.2/1">Prisons have always been required to examine specific security risks in their establishments and to set out a local strategy for dealing with those risks. Intelligence-led, targeted searches of specific prisoners or prison areas is one important and productive aspect of this strategy that has always been encouraged in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.405W.2/2">Since May 2010 the National Offender Management Service has removed the requirement for prisons outside of the High Security Estate to conduct routine searches in certain areas of the prison. By doing this, in appropriate circumstances, prisons are able to set more effective local searching strategies by moving away from routine searching, which can be predictable and unproductive, and instead concentrate resources on more targeted searches driven by intelligence or other local need. Prisons are required to carry out a local risk assessment to determine if a programme of routine cell searching is required and if so the extent of this. Local searching strategies are documented by each prison and agreed with the regional manager.</p>
	<p pid="a.405W.2/3">Data on targeted searches are not available centrally and to provide this information would require every establishment in England and Wales to collate this information which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.2/1">The rules pertaining to the naming of qualifications are a matter for Ofqual, the independent exams regulator. Dennis Opposs, Director of Standards at Ofqual, has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dennis Opposs, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-22">22 December 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/3" class="indent">Further to your Parliamentary Question seeking the removal of the distinction between the IGCSE and the Level 1/2 Certificate I am writing to clarify the position of Ofqual on this issue. Our position is essentially based on clarity and expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/4" class="indent">Under the 'Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act (2009)' Ofqual will accredit qualifications that meet the relevant published criteria. There are currently no criteria for qualifications titled 'IGCSE'. Use of this title could create unfounded expectations amongst users (learners, employers, schools and colleges) of the consistency with GCSE requirements. For example, users might expect that a qualification in French would include ail four of the skill areas: speaking, listening, reading and writing. This inclusion is a requirement at GCSE but not a feature of all IGCSE qualifications. Such differences may be confusing to users. On this basis, Ofqual and the regulators for Wales and Northern Ireland have decided that the title 'IGCSE' will not be accepted for accreditation purposes at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/5" class="indent">I can confirm that the awarding organisation Cambridge International Examinations has a number of qualifications accredited by the regulators as Level 1/2 Certificates and markets them under the title 'IGCSE'. Some of these qualifications are approved for use in maintained schools and colleges in England through inclusion in the Section 96 list maintained by the Department for Education. Likewise the awarding organisation Edexcel has submitted to us for accreditation some Level 1/2 Certificates derived from their unregulated 'IGCSE' qualifications offered in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/6" class="indent">Level 1/2 Certificates may not cover the requirements of the Programmes of Study in subjects where they exist but in carrying out the accreditation review of these qualifications we focus on the need for equivalence in demand of the teaching, learning and assessment requirements in comparison to the national GCSE qualification suite.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/7" class="indent">I trust that this clarifies the current situation and the stance taken by Ofqual to ensure clarity for users and consistency of demand across qualifications. Should you require any further information about this or the workings of Ofqual, please do not hesitate to get in touch.</p>

	<p pid="a.413W.2/1">Good discipline and regular attendance at school is essential to ensure that all pupils can benefit from the opportunities provided by education. It is this Government's intention to restore the authority of teachers and head teachers so they can establish a culture of excellence in their school. School should be a place where there is good behaviour in the classroom, where pupils feel safe, give respect and are respected in turn, and want to come to school to learn.</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.2/2">There has been no change to the regulations that govern the amount of family leave that can be granted. The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 state that a pupil may be granted leave of absence from school to enable them to go away on holiday but that, save for exceptional circumstances, they should not be granted more than 10 school days leave of absence in any school year.</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.2/3">Head teachers and local councils already have powers to issue penalty notices (fines of &#163;50 to &#163;100) to parents who fail to ensure their children's regular school attendance, which includes taking them on holiday during term time without the school's permission. Alternatively, local councils can prosecute parents under section 444 of the Education Act 1996. If parents are found guilty of the offence the Act provides for heavier sanctions where the parent condoned their children's absence from school, as in the case of taking them out of school on an extended family holiday without permission. The court can fine parents up to &#163;2,500 and or give a prison sentence of up to three months. The parent will also get a criminal record. Prosecutions should be used as a last resort by local councils as in most cases a penalty notice will be a sufficient sanction to deter parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.2/4">The Department publishes absence and attainment data for schools as part of the annual Schools Performance Tables. The recently published Primary School (Key Stage 2) Performance Tables included schools overall absence, persistent absence and unauthorised absence data. The Secondary Schools (Key Stage 4) Performance Tables are due for publication in January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.2/5">Ofsted, as part of their inspection criteria, will also look at trends in a school's absence data when considering school inspections.</p>

	<p pid="a.416W.2/1">Discards are a clear waste of natural resources. To minimise discards by all types of vessels throughout UK seas we are working at a European level to radically reform the common fisheries policy (CFP). However the UK is not awaiting the results of this reform to take action. There have been a number of initiatives aimed at reducing discards, including trialling an alternative &quot;catch quota&quot; management system which is based on managing and monitoring what is caught-not just what is landed. This trial had positive results; reducing discards, increasing selectivity and allowing fishermen to land more and will provide useful evidence for the reform of the CFP.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.2/2">While landing by-catch that would otherwise be discarded would reduce the problem of discards it would not avoid by-catch in the first instance. Our preference has always been to make fishing more selective, thus tackling the root of this wasteful practice and reducing mortality of non-target fish. Project 50%, a collaborative project between fishermen in the south-west and Government, has led to improved selectivity of fishing gear and less by-catch.</p>

	<p pid="a.417W.2/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/2"><i> (a)</i> The total discard estimate in 2009 (the latest period for which figures are available for those fisheries sampled in UK) is 51,179 tonnes. There are many reasons explaining these discards; however, the current system for recording catch and discard data does not allow us to differentiate (year on year) why each fish is discarded. Despite this, CEFAS analysis, conducted in 2010 on the 2008 English and Welsh discard data, estimated that:</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/3" class="indent">54% (13,230 tonnes) of total discards were discarded for reasons relating to weak/absent markets (i.e. non-quota species).</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/4" class="indent">Quota constraints were estimated to account for 22% (5,390 tonnes) of discards (i.e. quota species above the legal minimum landing size).</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/5" class="indent">24% (5,880 tonnes) of total discards were quota species below the legal minimum landing size (MLS) and were too small to land.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/6">High grading is another type of discarding where fishermen try to optimise the value of their catches by keeping the good value fish and discarding the poorer value ones. This creates a financial profit for fishermen but is still a waste of fish. A European high grading ban is in place in waters around the UK to prevent this behaviour. Other types of discarding, such as unmarketable species, over quota and under MLS may represent a loss of value to the fishermen and from the fishery.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/7">Estimates of the financial impacts of discards for the British fleet in specific areas are unreliable. To simply use the average market value of all fish species as a multiplier would give an inaccurate estimate of the financial impact of discards. We do, however, have a more robust study under way looking at the economic impact of discarding fish.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/8"><i> (b)</i> The environmental impacts on the ecosystem of discarding fish include the direct effects of discard mortality on fish stocks and the effects of population growth in species that utilise these discards.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/9">The direct ecological effects of fish mortality through being caught and discarded are inextricably linked to overall fishing mortality. In the North sea, excessive fishing mortality has been shown to:</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/10" class="indent">Reduce potential yield from the stocks;</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/11" class="indent">Reduce species diversity;</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/12" class="indent">Change predator-prey interactions; and</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/13" class="indent">Change the relative abundance of species.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/14">A wide range of scavengers, including seabirds and fishes, are known to feed on discards. In the North sea, discarding is estimated to account for up to 10% of the overall annual food consumption of scavengers. This level of contribution is probably sufficient to allow larger populations of these scavenging species to exist than would otherwise be possible. For instance, seabirds are estimated to consume 50% of discarded material; enough potentially to support over six million birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/15">Several seabed dwelling species also utilise discards but evidence for expansion of these populations, as a response to discards, is weak. In general, the full impacts of discarding on marine communities are not well understood, and neither are the consequences of reducing the amount of discarded material. However, it is recognised that removing non-marketable marine organisms from the ecosystem will reduce its health, and is therefore not consistent with good ecosystem management.</p>

	<p pid="a.418W.2/1">During 2010, CEFAS scientists joined 12 commercial fishing trips sailing from ports on the south-east coast between Lymington and Ramsgate in order to estimate the quantities of fish discarded during these trips. Eight of these trips were aboard vessels based in the Sussex ports of Rye and Shoreham. Overall, 67% by number of the fish caught were discarded, with the corresponding figure from the Sussex trips being 63%. During these trips, 62 different species of fish were caught.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.2/2">Many of these were discarded because there is no market for the species. Only four of the 62 species caught (cod, plaice, Dover sole and whiting) were subject to legal minimum landing sizes and quota restrictions. Discards of these species involved individuals both below and above the minimum landing sizes.</p>

	<p pid="a.419W.3/1">The drinking water regulations were changed at the end of 2007 to require water companies to risk assess every drinking water supply and monitor each raw water source on a continual basis. Companies have a duty to take steps to mitigate any potential risks to human health and must notify the Drinking Water Inspectorate of such circumstances. The Chief Inspector of Drinking Water can by notice require further mitigation steps to be taken, or, exceptionally, require that a supply is shut down.</p>

A household is made up of one of more families and is defined as a single person or group of people living at the same address as their only or main residence, who either share one meal a day together or share the living accommodation (i.e. a living room).

Where a private tenant has legitimate concerns, they can obtain help and advice from local authorities who also have extensive powers to tackle poor quality stock or poor management standards in the private rented sector. Tenants can also seek advice from a range of free independent advice organisations-most notably the citizen's advice bureaux, many of which receive funding from local authorities. My Department supports these sources of help through the funding it provides to local authorities.</p>

These programmes will help improve our productivity and efficiency and will mean that we can target our resources on those people likely to cause most harm to the UK.

	<p pid="a.438W.0/1">We have not estimated a date on which global production of crude oil will peak. However, we do look at a variety of sources that assess oil demand and oil depletion including the IEA, industry and other research organisations. In 2010, DECC's chief scientist sent out a call for evidence on the prospects for future oil supply to a range of experts. A number of responses received argue that a supply 'crunch' (a tightness in the oil market), if not a peak in oil production, is very likely before 2020. We are very grateful for the excellent responses and will use the results to help ensure that our analysis is informed by all relevant factors and further develop energy policies that reduce the risks inherent in a resource constrained future.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.3/1">Many off-grid energy consumers have been hit hard by high prices and supply issues this winter. I am keen the reasons for this are thoroughly investigated by an independent authority. This is why I asked the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to bring forward its competition and consumer study into off-grid energy, and asked the OFT if the study could explore the longer term consumer issues such as lifetime payback, consumer standards and labelling for alternative energy sources or supplies. Such a study would provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.6/1">Government are undertaking a staged process for implementing geological disposal of higher activity radioactive waste, as set out in the 2008 White Paper 'Managing Radioactive Waste Safely: A framework for Implementing Geological Disposal'. This process is based on voluntarism and partnership with local communities with the first stage being local communities 'expressing an interest' in entering discussions with Government about the geological disposal facility siting process.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.6/2">To date, three 'expressions of interest' have been received (Copeland borough council, Cumbria county council and Allerdale borough council) for the areas of Copeland and Allerdale. The authorities and local stakeholders are working together in partnership to consider whether to move to the next stage of the process. The option to express an interest remains open and DECC officials are available to answer questions or advise any community who wishes to seek further information.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.6/3">Government, along with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), are responsible for implementing geological disposal. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management's (CoRWM's) primary task is to provide independent scrutiny and advice on the Government's and NDA's proposals, plans and programmes to deliver geological disposal, together with robust interim storage. Further information on the work of CoRWM is available on their website at:</p>

In some instances, applicants are asked to pay the fee required to carry out a check but this fee is subsequently reimbursed by ONS.</p>

	<p pid="a.451W.5/1">The individual organisations that make up the public sector have responsibility for ensuring that sickness absence is managed effectively. Cabinet Office hosts a forum for employers which span the civil service, public sector, private and voluntary sectors. This forum tackles cross cutting issues affecting the work force, and shares best practice to address work force issues such as staff sickness absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.5/2">Across the public sector, the Department of Health is working with NHS Employers to improve support for NHS staff health and well-being and reduce sickness absence rates in the NHS. Between April and June 2010 the average sickness absence rate for the NHS in England was 3.89% falling from 4.05% for the same period in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.5/3">Many NHS organisations have developed unique approaches to reducing staff absenteeism and have been running local pilots tailored to the needs of their workforce. For example, an NHS Plus initiative improving delivery of workplace and occupational health at York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has reduced long term sickness absence rates by 40% since it was launched in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.5/4">In response to Dame Carol Black's Review of Health of the UK, a UK wide programme jointly sponsored by Department for Work and Pensions and Department of Health is running 11 pilots to address long term sickness absence across all sectors. The pilots combine a personalised service tailored to the needs of the individual with employment support to address long-term sickness absence. These will run and be evaluated until at least 2011. More information can be found by accessing the DWP website:</p>

	<p pid="a.451W.5/6">The level of staff absence across the civil service as a whole is at its lowest since 1999. 41% of all staff had no sickness absence in the year up to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> and the average number of working days lost is currently 8.7.

	<p pid="a.453W.2/2"><i> (a)</i> As part of the Giving Green Paper published in December 2010, long-term trends in volunteering were assessed. The assessment found that levels of regular formal and informal volunteering have been fairly stable since 2000. The most recent data for England and Wales, suggests that around 29 million adults volunteered in 2010, of which, almost 18.5 million do so on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/3"><i> (b)</i> Growing a big society will put people at the heart of their community. It will enable them to take greater responsibility for helping others and themselves to solve problems through social action, including volunteering, and to grasp opportunities to shape their neighbourhoods. The Giving Green Paper set out some innovative ideas for helping people fit volunteering around their everyday lives, and we will expand on this in the White Paper to be published early this year. Although we do anticipate increases in levels of volunteering over the next three years, it would be unrealistic to accurately put a figure on what these might look like at this early stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.454W.2/1">12 providers have been appointed to run National Citizen Service (NCS) pilots for 16-year-olds in summer 2011. Over 11,000 NCS places will be available in a wide range of locations in England, and those organisations are now in the process of attracting young people to join their pilot schemes. My Department, in conjunction with the Department for Education and the Department for Communities and Local Government, continues to work closely with our 2011 pilot providers and to plan for the second year of NCS pilots in 2012.</p>

For these reasons, PCTs have not been advised of individual sums for breaks.</p>

	<p pid="a.457W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated January 2011:</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions asking:</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/5" class="indent">1. What the rate of mortality for children aged one to 14 years was in each (a) local authority area, (b) health authority area and (c) constituency in the latest year for which figures are available. (35839)</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/6" class="indent">2. What the rate of death of young people aged 15 to 19 years by (a) accident, (b) homicide and (c) suicide was in each (i) local authority area, (ii) health authority area and (iii) constituency in the latest year for which figures are available. (35840)</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/7" class="indent">Tables 1 to 3 provide the number of deaths of children aged one to 14 years in each (a) local authority (Table 1), (b) primary care organisation and local health board (Table 2) and (c) parliamentary constituency (Table 3), in England and Wales, for 2009 (the latest year available).</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/8" class="indent">Tables 4 to 6 provide the number of deaths where either (a) accidents, (b) homicide or (c) suicide was the underlying cause of death, for persons aged 15 to 19 years, in each (i) local authority (Table 4), (ii) primary care organisation and local health board (Table 5) and (iii) parliamentary constituency (Table 6), in England and Wales, for 2009 (the latest year available).</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/9" class="indent">Figures for accidents, homicide and suicide in Tables 4 to 6 have been combined to protect confidentiality, in line with the ONS policy on protecting confidentiality within birth and death statistics. Table 7 attached provides the number of deaths separately for each cause where (a) accidents, (b) homicide or (c) suicide was the underlying cause of death, for persons aged 15 to 19 years, in England and Wales, for 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/10" class="indent">It is ONS practice not to calculate mortality rates where there are fewer than three deaths in an area, as rates based on such low numbers are susceptible to inaccurate interpretation. As this affects a large number of areas within each table, the number of deaths in each area has been provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.2/11" class="indent">To take the size of each area into account, Tables 8 to 11 provide the mid-year population estimates for (a) children aged one to 14 and (b) persons aged 15 to 19, for each (i) local authority (Tables 8 and 9) and (ii) primary care organisation and local health board (Tables 10 and 11), in England and Wales, for 2009 (the latest year available).

The money will complete the roll out of the nationwide training programme and services which began in 2008 and begin to extend the benefits of talking therapies to the young, the elderly, those with serious mental illness and those who have anxiety disorders or depression alongside long-term physical health conditions like diabetes, heart or lung disease. By March 2011, the roll out will achieve 60% geographical coverage of England. The spending review settlement will complete this by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.464W.5/3">For individuals on benefits, there is support available from all of the Department of Work and Pensions' employment programmes through both mainstream and specialist services. They provide personalised support to help individuals overcome their challenges to work, including job broking, health-related support and signposting to relevant services. In each Jobcentre Plus district, there is a mental health co-ordinator function, which develops practical links between mental health and employment services and provides intelligence to advisers. Jobcentre Plus advisers also have access to disability employment advisers and work psychologists, who provide support and advice in relation to claimants and employees who have the most complex work-related support needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.0/1">The new registration system for private and voluntary healthcare and adult social care providers was set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (the 2008 Act). It came into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.0/2">The 2008 Act does not set minimum inspection frequencies for services. Instead, it enables the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to adopt a proportionate approach to inspection. Discussions about when to inspect are based on ongoing intelligence gathering and an assessment of risk. This means CQC targets its resources on providers where the risk is highest, while reducing the regulatory burden on providers where the risk is low.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.0/3">CQC implements its approach to inspections in two ways. CQC carries out planned and responsive reviews of a provider's compliance with the registration requirements. A planned review of compliance is a scheduled check of compliance with all of the 16 key essential safety and quality requirements. A responsive review of compliance is carried out when information, or a gap in information, raises concerns about people not experiencing the outcomes they should. Unlike a planned review of compliance, a responsive review is not a full check of compliance with all 16 key essential requirements; it targets the area(s) and outcomes that the specific concerns or gaps relate to.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.0/4">In terms of staffing, CQC is an independent body and it is therefore for CQC to determine the appropriate staffing complement in order to carry out its functions efficiently and effectively.</p>

They are unpaid and receive only reasonable out of pocket expenses. The Central Advisory Committee on Pensions and Compensation appointed one unpaid member. There were five appointments to the National Army Museum Council. Council members are unpaid but receive reasonable expenses. There were four appointments to the Defence Scientific Advisory Council. The chairman and council members are paid a fee for each day worked, plus reasonable travel and subsistence costs.

	<p pid="a.485W.5/1">The Technology Strategy Board supports technology innovation by UK businesses in those areas which offer the greatest scope for boosting UK growth and productivity on the basis of business and academic strength. To deliver this goal it works with partners across Government including, importantly, the research councils, as this ensures that investments in research are more closely informed by business, and that businesses will more readily adopt innovations that stem from excellent research.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.5/2">Since its establishment in July 2007, the partnership with the research councils has become stronger and more diverse, evolving from traditional areas (e.g. aerospace) to addressing key challenges (e.g. sustainable agriculture and food and stratified medicine) and growing sectors of the economy that are important to the UK (e.g. creative industries).</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.5/3">The scale of research council activity aligned with the Technology Strategy Board (announced and projected) now totals &#163;189 million, and has exceeded the original target of &#163;120 million over the current Spending Review period. Furthermore, over two thirds of the 900 current collaborative R and D projects, which account for a majority of the Technology Strategy Board's direct funding, have at least one university partner collaborating with business, and its knowledge transfer networks and knowledge transfer partnerships, enable business and academia to collaborate to improve competitiveness and productivity through better use of knowledge, technology and skills. Networks bring together key individuals with a shared interest in areas aligned with Technology Strategy Board priorities, and partnerships allow the placement of skilled individuals into business injecting vital know-how to enable the strategic development of the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.5/4">Moving forward, the research councils and the Technology Strategy Board have identified a number of strategic priority areas within the broad themes of high-value manufacturing; health care; digital; low carbon; energy and resource efficiency, for collaboration, and the research councils will also work with the Technology Strategy Board to help deliver technology and innovation centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.5/5">It should also be noted that the Technology Strategy Board will be the subject of a formal five-yearly review in 2012 which will assess its performance among other issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.486W.8/1">All export licence applications, including those for export to China, are considered on a case by case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria and the associated EU Code of Conduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/2">We have taken steps in recent years to reduce administrative burdens on the issuing of export licences in general. In September 2007 we moved to a fully electronic web based processing system, known as SPIRE. This replaced the previous system of paper licences and provides a complete end-to-end e-business service. This change benefited all exporters.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/3">The Government publishes licence processing target times. For standard individual export licences, the target is to process 70% of these within 20 working days; although if extra information is requested and not supplied, this will inevitably delay resolution of the case. Additionally, sensitive destinations, such as China which is subject to an EU arms embargo, sometimes take longer to process due to the need to apply greater scrutiny. Furthermore, the Government's performance against these targets for each destination country is published in the Annual and Quarterly Reports on Strategic Export Controls.</p>

Much more public funding will be reaching universities via students, supported by up-front loans from the public purse. These changes are significant, and we want to monitor their effects carefully. The draft guidance to the Director of Fair Access therefore asks him to review access agreements annually, rather than every five years as at present.</p>

Microfinance and larger loans are also supported by the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (and previously Small Firms Loan Guarantee). However, no information is available about the breakdown between microfinance and larger loans for these schemes.

	<p pid="a.492W.14/1">The last Government consulted on this issue in 2009, and found that there were mixed views. There was a strong feeling that regulation of debt recovery companies should be looked at in the context of the personal insolvency regime as a whole. Our call for evidence &quot;Managing Borrowing and Dealing with Debt&quot; (published October 2010) invited comments on the personal insolvency framework, including debt management aspects. We have received a large number of responses which are currently being analysed and will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.14/2">All who provide debt management services are required to be licensed under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Last year the Office of Fair Trading reviewed compliance with its Debt Management Guidance and published a report on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-28">28 September 2010</phrase>. Subsequently they issued warnings to 129 debt management firms about non-compliant business practices. Of the 129 firms, 35 have indicated that they will surrender their licences, 79 have produced audited evidence confirming action taken to address areas of non-compliance and the OFT have initiated revocation action against a number of traders.</p>

	<p pid="a.493W.2/1">The Council for Mortgage Lenders have advised that a student loan is very unlikely to materially impact on an individual's ability to get a mortgage.

	<p pid="a.493W.2/2">Our proposal to increase the repayment threshold from &#163;15,000 to &#163;21,000 will reduce the amount borrowers need to repay each month, and therefore increase the amount of net income available to them which could be helpful to them when applying for a mortgage.</p>
