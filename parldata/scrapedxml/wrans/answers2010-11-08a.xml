	<p pid="a.5W.3/1">The Electoral Commission informs me that it issues no such guidance. The responsibility for local government boundary reviews lies with the local government boundary commissions for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.3/2">The Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE) informs me that it issues electoral review guidance to local authorities within the framework provided by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.3/3">The Act provides that where a local authority which holds, or has resolved to hold, whole council elections every four years requests the LGBCE to undertake a single-member ward review, there is a presumption that the LGBCE should recommend a pattern of single-member wards for that authority. Where a local authority elects its members by thirds (elections in three years out of every four), there is a presumption that the LGBCE should recommend a uniform pattern of three-member wards. Similarly, where a local authority elects by halves (elections in two years out of four), there is a presumption that the LGCBE should recommend two-member wards.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.3/4">However, in each of these circumstances, the LGBCE is obliged to recommend a pattern of wards that best meets all of its other statutory criteria: to provide for equality of representation; to reflect community identities and interests; and to secure effective and convenient local government. This overrides any presumption to recommend a uniform pattern of single-, two- or three-member wards. Accordingly, the LGBCE is able to recommend a mixed pattern of wards if that would best meet its statutory criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.9W.8/1">Pollution control and river management works carried out by the Environment Agency with water companies, wildlife trusts, local rivers trusts and riparian landowners have helped to improve water quality and habitat structure in many rivers in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.8/2">Further habitat improvement and pollution prevention work, including land management incentives to tackle diffuse pollution, will help to make further improvements to the ecological status of rivers over the next few years. This should allow otters to continue their recovery, which has already seen an increase from occurrence at 5.8% of river sites in 1977-79 to 58.8% in 2009-10.</p>

This provides low cost loans to the sector, enabling communities to keep their buildings in a good state of repair. The funding of Community Halls dates back to the late 1930s. The current provision for this rolling fund stands at &#163;700,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.8/2">Additionally, DEFRA committed a total of &#163;45,000 funding over three years, from 2008-09 until 2010-11, towards research of the latest village hall survey. This was part of a package of support to fund Rural Communities Action Network (RCAN) for supporting rural communities as part of Community Empowerment and Rural Partnership Programme. The national rural community buildings survey is probably the most comprehensive information source on community-owned buildings, and provides detailed information on their physical state, financing, use and governance. In particular, some of the data was used by the BIG Lottery to help make the case for the recently announced new BIG Lottery Reaching Communities Programme for extension and refurbishment of halls.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.2/2">The feasibility study also calculated levelised generation costs for five potential Severn power schemes. These can be compared to recent estimates of levelised costs for onshore wind to give an indication of the relative cost of the technologies, as set out in the following table. All Severn scheme costs exclude the costs of Compensatory Habitat provision and any adjustment for Optimism Bias.</p>

The role of this group is to identify and prioritise a small number of specific policy proposals that will make the biggest difference to children and families.

We regularly urge the military regime to respect the human rights of all Burma's people and discuss these issues with a full range of international partners. I look forward to discussing Burma with President Obama. I know that he shares my concern about the situation there. US and UK officials are in regular and close contact in Washington, including with the White House, and on the ground in Burma. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Alistair Burt) and Assistant Secretary of State, Kurt Campbell, exchanged views on the subject at a meeting of the UN Secretary General's Group of Friends in September. We will continue to work closely with the US in our efforts to bring positive change to Burma.</p>

There are, however, two schemes to which Palestinian postgraduate students can apply to study in the UK for further qualifications. The Chevening scholarship scheme funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) provides talented graduates and young professionals from developing countries with the opportunity to develop their leadership skills. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council fund the Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Awards for outstanding students from the developing world to study for PhDs in high-rated UK research facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.28W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) considered one specific private financing proposal that was received in response to the 2009 public consultation on the St Helena airport. We also commissioned an independent review to determine whether there could be any other public private partnership (PPP) approaches that could be appropriate for financing the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.0/2">We were looking for a viable solution that would not only make the project more affordable in the short-term, but also deliver the project more efficiently by transferring risk from DFID to the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.0/3">The review concluded that a PPP approach would give limited scope for further risk transfer from the current Design, Build and Operate approach. Although a PPP approach could avoid the need for large up-front Government financing, it would do so on more costly terms, and therefore would be unlikely to deliver further value for money compared to the grant-funded approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.0/4">We want to provide a permanent, economically viable solution to the problem of access to St Helena. Independent analysis has concluded that, providing certain conditions are met, the best long-term solution from an economic and financial perspective for both the UK Government and St Helena is to construct an airport.</p>

	<p pid="a.31W.3/1">EADS employs a number of in-house lobbyists. We are aware that EADS has supplemented its resource in this area in recent months by taking on former senior personnel from the fire and rescue sector to lobby for changes to the Government's approach to FiReControl and its relationship with EADS. These efforts include both formal meetings and events, and informal contacts. We are also aware that Good Relations of the Bell Pottinger Group are also undertaking lobbying on behalf of EADS.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.3/2">I have myself been presented with speculative ideas from EADS that are not in the FiReControl project agreement. However, at the time I made it absolutely clear to EADS that my sole focus for the project was on them delivering the system specified in the project agreement to time, to cost and to quality. To this end, we activated a key milestone in their contract to deliver the main IT system in three control centres by mid-2011. I recommended to EADS that this should be their sole focus on the project too, rather than spending time and money on lobbying.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.3/3">The FiReControl project, initiated by the last Government, is over-budget and behind schedule. As with all major Government projects it is being reviewed to ensure value for money for the taxpayers. We have been clear that this Government are not prepared to pour any more taxpayers' money into funding EADS's further delays, nor can they cut any corners in the quality of the system they deliver. This Government are committed to ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, improving resilience and stopping the forced regionalisation of the fire service.</p>

There are a range of measures in place to help people struggling to pay their mortgage. These include access to free advice, support for mortgage interest (paid by DWP to unemployed homeowners), Homeowners Mortgage Support, and the Mortgage Rescue Scheme which enables the most vulnerable homeowners at risk of repossession to remain in their homes. These provisions are nationwide and not particular to Coventry or the west midlands. In July 2010, the Minister for Housing and Local Government announced changes to the Mortgage Rescue Scheme to secure better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to housing associations and tighter caps on property price and repair costs for new applications.</p>

We will carefully assess the impact of the new A levels introduced in 2008, and the modular GCSEs introduced in 2009, on standards and on the continuing fitness for purpose of these vital examinations. Many universities think that students should have more time to study subjects in depth to prepare them for higher education, and we will establish new arrangements for developing GCSEs and A levels which give universities and learned societies a much stronger say in their design. We will announce our detailed proposals later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.50W.2/4" class="indent">In order to provide the most up-to-date information, I have interpreted your request for the figures in the latest available year to run from <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October 2009</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase>. The figures you request are set out in three tables at the end of this letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.2/5" class="indent">Table A details the total number of stage 1 complaints about our work in this period and the number we responded to within 20 working days of receipt. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-01">1 September 2010</phrase> and so for the majority of the period you have requested information on, our timescale for response was 20 working days from receipt of the complaint. As a result, we monitored our performance against this standard and so Table A has been compiled using this target deadline. I hope this is acceptable, but please do not hesitate to contact me further if you want the 25 day figure specifically. Following public consultation and the introduction of our new complaints process earlier this year, we now make a telephone call to the complainant to clarify the detail and assess the type and scope of the complaint in the first five days after we receive the complaint. We now aim to provide a substantive response to complainants within 20 working days of the initial contact telephone call, or within 25 working days of receipt of the complaint, whichever is earlier. The timescale for the investigation begins the day after the telephone call with the complainant or six working days after the complaint was received if no contact has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.2/6" class="indent">Table B shows the total number of complaints about our work in this period that progressed to stage 2 and the number to which we responded within 20 working days of receipt of the stage 2 request from the complainant. The number of complaints is approximately 10% of the complaints received at stage 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.2/7" class="indent">Table C shows the total number of complaints that progressed to the Independent Complaints Adjudication Service for Ofsted in the last year. This figure represents approximately 2% of complaints received at stage one.</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.2/1">Following recent media coverage about the harm caused by squatters in residential and non-residential property, I have received a number of representations from members of the public and Members of Parliament calling for the law to be strengthened. To date, I have not received any representations from Members of the House of Lords or local councillors on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.2/2">I have asked my officials to look at the existing law on trespass and the way it is enforced to see if it can be strengthened. They are working with officials in other Government Departments, including the Home Office, and with the Association of Chief Police Officers and CPS to see what, if any, changes may need to made, including to police guidance on dealing with squatters. No firm conclusions have been reached.</p>

This has been made clear to ISW groups on many occasions although they have also been invited to see and comment on any emerging findings from the expert witness fees project as part of a wider reference group. This is because changes to payments to ISWs were consulted on as part of the joint Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and LSC consultation Family Legal Aid Funding from 2010 which ran from <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-18">18 December 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April 2009</phrase>. Following the full public consultation, it was confirmed in the consultation response that payment for legally aided independent social work in public and private law children cases would be capped to the same level as that paid by the Children and Family Court Advisory Service (CAFCASS). The consultation response was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-21">21 October 2009</phrase> and is available on the LSC website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.68W.8/1">In the financial year 2009-10 the funding allocated to North Wales Probation Board by NOMS was &#163;12,132,000. In addition to this funding, NOMS Cymru made an additional allocation of &#163;205,000 to ensure that North Wales Probation received a sufficient level of funding to provide probation services across the region. During the financial year north Wales identified that they would not spend this full allocation and a transfer of funding of &#163;112,000 was made to Gwent Probation Board to allow them to offer some employees early exit schemes. The final amount of funding provided to North Wales Probation Board for 2009-10 was &#163;12,225,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.68W.8/2">With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>, following the successful application of all four probation organisations in Wales to merge and form the Wales Probation Trust, North Wales Probation Board ceased to exist as a single entity. As such it is not possible to identify the amount of funding allocated to north Wales for probation services, however, the level of funding provided to the Wales Probation Trust for 2010-11 currently stands at &#163;55,626,000, which represents a funding settlement that is in line with the business plan put forward as part of the application to form the Wales Probation Trust. It is not possible to specify the proportion of funding provided to cover north Wales as many services are now provided on an all Wales basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.68W.8/3">NOMS is unable to confirm the level of funding that will be provided to the Wales Probation Trust for 2011-12 as the settlement for the whole of NOMS is not yet known. Once the detail of the impact of the comprehensive spending review has been worked through NOMS will be in a position to provide the planned funding allocation for Wales Probation Trust.</p>

	<p pid="a.72W.2/1">The Prison Service and NOMS are national agencies that cover the whole of England and Wales and provide a service for all offenders regardless of their home location. Presently there are no prisons situated in north Wales area and as such there has been no funding directly allocated to north Wales in relation to Prison Services. The majority of male offenders in custody that originate from north Wales are located at HMP Altcourse, with the majority of female prisoners being held in HMP Styal, and additional services have been allocate to support Welsh offenders held at both sites. The cost of these services are included in the overall prisons' costs as such we are unable to separately identify the funds utilised for those services.</p>

	<p pid="a.73W.2/1">Approved Premises provide close and enhanced supervised accommodation for high and very high risk offenders, which would be much more difficult if such offenders were dispersed into less suitable accommodation elsewhere in the community. Approved Premises accommodate prisoners who have completed the custodial part of their sentence and have been released on licence, as well as offenders serving community sentences and bailees with a condition of residence. The total budget for Approved Premises in each of the last three financial years (including 2010-11) has been &#163;58,300,000.

	<p pid="a.74W.2/1">In accordance with the legislation which governs the release of prisoners, no prisoner serving a determinate sentence is required to serve the entire sentence in prison. Most are required by law to be released at the halfway point of their sentence and, for sentences longer than 12 months, they then serve the second half of the sentence on licence in the community. They are supervised by the Probation Service and may be recalled to prison during the licence period if they fail to comply with their conditions. Only those prisoners serving a life sentence with a whole life tariff will spend their entire sentence in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.2/2">The actual amount of time served in prison, following sentence, will depend on a number of factors, including time spent as a remand prisoner or credit for time spent on tagged bail if directed by the court, any added days for misbehaviour in prison and where release may be discretionary, for example on parole, home detention curfew or end of custody licence, if eligibility criteria are met-the end of custody licence scheme operated between June 2007 and March 2010, when it was brought to an end.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.2/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September</phrase>, 593 prisoners at HM Prison Maidstone were on the standard or enhanced levels of the IEP scheme and therefore eligible to rent a TV set and 386 were on the enhanced level and eligible to have a games console of their own in their possession. The equivalent figures for the prison estate as a whole were 83,017 and 36,202 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/4">To establish how many of those eligible actually had a games console of their own would necessitate asking each prisoner individually at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.84W.9/1">According to Government of Colombia figures 317 internally displaced persons were killed in 2007, 363 in 2008 and 553 in 2009. These figures equate to 1.9%, 2.4% and 3.1% respectively of the total number of homicides in that year.</p>

Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities are particularly vulnerable, mainly because they occupy land of strategic importance to guerrilla groups, cocaine cultivation or narco-trafficking.</p>

	<p pid="a.85W.5/2">Our embassy in Bogota funded the visit of UN Special Rapporteur James Anaya to Colombia in July 2009.

	<p pid="a.85W.5/3">However, significant obstacles remain in the effort to realise the rights of indigenous people, particularly in the areas of land rights, forced displacement, nutrition, threats and murders. Officials at our embassy in Bogota have visited a number of indigenous communities to show support and hear at first hand about the difficulties they face. This has included visits to the Awa community in Narino and the Emberas community in Choco. Our embassy is also funding a project to enhance the judicial system and combat impunity in Cauca. Indigenous communities here represent 21.5% of the entire indigenous population in Colombia and are the victims of most human rights' abuses.</p>

	<p pid="a.86W.6/2">Provision already exists under Article 126(11) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union for the imposition of financial penalties on euro-area member states which are considered to be in excessive deficit and fail to comply with the Council's recommendations under the EU's Stability and Growth Pact. These cannot be applied to the UK since we are not a member of the euro-area. Moreover, our Protocol to the Treaty precludes use of any sanctions against the UK under this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.6/3">The European Commission has recently published legislative proposals which create additional sanctions to encourage compliance by member states with the Stability and Growth Pact and the EU's Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. There are a variety of possible sanctions, extending up to fines of more than 0.2% of a member state's GDP for serious and repeated breaches of the Stability and Growth Pact. However, the draft proposals for sanctions relate only to euro-area member states and thus do not apply to the UK.</p>

According to the UN in May, prior to the Israeli announcement, there were 2,794 trucks allowed into Gaza compared to 3569 in September. However, this still falls significantly short of the required amount and we believe that more needs to be done to ensure full implementation and deliver real change on the ground. We continue to discuss these issues with the Government of Israel and the UN Relief and Works Agency.</p>

The reduced role for the EHRC set out in the findings of the Public Bodies Review means that the Commission's workforce will reduce considerably over the next four years. GEOs staff will also reduce. No precise estimate of the costs of redundancies is possible given that the amounts payable are still to be decided and the numbers being made redundant will depend on other factors such as natural wastage.</p>

The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful for a disabled person to be subjected to direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, or discrimination arising from disability.

	<p pid="a.100W.5/1">Engagement with the public and external experts has demonstrated a strong consensus in support of action to tackle the deficit and secure economic stability. It has also revealed broad agreement that spending reductions should be balanced across public services and welfare payments, rather than just focused on the former. Regarding the switch to the consumer price index (CPI) for the indexation of benefits, tax credits and public sector pensions, a number of economic commentators have endorsed the Government's assessment that the CPI has advantages over the retail price index, including that it better represents the real behaviour of consumers in substituting away from goods which have become relatively more expensive towards cheaper goods.</p>

	<p pid="a.108W.2/1">Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) can be used as a transport fuel in converted petrol vehicles.

	<p pid="a.108W.2/3">The results of this testing showed that air pollutant emissions when these vehicles ran on LPG were similar to, but no lower than, those when running on petrol. Tailpipe CO2 emissions from LPG were however around 11% lower than from petrol, due to the lower carbon content of the fuel. Based on this evidence, converting petrol vehicles to run on LPG is unlikely to have any air quality benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.119W.6/2">The proposed closure of the passport application processing centre at Newport would affect around 250 staff. The Identity and Passport Office are proposing to retain a customer service centre in Newport to service south Wales and the south-west. This will redeploy up to 45 people to provide a counter service and the ability to deal with applicants in the Welsh language. There is no forecast yet available regarding the volume or type of vacancies that might arise in the wider civil service between now and the proposed closure date. However, Identity and Passport Service is committed to providing individuals with outplacement support in order to help facilitate their move to alternative employment. This will include providing support in identifying alternative job opportunities both in the wider public sector but also in the private sector; providing practical training and development support; and making dedicated office space available to outplacement support where members of staff can go to seek help and advice and take time to carry out their job search.</p>

Because of this level of under-diagnosis, one of the Government's priority objectives in implementing the National Dementia Strategy is increasing the early diagnosis of dementia.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.5/1">At the time of licensing Ativan (original brand name for lorazepam), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's predecessor, the Medicines Division of the Department of Health and Social Security, considered that the data provided were sufficient, in terms of the evidence of quality, safety and efficacy, to allow the grant of a marketing authorisation. The Committee on the Review of Medicines also considered the risk:benefit balance of Ativan to be positive in relation to quality, safety and efficacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.5/2">The licences for all oral Ativan products were cancelled in 2008 at the request of the marketing authorisation holder for commercial reasons and the Department no longer holds the original clinical trial data which supported these applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.5/3">A number of generic lorazepam products have been approved in the United Kingdom following a thorough assessment of the data submitted by the applicant companies. However, under the terms of the Directive 2001/83/EC (article 10.1 'generic application' or article 10c 'informed consent') the product information for the new generic must reflect the safety information contained within the brand leader's product information and these applications do not need to be supported by new clinical trials investigating safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.5/4">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency continuously monitors the safety of medicines using a variety of sources including information from clinical studies, published literature, spontaneous case reports, data from marketing authorisation holders as well as other regulatory authorities. This information is used to ensure that up to date information is provided in the product information, which consists of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet, to aid the safe use of the medicine for the approved indication.</p>

They will not be directly responsible for commissioning services that GPs themselves provide, nor will they will be responsible for commissioning the other family health services.

	<p pid="a.137W.5/1">The National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) is renowned as being one of the best screening programmes in the world, with over three quarters of women invited choosing to participate. However, it is important that we are careful to promote breast screening in a responsible way, so that women can make an informed choice on whether to be screened or not. Like other methods of screening, mammography is not perfect.</p>
	<p pid="a.137W.5/2">Despite this, we do know that women from certain groups are less likely to take up their invitation for breast screening. Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for commissioning the NHS BSP locally and for organising local screening awareness initiatives as appropriate. In March 2010 the Department published &quot;Reducing cancer inequality: evidence, progress and making it happen: a report by the National Cancer Equality Initiative&quot;. A copy has already been placed in the Library. The report recommended that PCTs review local levels of screening coverage and uptake to consider whether further action is required to improve coverage and uptake.</p>

	<p pid="a.138W.5/15">Several departmental/national health service activities contribute to COPD prevention and exacerbation prevention, including influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination and Stop Smoking Services. These activities also help prevent other diseases, so it is difficult to attribute a precise fraction of their cost to COPD. The Impact Assessment estimates an attributed cost of &#163;20 million per annum for the vaccinations. Data from the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care shows total expenditure on Stop Smoking Services (excluding pharmaceuticals) of &#163;60.8 million in 2007-08, &#163;73.7 million in 2008-09 and &#163;83.9 million in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.140W.8/1">There are no plans to allocate extra resources to Darent Valley hospital for this purpose, as, under the Payment by Results system, hospitals are paid by commissioners for all activity within the scope of the national tariff, adjusted by the Market Forces Factor to take account of unavoidable local cost differences. As tariff payments follow the patient, an increase in activity at Darent Valley hospital would result in it attracting tariff payments that it otherwise would not have received had those patients been treated elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.141W.11/1">In October 2009, the Department undertook and published an impact assessment of regulation of primary medical and dental care providers under the Health and Social Care Act (2008). The impact assessment considered the cost and benefits of registering primary care providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.11/2">The current regulatory arrangements for primary care focus on the competence of the individual professional. The Care Quality Commission will actively monitor providers' compliance against registration requirements, focusing on the way that organisations are managed and the way their systems work. For example, organisations must meet requirements around cleanliness and infection control, medicines management, premises and equipment. These safety issues, as well as a number of other registration requirements are not covered in full by other bodies.</p>

	<p pid="a.150W.5/1">National health service funding for 2011-12 to 2014-15 is set out in the recent spending review settlement; funding is protected in real terms over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/2">Further, the Department is working with the NHS to prepare to deliver a quantum shift in NHS efficiency, delivering &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/3">All of these savings will be reinvested in the NHS. Together with the guarantee to protect funding against inflation the increased efficiency will allow the NHS to continue to deliver high quality health care and keep pace with demographic pressures, medical advances and rising public expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/4">On the particular pressures identified in the question:</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/5">An increasingly elderly population: The Department anticipate a pressure of about 1% per year over the spending review period. This matches analysis of external commentators such as The Kings Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/6">Branded drug prices are controlled by the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS)-a voluntary agreement between the Department and the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries-which aims to achieve a balance between reasonable prices for the NHS and a fair return for the industry to enable it to research, develop and market new and improved medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/7">The 2009 agreement included a pricing package comprising price cuts of 3.9% in 2009, and a further 1.9% in 2010. The agreement also permits price increases of 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.2% in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/8">In 2014 we will introduce a system of value based pricing for medicines, where the price of a drug will be determined by its assessed value. The NHS faces great challenges and reforming the way we pay for new medicines is a key part of ensuring that patients get better access to drugs and the NHS and the taxpayer get better value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.151W.2/1">The implementation programme has been successful, with the vast majority of recommendations needing a central steer being either completed or nearing completion. Key progress includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/2" class="indent">Establishing a new Organ Donor Organisation within NHS Blood and Transplant.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/3" class="indent">Establishing a new United Kingdom-wide independent Donation Ethics Committee within the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/4" class="indent">Ensuring that Acute Trusts have: a Clinical Lead for Organ Donation; A Donation Committee; a Specialist Nurse for Organ Donation.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/5" class="indent">Disseminating bench-marked data to trusts every six months, to enable them to monitor their potential and actual donation rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/6" class="indent">Removing financial disincentives, through reimbursing trusts for the management of potential donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/7" class="indent">Establishing organ retrieval teams to provide high quality, 24/7, organ retrieval service across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/8" class="indent">Publishing national guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/9" class="indent">Running a national media campaign to promote organ donation.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/10">Work to implement the recommendations in the Organ Donation Taskforce report has been ongoing since the report was first published in January 2008 and good progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/11">As part of the implementation programme, NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) have already been working to raise the profile of and improve the systems for organ donation within every hospital trust. In order to do this they have established a network of 220 Specialist Nurses for Organ Donation who are based at hospitals throughout the country. The role of these specialist nurses is to work with families, providing a constant link to support and guide them throughout the donation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/12">NHSBT have also worked with hospitals to ensure the appointment of 187 Clinical Leads for Organ Donation. Usually intensive care or emergency medicine consultants, the Clinical Leads are working with their colleagues to foster a culture where consideration of the potential for organ donation becomes a usual rather than unusual event.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/13">In addition to this 160 Donation Committees have been set up within hospitals with the tools they need and an innovative Professional Development Programme to support organ donation.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/14">There were 884 organ donations after death in 2008, when the implementation programme began. The implementation programme has led to the number of deceased organ donors and organ transplants reaching a record UK high last year, with the lives of more than 3,700 people being saved through the gift of life. This represents a 19% increase in deceased organ donation since the implementation programme began. This increase is significantly higher than the Programme Delivery Board anticipated at such an early stage of the implementation programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.2/15">We are taking steps to ensure that the momentum gained over the last two years is sustained, to enable us to realise the taskforce's aspiration of a 50% increase in organ donation by 2013. This includes continuing to ensure that work is aligned with and utilises new levers, such as those included in the NHS White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.159W.5/1">Thrombolysis is only suitable for a small proportion of people who have had an ischaemic stroke. We want to develop the system so that everyone who has a stroke, and can benefit from thrombolysis, is able to receive it safely. Pathways to achieve this will vary between local health economies. For example, some areas have developed a smaller number of hospitals providing a 24 hour, seven day a week service for a larger population, while others are developing telemedicine arrangements to access stroke specialist expertise remotely out of hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.5/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Stroke Quality Standard launched in June 2010 is a set of specific, concise statements that act as markers of high quality, cost-effective patient care covering treatment and prevention. Statement three in this stroke standard says &quot;patients with suspected stroke are admitted directly to a specialist acute stroke unit and assessed for thrombolysis, receiving it if clinically indicated.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.162W.0/2">I have also met Dame Lynne Brindley twice recently in her role as the chair of the independent Online Learning Task Force. The Task Force was established by HEFCE to make recommendations regarding the development of excellence in online learning, to support higher education (HE) in exploiting fully its pedagogical and commercial opportunities, with the aim of our HE sector sustaining its excellence and growing its market share. Although it was set up under the last Government, the Task Force has our full support for its objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.0/3">The appropriate use of digital technology in education has a very important role to play in both supporting and enhancing higher education. It can help universities to improve the quality of their provision, meet the expectations of today's digitally-aware students and fully engage disadvantaged students in HE-especially those with disabilities and caring responsibilities-as well as enabling them to deliver HE in more flexible ways.</p>

	<p pid="a.162W.3/1">The Government have now set out their proposals for higher education and student finance in Parliament following the Browne Review of Higher Education and Student Finance. The Government have broadly accepted Lord Browne's proposals on repayment while adapting the system to make it more progressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.3/2">We have estimated the number of years students are likely to be in repayment if the proposals in the Browne Review were to be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.3/3">Graduates move into repayment from the April after they leave university. The following table gives the number of years that we estimate graduates will be in repayment, though in each year there will be many graduates who will be eligible to repay as they have left university while benefitting from the low income protection and not actually making any repayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.3/4">Graduates who are still in repayment after 30 years have the balance of their loan cancelled and are considered to be in repayment for 30 years. Graduates who fully repay their loan on graduation are considered to be in repayment for 0 years. Graduates who have their loans cancelled for death or disability are considered to be in repayment for the number of years until their loan is cancelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.3/5">This has been based on a student on a three-year course taking out a loan in each year.</p>

	<p pid="a.173W.3/1">DWP is fully committed to supporting disabled people, including those with mental health difficulties such as depression, to find suitable, sustainable work through Jobcentre Plus Personal Advisers, including disability employment advisers (DEAs), and programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.3/2">The Work Programme will be an integrated package of support providing personalised help to a broad range of customers, including those who may previously have been receiving incapacity benefits for many years. We will offer providers higher rewards for supporting harder to help customers into employment to ensure that it is worthwhile for providers to offer all customer groups, including those with disabilities or health conditions, appropriate employment support. We aim to have the Work Programme in place nationally by the summer of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.3/3">Jobcentre Plus policy is to develop its people in the skills required to manage a range of behaviours demonstrated by customers, covering a variety of health conditions. This approach ensures that they are equipped to deal with a diverse set of circumstances whilst treating customers as individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.3/4">Skilled employment advisers look at the interaction between the person, the job and an individual's ability. Advisers ensure that job goals relate to the person's abilities and that work solutions are sought which overcome any challenges a customer might face in a particular job.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.3/5">DWP and the other partners in the cross-government Health Work and Well-being Executive also have a programme of action for those in work. The programme of action looks to improve health at work and to reduce the level of ill health related job loss. It has a particular focus on support for people who have mental health conditions, as they are more likely to face stigma and discrimination and less likely to have access to timely diagnosis and the sorts of interventions that could help keep them in or help them to return to work quickly.</p>
