	<p pid=".882W.0/2">The new biodiesel rate of 27.10 pence per litre was chosen to maintain the 20 pence per litre duty differential with ultra-low sulphur diesel. The Government offers lower duty rates for less environmentally-damaging fuels by offering duty differentials relative to the main road fuels. These differentials are intended primarily to reflect the relative environmental benefits of the fuels in question. In determining the size of the duty incentive for biodiesel, the Government has taken into account principally the environmental benefits of the fuel, which amount to approximately 55 per cent. carbon emissions savings on a lifecycle basis, as well as a range of other benefits offered by the fuel, including fuel security benefits and the potential to encourage the recycling of waste products.</p>

	<p pid=".883W.11/16">This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income, described in detail in The Child and Working Tax Credit. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &pound;2,500, disregarding the first &pound;2,500 of any risk. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.11/17">Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or new tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.11/18">As a result of the Government's reforms, over half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1997. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children.</p>

	<p pid=".888W.6/1">In order to prevent the spread of Avian Influenza (AI) from the European Union to the UK the Department has taken the following steps.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/2">In March 2003 Defra issued Declarations under Regulation 27 of the Animals and Animal Products (Import and Export) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (and equivalent legislation in the devolved territories) introducing a ban on the import of live poultry, hatching eggs and racing/show pigeons from the Netherlands and Belgium. These Declarations make it a criminal offence to import live poultry and hatching eggs into England from both the Netherlands and Belgium. A further Declaration was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-09">9 May 2003</phrase> prohibiting the import of live poultry and hatching eggs from the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also introduced similar measures.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/3">In normal circumstances, all birds (poultry or captive birds) entering the UK from the EU must be accompanied by an EU model health certificate stating that premises and area of origin are free from AI.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/4">The Government have also banned the import from the Netherlands, Belgium and from the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany of fresh, unprocessed and non-heat treated poultry manure and litter. EU legislation does not permit trade in fresh poultry meat if it was obtained from poultry originating in established surveillance zones in those countries.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/5">In addition, action was also taken on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-16">16 May</phrase> to ban the importation into the UK of cull day old chicks from the Netherlands, Belgium and from the Land of North</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/6">Rhine-Westphalia in Germany.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/7">Table eggs do not present a high risk of spread of disease. Any risk would be of mechanical transmission of virus on eggs, packaging or means of transport. Controls in force in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany provide good safeguards against this risk and a ban on imports would be disproportionate.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/8">Defra has reminded egg and poultry producers in the UK about the need for stringent biosecurity measures at all times. To minimise the introduction of AI into their flocks by means of faecal contamination, poultry producers should ensure that their boots, clothing, equipment and vehicles are disinfected. Access by wild birds should be minimised, for instance by clearing up feed spillages. Officials have asked poultry producers in the UK to be vigilant for any signs of respiratory disease in birds and contact their local veterinary office immediately if they have any concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/9">The Department is monitoring the AI situation in the EU. Should there be any significant changes, the risk assessment for the UK will be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.6/10">Officials have reviewed and updated the Contingency Plan, are learning the lessons about the Dutch outbreak from the authorities there, and remain in close touch with the poultry industry about measures we would take should the disease appear here.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.2/1">The Carbon Trust is a private company created in April 2001 to take the lead on energy efficiency in the business and public sectors, and to support the development of the low carbon sector in the UK. The Trust has already done much valuable work in developing its three main programme areas and is taking a proactive role in the energy efficiency arena in its role as the main source of energy efficiency information and advice for the non-domestic sector. An initial impact assessment programme for the Trust is being developed and should provide preliminary results over the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.2/2">A policy evaluation of the Energy Saving Trust to review their effectiveness in carrying out their objectives in the period 1996&ndash;99 was completed in September 2000. The report concluded that the Energy Saving Trust had a valuable contribution to make to the Government's sustainable energy objectives in promoting energy efficiency and that there was a continuing case for funding those objectives that could not be met through other sources.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.2/3">The Government's Energy White Paper has made clear that they will continue to support the work of the two trusts. It also announced a review of low carbon delivery programmes and associated support bodies before the end of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".891W.2/2">The egg industry are concerned that following tariff reductions in the current WTO round, they will have to compete against imports from third countries where compliance with lower standards of animal welfare confers a substantial cost advantage. The EU has successfully pressed for such non trade concerns to be taken into consideration in the negotiations and the UK will continue to play an important role in formulating EU policy in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".895W.5/1">One cause of the decline in salmon stocks may be increases in river temperatures resulting from natural factors or human activities. This could reduce the survival or reproductive success of the fish. The tags used in the study record temperature and transmit the fish's position, allowing scientists to investigate whether or not adult salmon show temperature preferences during upstream migration. This is of particular relevance to the spring-running multi-sea winter salmon in the Avon, which are resident in freshwater for many months prior to spawning. The results of this work will be used to provide advice to Government and other organisations dedicated to the conservation and sustainable management of salmon stocks, on the potential impacts of habitat management practices and climate change on salmonid populations.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.5/2">Between 1985 and 1990 more than 400 salmon were tagged with radio transmitting tags in the Avon estuary. The great majority of these fish entered the Avon and were tracked migrating upstream to their spawning areas. 45 were reported caught by anglers, which is consistent with recapture rates elsewhere of conventionally tagged fish. No radio-tagged fish were found dead in the river. This suggests that tagging salmon with radio tags has a negligible influence upon their natural behaviour or survival.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.5/3">Both riparian owners and angling interests were consulted through the Environment Agency, who discussed the work with the Chairman of the Avon and Stour Fishery Association; riparian interests were sent a copy of a letter from CEFAS explaining the purpose of the work and the methods to be used. The Chairman of the Wessex Salmon and Rivers Trust, and English Nature, were also consulted.</p>

	<p pid=".902W.0/1">My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions, represented the UK at the Competitiveness Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-13">13 May 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/2">The council adopted conclusions on Industry Policy in an Enlarged Europe, which were discussed at the Competitiveness Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/3">The commission introduced its new Communication on Innovation Policy. Among other things it highlights the EU's continued underperformance in turning ideas into commercially successful products and services. The commission emphasised that new models and marketing methods were as important as exploiting technological research. Key characteristics of EU policy should be an emphasis on diffusion, and seeing the world from a business perspective. Other important elements were innovation in the public sector, regional diversity and the challenges of diversity.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/4">The UK welcomed the communication, while expressing some disappointment that the commission had not done more to integrate research and innovation policy. The communication could also have gone further in promoting the role of competition. A light touch was needed in applying the open method of co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/5">Many similar points were made in discussion on the commission's Action Plan for increasing spending on Research and Development to 3 per cent. of GDP. Member states particularly stressed the need for fiscal and other incentives, and more flexibility over state aid. This area was of equal importance to accession states; Slovenia was interested in the question of policy co-ordination and how to make markets work better.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/6">Commissioner Liikanen presented the commission's 7th Report on the situation of world shipbuilding. The report highlighted that the difficulties in world shipbuilding are growing, as evidenced by a further decrease in orders for new vessels in the major shipbuilding regions in 2002. The commission stressed that the most important market segments for EU yards developed negatively. For EU producers, order intake in 2002 was down by 50 per cent. compared to 2001. Investigations into Korean yards show that there were large-scale subsidies, and the commission was working closely with industry representatives on the challenges the sector currently faces, and would report by the end of the year. The French and Spanish delegations, supported by Germany and Portugal urged the commission to extend the temporary defence mechanism and include liquid gas carriers. France also pressed for the commission to open a WTO dispute procedure against Korea.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/7">In introducing the Communication on European Defence&mdash;Industrial and Market Issues the commission argued that the industrial aspects of defence equipment supply were important for EU competitiveness. The fragmented state for the EU market needed to be overcome, and consolidation should be encouraged by an appropriate regulatory framework which would promote cost-effectiveness. Commissioner Busquin supported this with a plea for more civil/military synergy in R&amp;D. A number of member states were cautious. The UK gave a broad welcome but said detailed examination would be needed, including inter-governmental work on key issues.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/8">The council considered a draft resolution which broadly supported the commission's Green Paper on European Space Policy and better co-operation between the commission and the European Space Agency. After a comprehensive discussion, and concerns raised by the Italian and German delegations, details on the form and scope of such an agreement were deleted. The resolution was then agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/9">Wide-ranging proposals for regulation of chemicals were presented by the commission. Commissioner Liikanen recognised the need to strike a balance between public health and environmental objectives on the one side, and competitiveness on the other and stressed the commission's effort to ease the burden on SMEs and respond to industry concerns. A number of member states, including the UK, intervened to warn of major concerns over the effect on competitiveness and the danger of moving chemical production outside the EU, and emphasised the need for impact assessment and for the Competitiveness Council to keep the issue under review. The Italian delegation said that the legal base included Article 95, which meant that the Competitiveness Council should lead on the dossier, and indicated that this would feature highly on the agenda during their presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/10">The commission also presented their latest report on the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Strategy, stressing three key priorities: more effective use of intellectual property rights; the need to implement EU legislation on GMOs; and improved access to finance.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/11">Ministers discussed the arrangements for selecting the site for the new International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). All member states apart from Spain agreed with the draft council conclusions supporting the commission's approach that a single EU candidate site should be selected to compete subsequently with the non-EU sites. Spain argued that the EU would stand a better chance if both EU sites (French and Spanish) were put forward together. The presidency was forced to abandon formal conclusions, and summed up that all Spain could accept the suggested process, which would be based on an objective criteria and expert input.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.5/1">European Union Defence Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council focused mainly on military capabilities, noting that</p>
	<p pid=".912W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;the EU now has operational capability across the full range of Petersberg tasks, limited and constrained by recognised shortfalls.&quot; These shortfalls particularly affect speed of deployment and level of risk for larger scale, higher-intensity tasks. Ministers endorsed the launch of ECAP Project Groups, in which participating member states will work on implementing selected solutions identified by the ECAP Panels. Ministers welcomed the first meeting of the EU-NATO Capability Group, which will help to ensure that EU efforts on military capabilities are coherent and mutually reinforcing with the work in NATO, as well as proposals in the context of the Convention for an EU defence capabilities development and acquisition agency. Ministers also noted the significant progress on ESDP since their last formal meeting in November 2002, and in particular, agreement on the Berlin Plus arrangements with NATO and the launch of the first military ESDP operation in Macedonia. The full Conclusions from the General Affairs and External Relations Council will be placed in the Library in the House shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".913W.2/1">Providing a safe, secure and risk free environment for the Iraqi people is a key aspect of restoration activity for the Coalition. When any unexploded munitions&mdash;including cluster bomblets and mines&mdash;are discovered, United Kingdom and other Coalition forces mark the site and inform those in the vicinity. Their normal practice is then to destroy the munitions in situ. Those that present the greatest threat to human life and coalition operations are destroyed first.</p>
	<p pid=".913W.2/2">Increasing amounts of independent research by eminent scientists within groups such as the Royal Society Depleted Uranium Working Group and the United Nations Environment Programme support the view that DU levels will only necessitate precautions to prevent or reduce possible intakes in highly localised areas. As many defeated tanks as possible within the British area of operations are being cordoned off and kept undisturbed, awaiting scientific examination.</p>
	<p pid=".913W.2/3">In support of the United Nations Environment Programme environmental survey of Iraq, the Ministry of Defence has released information on DU used by UK Forces in the Iraq conflict and will be making available details of where that usage occurred. The UK Government will be considering carefully any scientific data which may emerge concerning environmental issues in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".921W.2/4" class="indent">A claim package is sent out approximately four months prior to a customer approaching State Pension age (age 65 for a man, age 60 for a woman). This package includes an invitation to claim (form BR833) and a letter of expected entitlement (form BR33M/W). This package is issued to all customers based on whether they have entitlement based on their own National Insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/5" class="indent">Form BR833 informs a married man that if his wife is 60 or over a claim form can be sent to him for her to complete to claim State Pension based on his contributions. Also on form BR33M issued to a man it alerts him that his wife can claim State Pension on his National Insurance contributions. It asks him to advise her to claim if she has a reduced rate State Pension of her own or none at all.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.5/16">1. The estimates in Table 1 are based on potential claimants eligible to Pension Credit rather than actual claimants.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/17">2. Column 3 relates to the proportion of households eligible to Pension Credit out of the total number of pensioner households for that age group.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/18">3. The estimates were calculated for all pensioners using the department's Policy Simulation Model based on the Family Resource Survey data for 2000&ndash;01 projected forward to 2003&ndash;04. This shows around 3.6 million households entitled to pension credit.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/19">4. The Policy Simulation Model excludes all pensioners in nursing or residential care homes. This is because the Family Resource Survey data does not contain information on these cases. We estimate that just over 200,000 pensioners in care homes will be entitled to Pension Credit. This means that total pension credit entitlement for 2003&ndash;04 is estimated to be about 3.8 million households.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/20">5. The figures in the table were rounded to the nearest 50,000 cases. The figures may not add up due to rounding.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/21">The Department's PSA target states that 3 million households will be in receipt of Pension Credit by 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".929W.5/1">The discretionary Social Fund, which includes interest free budgeting loans and crisis loans, plays an important role in our agenda for tackling poverty and social exclusion. It provides support to millions of people on low incomes who need help with unexpected and varied needs.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.5/2">Budgeting Loans are available to people who have been receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance for at least 26 weeks, to help with intermittent expenses which are difficult to budget for. Crisis Loans are available to anyone in an emergency or as a result of a disaster, whether in receipt of benefit or not, when they have no other means of preventing serious damage or risk to their, or a member of their family's, health or safety.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.5/3">The items for which Budgeting Loans can be awarded are not specified in detail; help is provided for a broad range of expenses for which an applicant may have difficulty in budgeting for from their benefit. Because a Crisis Loan is intended to cover immediate short-term needs, the help needed may be for a specific item or service or to meet immediate living expenses for a short period, usually up to 14 days.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.5/4">Part 4 of the Discretionary Social Fund Guide (para 6300 et seq.), lists the categories of need for which a Budgeting Loan can be awarded. A copy is available in the Library. Part 3 of the Guide (para 4700 et seq.) provides examples of the circumstances in which a Crisis Loan can be awarded.</p>

To meet this rising demand, and to reduce waiting times for driving tests, the Driving Standards Agency has recently recruited over 130 driving examiners and plans to recruit 330 more in the coming year. The increased levels of test demand also impact on the number of support staff, such as call centre agents, that are needed.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.11/3">In addition, DSA is boosting other activities in line with commitments in the Government's &quot;Road Safety Strategy&quot;, such as delivering a national programme of &quot;Arrive Alive&quot; presentations to youngsters in schools and colleges.

Transport Direct will provide integrated travel information to help people to plan their journeys and to compare routes and prices across different types of transport. The ultimate vision for Transport Direct is to cover all types of transport within the UK, including rail, bus, car, ferries, air, trams, and taxis. Transport Direct will do three things:</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/2" class="indent">Tell the traveller what choices they have when planning the journey</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/3" class="indent">Allow the traveller to book and pay for their journey at the time of making their inquiry</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/4" class="indent">Advise the traveller about how their chosen travel option is performing in real-time before they set off.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/5">Initially it will be available over the internet through our Transport Direct Web Portal. Later on we hope to extend the service to mobile phones, hand held devices, high street kiosks and interactive TV.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/6">We expect the first release of the Transport Direct portal to be available by the end of 2003, and will include:</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/7" class="indent">multi-modal travel information on the internet, covering road journeys as well as all public transport modes at a single point of contact</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/8" class="indent">real-time (that is, actual rather than recorded or timetabled) train operating information</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/9" class="indent">some booking of long-distance multi-modal journeys on the internet</p>
	<p pid=".945W.11/10" class="indent">development of Internet-based maps, which will allow travellers to examine public transport options both for visiting a specific venue and for general travel around an area they are considering visiting.</p>

	<p pid=".946W.8/1">The Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board was set up to carry forward the proposals made by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science report on modernising the vehicle registration system. The Board is driving forward a programme aimed at reducing vehicle crime and enhancing compliance with road traffic law in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.8/2">The Board have advised on a package of improvements to tackle car crime, reduce car dumping and ensure that every vehicle has a traceable keeper. As a consequence of the Board's advice, a range of proposals were announced by my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (David Jamieson) today that will significantly tighten the registration and licensing system, and make it much easier to deter and detect motorists who fail to insure or tax their vehicle. It will also be easier to trace the keepers of abandoned vehicles. The measures announced include; the registered keepers of vehicles remaining legally responsible at all times for taxing their vehicle, offenders will be penalised from the record when their tax-disc expires or Statutory Off-Road Notification lapses. Those that fail to comply will face a new automatic &pound;80 penalty. Determined offenders could face a minimum &pound;1,000 fine if taken to court.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.8/3">The Government intend to consult on the secondary legislation that it plans to bring forward to implement these proposals. A wide range of stakeholders have already been consulted on these new measures and further consultation will take place as future initiatives are considered by the Board.</p>

Talks held in Tokyo on 17 to <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-18">18 May 2003</phrase>, aimed at salvaging the peace process, failed to reach agreement.

We continue to impress upon both sides that a long-term solution to Aceh can only be achieved through peaceful dialogue and full implementation of the COHA.

The verdict was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-27">27 February 2003</phrase>.

	<p pid=".950W.15/1">The fall of Saddam Hussein's regime has brought to an end a long period of violations of the Iraqi people's human rights. The draft UN Security Council Resolution, put forward by the UK, US and Spain, proposes that there should be a UN Special Representative whose responsibilities would include the promotion of human rights. Working to support the people of Iraq in moving toward the establishment of a representative government affording equal rights and justice to all Iraqi citizens will be the best means of ensuring that their human rights are protected.</p>

There are approximately 80 BESTs working in 33 local education authorities (LEAs) supporting over 70 secondary and 300 primary schools.

The aim is for all primary care trusts to have schemes in place so that people get more help from pharmacists in using their medicines by 2004. Working closely with GPs and giving patients more information about the effective use of medicines is central to this progress.</p>

It is still too early to know whether any major mental health concerns will emerge among those who took part in Operation Telic.</p>

	<p pid=".963W.11/1">It is the intention of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill to better match the provision of primary dental services with local oral health needs through local commissioning of the service. This would enable local flexibility to be built into the system.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/2">It is also the intention of the Bill that providing oral health services to national health service patients becomes a more attractive option to general dental practitioners by making it possible to pay them differently. The current item-of-service remuneration system is widely recognised as the main reason for dentists' disaffection with NHS work as they are paid only for treatments rather than oral health care. Under this proposed approach, the whole dental team would be better able to advise patients on improving their oral health allowing further improvement of the quality and patient focus of their care. In addition, NHS dentists and other members of the dental team will increasingly become part of the NHS family, participating in local dental public health programmes and benefiting from primary care trust (PCT) support networks and in due course, to NHS occupational health services. By contracting with a PCT, dental practices will receive a more secure and predictable income in return for a longer term commitment to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/3">All stakeholders are being kept abreast of the proposed changes. The patients forum has met officials and is broadly supportive. A working group, led by the Department's Director for Patient Experience and Public Involvement and including patient representatives, will undertake a review of the charging regime. To improve patient experience of NHS dentistry, each PCT will be required to publish information about the primary dental services in its area.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/4">A series of events for dentists was held by the NHS Modernisation Agency earlier this year. The events were designed to explain the proposals in &quot;NHS dentistry&mdash;Options for Change&quot; and to encourage their involvement. Workshops for PCTs are being run by the national primary and care trust development programme and the Department of Health. In addition, learning events are being provided for local dental committee representatives by the British Dental Association, together with the NHS Modernisation Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/5">The legislation before Parliament proposes transitional arrangements under which a dentist already providing general dental services must be offered a new GDS contract, the terms of which would include remuneration.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/6">Subject to Parliament, funding will be allocated to PCTs, which will then hold a predictable financial resource to secure primary dental services. Funding for primary care dentistry, hitherto held centrally and administered by the Dental Practice Board, will then be part of PCT general allocation, which has in recent years seen a higher rate of growth than that in the general dental service. Over time, PCTs will be better able to target these resources and to increase their spend on dentistry in the light of local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/7">Funding is being made available for a support team for NHS dentistry to support local health economies during this period of substantial change to develop their capacity for local commissioning of primary care dentistry and to assist them in addressing immediate or potential access issues.</p>

	<p pid=".965W.2/2">General dental practitioners are independent contractors and, as such, are free to choose whether they wish to provide national health service or private dentistry or a combination of the two. However, very few practices are exclusively private, with only about 5 per cent. offering no NHS treatment. Under their NHS terms of service, dentists who stop offering NHS services are required to complete any outstanding treatment on the NHS or notify the appropriate primary care trust if this is not possible.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/3">A number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years to encourage dentists to continue to offer dental treatment on the NHS:</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/4" class="indent">The commitment payments scheme was introduced in 2000 to encourage dentists' commitment to the NHS. Dentists who have offered NHS treatment to patients for five years or more and who have a certain level of NHS commitment receive extra payments. Dentists in England earned an extra &pound;23 million under the scheme in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/5" class="indent">&pound;10 million was made available between 1997&ndash;99 under the Investing in Dentistry scheme to allow dentists to increase their NHS commitment or start new practices in areas of poor access.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/6" class="indent">A Dental Care Development Fund of &pound;4 million was made available in 2000&ndash;01 along with &pound;6 million Dental Action Plan money in 2001&ndash;02 to allow practices to grow and treat more patients.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/7" class="indent">A Modernisation Fund of &pound;35 million was made available in 2001&ndash;02 for practices to expand or improve their premises.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/8">Where dentists withdraw from providing NHS dentistry, PCTs can apply to the Secretary of State for agreement to fund salaried general dental practitioners under Section 56 of the 1977 NHS Act. Any such applications recently received have been given a positive response.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/9">In addition, a number of dental access centres (DAC) have been set up primarily in areas where access to NHS dentistry is difficult. Patients do not have to be registered to receive treatment in a DAC.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/10">A range of dental treatments is available under the NHS to unregistered patients through the occasional treatment arrangements. This ensures that those patients who require urgent treatment can receive it without registering with a dentist.</p>

	<p pid=".970W.8/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, the Department of Health assumed budgetary responsibility for prison health care in England, other than at contractually managed establishments. There has not, historically, been a separate budget for health care within overall prison service expenditure but the total Home Office baseline costs for 2002&ndash;03 were identified as &pound;117.7 million. This baseline was transferred to the Department of Health, which will, over the next three years, make further resources, rising to around an extra &pound;46 million a year by 2005&ndash;06, available to improve prison health services.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.8/2">Prisons which receive prisoners directly from court undertake a full health assessment on a prisoner's first reception into prison custody. There is, at the minimum, a primary health care service at every establishment. Most will also have some of a range of other services, such as in-patient facilities in a health care centre and dental, optical, mental health, substance misuse, genito-urinary and communicable disease services. Prisoners with physical or mental health problems which cannot be satisfactorily treated within the prison setting are admitted to hospital.</p>

Militia commanders have agreed to allow overland access but want food for troops, which is not acceptable to the UN. The UN is planning a joint assessment. Access and the operating environment are the main constraints rather than funding at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".973W.2/2">We continuously monitor the humanitarian situation in the DRC. We have increased our total funding to DRC in recent years. In 2001&ndash;2002 our total funding was &pound;5.56 million, of which &pound;5.18 million was humanitarian assistance. In 2002&ndash;03 our total funding was &pound;12.9 million, of which &pound;10.89 million was humanitarian assistance. In March 2003 we provided funding of &pound;1 million UN OCHA for humanitarian emergency interventions in DRC including in Ituri. The Head of UN OCHA has recently visited and assessed the situation in the area and will be funding those humanitarian agencies that are currently active and effective. The UN OCHA Deputy Head for New York will also be visiting Ituri at the end of this week. DFID will shortly be sending its Humanitarian Adviser to visit the region to assess the situation and look at how DFID can effectively assist further alongside other international donors.</p>

	<p pid=".976W.2/2">Similarly, in an increasing number of African countries, DFID is providing general health sector budget support to the overall national health plan. In many situations, we believe this to be a better approach than financing specific ring-fenced initiatives within the health sector. For this reason, it is no longer possible, or indeed appropriate, to specify the proportion of DFID funding in Africa allocated to primary health care and reproductive health services. We would, however, expect both primary health care and reproductive health services to be priority components of the national health plans to which we provide sector budget support. However, we do continue to support specific primary health care and reproductive health services investments in a number of African countries where budget support is not appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".976W.5/1">To date, 26 countries out of a total of 37 eligible countries have qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and will receive over US$62 billion in debt relief. Of these, eight countries (Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda) have reached Completion Point and have received an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt. The other 18 (Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia) have reached Decision Point and are receiving interim relief on their debt servicing payments. During this stage of the process, these countries are no longer required to make any further payments on the debt to be written off. We expect most of these 18 countries to reach Completion Point within the next two years when they, too, will receive full debt relief. It is difficult to predict when the remaining 11 countries will qualify for HIPC relief, as many are still affected by conflict and governance problems. We expect the Democratic Republic of Congo to reach its Decision Point in the coming months, and the Central African Republic, Comoros and Cote d'Ivoire to do so later this year but, in some cases, this will depend on progress towards peace. The other countries (Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Togo) are a long way from qualifying, as they are affected by conflict or have serious governance concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".983W.11/1">The timetable for revising Regional Spatial Strategies and Local Development Documents will vary considerably depending on the nature of the document. The timetable for the former will be agreed between the Regional Planning Body and the Government Office. Each local planning authority will be required to prepare a Local Development Scheme which will set out the timetable for the preparation of Local Development Documents. The Scheme must be submitted to the Secretary of State who may direct amendments to it as he thinks appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".984W.0/1">There has been no suspension of the Right to Buy in any area, but nine local authority areas in the South East Region were included in the Housing (Right to Buy) (Limits on Discount) (Amendment) Order 2003&mdash;Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 498&mdash;which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-27">27 March 2003</phrase>. These areas were:</p>
	<p pid=".984W.0/2">Chiltern&mdash;Epsom and Ewell&mdash;Hart</p>
	<p pid=".984W.0/3">Oxford&mdash;Reading&mdash;Reigate and Banstead</p>
	<p pid=".984W.0/4">Tonbridge and Mailing&mdash;Vale of White Horse&mdash;West Berkshire.</p>
	<p pid=".984W.0/5">The Order lowered the maximum Right to Buy discount available to tenants from &pound;38,000 to &pound;16,000 in 41 areas under the greatest housing market pressure as evidenced by high levels of homelessness and high local house prices. This was determined on the basis of two measures:</p>
	<p pid=".984W.0/6" class="indent">homelessness&mdash;reflecting high demand for social housing. Using information provided by local authorities themselves in their regular Housing Investment Programme returns, the number of homeless households in temporary accommodation was compared with the number of local authority lettings and nominations to Registered Social Landlord dwellings given to households who were not homeless. A high value for this ratio indicates high homelessness and/or a low number of available lettings.</p>
	<p pid=".984W.0/7" class="indent">house prices&mdash;reflecting the demand for private housing and affordability. The Land Registry lower quartile house price for the third quarter of 2002 was used, to indicate likely availability for first time buyers.</p>

	<p pid=".986W.7/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) received &pound;575,000 to pilot an electronic link from the CRB to police forces, enabling Enhanced Disclosure checks to be undertaken with the minimum of manual intervention, while remaining under a police force's control. The objective is to reduce the proportion of enhanced applications referred to local police forces from 100 per cent. to 5 per cent. to 10 per cent. The funding is allocated solely to this project.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.7/2">The Invest to Save Budget (ISB) was set up in 1998 by Her Majesty's Treasury, in collaboration with the Cabinet Office. Its aim is to provide funding for projects that bring together two or more public bodies to deliver services in an innovative fashion.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.7/3">ISB provides a means of investing in partnership projects with the potential for transforming public services. The projects need to be further developed before this potential can be unlocked. Funds are allocated competitively and public sector managers are challenged to come forward with proposals that will make a real difference.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.7/4">To date, the ISB has supported 136 partnership projects with a total of &pound;180 million, following the first two bidding rounds. A further 123 projects have been selected for funding following the third round. The projects are spread right across the public sector, involving central Government, local government, health authorities, police and others.</p>

	<p pid=".999W.16/1">All schools make use of temporary contracts for teachers. These are mainly used as occasional cover for teachers who are absent on sick leave. Temporary contracts also give schools greater flexibility to respond to local circumstances in meeting their staffing needs. The number of occasional teachers has fallen for the second year in succession, by 2,600 to 14,900. The wider picture shows substantial overall progress in terms of growing teacher numbers and falling vacancies.</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.8/1">A minimum of 22,000 full-time places will be provided (a full-time place being from 12 noon to 9 pm), with a minimum of 6,200 receiving dedicated support from Connexions Personal Adviser Key Workers. These key workers will support an agreed list of hard to help young people to remove barriers to participation, to build relationships, to help the young people access the most suitable provision and to support them back into education or training at the end of holiday periods. These young people will be identified both by referral agencies and by targeting areas of geographical disadvantage. We expect that the programme will provide places for a wider group of young people in each community than those requiring key worker support.</p>

	<p pid=".1007W.5/1">Our White Paper &quot;The future of higher education&quot; proposes a number of measures which address concerns about student debt, particularly for students from low income families. In particular, from 2004/05 around 30 per cent. of students will benefit in full from the new HE Grant of &pound;1,000 per year and a further number will receive a proportion of &pound;1,000. The grant will be additional to the loan but students can choose to reduce their loan take up, including costly commercial loans, and hence their future debt.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/2">From 2006/07 the abolition of the requirement to pay upfront fees and new university bursary schemes to support lower income students will also help reduce the need to borrow. The Government will continue to means test the first &pound;1,100 contribution to fees; at present only 40 per cent. of students pay the full contribution. In 2001/02, 43 per cent. of students received a full grant to cover tuition costs and 16 per cent. received a partial grant, institutions that wish to charge higher, variable fees will be required to enter into an access agreement with the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). The access agreement will cover proposals to extend the bursaries and other financial arrangements they will offer, such as subsidised accommodation, travel, books, study aids etc.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/3">Student loans will continue to be offered at highly subsidised rates. Unlike commercial debt or mortgage there is no interest charged other than inflation. From 2005 the threshold at which students start to pay back will be raised from &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000, helping new graduates and lower earners. This makes debt repayments lower and more affordable and repayments will continue to be income contingent. The new Student Income and Expenditure Survey for 2002/03, currently being undertaken, will give authoritative information about students' cost of living and anticipated debt.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/4">We have asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to bear down on non-completion. To that end, HEFCE are funding Action on Access to highlight and disseminate good practice in student retention. Further measures planned by HEFCE to improve retention and increase information to potential students include:</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/5" class="indent">1. Asking Action on Access to establish a target group of institutions and work specifically with them to improve their retention rates.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/6" class="indent">2. Bringing together of Aimhigher: Partnerships for Progression and Excellence Challenge under Aimhigher to create a more unified message for potential students.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/7" class="indent">3. Ensuring that additional relevant information is put on the Higher Education and Research Opportunities (HERO) website to assist potential students make informed decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/8" class="indent">4. Working with the Department and other partners to establish a new HE Students Portal (HESP) which will provide a dedicated information service to students, their parents and advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/9">HEFCE will take further steps in line with the proposals in the White Paper to ensure universities and colleges will be properly funded for the extra costs of attracting and retaining students from non-traditional backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.5/10">The HEFCE have allocated &pound;265 million to institutions in 2003&ndash;04 for widening access and improving retention. This figure recognises the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and thereby increases the likelihood that they will complete their courses successfully. We expect HEFCE to come forward with further proposals for 2004/05 on how they intend to implement White Paper proposals on funding HEIs who are not making progress on improving completion rates.</p>
