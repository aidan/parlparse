Monitoring customer satisfaction with transport services helps to underpin improvements to services. Research helps us to understand the transport needs and priorities of the public and is used to design, implement, and evaluate the impact of policy interventions. It also provides important insights into the links between attitudes and behaviour, and how best to bring about behavioural change. The Department's research also contributes to the development of awareness campaigns, such as Think! and Act on CO2, and monitors their impact. This ensures that the campaigns are effective, reach the target audience, and achieve value for money.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203W.9/1">The Defence Medical Services operate in accordance with the guidance issued by the Dept of Health and the Health Protection Agency (which issues annual advice on the prescription of anti-virals). For the treatment of seasonal influenza, Defence Medical Services obtain vaccines and anti-virals as required, through the UK Departments of Health (DH). Stocks will be held locally at unit medical centres and other medical facilities, and quantities will vary according to clinical requirement and day-to-day usage. Vaccinations and anti-virals are prescribed for individuals by medical staff according to clinical need, following national guidance issued by the DH.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.9/2">It would not be practical to &quot;stockpile&quot; vaccines against seasonal influenza, since antigenic drifts (minor changes) of influenza viruses lead to the emergence of new viral strains every year.

	<p pid="b.1209W.6/1">The Prospects programme was designed to reduce crime in local communities by assisting offenders with a history of drug taking to lead law abiding lives. It offered such offenders a 12-16 week residential place with comprehensive services and support followed by identification of suitable accommodation where support was provided for up to six months in the community. It was originally aimed at drug using offenders serving short prison sentences who became abstinent in custody and entered into voluntary support on release to the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1219W.3/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-20">20 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/4" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on what percentage of migrants from (a) Poland (b) Ukraine (c) Pakistan and (d) Sri Lanka found full-time employment in Leeds Metropolitan District in each year since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on migrant workers for local areas from the Annual Population survey (APS) and its predecessor the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS). The National Statistics method for estimating the employment rate of migrant workers employed in the UK is based on the employment rate of people at a given time who were born outside the UK and of working age. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the figures. Those in full time employment are defined following International Labour Organisation definitions of employment with the respondent answering that they worked full time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/6" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows estimates of the employment rate of persons who live in the Leeds Local Authority District in full time employment who were born in Poland, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Figures for Ukraine are not available. Estimates are obtained for the 12 month periods ending in February, for 2001 to 2004, from the annual LFS. The APS estimates from 2004 to 2006 are provided covering the 12 month periods ending in December. The most recently released estimate is also included, which covers the 12 month period ending in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/7" class="indent">The unweighted count (sample size) underpinning the estimates are also provided because at this geographic level they are inevitably small, especially for the earlier years. In addition some numbers in the table are not provided because the sample sizes are very small and risk being disclosive. The estimates are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty and special care should be taken on drawing conclusions on the basis of year-on-year comparisons.</p>

	<p pid="b.1221W.0/2">The abolition of the half test for women reaching state pension age after <phrase class="date" code="1979-04-05">5 April 1979</phrase> was part of a package to encourage married women to make independent pension arrangements and to revisit their election choice. The main thrust of the early publicity was a national press advertising campaign commissioned by DSS during February and March 1977. The programme was designed to give optimum, cost effective coverage of the main target group, working housewives. In addition, there was extensive editorial news and feature coverage in newspapers, magazines, and on radio and television. According to DSS records the published articles all stressed the importance of married women making decisions on their national insurance contributions position.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.0/3">Leaflets, available at local offices, were distributed by DSS. Specifically, Leaflet NP25 entitled &quot;PENSIONS&quot;: Britain's great step forward&quot; issued in August 1975 and Leaflet NP31 entitled &quot;New Pensions: a better deal for women&quot; issued in January 1977 drew attention to the abolition of the half test. Leaflet NI1 entitled &quot;National insurance guidance for married women&quot; issued in February 1978 dealt extensively with the implications of election choice and invited women who were proposing to change their choice and were unsure that they would be able to satisfy the contribution conditions for basic pension to consult their local social security office who would usually get their individual contribution record before giving advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.1221W.3/2">Work is the best route out of poverty. For example, children in working households are much less likely to be in poverty than those living in households where no one is working. The Government have made considerable progress in tackling worklessness through national back-to-work programmes such as New Deal and Pathways to Work, as well as local initiatives such as Step Closer 2 Work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.3/3">Since 1997 the number of unemployed people in the Liverpool Riverside constituency has fallen by 45 per cent., the number of lone parents claiming benefit has fallen by 28 per cent. and the number of people claiming incapacity benefits has fallen by 17 per cent. Specific information on the level of poverty are not available below regional level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.3/4">However we recognise that there is more to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.3/5">In August the Jobcentre Plus District for Liverpool Riverside will start a campaign targeting over 2,000 small to medium size employers, encouraging them to work with us in local employment partnerships. This will open up job opportunities for those of our customers who have found it difficult to take advantage of the employment opportunities that exist across the district. Across Liverpool the working neighbourhoods fund is investing over &pound;3 million in 2008-09 and the deprived area fund over &pound;2 million to improve employment opportunities. Jobcentre Plus have also been working with the local authority and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to improve the transition when people move between welfare and work.</p>

Nevertheless, during the consultation process the Government commissioned the Children's Rights Alliance for England (CRAE) to organise an event at which a cross-section of children discussed their own experiences of age discrimination. A report of the event is available on CRAE's website. In addition, a number of consultation responses raised the issue of age discrimination against those aged under 18.

	<p pid="b.1232W.2/1">The amounts allowed on page 148 of Departmental Report 2008 for primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) capital expenditure and that of national health service trusts and foundation trusts (FTs) are &pound;0.8 billion and &pound;2.7 billion respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/2">As explained in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-15">15 May 2008</phrase>, PCTs and NHS trusts are no longer subject to the formulaic capital allocations of recent years. Under the new capital regimes established for them, capital for investment by PCTs and NHS trusts is allocated in response to plans that they submit at the start of the year, as part of their annual planning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/3">The process for 2008-09 is not yet complete, as had been anticipated in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-15">15 May 2008</phrase>. It is however well advanced, with individual NHS trusts and PCTs plans having been checked for accuracy by SHAs and with the position across most SHA patches validated by the Department. The SHAs and Departmental officials are now broadly satisfied with the majority of the plans and should be able to approve them in the next few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/4">As capital plans have not yet been approved, none of the capital funding identified for expenditure by PCTs or NHS Trusts in 2008-09 has so far been formally allocated. For the NHS trusts and FTs, however, approaching &pound;1.8 billion of the cash that is spent on capital investment is provided through the cash-funding of depreciation in their revenue income. NHS trusts have had confirmation that they may invest this capital funding, which equates to about 65 per cent. of the &pound;2.7 billion that is stated on page 148 of the Departmental Report 2008 as being available to fund capital investment by NHS trusts and FTs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/5">FTs are not subject to capital allocations or required to submit financial plans to the Department in the same way as PCTs and NHS trusts. Under their capital regime, the majority of their investment is funded with cash retained from their operations and any property disposals, and through borrowing from the departmentally operated FT financing facility.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/6">Included in the &pound;0.8 billion identified in the Departmental Report 2008 for SHAs and PCTs was a total of &pound;0.497 billion for expenditure on PCTs7 own local investment plans in 2008-09, of which &pound;0.097 million was expected to be released through the PCTs' own property disposals. The remaining &pound;0.4 billion of capital resources that was to be provided by the Department had already been notified to PCTs in 'The Operating Framework. For the NHS in England 2008-09', which was published in December 2007. This document also advised that the Department would contribute &pound;0.48 billion towards PCTs' local investment plans in 2009-10 and &pound;0.565 billion in 2010-11. The &pound;0.48 billion and &pound;0.565 billion do not include any anticipated contribution from PCTs' property disposals. Copies of this document are available in the Library</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/7">The &pound;2.7 billion identified in the Departmental Report 2008 for NHS trusts and FTs capital expenditure included &pound;2.165 billion for expenditure on trusts' local capital investment plans, of which &pound;0.159 billion was expected to be released through the trusts' own property disposals. There is no fixed split of the &pound;2.165 billion into a budget for NHS trusts and FTs. This is because the expenditure of each of these sectors will depend on the number of trusts that achieve foundation status in the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/8">The allowances for the local capital investment priorities of PCTs and NHS trusts in 2008-09 may be adjusted as part of the process referred to above of validating and signing off the plans of local NHS Trusts and PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.2/9">Capital budgets to cover the local investment plans of NHS trusts and FTs in 2009-10 and 2010-11 and indicative capital allocations for NHS trusts and PCTs for those years have not yet been agreed or announced.</p>

For example, a proposal on the edge of a town centre that would support the centre and bring wider benefits can be refused because the identified need is being met by an existing or proposed out of centre development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240W.8/2">The Government are reviewing the current approach in &quot;Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for Town Centres&quot; (PPS6) to assessing the impact of proposals outside town centres and will replace the need and impact tests with a new test which has a strong focus on our town centre first policy, and which promotes competition and improves consumer choice. We intend to publish a consultation paper on proposed revisions to PPS6 later this summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.2/1">The UK Government, in close consultation with the Scottish Executive and the Irish Government and the industry, made a detailed assessment of the likely effects of the removal of the minimum import price for salmon as proposed by the European Commission. In our assessment removal was likely to lead to a recurrence of dumping by Norwegian exporters. This assessment was submitted to the European Commission as part of its Interim Review of the measures. The European Commission however concluded that dumping was unlikely to recur and was supported in this view by the other 25 of member states.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266W.6/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) main allocation to tackling unsafe abortions in Africa is &pound;7.5 million through the 'Safe Abortion Action Fund', administered by the International Planned Parenthood Foundation (IPPF) and Ipas. This investment aims to strengthen regional organisations and networks that advocate for safe abortion; support advocacy and production of policy relevant research; have an impact at country level and regional level on policy change and service delivery; and increase utilisation of quality safe abortion and post-abortion services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.6/2">DFID also provides significant resources via government budgets in Africa to strengthen countries health systems including sexual and reproductive health services (e.g. In 2006-07, &pound;257.6 million to general budget support and &pound;21.2 million direct to government health budgets).</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.6/3">DFID also supports African countries improve access to sexual and reproductive health services and supplies, and sex education. For example, DFID has committed &pound;100 million over five years to United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) to improve access to family planning and reproductive health supplies. In Ethiopia, DFID had distributed 1.3 million condoms by the end of August 2007. DFID is also funding a &pound;35 million programme with the Population Council called 'transitions to adulthood', which is helping nine developing countries&mdash;including South Africa, Uganda and Kenya&mdash;to develop better curricula for gender education, including sex education.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266W.9/1">Economic growth is essential for the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs). MDG 1, by definition, requires growth in the incomes of the poor.

	<p pid="b.1266W.9/2">Better infrastructure is a key constraint to faster growth in Africa. The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa is facilitating more effective infrastructure investment and there has been a 20 per cent. increase in investment since 2005.

As of December 2007 the facility had loan commitments totalling $384.5 million (&pound;192 million) in 15 projects. EAIF projects have led to private sector commitments of more than $4 billion (&pound;2 billion). The government of Rwanda has asked DFID to help it with 'Growth Analytics', to prioritise actions, to help get higher growth rates. This promising work has led other African countries to seek DFID's advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266W.12/1">Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa over the course of 2005-2007 averaged 6.3 per cent. per annum. The same figure for 1997-2002 was 4 per cent. This is encouraging, but growth is still below the 7 per cent. rate which is thought necessary to achieve the millennium development goals and there are concerns about the sustainability of growth in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.12/2">UK aid is supporting economic development in a number of ways. For example, the Department for International Development (DFID) played a key role in the establishment and successful launch of the Investment Climate Facility (ICF) in 2006 to help strengthen Africa's business environment. Since then, ICF-funded projects have started in Rwanda, the East African Community, Lesotho, Liberia and Tanzania.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267W.2/1">Reducing maternal mortality in Africa is a UK Government priority. The Department for International Development (DFID) will continue to support partner governments to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services and commodities through DFID-funded country programmes, through regional and global advocacy, and through funding global and regional research, in line with the African Union Maputo Plan of Action on Maternal health and the DFID strategy 'Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1267W.2/2">Better health systems and services are essential to reducing maternal mortality. DFID will spend &pound;6 billion by 2015 for these purposes, a significant proportion in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.1267W.2/3">DFID has committed &pound;100 million over five years to United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) to improve access to family planning and reproductive health supplies. Africa will be a major recipient. At a country level in Africa, DFID is currently funding a range of health programmes that will help reduce maternal mortality, including a &pound;100 million commitment in Malawi (over six years) &pound;140 million commitment in Nigeria (over six years), a &pound;24 million commitment in Zimbabwe (over four years), and &pound;50 million commitment in Sierra Leone (over 10 years). Substantial funding is also provided through general budget support in some countries, as in Tanzania, where 11 per cent. of DFID's &pound;105 million expenditure through this channel was used to finance the health sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) works closely with the Government of Mozambique to support the health of mothers and children under the age of five. DFID as the focal donor for the health sector in Mozambique co-ordinates the support of 26 agencies (including DFID) who provide funding to the health sector. These partners are the World Bank, World Health Organisation, USAID, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNAIDS, Global Fund for Aids TB and Malaria (GFATM), the Clinton Foundation, President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), Swiss Development Co-operation, Norway, Netherlands, Japan, Italy, Ireland, France, Finland, Flanders, the EC, Denmark, Canada, Spain and Catalunia.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269W.6/1">Recent poverty reduction in Nepal has been impressive. Despite the conflict it reduced from 42 per cent. in 1995-96 to 31 per cent. in 2003-04, the latest year for which data are available. A key driver of poverty reduction, according to the World Bank, was better rural infrastructure, in which DFID has invested &pound;42 million since 2000 to build 1,500 km of rural roads and 2,200 bridges. We will invest a further &pound;28 million in rural infrastructure over the next three years. DFID has supported poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth in other ways. In the last five years we have invested &pound;20 million in education and &pound;50 million in health, contributing to a 5 percentage point increase in school enrolments and a halving of child mortality over the last decade. DFID has invested &pound;12 million over the last five years in rural livelihoods programmes which have benefited 550,000 people and lifted 130 thousand people out of poverty. DFID's investment of &pound;19 million over 10 years in community forestry will help almost one fifth of the population of Nepal to make a better and more sustainable living from forest resources.</p>

The programme aims to strengthen the Government's ability to provide water and sanitation services and deliver real benefits for the poor&mdash;enabling an additional 1.5 million people to access safe water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.2/2">The principal partner for this nationwide programme is the Government of Sierra Leone. We are also working with UNICEF and NGOs; including PLAN, Oxfam, and Goal.</p>

	<p pid="b.1273W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is prioritising equality and women's empowerment in a variety of ways. Firstly DFID provides significant funding for education and health sectors, which can have a huge impact on human development outcomes for girls and women. In Pakistan, DFID is contributing up to &pound;90 million for a new National Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health Programme. In India, DFID is providing &pound;220 million to the National 'Education For All' programme which sets measurable disaggregated targets to reduce the gender gap in school enrolment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/2">Secondly, DFID also supports numerous programmes that increase women's access to financial services, economic opportunities and political space. In Bangladesh, DFID is providing &pound;75 million over seven years to the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) (a large NGO), for the second phase of a programme that aims to help 800,000 extremely poor women and their households achieve sustainable livelihoods. In Nepal, DFID's Rights, Democracy and Inclusion Fund (RDIF) supports a three year project focused on strengthening the capacity of women political leaders and cadres to implement democratic and inclusive governance. In Afghanistan, DFID has provided &pound;20 million to the Micro-Finance and Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan which aims to improve women's access to micro credit loans.</p>

	<p pid="b.1274W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has in place robust financial procedures for all programmes. DFID completes a rigorous Fiduciary Risk Assessment (FRA) before all general and sector budget support is agreed. These examine the Government systems through which our money will be spent, identifies weaknesses and sets up monitoring mechanisms for improvement over a period of time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1274W.8/1">DFID has supported the provision of free primary education in Zambia since 2000 through two reform programmes; The Basic Education Sub-Sector Investment Programme (1999-2002) and the Education Sector Strategic Plan (2003-07). The Basic Education Sub Sector Investment Programme together with Zambia's Free Primary Education policy increased enrolment by 10 per cent. and halved the number of children out of school. These programmes were financed by a multi-donor education fund to which DFID contributed &pound;22.1 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.8/2">Between 2000 and 2006 net enrolment rates in primary grades increased from 71 per cent. to 97 per cent. while primary school completion rates improved from 63 per cent. to 85 per cent. The number of children out of school in Zambia fell from around 600,000 in 1998 to 67,000 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.8/3">From 1998-2005, DFID also funded a &pound;10 million Primary Reading Programme which resulted in improvements of up to 500 per cent. in literacy performance in grades 1-3 in 2005 and overall improvements in the primary school completion exams at grade 7.</p>
