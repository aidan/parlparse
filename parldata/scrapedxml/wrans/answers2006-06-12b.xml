	<p pid="b.865W.6/3" class="indent">Supported private saving by helping people to make better informed choices about their retirement, introducing a range of pension forecasts to give individuals an understanding of the income they are likely to receive in retirement.</p>

Whether or not a claimant was represented by a company providing claims handling services, rather than by solicitors, can therefore only be ascertained by retrieving the relevant files and examining the correspondence in order to discover the identity of each claimant's representative. Such an exercise would be labour intensive and would be at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.876W.0/1">The Littlecombe site at Dursley is the subject of a development agreement between the South West of England Regional Development Agency (South West RDA) and St. Modwen (the developer). The agreement requires the developer to carry out a whole series of activities in order to obtain planning permission for the regeneration scheme and deliver that scheme on the ground, either directly or through third parties (mostly residential developers). Agreement has to be reached with South West RDA on key issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.0/2">Among other matters, St. Modwen are required to investigate and, where appropriate, incorporate various sustainability measures in their designs.

The scope for micro hydro-electric power generation (HEP) was considered by the developer in this context.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.0/3">These investigations showed that the HEP scheme would not be economical&mdash;it would only produce enough electricity for two houses. In addition, the Environment Agency had concerns over the impact of the scheme and was not supportive. The South West RDA agreed with St. Modwen that HEP would not be pursued.</p>

Wylfa's plans for decommissioning and clean-up are still in preparation and job requirements have not yet been finalised. But in preparation for the defuelling and decommissioning phase of care and maintenance the NDA have prepared indicative numbers (derived from Wylfa's current plans) which indicate that at the end of operations, job numbers (both staff and subcontractors) will be about 700 by 2010, reducing to 160 by 2024. In so far as is practicable, the NDA will seek to ensure that employees who wish to stay with a site through to its next phase are able to remain in employment and receive appropriate support, development and retraining. Subcontractors currently providing site support are expected to continue to do so during the defuelling and decommissioning phases.

It therefore does not offer any specific incentives to share vehicles when travelling to and from work but instead actively encourages the use of public transport. Such incentives include interest-free loans for the purchase of season tickets and a scheme to encourage the use of bicycles to travel to work.</p>

	<p pid="b.886W.6/2">Defra issues licences to allow the interference with badger setts to prevent serious damage to property, and to permit agricultural, forestry or drainage operations. The majority of licences involve interference to exclude badgers from part or all of a sett, sometimes followed by sett destruction. Very few licences for translocation of badgers are granted. Some licensed activities include maintenance works undertaken by transport infrastructure companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.6/3">Badgers typically have more than one sett which they use in their territory. Thus there is no reason to believe that the closure, or partial closure, of a sett would necessarily cause badgers to move outside their normal range. My Department has commissioned a study which involves looking at badger movements when licensed sett interference is carried out in urban situations. However it is too early to draw any conclusions from this work which is currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.6/4">Defra's wildlife management advisers ensure that a proportion of licences is assessed through monitoring. The method, timing and amount of monitoring will vary depending upon a number of factors such as the species, site or activities being licensed. Defra aims to monitor around 30 per cent. of badger licences. A proportion of these will be targeted towards sensitive or complex cases such as those involving translocation or cases that have attracted a high level of public attention. The results of monitoring are recorded and if a breach of licence conditions has been identified Defra will consider an appropriate course of enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.6/5">English Nature issues licences to permit the disturbance of badgers and destruction of setts during the course of development activities, which would include some activities associated with the maintenance of transport infrastructure. English Nature does not license the translocation of animals in these cases&mdash;it licenses disturbance to setts, and where setts are to be lost as a result of the activity the licence allows animals to be excluded from the sett before it is destroyed. Where no suitable alternative setts are available nearby for the badgers to move to, an artificial sett must be constructed within the animals' existing territory, before they are excluded from their existing sett. No significant movement of badgers is likely to result from these activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.6/6">In the very few cases where Defra has licensed the translocation of badgers to another part of the country, it has been a condition of the licence that all badgers caught must be tested for bTB.</p>

Milk prices are subject to change on a regular basis, and farmers understand that they fluctuate throughout the year as a result of supply and demand. However, the underlying price of milk is expected to fall as a result of CAP reform. Through the Dairy Premium, farmers were partially compensated for these price reductions.</p>
	<p pid="b.887W.5/2">The Government do recognise that the dairy industry is facing a number of challenges, not least because of farm-gate prices.

	<p pid="b.889W.0/2">The question is a difficult one to respond to meaningfully. The referenced domestic legislation and the ELD are not directly or entirely comparable. The ELD, unlike the Pollution Prevention and Control or Waste legislation, is not a regulatory regime&mdash;there are no initial compliance costs; it imposes costs only when a business causes significant environmental damage. The legislation dealing with EU and domestic biodiversity provides a much more limited framework for liability for remediation than the ELD. The contaminated land (part IIA, Environmental Protection Act 1990) regime has some overlapping features with the ELD and can deal with current damage, but it is largely concerned with historic damage, which is outside the scope of the ELD.</p>

	<p pid="b.901W.1/2">While the intention has been, and remains, for the Rural Payments Agency to make outstanding payments under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme as soon as possible, it has always been the case that some payments may be made after the end of the EU payment window on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>. In those cases, the claimant will still be paid in full, but EU funding of those payments could be reduced. With that in mind and to safeguard the interests of UK taxpayers, a request was made to the European Commission in April to extend the payment window. Subsequent discussions with the European Commission suggest that a formal extension is unlikely, but those discussions will continue, focused on the EU rules governing the funding of payments made after the end of the payment window.</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.3/2">Under EU legislation governing the single payment scheme (SPS), member states may set a minimum area for the establishment of SPS entitlements, which cannot be higher than 0.3ha. Following discussions between the Department and the devolved administrations, the UK made maximum use of this flexibility in adopting a minimum area of 0.3ha. The establishment of entitlements is, with very limited exemptions, a one-off exercise undertaken in the year the SPS is introduced. In the UK, this was 2005. Even if it were possible, therefore, for the UK to now set a higher minimum area, it would have little, if any, practical effect going forward.</p>

VHS is a notifiable disease and the Department has a contingency plan in place for dealing with outbreaks of VHS and other serious fish diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/3">In line with these arrangements, Fish Health Inspectors from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), under Defra's direction, immediately formed a National Control Centre (NCC) to co-ordinate action to manage the outbreak with other partners, including the Environment Agency. The NCC is based at the CEFAS laboratory in Weymouth.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/4">Fish from the affected farm were slaughtered humanely with full co-operation from the farm owners. The fish have been disposed of in accordance with animal by-products legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/5">Defra has placed restrictions on the movement of fish into and out of the Ouse catchment area, and specifically on all farms in that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/6">The cause of the VHS outbreak has not been identified, but extensive epidemiological investigations are underway to try and determine the source. A comprehensive sampling programme is also taking place, targeting fish farms and wild sites in the Ouse catchment as well as other possible contacts. Results are expected within the next 14 days. No further disease cases have been identified by recent sampling and inspections.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/7">Stakeholders make regular representations to the Department about compensating fish farmers for the compulsory slaughter of stock due to an outbreak of a serious fish disease. We have made it clear that it is not our policy to make compensation available in these circumstances. However, EU legislation does allow fish from an infected site to be on-grown for marketing, provided they do not display any clinical signs of disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/8">VHS has no implications for human health. The VHS virus cannot grow or replicate at human body temperatures.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.2/2">For the purposes of the Waste Incineration Directive (WID), &quot;waste&quot; means any solid or liquid waste as defined in Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD). Whether or not a substance is &quot;waste&quot; within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the WFD is a matter that must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/3">In addition the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (ABPR) ((EC) No. 1774/2002) requires a range of animal by-products, and substances derived from them (for example, tallow), to be disposed of as waste. Where the method of disposal is incineration or co-incineration (that is, use as a fuel), the ABPR requires it to be carried out in compliance with the WID. The ABPR is directly applicable in all EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/4">We understand that other member states are at various stages in discussing the implications of the regulations on burning tallow in their own countries. However, in response to representations by the UK Government, the European Commission has set up a study to help establish whether such controls are proportionate and necessary to the protection of the environment. The study is expected to report by the autumn, and the Government are pressing the Commission for the study to be completed as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.5/1">A number of improvements to existing legislation dealing with litter were made under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, including the introduction of greater powers for local authorities in issuing fixed penalty notices and litter clearing notices. This was complemented by new guidance on the legislation and revision of the statutory &quot;Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.5/2">Improving the toolkit of powers and guidance available to local authorities will help them tackle local environmental quality issues more effectively. In addition, ENCAMS (Environmental Campaigns), which is grant-funded by DEFRA, runs the &quot;Keep Britain Tidy&quot; campaign and carries out a number of public awareness campaigns aimed at changing behaviour. Recent campaigns have focused on youth littering and smoking-related litter.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.5/3">In addition to increasing the range and flexibility of enforcement options for local authorities, work is being taken forward on improving the provision of skills in relation to street cleansing and related services. A Local Environmental Management training and skills framework is being developed which will ensure that specific, tailored training and qualifications are available to the industry from operational level to senior management and play a key role in enabling local authorities to increase the effectiveness of their litter clearance, as well as other services they provide.</p>

	<p pid="b.924W.8/4" class="indent">Available figures relate to deaths where the underlying cause was drug poisoning, not the total number where use of crack cocaine was a contributory factor. ONS routinely carries out special monitoring of deaths from drug-related poisoning and publishes a combined figure for deaths mentioning cocaine on the death certificate. It is not possible to provide separate figures on deaths related to crack cocaine and cocaine from routine mortality data, as it is not possible to separately identify crack cocaine from other forms of cocaine at post mortem and other evidence to distinguish the form of cocaine taken is rarely provided at death certification.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.8/5" class="indent">The most recent year for which figures are available is 2004. The following table shows the number of deaths where the underlying cause of death was drug-related poisoning and cocaine was mentioned on the death certificate in England and Wales for the calendar years 2000 to 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.928W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the latest estimate is of the percentage of disposable income spent on housing by each income decile, for each year from 1995 to 2005. (75913)</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of expenditure on housing are based on the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS), an annual sample survey of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 households in the UK. Family Spending, the annual report on the EPS, recently introduced a more comprehensive treatment of housing expenditure, and for this reason comparable figures are only available from 2002/03 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/5" class="indent">The table below shows the percentage of disposable household income spent on housing for each gross income decile group since 2002/03. All housing expenditure is included: rent; mortgage payments; costs associated with second dwellings; charges such as council tax and water charges; costs associated with moving house; maintenance and repair; alterations and improvements; and household insurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/6" class="indent">Housing expenditure as a proportion of disposable income is highest for households in the bottom decile. The bottom decile in particular does contain some households whose total expenditure including that on housing, greatly exceeds their income. Some of these households have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). These households may finance their expenditure by drawing on their savings, borrowing, or other kinds of receipts which are not treated as regular income in the EPS e.g. inheritance and severance payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/7" class="indent">A more detailed breakdown of housing expenditure by income decile is available in Table 2.3 on page 14 of Family Spending 2004/05, albeit expressed as average weekly household expenditures, rather than as proportions of disposable income. Family Spending is available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361</a>&amp; Pos=l4&amp;ColRank=l&amp;Rank=272.</p>

The percentage of hotel rooms in the capital which are currently subject to inspection under the grading schemes operated by VisitBritain and the Automobile Association is not available to my Department.

	<p pid="b.942W.9/19">Until the launch of Taking Part: The National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport in 2005, several of our non-departmental public bodies commissioned their own surveys. Taking Part is a collaborative, cross-sectoral survey which can replace the need for our partner bodies to undertake their own surveys. Therefore it is improving our understanding of cross-sectoral issues, it is a more authoritative source as the sample size can be increased compared to previous, sector-specific surveys and costs overall can be reduced.</p>

Changes to the benefits offered to the Friends of the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) were made by the Friends organisation itself in response to the findings of an internal tax review and on the advice of an independent tax expert. Under Gift Aid rules, which apply to all charities, the Friends of the V&amp;A is not permitted to give benefits worth more than 25 per cent. of their subscription cost to each member. The Friends scheme has made some changes to the benefits that it offers to its members to ensure it remains within this threshold.</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.6/1">Strengthening health services in Africa is a DFID priority and we have contributed over &pound;650 million to this since 2000. At Gleneagles in 2005, the UK pushed for a G8 commitment to strengthening African health systems and addressing the human resources for health crisis. Providing long-term predictable financing for expanding basic health services will be a priority for 2006 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.6/2">DFID is tackling both &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; incentives for health worker migration. In the UK, DFID has worked closely with the Department of Health to prevent the targeting of developing countries in the international recruitment of health care professionals. A list of countries has been agreed from which the NHS does not actively recruit&mdash;including all sub-Saharan African countries. In addition, the Department of Health has brokered a groundbreaking agreement for this code to apply to major players in the UK independent health care sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.6/3">But health worker shortages go beyond migration and international recruitment. There is also migration within countries from rural to urban areas and between countries in Africa, and health professionals also move into non-health careers.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.6/4">In Africa, DFID has responded to health worker shortages through our support for health systems development. This will help countries deal with the &quot;push&quot; factors within their health systems such as poor pay, housing, training and career progression, job satisfaction and availability of equipment and drugs. For example, in Malawi, where the shortage of health workers is particularly severe, we have provided &pound;100 million support to the health sector of which &pound;55 million is earmarked for the Emergency Human Resources Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.6/5">DFID is also continuing to work with the Department of Health to further develop the NHS Links programme and the Tropical Health Education Trust (THET) programme of support to health workers from less developed countries practising in the UK.</p>

Having spent &pound;5.6 million in 2001-02, we have &pound;62 million available this financial year. Our current transition programme follows the following themes:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/22" class="italic"> 1. Security and the Rule of Law</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/23" class="indent">Support for the disarmament, demobilisation and re-integration of ex-combatants through the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Re-integration Programme (MDRP), support to army integration, reform of the police and justice sector, and local level peacebuilding and dialogue initiatives through non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/24" class="italic"> 2. Functioning State</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/25" class="indent">This includes support for the transition institutions (such as the Parliament, Electoral Commission and High Media Authority), the establishment of a professional and impartial media sector, and preparation for elections. The UK is the largest bilateral donor to the electoral process in the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/26" class="italic"> 3. Reconstruction</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/27" class="indent">Support for infrastructure within the Government's reconstruction plan, especially transport links; the development of a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP); support to the social sectors (health, education and water) largely through NGOs; and the fight against HIV/AIDS through the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/28" class="italic"> 4. Natural Resources and Enhanced Revenue Generation</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/29" class="indent">We have funded research by Global Witness into the current state of natural resources management in the DRC. We are supporting the implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in the DRC and developing our plans for further support for effective and transparent natural resource extraction and the re-establishment of border control systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/30" class="italic"> 5. Humanitarian</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.3/31" class="indent">Around half of our programme is spent on humanitarian interventions either through UN agencies or NGOs, to address the complex and chronic humanitarian emergency that has faced the people of the DRC since the war. Our funding is principally channelled to the UN's Action Plan for the DRC through its pooled donor funding mechanism.</p>

	<p pid="b.955W.2/1">The UK is playing a substantial leadership role in AIDS, and a key part of this is promoting access to HIV prevention strategies as well as to AIDS treatment and care. For example, the UK used its European Union (EU) presidency to work with the European Commission and with member states to agree a common EU position on HIV prevention&mdash;the EU statement on HIV prevention for an AIDS-free generation. The EU statement advises on the importance of comprehensive, rights and evidence- based approaches to HIV prevention.

	<p pid="b.955W.5/1">DFID's policy on 'Partnerships for Poverty Reduction: Rethinking Conditionally' (launched in March 2005) is that we will not make aid conditional on specific policy decisions. However, we believe that an effective aid partnership should be based on a shared commitment to three objectives: reducing poverty and achieving the millennium development goals; respecting human rights and other international obligations; and strengthening financial management and accountability, to reduce the risk of funds being misused through weak administration or corruption. We will consider reducing or interrupting aid if partner Governments deviate significantly from any of these objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.955W.5/2">In supporting HIV and AIDS programmes in Africa, DFID uses a range of different funding channels to help ensure that resources are directed towards appropriate agencies and treatments. In countries with sound poverty reduction plans and public financial management, we can put poverty reduction budget support directly into a Government's treasury. We can also earmark funding for specific Government sector budgets. And we also fund projects, especially when it is not possible to work through Government budgets. In all cases, DFID officials work closely with Governments and civil society to help ensure that policy and programme choices are appropriate. We also monitor the progress and impact of programmes that we fund and take lessons into account when making future decisions.</p>

To this end we are working with Governments, international organisations, pharmaceutical companies, academia and private foundations. There have been some important successes over the last few years such as the doubling of UK funding to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria to &pound;100 million in 2006-07 and &pound;100 million in 2007-08, resulting in long-term policy and financial signals to ensure a sustainable supply of key drugs. In addition, the UK has increased its direct funding for research to develop vaccines and medicines for diseases disproportionately affecting the poor, in particular through the financing of Product Development Partnerships (PDPs).</p>

	<p pid="b.956W.5/1">The UK's strategy for tackling the HIV and AIDS epidemic in the developing world is set out in the Government's strategy 'Taking Action'. We have also worked closely with the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), with other Governments and multilateral agencies and through the Global Steering Committee on Scaling Up Towards Universal Access (which DFID co-chaired with UNAIDS) to set out the priorities for action in order to achieve the Gleneagles commitment to achieve universal access to prevention, treatment and care by 2010. These priorities were reflected in the Political Declaration agreed at the United Nations General Assembly on AIDS (<phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June 2006</phrase>), which provides a political blueprint for achieving universal access.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.5/2">The UK played an active role in negotiations. It set out commitments for countries to develop, by the end of 2006, ambitious national plans to scale up towards universal access by 2010 to comprehensive HIV prevention programmes, treatment, care and support, with interim targets for 2008; to provide $20-23 billion annually by 2010 for AIDS responses; to put in place comprehensive prevention strategies; to promote the rights and reduce the vulnerability of sex workers, men who have sex with men, children, women, adolescent girls and drug users; to intensify efforts to develop new technology especially microbicides and vaccines; to ensure that no credible, sustainable national plan goes unfunded; to reaffirm the importance of countries employing the flexibilities within Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) to protect public health; and to strengthen countries' capacities to do so.</p>

The UN Secretary-General presented to this meeting an assessment of progress which underlines the challenge that we face in meeting the Gleneagles commitment to provide universal access to prevention, treatment and care by 2010. The Secretary- General's report shows that only 9 per cent. of HIV-infected pregnant women are currently on anti-retrovirals, and that only 20 per cent. of people with advanced HIV are on anti-retrovirals. While this shows the scale of outstanding need, it is noteworthy that since 2001 the number of Africans on treatment has risen eight-fold.

	<p pid="b.958W.2/1">In China, DFID is providing &pound;3.075 million in support of an International Labour Organisation (ILO) project which helps to reduce the vulnerability of girls and young women to trafficking. The project covers activities in Anhui, Henan and Hunan provinces, from which girls and young women are trafficked, and in Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces which receive them. The project is being implemented over four years. It started in May 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/2">DFID is not supporting such campaigns or projects in Albania. Until 2000, DFID contributed to the funding of a centre in Vlora for trafficked women and girls returned to Albania. The centre aims to educate young women about the risk of becoming victims of trafficking. In 2003, DFID contributed to the purchase of equipment for a centre in Tirana, managed by the Institute of Migration (IoM), that seeks to give employment to returned female victims of trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/3">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is providing 238,000 through the IoM, to foster safe migration and prevent human trafficking. The project aims to build the capacity of the state infrastructure in Albania to provide information to potential migrants, vulnerable groups at risk of human trafficking, the media, government officials, non-government organisations (NGOs) and the general public. The project includes a national telephone hotline to provide information on legal migration, and enable members of the public to report people-trafficking to the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/4">In 2005, the FCO provided &pound;500,000 for work by the IoM with returned Albanian migrants, many of whom have been trafficked. By assisting their re-integration, the project aims to reduce the risk of repeat trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/5">In Moldova, the IoM manages an extensive, nationwide programme on trafficking which has included a feature film, TV, radio and public service announcements, established Migration Information Centres, organised seminars for local authorities, and produced hotline promotional stickers and other information material distributed at Moldovan border crossings. In partnership with the Moldovan Migration Department, IoM launched in 2004 a website and mobile information centre that distributed information on legal migration and the dangers of trafficking. Other information and education activities on trafficking in Moldova are provided by the NGO La Strada, including seminars, educational materials, a resource centre and a hot line. La Strada has received support from the FCO.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/6">DFID's bilateral programmes, and support to multilateral agencies, aim to reduce poverty and some of the root causes leading to human trafficking. This includes creating economic opportunities, promoting pro-poor sustainable growth, conflict resolution and improving governance and the institutional environment for poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="b.959W.2/1">The UK Government are concerned to support the basic needs of the Palestinian people. Until the Hamas-led Government renounce violence, recognise Israel's right to exist and accept previous agreements and obligations we cannot provide aid to the Palestinian Cabinet or its ministries. However, there are other ways to help Palestinians directly and we are doing all that we can to assist.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/2">Since the Hamas Government came to power, the largest component of our assistance has been a &pound;15 million contribution through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). UNRWA provides health, education, housing, food and jobs to approximately 40 per cent. of Palestinians who are registered refugees. This aid is getting through to people who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/3">In addition, DFID is working closely with the European Commission and others to develop a temporary international mechanism to provide direct assistance to the Palestinian people. This will include those who are not registered as refugees and therefore do not receive help through UNRWA. Our hope is that such a mechanism will be established as soon as possible.</p>

The UK has provided &pound;49 million to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) this year, of which the WFP has been the largest recipient.

	<p pid="b.960W.0/2">Only 49.5 per cent. of the WFP's 2006 budget has been funded to date. As a result, the WFP was forced earlier in the year to halve food rations to Darfur temporarily, though ration levels elsewhere have been maintained. Recent additional support from two key food aid donors (the EU and the US), and a contribution of 20,000 tonnes of Sorghum from the Government of Sudan, have since enabled the WFP to increase the ration level in Darfur to 84 per cent. Reinstatement of full ration may be possible by October, though this is still not certain.</p>

The impact of road schemes in the Highways Agency targeted programme of improvements, consistent with the Future of Transport White Paper, is estimated to be around an additional 0.1 million tonnes of carbon (MtC), a tenth of the carbon savings expected in 2010 from the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. The overall implications for carbon dioxide emissions of local transport plans have not been modelled, but LTPs are subject to individual Strategic Environmental Assessments which carefully consider these impacts.</p>

	<p pid="b.967W.6/4">The third was conducted by BMG and concerned the development of new sections of questions for the 2006-07 BVPI surveys (we anticipate the publication of this work in the autumn of 2006). The new questions formed part of the recent consultation of local authorities on the BVPI surveys.</p>
	<p pid="b.967W.6/5">In addition to this work, following the 2003-04 surveys, 'in-house' analysis concerning the impact of methodology on response rate, using data supplied by local authorities, has been conducted. These analyses also considered factors such as deprivation and ethnicity. This work found no evidence of a significant difference in response rate between postal and face-to-face methods even after allowing for context and respondent group.</p>

SOAs are a better measure as they are consistent in size and overtime, and they allow better identification of small pockets of deprivation. There are 32,482 SOAs in England, each with an average population of 1,500 people.</p>

Peterborough City has 42 per cent. of its 104 SOAs among the 30 per cent. most deprived SOAs in England. The following table lists these SOAS and identifies the wards in which they are located. There are three wards (Central, East and North) in which all the SOAs fall within the 30 per cent. most deprived in the country.</p>

This debate continues and feedback from all stakeholders is welcomed. The debate will be drawn together in the form of a White Paper later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.978W.2/1">The Driver Vehicle Testing Agency's equipment was purchased in 2001 as part of a PFI contract for all MOT testing equipment. Prior to finalising this contract, extensive research and trials were conducted to ensure the equipment could meet the needs of the agency and conduct a quality test fully compliant with legislation. This equipment is the same as that currently used in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/2">Following procurement, further trials of the diesel test equipment took place in Cookstown DVTA test centre, and from this time Larne DVTA centre has offered the diesel emission test to customers on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/3">DVTA is heavily committed to research and development, and liaises with many testing organisations worldwide to ensure best practice testing is being maintained in Northern Ireland. These experiences and advice received from other organisations that have been conducting this test for many years served to inform DVTA's research on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.981W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about the number of people employed by Water Service, how many will be employed by the proposed Gov-Co, what measures are planned to facilitate staff transfers within the Civil Service for Water Service employees, and what relocation packages are planned for Water Service employees wishing to relocate to Belfast to work for the proposed Gov-Co. (75587). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.5/4" class="indent">At <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April 2006</phrase>, 920 non-Industrial and 876 industrial whole time equivalent staff were employed by Water Service. Detailed planning for the achievement of efficiencies in 2007 and beyond is proceeding but the level of efficiency required of Northern Ireland Water Ltd has not yet been finalised. It is not therefore possible, at this stage, to give definitive numbers but a further reduction in numbers is planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.5/5" class="indent">As part of a wider staff migration programme, Water Service is currently working closely with the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) to facilitate the transfer back to the NICS of the optimum number of staff as the business will allow. Since March 2005, Water Service has facilitated a total of 93 transfer requests which have resulted in staff moving back to the wider NICS and there is a commitment to continue the progress made to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.5/6" class="indent">At this point in time it is not envisaged that a significant number of staff will be required to relocate to Belfast in advance of the creation of GOCO. However, staff who are required to relocate to Belfast, or to any other location across Northern Ireland, will be entitled to the full range of relocation packages, including excess fares allowance or removal expenses, inline with the provisions of the NICS Staff Handbook.</p>

	<p pid="b.985W.5/1">Through the personal, social and health education (PSHE) framework, pupils are taught to identify and respect the differences between people, including disability. Pupils are taught about the effects of all types of stereotyping and discrimination, how to challenge them assertively and ways of working co-operatively with a range of people who are different from themselves. Through citizenship education pupils are taught about legal and human rights and responsibilities. They will learn how the law and concept of human rights underpin society and affect the relationship between the state and the individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.985W.5/2">We have also committed significant funding up to 2008 to support all schools in providing access to a range of extended services and activities. We have set out a core offer of extended services that we want all children to be able to access through schools by 2010. We have provided guidance to schools, local authorities and other providers which makes clear that children with disabilities and special educational needs must be able to access all the services</p>

The Learning and Skills Development Agency, on behalf of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), produced an early report in January 2005 entitled, 'An early assessment of the impact of the Level 2 offer.' In March 2006 the Adult Learning Inspectorate completed a short report entitled, 'Evaluation of the Level 2 entitlement.' Both documents have been used to help shape the national LSC's communication strategy with the regions prior to the national availability of the entitlement from September 2006.</p>

The Government do not believe that a legal presumption of equal contact would be in the best interests of most children. The most appropriate arrangements for contact between children and their separated parents will depend on a variety of issues particular to their individual circumstances. Where equal contact arrangements appear to be in the best interests of a child, whether agreed between the parents or determined by a court, they are already able to be, and should continue to be, put in place.</p>

It provides advice online, in response to individual requests and via its helpline to those schools and local authorities which choose to participate in the scheme. This advice covers how to apply for the payment of subsidy on milk.</p>

	<p pid="b.992W.3/2">The Child Protection database, maintained by the Commission for Social Care Inspection, indicates that 78 cases from 2003-04 were the subject of a Serious Case Review (SCR), while 82 cases from 2004-05 were the subject of a SCR. The data for 2005-2006 are not yet complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.3/3">Guidance on these issues is contained in 'Working Together to Safeguard Children', which includes guidance on the role and functions of local safeguarding children boards (LSCBs). One of the core functions of LSCBs is to undertake SCRs. Chapter 8 of 'Working Together' sets out how and when SCRs should be undertaken. This includes specifying how the relevant services should undertake separate management reviews, and how the LSCB should commission an overview report which brings together and analyses the findings. 'Working Together' states that the LSCB should consider carefully who might have an interest in reviews, for example, elected and appointed members of authorities, and what information should be made available to each of these interests, considering a number of factors including the need to maintain confidentiality in respect of personal information, and the accountability of public services. In all cases there is a public executive summary.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.3/4">'Working Together' also states that LSCBs should have clear work programmes, including measurable objectives, and budgets. This will enable LSCBs' work to be scrutinised by local authorities, other local partners and key stakeholders as well as by the inspectorates. Elected members' role, through their membership of governance bodies such as the cabinet of the local authority or a scrutiny committee or a governance board, is to hold their organisation and its officers to account for their contribution to the effective functioning of the LSCB. The lead member for children's services within the local authority will have a particular focus on how the local authority is fulfilling its responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and will hold the director of children services to account for the work of the LSCB.</p>

	<p pid="b.994W.3/1">In March 2004 my officials discussed with the Association of British Insurers insurance issues related to school-age work experience. The ABI confirmed the continuation of the long-standing convention by which school students on placement are considered to be covered by the employers' liability policy, as if they were employees. Generally, insurers make no charge for this insurance, provided they are notified of the placement in advance or have a longer-term agreement that the employer will regularly offer work experience. There should not therefore be premiums to pay which might act as a barrier to the employer's involvement. This is also the case when employers take on apprentices. Further discussions on these questions would be welcome.</p>

	<p pid="b.995W.2/1">Apprenticeships are the main programme for young employed people seeking vocational qualifications at Level 2 and Level 3. Other opportunities are also being developed, including a pilot programme that started in April this year aimed at encouraging 16 to 18-year-olds in jobs without training to gain a Level 2 qualification, whether academic or vocational. For those over 19 and without either basic skills or a first Level 2 qualification we have put in place the Train to Gain service to deliver high- quality flexible qualifications in the workplace.</p>

	<p pid="b.995W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May</phrase>, the Musa Qaleh District Centre in Northern Helmand was attacked by an estimated 150 insurgents. Afghan National Police (ANP) successfully responded to the incident and the insurgents fled further North towards the town of Tisney. The ANP pursued the insurgents, suffering 13 fatalities and approximately ten wounded; UK forces provided medical support to the injured ANP. It is thought that up to 50 insurgents were killed by the Afghan forces, 10 were wounded and some equipment (including a 4x4 vehicle) was seized.</p>
	<p pid="b.995W.6/2">UK forces, along with the ANP and Afghan National Army, have since established a presence in Musa Qualeh to prevent insurgents from returning there, and to help establish the rule of law and aid reconstruction efforts. This has been well received by the local population.</p>

However, the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB), when making recommendations about armed forces pay, takes into account the comparative value of the AFPS. At the moment the AFPRB assess the AFPS to be 7 per cent. more valuable than comparator schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.996W.5/1">There have been a number of contracts let with commercial companies to develop a synthetic replacement for bearskins. There has been a trial of caps made from material provided by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Problems were identified with these caps which included unsatisfactory performance in typical wet weather conditions. Nonetheless we are continuing to work with PETA to find an alternative, and all parties concerned with the trials are taking the search for an alternative to bearskins very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.996W.5/2">If an alternative is sourced and found to be fit for purpose, replacement of bearskins will be considered. This has already happened in a number of cases as, for example, with the &quot;busby cap&quot; used by the Royal Horse Artillery.</p>

	<p pid="b.1000W.3/1">The UK is fully committed to progress in multilateral disarmament forums, in particular in the Conference on Disarmament (CD). As we have said on many occasions, our priority is the start of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT), without pre-conditions, which we view as the next logical step towards achieving the goals of nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. In this regard, the UK fully supports the US initiative in tabling a draft FMCT text on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-18">18 May</phrase>. We hope that all CD member states are able to accept the very broad mandate proposed and agree to open negotiations towards a treaty without delay.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001W.3/1">The UK fully supports the introduction of a reliable supply of fuel cycle services and is co-operating with the US and other partners to develop workable ideas. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has the competence to administer such a mechanism and the US will soon submit a joint proposal to them, supported by the UK, to take this work forward. We believe that, in case of market disruption, the Agency could broker a new fuel supply agreement between a state and an alternate supplier. Suppliers, and their Governments, could give an undertaking to provide a back-up if relevant non-proliferation criteria were met. As a last resort, the Agency could make supplies available from a multilateral reserve of uranium, contributed by states with spare material.

	<p pid="b.1005W.0/2">The European Commission's 2005 Report states that Turkey sufficiently fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria but calls for continued reform, including on freedom of expression, freedom of religion and torture. The Government fully endorse this assessment. Human rights organisations report decreasing levels of torture and ill treatment by security forces so far this year, although there was a temporary rise in allegations during violent demonstrations in March/April 2006. We look forward to the Commission's 2006 Report, expected in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1008W.3/2">This information is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/3">In September 2003, the Department recognised that the need to switch to the superior nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs) for chlamydia testing and screening should be treated as a priority. At the same time, the chief medical officer wrote to all chief executives of strategic health authorities (SHAs) confirming this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/4">&pound;7 million pump-priming money was invested in 2004-05 to ensure that all major laboratories in each region of England use the most effective technology. We have invested &pound;80 million in the national chlamydia screening programme. One of the conditions is that all tests are undertaken using NAATs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/5">This is a clinical governance issue and we have stressed to the national health service how important it is to use this method of testing.</p>

	<p pid="b.1008W.9/1">The Department has commissioned a research project to consider the costs and benefits of current services for bowel cancer, including laparoscopic surgery, and to identify areas where improvements might be achievable. This research is being conducted by York health economics consortium and the School of Health and Related Research at Sheffield University and is due to report in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.9/2">In addition, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published provisional new advice on the use of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. It recommends laparoscopic (including laparoscopically assisted) resection as an alternative to open resection for patients with colorectal cancer who are considered suitable for surgery. NICE's final advice on this technique is due to be published in September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.9/3">Departmental officials have also carried out a review of existing evidence on the costs and benefits of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of colorectal cancer and considered whether there is a need for further research in this area. It was concluded that, given the York/Sheffield project and the work being carried out by NICE, no further work was required at this time. This decision was endorsed by the bowel cancer advisory group chaired by the national cancer director.</p>

The guidance provides a suggested time frame for progress. Nuchal translucency combined with serum tests are performed around 11 to 14 weeks and is one of the recommended tests for Down's syndrome screening. The national Down's syndrome screening programme advise that currently almost 25 per cent. of NHS trusts implement this form of screening. The nuchal fold scan performed between 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy is not currently recommended by the United Kingdom National Screening Committee as an acceptable marker to detect Down's syndrome.</p>

	<p pid="b.1023W.3/1">The data are not available in the format requested. Tackling antisocial behaviour involves a multi-agency approach which includes the local police, crime and disorder reduction partnerships as well as local borough councils and other partner authorities. The Government have already provided guidance and support to these local agencies to help them to target resources and powers to protect the public and ensure that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.3/2">There are variations in performance to tackle antisocial behaviour across the country and the Government are determined that public concern about antisocial behaviour is adequately reflected in the priorities of all our services. The Respect Programme will now take this further so that local services are organised so that they respond swiftly and effectively to the problems that communities face today. People need to see and feel that a difference can be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.3/3">The Government also aims to improve accountability between service providers and the public by giving more power to local communities. The Police and Justice Bill contains provisions for the community call for action. This is a way for local communities to demand a response from agencies to persistent local community safety or antisocial behaviour problems, via an approach to their ward councillor.</p>

Card issuers usually have the power to remove an individual's payment card once they have been informed of the commission of a relevant offence.</p>

On occasions such as this it is necessary to recheck these details against the PNC and the other databases containing details of people who are considered unsuitable to work with children and vulnerable adults.

	<p pid="b.1025W.5/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) publishes an annual report and accounts, which is presented to Parliament pursuant to section 7 of the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000. The annual report and accounts provides, among other things, analysis on the CRB's performance and its operating costs and balance sheet for the financial year. Copies of the CRB annual report and accounts 2004-05 were placed in the Library and a copy may be downloaded from the CRB's website <a href="http://www.crb.gov.uk">www.crb.gov.uk</a>. The bureau's management board, which includes a senior Home Office official, also regularly reviews issues concerning efficiency and effectiveness and the Chief Executive provides regular reports to Ministers on performance. The CRB's published service standards (PSS) are to issue 93 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within 14 days and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within 28 days. The CRB is currently issuing 99.7 per cent. of standard disclosures within PSS, and 88.6 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within PSS. More organisations than ever before have access to the CRB's disclosure service and this expansion clearly demonstrates the Government's confidence in the CRB and its ability to deal with growing volumes in a timely and effective manner. Furthermore, a CRB-commissioned MORI survey has also shown that customer satisfaction levels are at an all time high, reflecting the year-on-year improvements that the CRB has made. The independent research has also shown that the CRB is making a difference to the protection of children and the vulnerable. In 2005, some 25,000 unsuitable people were prevented from gaining access to children or the vulnerable, as a direct result of CRB checks. Many more unsuitable people are deterred from applying to work with children and the vulnerable as a direct result of a requirement for a CRB check.</p>

These have been in place since 1992 and are regularly re-tendered. The arrangements are strongly encouraged by the Association of Chief Police Officers and HM inspectorate of constabulary. The most recent version (spring 2005) has been designed to assist forces in rationalising the variety of models in use, to encourage standardisation and deliver further increases in value for money.</p>

	<p pid="b.1039W.5/1">The usable operational capacity of the prison estate is 1,700 spaces less than the certified operational capacity. This operating margin reflects the constraints imposed by the need to provide separate accommodation for different groups of prisoners such as gender, age, security category and conviction status, as well as the necessary provision of single cells, accommodation out of use and the geographical distribution of prisons and prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1039W.5/2">In April 2004, a database was introduced to assist with the management of the prison population. The more accurate information it provides enabled us to reduce the operating margin in stages from 2,000 to 1,700 places. The reduction added 300 places to the useable operating capacity while still maintaining a sufficient operating margin to manage the prison population safely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1042W.3/1">Evidence obtained as a result of any acts of torture by British officials, or with which British authorities were complicit, would not be admissible in criminal or civil proceedings in the UK. It does not matter whether the evidence was obtained here or abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.3/2">During the individual appeals against certification under powers provided under part four of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act (ATCSA), the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) emphatically rejected any suggestion that evidence relied upon by the Government was, or even may have been, obtained by torture. The Court of Appeal later confirmed the view of SIAC. This issue is currently before the House of Lords' Judicial Committee. It is not always possible to know where all intelligence information has come from or the precise circumstances under which it was obtained. The Security Service and Secret Intelligence Service receive material from a wide range of foreign intelligence services. The agencies evaluate the reliability of this intelligence against other information available to them. It is then passed, together with an assessment of reliability, to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.3/3">It may be necessary in some circumstances to rely operationally on material which may have been obtained through the use of torture where it is considered necessary to do so, in particular for preventing terrorist attack and protecting life. The Government do not believe there is an absolute exclusionary rule preventing the use of such evidence in legal proceedings to assess the lawfulness of such executive action. Such a rule could endanger national security as it would undermine our ability to defend in court the decision made and therefore inhibit executive action to protect national security.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.3/4">We do not condone torture in any way, nor would we carry out this completely unacceptable behaviour. However, we do have an obligation to protect national security and public safety. We would be deficient in this duty if we did not properly assess all the information available to us.</p>

	<p pid="b.1045W.0/1">This information is not collected. Electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual. Currently, it is an offence to fail to supply information to the ERO and knowingly supply false information on the annual canvass form. The Electoral Administration Bill, currently under consideration, strengthens the objection process and creates a new offence of supplying false information of any kind to an ERO, or failing to supply information in connection with registration, at any time. The electoral register does not specify the immigration or asylum status of individuals entered on it; however, the addition of a &quot;nationality&quot; box in the registration form does provide an opportunity for EROs to determine the eligibility of an applicant for inclusion in the register on the basis of their stated nationality.</p>

	<p pid="b.1052W.2/1">Over the past year the Department has been engaged in, and is developing, several activities that support this initiative. There has been a series of articles produced for the in-house magazine on a range of health topics, including diabetes and migraine, and more are planned including ones on healthy living and exercise. The Department runs stress courses to offer tips and strategies for managing stress. The occupational welfare team provides a range of information on health issues. The Department is also working towards implementation of the smoking ban in line with the impending legislation and, through the welfare team, has committed to providing information and support to those wishing to give up, both in the run up to and after implementation. As the programme of work on this initiative develops the Department of Health will be working across all of Government to ensure the programme joins up to promote maximum impact. DH is leading the implementation for the initiative as part of its cross-government commitment to deliver the public health &quot;White Paper Choosing Health&quot;.</p>
