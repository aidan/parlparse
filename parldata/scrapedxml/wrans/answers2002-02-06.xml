	<p pid=".935W.12/3">A recent survey report&mdash;&quot;Better Policy Making&quot;&mdash;provides over 40 worked examples of good practice in policy making. It also shows that policy-makers have assimilated and are taking action to modernise the policy process. More information is available at <a href="http://www.cmps.gov.uk">www.cmps.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.12/4">Responsive, consumer focused public services&mdash;The Office of Public Service Reform is working with Departments to raise awareness of the principles of public sector reform and to increase feedback from customers to support policy making, service delivery and monitoring of performance, to ensure that services are designed around customers and are responsive to them.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.12/5">Improving public services&mdash;The Prime Minister's Delivery Unit has been established to ensure that the Government achieve their delivery priorities during this Parliament across the key areas of public service: health, education, crime, asylum and transport.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.12/6">E-government&mdash;The office of the e-Envoy published e-government: a strategic framework for public services in the information age, in April 2000, which set out the Government's strategy for Departments progressing towards the target of having 100 per cent. electronic service delivery by 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.12/7">The proportion of Government services available online has risen from 33 per cent. in spring 2000 to 51 per cent. in summer 2001, and is expected to reach 74 per cent. by the end of 2002. The UK online citizens' portal and the Government Gateway are providing the core infrastructure for the further development of e-government services.

	<p pid=".937W.9/1">Successful implementation of IT enabled projects is important for the Government's delivery of improved public services and we are strengthening their management in a number of ways. During the last year all major procurement projects in central civil government have been required to undergo Gateway reviews at key decision points by teams of experts independent of the project team; projects can proceed to the next stage only when these rigorous tests have been met. We launched the Successful Projects in an IT Environment (SPRITE) Programme in January 2001 to work with Departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies to ensure that the recommendations to improve project delivery in the Successful IT: Modernising Government in Action report become embedded in their working cultures.</p>

	<p pid=".943W.9/1">Security is a key issue for the Afghan Interim Authority (IA) and for the International Community. It is clear that a stable environment is needed for the IA to be able to function effectively and for reconstruction work to begin. We have been working closely with the IA on this issue and the UK is currently acting as lead nation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). ISAF was mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 (2001) to assist the IA in the maintenance of security in Kabul and its surrounding areas, so that the IA as well as UN personnel can operate in a secure environment.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.9/2">There has been regular discussion with the IA on the issue of security, including between my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the Chairman of the IA during the latter's visit to the United Kingdom on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".947W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I attended the <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-28">28 January</phrase> General Affairs Council. There were no formal votes taken at this Council, but Conclusions were adopted on a range of subjects, in each case reflecting UK positions.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/2">The Council held a public debate on the Spanish presidency programme for the first half of 2002. The UK underlined the importance of anti-terrorism co-operation, enlargement, economic reform, effectiveness in external policy, trade liberalisation, the middle east peace process and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/3">On Zimbabwe, the Council concluded that the essential elements defined in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement were not being respected. It decided to close the Article 96 consultations with Zimbabwe and to implement targeted sanctions if:</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/4" class="indent">the Government of Zimbabwe prevent the deployment of an EU observation mission starting by <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-03">3 February 2002</phrase>, or if they later prevent the mission from operating effectively. Likewise, if the Government of Zimbabwe prevent the international media from having free access to cover the election; or</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/5" class="indent">there is a serious deterioration in the situation on the ground, in terms of a worsening of the human rights' situation or attacks on the opposition; or</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/6" class="indent">the election is assessed as not being free and fair.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/7">The Council took note of a presentation by the presidency of its work programme on enlargement. The presidency's programme is aimed at ensuring that negotiations with candidate countries which are ready can be concluded by the end of the second half of 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/8">The Council discussed Council Secretariat and Commission papers on conflict prevention. The presidency stressed the need to identify priority areas for action. Member states endorsed the themes of the papers and agreed that EU action should continue to be targeted, joined up and timely.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/9">The Council adopted Conclusions calling for conclusion of the EU/Chile agreement before the EU Summit with Latin American and Caribbean countries in May this year, and agreed Conclusions welcoming progress in the EU/Mercosur negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/10">The Council agreed that the two Vice Presidents of the Praesidium to the Convention on the Future of Europe should remain independent of their nation states. The Council agreed a general framework for the convention budget to be extracted from the current Community budget. This will not, therefore, require any additional expenditure by member states.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/11">The General Affairs Council issued Conclusions on the middle east peace process. Ministers were concerned at the recent violence and condemned recent Palestinian terrorism. Ministers reaffirmed the importance of the Laeken declaration, which set out the steps required by both sides in the short term, called on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to implement the Tenet and Mitchell recommendations immediately and unconditionally and reaffirmed the need for security and political steps to be taken in parallel. Ministers also expressed their concern at the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and other facilities which help Palestinians in their economic, social and humanitarian development and which are financed by the European Union and other donors. The GAC urged the Government of Israel to put an end to this practice and reserved the right to claim reparations in the appropriate fora.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/12">The Secretary General/High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations presented a joint paper consisting of an annual review on Common Strategies. The first of the existing three Common Strategies (on Russia, Ukraine and the Mediterranean) expires in June 2003. The SG/HR and Commissioner Patten agreed to work together on further ideas for improving the effectiveness of Common Strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/13">The Council discussed the Western Balkans and welcomed signs of steady improvement in relations between Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and encouraged the three countries to continue this rapprochement. The Council urged Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo to work with increased resolve on all matters related to the return of refugees and displaced persons. The Council supported efforts undertaken by SG/HR Solana to facilitate dialogue between Belgrade and Podgorica. It also expressed its concern at the continuing failure of the Assembly in Kosovo to elect a President. The Union's willingness to start negotiations with Albania for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania was stressed, but the Council noted that attention has recently been diverted from vital reforms. The Council took the decision to conclude the Interim Agreement with Croatia. The adoption of the Local Self-Government Law in Macedonia was welcomed as a critical step in the process of implementation of the Framework Agreement. This opens the way to the holding, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March 2002</phrase>, of a Donors' meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/14">The Council discussed the possibility of an unarmed EU-led policing mission to succeed the International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia when it completes its mandate at the end of 2002. Its aim would be to consolidate the achievements of the IPTF and the international community's work to establish sustainable policing arrangements under Bosnian ownership in accordance with best European and international practice. The Council agreed that more detailed work was required in order to allow it to take a decision at its <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">18 February</phrase> meeting on whether the EU should make a formal offer to run the IPTF successor mission.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/15">Council discussion on EU/Russia focused mainly on Kaliningrad. The presidency said it would accelerate work on Kaliningrad in time for the EU-Russia Summit in May. The importance of dialogue on Kaliningrad between Poland, Lithuania and Russia was also highlighted.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/16">The presidency debriefed partners on recent EU efforts to defuse tensions between India and Pakistan. The presidency said that the EU should continue its efforts to encourage de-escalation and a return to dialogue.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.0/17">The Council discussed the situation in Afghanistan and in particular the satisfactory outcome of the International Donors Conference in Tokyo on 21&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-01-22">22 January 2002</phrase>. It reiterated the Union's commitment to playing a significant role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and in supporting the political process agreed in Bonn.</p>

These are taken from The Greenhouse Gas Protocol website <a href="http://www.ghgprotocol.org">www.ghgprotocol.org</a> and are the 1999 average values for power plants in &quot;Economies in Transition&quot;.

If the outcome of the evaluation and of additional work on the costs and benefits of a national Your Guide service indicate that a national service should go ahead, the intention is that this should be introduced throughout the United Kingdom. (Of course national roll-out of an ambitious programme of this kind would be a major undertaking and it is to be expected that the service would be phased in over a period of time.) However, roll-out of a Your Guide service in the devolved regions would be subject to discussion with the devolved Administrations.</p>

	<p pid=".965W.0/1">We have introduced a number of complementary initiatives designed to encourage better interaction between universities and industry. This will enable businesses to access and benefit from the universities' research capabilities, and universities themselves become more responsive to the needs of industry.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.0/2">In October 2001 the Government made awards in excess of &pound;100 million under three competitions (the Higher Education Innovation Fund &pound;80 million, Science Enterprise Challenge &pound;15 million and University Challenge &pound;15 million) to encourage the transfer of knowledge from the science base to industry.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.0/3">This builds on the previous funding allocated to the first round of University Challenge, &pound;45 million in 1999, and Science Enterprise challenge, &pound;28.9 million in 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.0/4">We have expanded the successful TCS scheme which enables high-quality graduates to draw on academic support and expertise while working in a company on research projects of value to industry. We have increased TCS activity by 25 per cent. during 2001; from 730 to 918 current TCS Programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.0/5">DTI and its co-sponsors have approved 18 Faraday Partnerships focused on areas of major industrial importance to the UK. Each partnership is designed to promote better exploitation of research and technology by creating partnerships between universities, intermediary bodies (eg research and technology organisations, private sector laboratories, etc.), business end-users and suppliers of finance. A further six partnerships will be selected later this year to enable us to fulfil our White Paper commitment to set up a national network of 24 Faraday Partnerships by 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.0/6">The Government have continued to support the LINK collaborative research scheme which is aimed at promoting the development and transfer of new technologies between universities and companies. Expenditure across Government in support of LINK was &pound;41 million in 2000&ndash;01. The Government announced seven new LINK programmes and committed &pound;12 million in 2000&ndash;01 to a further round of Foresight LINK Awards projects, complementing current LINK programmes in Foresight priority areas. There are currently a total of some 380 LINK university/company research projects under way.</p>

	<p pid=".966W.0/1">It is a priority for my Department to support a healthy UK textiles and clothing industry and to work alongside the industry's own Textile and Clothing Strategy Group (TCSG) in helping to improve the industry's productivity and competitiveness. I attach particular importance to helping the industry to innovate and develop new world-beating products. The Government have invested more than &pound;80 million in the industry since 1997. And in the last year alone, we have invested about &pound;8 million focused principally on developing the technical textiles market, employment and training opportunities, help for the supply chain, design skills, the benefits of 3-commerce and export support.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.0/2">My Department is working closely with the TCSG to raise awareness and encourage participating of textile and clothing manufacturers in a variety of research, technology transfer and best practice programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.0/3">A programme of 10 regionally tailored road shows, &quot;Textile and Clothing Funding Unzipped&quot;, is under way in key textiles and clothing regions underpinned by a dedicated website signposting companies to sources of help and support for technological innovation, for R&amp;D and for capital investment, including information on collaborative EU programmes such as Link and Eureka. &quot;Unzipped&quot; road shows have so far been held in Melton Mowbray&mdash;east midlands in March 2001, Bolton&mdash;north-west region in October 2001, Huddersfield&mdash;Yorkshire and Humber region in October 2001, Port Talbot&mdash;south Wales in November 2001, Llandudno&mdash;north Wales in November 2001, London in December 2001 and continues in Sunderland&mdash;north-east region on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-06">6 February 2002</phrase>, Solihull&mdash;west midlands on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-05">5 March 2002</phrase>, Edinburgh on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-14">14 March 2002</phrase> and Belfast on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-20">20 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.0/4">Particular focus has been given by my Department to supporting the development of Technical Textiles. Since 1998 22 collaborative and innovative technical textiles projects have been supported and a further seven new projects are currently in development. In April 2001 a Technical Textiles Project Co-ordinator was appointed to increase networking within the sector and bring together project consortia of technical textile companies and academic institutions. To help in this objective regional seminars have been held to highlight the availability of funding for technical textile innovation and to encourage traditional textile companies to diversify into this sector. My Department is supporting the work of TechniTex&mdash;the Faraday Partnership for technical textiles comprising hub partners Heriot-Watt university, the university of Leeds, UMIST and BTTG. We welcome the industry initiative to explore the possibility of setting up of a TT trade association, which would help broker stronger links across the sector.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.0/5">We continue to seek to involve UK textile manufacturers in research collaborations with universities. Currently we are funding two such research partnerships through Foresight LINK Awards. The two projects are aimed at researching new fire resistant textiles, and a prototype automated sorter for the detection and removal of natural and synthetic contaminants in wool and cashmere. We are also funding a EUREKA project with the objective of creating a pilot line for the manufacture of texturised, mass stained, fine polypropylene yarn.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.0/6">We are already supporting a variety of collaborative initiatives in the textile and clothing sector as a whole aimed at fostering stronger networks between strategic partners through the Innovation Budget and through best practice programmes such as the Industry Forum Adaptation scheme, which is currently funding a major initiative aimed at improving supply chain efficiency in the textiles and clothing sector.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.0/7">My Department is aware that the industry has been in discussions with a view to developing British wool textile as a generic brand. In consultation with the TCSG my Department is carrying out a comparative study of the UK and Italian clothing manufacturing industries, focused on the wool and worsted weaving and men's tailoring sectors. The results of this study will be disseminated to the industry and will inform decisions about any future research projects.</p>

	<p pid=".970W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.2/2">Results obtained under the OECD's Co-ordinated Research and Environmental Surveillance Programme (CRESP) related to sea disposal of radioactive wastes have demonstrated that the radiological impacts on human and oceanic populations emanating from the north-east Atlantic dumpsites are exceedingly small compared to the natural background levels, and are likely to remain so. This view was reiterated in the OSPAR Convention's Quality Status Report 2000, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.2/3">CRESP reported that the peak critical group individual dose as a result of sea dumping of solid radioactive waste would be 0.00002 millisieverts per annum, compared with 2 millisieverts per annum derived from natural radionuclides. The critical group is the hypothetical group of individuals who are calculated to be most exposed to the source of radioactivity being assessed&mdash;in this case coastal consumers of very large quantities of fish, crustaceans and molluscs (approximately 220 kg/year of fish, 37 kg/year of crustaceans and 37 kg/year of molluscs). The peak doses were calculated to occur approximately 200 years after dumping, by which time some of the activity would have leached from the disposal site and dispersed through the ocean.</p>
	<p pid=".970W.2/4">The Government fund extensive environmental monitoring of the waters around the UK, and this has not detected any adverse effects which could be attributed to radioactivity from Atlantic disposal sites. The monitoring shows that doses to critical groups from man-made sources of radioactivity are very small, and considerably less than doses due to natural background levels of radioactivity. In view of this, we have no plans to undertake any direct monitoring of the north Atlantic disposal sites.</p>

The prisons concerned and the numbers associated with each are set out in the table. Information relating to the police stations at which they were held is not available centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Figures for Ashfield, Brinsford and Portland may be understated as some information is available for the year commencing April 2001 only. Figures for Feltham and Onley may include some young offenders (18 to 21-year-olds).</p>

	<p pid=".976W.9/2">The Home Office is in the process of carrying out a research study on how crime and fear of crime affects older people. The findings of this study will be published in due course and will cover prevalence of crime against older people, the reporting of such crime to the police, and repeat victimisation. It will also examine how fear of crime among older people is affected by the area in which they live, by past experiences and by other characteristics and their perceptions of the police and criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.9/3">The Home Office Public Service Agreement (PSA) fear of crime target relates specifically to fear of violent crime, burglary and vehicle crime&mdash;the categories of crime which are of most concern to the public as measured by the British Crime Survey (BCS). The BCS shows that perceptions of crime do not necessarily follow actual trends in crime. This is particularly the case for older people where the percentage of people who feel it is very or fairly likely that they will be a victim of crime within the next year is significantly higher than the number who actually do become victims.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.9/4">A communication strategy is being developed to address this misperception, with key themes identified by research and targeted at geographical areas where fear of crime is greatest and groups of people who fear crime the most.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.9/5">The assurance agenda within the police reform programme can also be expected to increase feelings of public safety while the Home Office's Reducing Burglary Initiative includes a number of programmes which will target burglary against the elderly in particular.</p>

	<p pid=".978W.2/1">At any one time a small number of sex offenders will be being treated with antilibidinal drugs in prison. Research has shown these drugs to be effective only where libido is an important contributor to a person's offending behaviour. The majority of sex offenders, who act from feelings of rage, power or violence, would not be expected to benefit from this form of treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.2/2">Treatment with antilibidinal drugs in prison is initiated only after assessment by, and on the recommendation of, a consultant psychiatrist specialising in the treatment of sex offenders, taking account of the nature of the particular individual's sex offending and whether the likely benefits of treatment outweighed the risks and side effects. Treatment would only go ahead with the informed consent of the prisoner concerned. The specialist would also be expected to advise on arrangements for the continuation of treatment on the prisoner's release, as the drugs need to be taken regularly to maintain their effect.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.2/3">The national health service has commissioned a study of the feasibility of undertaking further research on the effectiveness of a different group of drugs in the management of sex offenders in both prison and the community.</p>

The formula shares 30 per cent. of funds equally between the nine regions in England and Wales, allocates 30 per cent. based on the proportion of population living in the 10 per cent. most deprived wards and 40 per cent. on levels of recorded crimes which impact most on retailers.

	<p pid=".984W.6/1">Our assessment was set out clearly in the White Paper &quot;Time for Reform&quot; (Cm. 4696) published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-10">10 April 2000</phrase>. We proposed that the conditions attached to the licences of pubs and clubs should be set locally by the local authority on the basis of the balance of the operator's requirements, resident views, and police and fire authority assessments. To counter and minimise public disorder resulting from fixed closing times, we intend to introduce flexible opening hours as a condition of the licence for each premises, with the potential for some venues to operate up to 24 hour-opening, seven days a week, subject to consideration of the impact on local residents. We intend to implement these proposals by means of primary legislation as soon as parliamentary time permits. The changes will beneficial to the police because it will help them cope with late night disorder and reduce crime; for business because it will sweep away red tape and offer them real flexibility; for citizens and visitors to this country alike by creating a safer environment in which they can have greater choice; for families by creating more opportunities for them to spend leisure time together without fear of intimidation or disorder; and for local residents, who will acquire a bigger say in the licensing process which will be properly accountable to them.</p>

An amendment to the article on recovery in the draft regulation was agreed in February 1999 at the EC Environment Council meeting. Between February 1999 and mid-2001, UK officials repeatedly asked the Commission for formal clarification of the position of ODS in the insulating foam of refrigeration equipment.

	<p pid=".989W.9/1">There is no simple, direct relationship between the dose arising from any radioactive discharges from UK nuclear plants and proximity to them. All radioactive discharges from UK nuclear plants are well within the national and international limit of 1 millisievert a year. In setting discharge limits, the Environment Agency has to be sure that no one would be exposed to a dose from man-made sources of ionising radiation greater than this. (There are separate dose limits for a single site and for a single new source of ionising radiation of 0.5 and 0.3 millisieverts respectively). There are no cases in the UK where any of these limits are breached. In all cases the most exposed members of the public receive a dose which is considerably below the appropriate limit.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.9/2">The Environment Agency has recently published its report &quot;Radioactivity in the Environment Report for 2000&quot;. This is the latest in a series of such reports and contains a summary and radiological assessment of the agency's monitoring programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.9/3">The principal conclusions were that discharges of radioactivity into the environment reported by the operators of the major sites during 2000 were well below the authorised discharge levels; concentrations of radionuclides in water, sediment, soil and grass were broadly similar to those in previous years; activity concentrations in air, rain, and sources of drinking water remained low during 2000; and all the estimated doses from radionuclides in sediment, soil and water were below the public dose limit and in many cases the estimated doses were much less than 1 per cent. of the dose limit.</p>

	<p pid=".992W.2/1">All targets attacked in self defence by coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones are military elements of the Iraqi Integrated Air Defence System.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.2/2">On the rare occasions where ordnance has failed to hit the intended target, it has almost invariably landed on open ground. It is extremely difficult to assess collateral damage, or numbers of civilian casualties caused by the remainder, despite the painstaking Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) that the coalition carries out every time ordnance is released. However, it is possible to demonstrate categorically that many of the Iraqi claims of collateral damage and civilian casualties are untrue. There have, for example, been several instances when Iraqis have claimed civilian casualties when coalition aircraft have not been flying, or when BDA has confirmed that only military targets were hit. Indeed, there is good evidence that, on several occasions where Saddam has made claims of civilian casualties, it has been caused by Iraqi artillery shells or missiles, recklessly fired at coalition aircraft, falling to earth in built up areas.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.2/3">In all cases of failure to hit the intended target by ordnance released from UK aircraft, the failure was caused by ordnance malfunction. We do not hold information for coalition partners.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.2/4">Coalition aircraft only attack military targets in self-defence. We make every effort to select targets and to employ precision guided munitions in order to minimise the possibility of collateral damage and civilian casualties. Despite these efforts, regrettably, on occasions civilians may have suffered as a result of coalition activity. However, this would be completely avoided if the Iraqis desisted from attacking coalition aircraft.</p>

	<p pid=".993W.2/1">Since January 1998, Saddam has continually sought to upgrade his air defence system. Developments since January 1998 include increased use of digital technology and greater mobility and dispersal of radars and weapons.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/2">Its capability is very carefully monitored to assess the impact of any changes on coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. The danger to our aircraft is demonstrated by the fact that the Iraqi air defence system has threatened coalition aircraft on around 1,000 occasions over the last two years. The coalition has on occasion responded purely in self-defence using high precision weapons against elements of the Iraqi Air Defence System. There is no doubt these self-defence responses do have an impact in terms of reducing the threat posed to aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. Other important initiatives, including the UN-sponsored arms embargo on Iraq, also have an impact on the capability of Saddam's air defence infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/3">As long as the Iraqis persist in attempts to shoot down our aircraft, the coalition will continue to take action in self-defence to ensure the safety of our aircrew.</p>

	<p pid=".1000W.0/1">The underlying rate of increase of formula rents will be the same for all local authorities. In 2002&ndash;03, we predict that the average rate of increase in real terms for formula rents for council tenants will be 1 per cent. Taking into account the policy that registered social landlord rents increases should be limited to RPI plus &frac12; per cent. a year, it is likely that local authority formula rents will have to rise by an average of about 1&frac12; per cent. a year in real terms over the next 10 years to achieve Ministers' intention that similar rents should be charged for similar council and housing association properties by 2012. This is about half the average rate of council rent increases over the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".1000W.0/2">However, the precise path of social rents over the next 10 years will depend, among other things, on the outcomes of future spending reviews and the decisions taken by individual landlords who retain responsibility for rent setting.</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.2/1">The Secretary of State confirmed in December 2000 that the A36/A46 route was to remain non-core, and would be detrunked in due course. Negotiations on detrunking between the Highways Agency and the local highway authorities commenced early in 2001. However, the South West Regional Assembly placed a holding objection to detrunking, pending the outcome of a further study into the management of the route and the traffic problems in Bath. This study, entitled the &quot;Bristol/Bath to South Coast Study&quot; is to be commissioned shortly, and is due to report at the end of 2002. Detrunking negotiations are therefore likely to be on hold until early 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.2/1">Deprivation is so ingrained in some inner city areas that only long-term regeneration programmes rooted in the needs and aspirations of local people, can make a significant impact on these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/2">A New Commitment to Neighbourhood Renewal National Strategy Action Plan which was launched by the Prime Minister in January 2001 recognises this. The national strategy is a new long-term initiative which aims to deliver neighbourhood renewal&mdash;the process of delivering real change to England's most deprived areas. The Government's vision is reflected in its goal: to narrow the gap between deprived neighbourhoods and the rest, so that within 10 to 20 years, no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live. It aims to deliver economic prosperity, safe communities, high quality schools, decent housing, and better health to the poorest parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/3">This approach will focus main Government programmes explicitly on deprived areas, many of which are located in inner city areas, and will require local people and public and private sectors to work in partnership. The strategy is being spearheaded by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, a cross-cutting unit based in DTLR and staffed by officials from across Whitehall and the public sector, with secondees from the private and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/4">In addition, the regional development agencies are providing support to deprived urban areas through the Single Regeneration Budget and physical regeneration programmes. In April 2002, the RDA's new single programme will include working with LSPs and other stakeholders to tackle poverty and social exclusion through promoting economic development in the most deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1008W.12/2">The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions uses the Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID 2000) as a means of determining how multiply deprived an area is, relative to other areas in England.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/3">The Indices of Deprivation 2000 is made up of:</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/4" class="indent">Six domain indices at ward level (Income, Employment, Health, Education, Housing and Geographical Access to Services),</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/5" class="indent">An overall ward level Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD 2000).</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/6" class="indent">A supplementary Child Poverty Index at ward level, which gives the percentage of children living in households that claim means tested benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/7" class="indent">Six summaries at local authority level of the overall IMD 2000, which allow all 354 local authority districts to be ranked according to each measure. These summaries take account of the different patterns of deprivation found in different areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/8">Each ward in England is ranked according to how multiply deprived it is, with the most deprived ward being assigned a rank of one and the least deprived a rank of 8,414, for presentation. The ranks show how a ward compares to all the other wards in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/9">The IMD 2000 is constructed from 33 indicators using the most robust and up-to-date information available to describe deprivation at ward level. This includes information from sources such as Department of Social Security benefits data and University and College Admissions Service data. The indicators were chosen after wide consultation with a number of interested parties including central Government, local government, academics and practitioners.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.12/10">The Index is based on the premise that multiple deprivation is made up of separate dimensions or 'domains' of deprivation. These domains reflect different aspects of deprivation. However, low income remains a central component of the working definition of multiple deprivation for the ID 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".1011W.6/1">DFID's &quot;Children out of school paper&quot; makes clear what action we believe should be taken on this. The main approach for delivering on the Dakar resource commitment should be through nationally owned poverty reduction strategy papers and similar planning frameworks. They should indicate how country plans to move towards the education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be met, including through the release of HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Country) savings and with the assistance of the international community. So far as possible, this should be through sector-wide approaches and budget support.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.6/2">This approach should be underpinned by detailed analysis of the funding implications for achieving UPE and gender equality in schooling at a country level. The World bank is supporting work of this nature, including the tracking of expenditures from debt relief and identification of the scope for additional national resources within countries. Where necessary, assistance should be given to help countries undertake resource analysis of this type. The bank's findings will be submitted to Governors at their spring meeting in April. We are consulting with the bank about this work.</p>

	<p pid=".1019W.9/2">Cold weather payments are a key part of our strategy to tackle fuel poverty. They provide extra help towards heating costs for the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society in periods of exceptionally cold weather. They are paid to pensioners receiving the minimum income guarantee, and to people receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who have children under the age of five or who have a premium for disability or long term sickness.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.9/3">The payments are made automatically and are triggered when the average temperature is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0 degrees centigrade or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. So far this year we estimate that payments to the value of almost &pound;16.8 million have been triggered. Available information on the breakdown of the payments is in the tables.</p>

	<p pid=".1030W.8/103">&pound;40 million has been allocated to buy additional elective cases in the private sector this year. It has been targeted on those health authorities most in need of short term support.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.8/104">The funding will be used to free up NHS capacity but the exact number of cases purchased is not yet known. This will depend on the final details of contracts negotiated with the private sector. We will make the final figures available after the end of the financial year. However, the allocations by health authority are shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".1034W.2/1">The Government's plans for modernising the national health service work force are set out in the document &quot;Investment and reform for NHS staff&mdash;Taking forward the NHS plan&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-15">15 February 2001</phrase>. This details activity in hand to modernise work force planning including the establishment of work force development confederations at local level. These bring together NHS and non-NHS employers to plan the healthcare work force. They will work with health authorities (HAs) to produce an integrated work force plan which underpins the service plans set out in their Health Improvement Programme (HimP).</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.2/2">The Northern Workforce Development Confederation is engaged in a number of initiatives to recruit more nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists in the north-east. The confederation is running four return-to- practice nursing courses and in-house returner training for some physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Study courses for nursing assistants to train to access pre-registration nursing courses are being run and two trusts are seconding nursing assistants onto nurse training.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.2/3">Individual trusts in the north-east are recruiting nurses from the Philippines and holding fast track recruitment days for all professions. Open days at hospitals are being held emphasising family friendly working and support groups. The confederation and three trusts were represented at the <i>Evening Chronicle</i> Jobs Event at the Telewest Arena in Newcastle on 23 and <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>. One trust is recruiting newly qualified nurses over establishment for expansion plans.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.2/4">The confederation is also giving presentations to schools and colleges, careers fairs and recruitment days; placing posters/leaflets in various public places such as libraries, sports centres, general practitioners surgeries, village halls, and running an advertising campaign on the back of buses until the end of December for general recruitment in all careers and for return to practice advertisements.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.2/5">We are committed to boosting GP numbers and have already introduced a number of measures to encourage more doctors into primary care. These include a &quot;Golden Hello&quot; scheme which will give &pound;5,000 to every GP who joins the NHS, with an extra payment of up to &pound;5,000 if they work in an under-doctored area and a new &pound;22 million GP training package whereby new GPs will be eligible for additional training of up to 20 days a year. We have also given a commitment to ensure trainee GPs' pay is increased in line with that of junior hospital doctors in the future and increased funding for locum cover for family doctors on maternity, paternity and adoptive leave.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.2/6">The Northern Workforce Development Confederation has allocated &pound;12,000 to fund recruitment and retention initiatives within primary care in the North East. The flexibilities afforded by the Personal Medical Services pilots allow opportunities for further GP recruitment, particularly as employees rather than independent contractors. Sunderland, which has the highest average GP patient list sizes in England, has been particularly successful in boosting its GP numbers through this scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.2/7">The measures announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="">5 November</phrase> to improve the quality of, and expand, GP premises, especially in under-doctored areas, are likely to act as a lever in boosting GP recruitment to hitherto difficult to recruit areas. The north- east health authorities have, in the two years to September 2001, increased GP numbers by over 90 additional GPs, representing an increase of seven per cent. in the GP work force.</p>

	<p pid=".1036W.5/37">asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities; and</p>

	<p pid=".1036W.5/40">2. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.</p>
	<p pid=".1036W.5/41">3. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies.

	<p pid=".1037W.5/1">The Department does not collect information about retirement intentions of general practitioners. All unrestricted principals and equivalents (UPEs) have to retire as a principal by the age of 70. Around 2,200 UPEs will reach 70 by 2011.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.5/2">In addition there are a further 8,880 doctors who are currently aged between 48 and 58. We might expect a proportion of these doctors to also leave by 2011. A number of doctors continue to work in the national health service after they have claimed their NHS pension until they retire fully.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.5/3">The target increase in the NHS Plan for GPs is at least 2,000 more by 2004. The increases are based on an assessment of what is deliverable given the numbers expected to come out of training, and what is achievable through action on recruitment and retention. This assessment is set against the number of staff we expect to leave the NHS (leavers and retirements).</p>

	<p pid=".1042W.5/1">We have already taken steps to improve the regulation of private health care services. From <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, a new independent body, the National Care Standards Commission, will take over from health authorities the regulation of independent health care providers.</p>
	<p pid=".1042W.5/2">For the first time, providers will have to meet national minimum standards. The guiding principles when producing these standards was that the needs of patients were paramount, and that the standards must be compatible with national health service standards where possible. The standards comprise core standards with which all independent health care providers will have to comply, including the requirement that they have in place a formal complaints policy and procedures. Complainants who are dissatisfied with a hospital's complaints system may approach the Commission direct.</p>
	<p pid=".1042W.5/3">Apart from core standards, providers will be required to meet standards specific to the services they provide. For the first time, the owners and managers of private hospitals will be held accountable for the quality of care provided in their establishment.</p>

	<p pid=".1047W.11/2">Routine vaccination for smallpox stopped in the United Kingdom and in all countries by 1980 when eradication was declared by the Word Health Organisation. We now have a population which either has never been vaccinated or who were vaccinated 20 or more years ago and who have waning immunity.</p>
	<p pid=".1047W.11/3">A Departmental funded study by the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research has been looking at how best to estimate the protective immunity within the UK population, as part of a wider study on microbial risk assessment. Recent estimates put the level of immunity at about 18 per cent., though it must be stressed that this is only a crude estimate.</p>
