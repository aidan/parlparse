The Government's preparations include a series of classified contingency plans for responding to a wide range of terrorist threats.

Much of the response is based on generic, multi-agency, local emergency arrangements, developed within the clear guidelines set out by the Home Office.</p>

This includes ensuring routes to and from the site of the incident remain viable, and planning for the reception and re-housing of evacuees. We are also taking steps to strengthen the regional level of co-ordination, to ensure compatibility and cohesion of local evacuation and reception plans for large-scale incidents.</p>

They are expected to be carried out in accordance with &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999)&quot; guidance. This expects that the area child protection committee will determine, within one month of a case coming to light, whether to conduct a review. The review should be undertaken and completed within a further four months.

	<p pid=".1054W.2/1">Children involved in prostitution and other forms of commercial sexual exploitation are likely to be in need of welfare services and&mdash;in many cases&mdash;protection under the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid=".1054W.2/2">Where there is a risk to the life of a child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, for example, the police or councils with social services responsibilities, should act quickly to secure the immediate initial safety of the child. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure either that the child remains in, or is removed to, a safe place. Under section 20 of the Children Act 1989, a local authority may provide accommodation for any child within their area if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child's welfare.</p>

This assessment should be followed by consideration of how best to address the identified needs of the child and development of a care plan for the child who is in need. The plan could include a range of services, for example, mentoring to assist a return to education or employment, and help to secure appropriate health services.</p>

	<p pid=".1060W.5/4">The independent Review of Radio Spectrum Management has made a number of recommendations designed to promote the optimal use of defence spectrum. These include an audit of defence spectrum, the continued application of spectrum pricing in parallel with non-military users on a comparable basis and the introduction of trading to provide incentives for effective spectrum use. The Government have accepted these recommendations and their implementation is now being taken forward by the Radiocommunications Agency with the Ministry of Defence.</p>

	<p pid=".1061W.0/1">It is not possible to identify definitively the individual reactors in which specific batches of plutonium allocated to the ownership of specific customers might originally have been produced. Reprocessing customers receive back separated plutonium based on that contained in the fuel they originally supplied. This is assessed before the fuel is reprocessed. The nature of commercial reprocessing in large-scale bulk chemical processing facilities means that the plutonium contained in the fuel becomes blended with that contained in fuel from other reactors.</p>
	<p pid=".1061W.0/2">International safeguards arrangements for MO&quot; fuel assemblies include measurement of the nuclear material content of the fuel before its shipment from the fabrication plant and then the application of seals to the transport flasks into which the assemblies have been loaded. On receipt at a reactor facility seals are checked and removed before the fuel is placed in storage or loaded into the reactor. Such fuel storage and reactor loading is monitored by safeguards inspections combined with the use of containment and surveillance equipment (e.g. cameras and seals). Safeguards measures continue to be applied after MO&quot; fuel has been loaded in a reactor.</p>

	<p pid=".1062W.2/1">In the European Union, the ownership of nuclear materials is governed by the Euratom provisions that deal with the supply of nuclear materials (essentially Chapter 6 of the Euratom Treaty). These provide that exchanges of material&mdash;which are basically a commercial matter for the companies concerned&mdash;require the approval of the Euratom Supply Agency on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.2/2">External obligations, for example limiting the use of such material to peaceful, non-explosive purposes are, however, a feature of some international nuclear co-operation agreements, such as those between, Euratom and the United States, Euratom and Australia and Euratom and Canada. In some cases where there are no Euratom agreements in place, there are bilateral agreements which contain comparable provisions. The owners of nuclear material can request that external obligations attached to one batch of material can be exchanged or swapped for different obligations on another equivalent batch of material. Each such request for a swap involving material that is subject to Euratom co-operation agreements must be approved by the Services of the European Commission, whose assessment takes account of the characteristics of the nuclear material concerned, (i.e. to ensure that the swap would not diminish the obligations involved) and the reasoning behind the request.</p>

	<p pid=".1064W.3/1">The Inspector's Report on the A63 Melton Public Inquiry contained conclusions that supported the Highways Agency's proposals in all respects apart from one element of the Side Roads Order. This related to an alternative proposal for a junction at Corby Park, submitted by East Riding of Yorkshire Council (ERYC). The Inspector concluded that further work should be carried out to check the feasibility of ERYC's alternative. That is why it was not possible for the Secretary of State to issue a definitive response on the outcome of the Public Inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".1064W.3/2">The Highways Agency is currently working with ERYC to identify the optimum solution and reach agreement on the way forward. It is hoped that an announcement will be made soon.</p>

	<p pid=".1068W.12/4">Keeping animal testing to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment; and</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.12/5">Maintaining or enhancing the competitiveness of the chemical industry.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.12/6">In addition, we also want to see a system that is transparent to all interested parties in its operation and that provides consumers, workers and users of substances with the level of information they require about the substances with which they come into contact.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.12/7">In practical terms we believe it would be difficult to enforce a requirement where every substance that had gone into the manufacture of an article was registered in accordance with the proposed new regulations. However, it may be possible to place a requirement on importers of articles to make a declaration that the imported article did not contain any labile substance of high concern which was likely to be released.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.12/8">On animal testing, as stated above, the Government wishes to ensure that vertebrate animal testing is kept to the absolute minimum necessary to provide sufficient information for decision-making on health and environmental protection. For example, one early estimate of the number of extra animal tests necessary to meet the system described in the White Paper came to 12 million, whereas the ideas outlined in the Government's Position Statement would require far fewer (around 1.3 million).</p>

	<p pid=".1069W.2/1">We estimate that the Common Agricultural Policy costs the average family of four in the United Kingdom between 8 and 9 per week through higher food prices and taxes. We believe reform is necessary to reduce this cost and contribute towards our wider poverty reduction objectives. Similarly, reform of the CAP would assist objectives of poverty reduction in developing countries, by increasing access for their agricultural produce to EU and third country markets.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.2/2">The CAP was originally introduced in 1962 to address a strategic need for food security in Europe. However, as production responded, surpluses became chronic and required increasingly heavy expenditure. Food security is now less of a policy driver, and we would prefer to see producers rewarded for delivering public benefits focussed on the environment and wider rural economy, rather than over-production.</p>

	<p pid=".1070W.2/1">The Agenda 2000 reform package, agreed at the March 1999 Berlin European Council, brought EU cereal, milk and beef prices closer to world levels, and gave member states some flexibility to use CAP money for environmental schemes. It represented a significant shift from price support to direct payments and it reduced some of the economic distortions of the CAP, enabling the formulation of an integrated EU rural development policy.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-22">22 January 2003</phrase> the Commission issued its draft legislative proposals for the 'Mid-term Review' of Agenda 2000. The Government has welcomed these proposals, believing further reform of the CAP to be necessary for both domestic and international reasons. In particular, we were pleased to see formal proposals to break the link between subsidy and production ('decoupling'), which will give producers greater flexibility to exploit market opportunities. However, we also have concerns over some elements of the proposals. For example, the proposed mechanism for transferring funds to support rural development is complex, would be hard to administer and would unfairly impact on larger farms; and we are disappointed at the proposed extension of milk quotas.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/3">The first formal discussion of these proposals took place at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting on 27 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-28">28 January</phrase>. Further Council discussions are planned for the coming months. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State regularly meets her EU counterparts bilaterally to discuss this issue.

	<p pid=".1073W.2/2">I understand that there are approximately 250 km of flood defences along the Trent and its tributaries which have been constructed by the Environment Agency and its predecessors.

	<p pid=".1073W.2/3">Defra encourages operating authorities to take a strategic approach to flood and coastal defence problems and to consider the need for schemes and develop proposals within an overall strategy for catchment areas so as not to create problems elsewhere. The Agency has commissioned consultants to prepare a strategy which will inform flood defence options for the River Trent between Stoke-on-Trent and Newark. Defra is providing grant aid for related studies. It is expected that the strategy will be published this Autumn. The Agency then plan to prepare a strategy for the tidal reach of the River between Newark and the Number Estuary. Defra will consider any capital works emerging from these strategies against the criteria above.</p>

Therefore, lifting the ceiling would not direct more resources to this group. In order to pay for the increased level of the ceiling, either the level of the floor would need to be lowered, or the authorities between the floor and the ceiling would need to contribute more money to help pay for the floor via the scaling factor. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes that it has set the level of floors and ceilings at an appropriate level to ensure a reasonable increase in grant for all authorities.</p>

The advertising figure for 1998&ndash;99 includes &pound;1 million spent on a consular advertising campaign in the run-up to the 1998 World Cup held in France. In addition to the expenditure identified, there was minor additional expenditure in the United Kingdom and overseas during the years specified. This cannot be ascertained without incurring disproportionate cost. The Government are committed to using only cost effective channels to deliver the publicity necessary to support policy implementation. Paid advertising is only resorted to after careful consideration of the cost-benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".1090W.5/1">From 2001, the core budget for prison education has been ring-fenced and is administered jointly by the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills, through the Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit. At the time of ring-fencing, education budgets were historically based, but from 2002&ndash;03, part of the education budget has been linked to achievement of basic skills qualifications. We will develop further the links between funding and educational and vocational qualifications as we increase funding for prison education to &pound;125 million by 2005&ndash;06. The recent review of prison education funding and procurement also identified opportunities for introducing other relevant achievement measures and we are considering these.</p>

The audits were conducted at a number of representative prisons and at headquarters. The results suggest that stress is common among prison staff and is due to a wide range of causes.

	<p pid=".1091W.3/3">From April 2003, all forces will have begun measuring sickness absence according to new data collection arrangements. This was released in June last year by the Police Numbers Task Force and will ensure that sickness absence is broken down into categories, including stress-related illness. The new data collection arrangements will enable forces to target the types of sickness absence that have the most effect on them.</p>

	<p pid=".1091W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, through the National Probation Directorate, has received representations as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1091W.6/2"><i>(a)</i> In respect of workloads, representations were made by the Trade Unions and staff representative bodies which led in January 2001 to a Joint Agreement on Priorities and Employee Care between the Home Office, probation employers, Trade Unions and staff representative bodies. This agreement identified the areas for concern raised by all signatories and a joint framework for improvement. The National Probation Directorate is leading the project to design and implement a Workload Measurement Tool, and has provided a Workload Prioritisation Framework.</p>
	<p pid=".1091W.6/3">The National Association of Probation Officers is undertaking a campaign in respect of workloads which has led to a formal dispute. Local agreements to settle this dispute have now been reached in 34 of the 42 areas of the National Probation Service for England and Wales, and negotiations continue in the remaining eight areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1091W.6/4"><i>(b)</i> In respect of resources, 16 Probation Boards have expressed views about their budget for 2003&ndash;04.</p>
