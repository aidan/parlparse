As part of our wider efforts to improve the overall security situation and respect for law and order, we encourage the Afghan authorities to take seriously any credible threats against human rights defenders. Where appropriate, we also raise individual human rights cases with the government of Afghanistan, both publicly and in private. We also provide financial support to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, which promotes, protects and monitors human rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.7/1">My Department continues to work closely with sponsored bodies responsible for culture to ensure that funding over the SR08 period is used to support the Government's objective to increase participation in culture by adults from a lower socio-economic background.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.7/2">Arts Council England is conducting audience segmentation analysis to gather fresh data about which groups engage with the arts and will use this as the basis for a national campaign to encourage the broadest range of people to do so. English Heritage is also looking at barriers to engagement with the historic environment experienced by people in lower socio-economic groups. Through the Renaissance in the Regions programme the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) is seeking to increase participation and achieve greater diversity amongst the visitors to regional hub museums across England. Entry to DCMS-sponsored national museums and galleries has been free for all since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.7/3">In September last year, 10 pathfinder Find Your Talent projects were set up with an investment of &pound;25 million to test various ways to deliver a five-hour cultural offer to ensure that all children and young people aged 0-19 can access a wide range of high-quality artistic and cultural experiences. In November 2008, my Department announced the Free Theatre initiative which offers free tickets to young people up to age 26. Evaluations of the annual 'Heritage Open Days' initiative, indicate a Department for significant increase in visitors from the lower socio-economic groups in 2006 and 2007 to those sites where records allow comparison with previous years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.7/4">The DCMS 'Taking Part' survey is being used to measure participation by adults from the priority groups. The most recent results, published in December 2008, indicate that the proportion of adults from lower socio-economic backgrounds attending a museum or gallery during the previous 12 months was 30.6 per cent., a 2.3 per cent. increase compared to the baseline established in 2005-06. For visits to historic environment sites the comparable figures were 59.4 per cent. attendance, an increase of 2.3 per cent. on the 2005-06 baseline. Attendance at arts events was 18.3 per cent. of this group with no significant statistical change on the baseline.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250W.5/2"><i> </i>In January 2007, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) commissioned the Work Foundation to produce Staying Ahead, a report analysing the economic performance of the Creative Industries in the UK. The cost of producing this report was approximately &pound;84,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1250W.5/3">Following this report, DCMS, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) produced Creative Britain in February 2008, which outlined 26 commitments seeking to maximise the contribution of the Creative Industries to the UK economy. The costs of producing this document were approximately &pound;74,000. Of this, BERR provided &pound;30,000. It is difficult to estimate the staff costs as most of the officials from each Department involved (DCMS, BERR and DIUS) were engaged on other projects at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1253W.2/1">UK Sport have advised that they will next carry out an athlete survey in the autumn of 2009 and would expect to report the headline findings by the end of the year. Although they had previously planned to conduct a survey early this year for March publication, UK Sport are now seeking to strategically align their athlete survey with the end of year reviews of sport that are conducted as part of Mission 2012&mdash;after the summer competition season. In addition UK Sport are now seeking to supplement findings with focus groups and other data gathering across the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1253W.2/2">The decision not to carry out a survey in 2008 was taken by UK Sport as a result of the uncertainty about the number and range of athletes that would be available to survey at that time. UK Sport will of course be able to benefit from the post-Games athlete survey carried out by the British Athlete Commission and they are confident that the other activity planned will inform Mission 2012 up to and until the next survey in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1255W.6/2">Construction of the temporary roads, hard standings and bridges giving access and lay out space at the Olympic Park construction site was completed up to August 2008 until the installation of the fifth (and final) temporary bridge. The completion of this work, including the establishing of the two main entrance plazas&mdash;one in the North and one in the South&mdash;fulfilled one of the 10 published key milestones set by the ODA (in Demolish, Dig, Design) to be delivered by the Beijing 2008 games.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255W.6/3">The positioning of temporary roads and hard standings onsite, however, will continue to change in response to the needs of each of the individual venue and infrastructure construction areas within the Olympic Park construction site. This will ensure the safe, secure and efficient movement of people and materials to, through and around the Olympic Park site throughout the construction period as work develops.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256W.2/1">The Personal Best Programme, formerly known as the Pre-Volunteer Programme, uses the excitement of the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games to inspire the most disadvantaged people to acquire and develop their skills for work through volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/2">The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) has identified that up to 70,000 Games-time volunteers will be required. It has committed to recruiting up to 10 per cent. of these through Personal Best.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/3">It is hoped that 20,000 disadvantaged people from London will be involved in Personal Best. So far, this programme has been trialled in 11 boroughs with 875 Londoners taking part. This includes the five host boroughs which are areas of significant disadvantage. Over the next six months the programme will be rolled out to every London borough. Building on the success in London this is now being offered to regions, the South East and North East being the first.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/4">Although not all graduates of the scheme will become Games-time volunteers, they will build self esteem through community volunteering, work experience and gain transferable job skills through a nationally recognised qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/5">LOCOG has recently launched its Trailblazer volunteer scheme giving volunteers the opportunity to work within LOCOG itself. The scheme began with a three month pilot with 23 volunteers on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January 2009</phrase> and has been promoted in the host boroughs. If successful, LOCOG intends to involve 60-70 volunteers over the year, increasing the number of participants in the run up to 2012.</p>

In order to minimise the use of pesticides and the consequent risk of exposure to potential toxicants, a process involving moth pheromone has been employed.</p>

Open and fair competition is the most effective method of making sure that we achieve this. Therefore, the MOD does not mandate that a certain proportion of all expenditure on defence procurement is spent on products produced by UK-based companies.

	<p pid="b.1265W.3/1">The sale price for the three Sandown class ships to Estonia was &pound;32 million (the gross return to MOD). The net return to MOD, however, will be adjusted by costs for regeneration of the vessels and training of crew prior to delivery. Regeneration is being carried out under incentivised arrangements and thus the final costs will not be known until completion of the work. In accordance with HM Treasury delegations, a business case was prepared and scrutinised by the appropriate authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266W.2/1">The health care for all veterans has been the responsibility of the NHS since 1953. Former service personnel with mental health problems, including post traumatic stress disorder will benefit from the Government's decision to extend priority treatment to all veterans whose condition is considered by their GP to be due to service. Veterans are also designated as a Special Interest Group (SIG) in the Department of Health's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Programme. This will train 3,600 new therapists by 2010-11 in England. Additionally, five NHS trusts across the UK are piloting a new model of mental health care for veterans, one of which is located in Camden and Islington, and another one is based at the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust. These will provide a holistic service with social support networks complementing health care. Since 1996, the NHS Trauma Service in Hull has worked with veterans to develop and raise awareness of a suitable care pathway.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268W.3/1">UK armed forces possess white phosphorus munitions for the purpose of producing a smoke screen to provide cover and thus protection for our soldiers on the battlefield. These are conventional munitions that are not outlawed or banned by any convention or protocol. I am withholding information on the size of the stockpile of these munitions on the grounds that its disclosure would be likely to prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of the armed forces. UK training in the use of white phosphorus emphasises that it should be used solely for its intended purpose and not as an anti-personnel weapon.</p>

	<p pid="b.1281W.0/1">Marine conservation zones (MCZs) will primarily be protected via existing regulatory regimes. A series of duties placed on public authorities will ensure that those authorities take account of the likely impacts on MCZs of their own actions, and of the activities for which they have responsibility for granting consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1281W.0/2">We will also provide a mechanism to allow the Marine Management Organisation (or, in respect of Welsh territorial waters the Welsh Ministers) to control activities that are otherwise unregulated, where they pose a threat to the achievement of a site's objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1281W.0/3">Where there is evidence to demonstrate that fisheries need to be controlled or restricted in order to further the conservation objectives for a site, the Bill places a duty on inshore fisheries and conservation agencies to take appropriate measures within their areas. Beyond six nautical miles we will pursue the introduction of measures through the EU Common Fisheries Policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1282W.5/1">UK fisheries administrations estimate that at the end of 2007 there were 12,700 people directly employed in the fish-catching sector, either on a full or part-time basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.5/2">The UK Sea Fish Industry Authority (SEAFISH) has published an analysis (in January 2008) that estimates that if the whole of the sea fishing sector were removed, a total of around 29,000 full-time equivalent jobs would be lost initially, including the 12,700 catching jobs, dependent upstream and downstream jobs and jobs in the wider economy which depend indirectly on these jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.5/3">Estimating the number of related jobs onshore whose existence can be attributed at least in part to the UK catching sector alone is complicated by the high levels of imported fish upon which jobs in our processing sector depend. Around 90 per cent. of whitefish processed within the EU is sourced from outside EU waters. SEAFISH estimates that there are around 15,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the UK fish-processing sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1283W.2/1">UK fisheries laboratories send observers to sea to record the quantity of fish discarded and retained by fishing vessels. This sampling is intended to provide estimates of discards of the main commercial species. It is only possible to sample a small proportion of fishing trips in this way. For this reason the sampling effort tends to be focussed on those fisheries which are of relatively large scale, and which usually involve some discarding. There are a large number of fisheries which are small in scale and/or involve little or no discarding, which are not routinely sampled. These include many shellfish fisheries, fisheries for pelagic species such as mackerel and herring, and in particular inshore fisheries involving vessels less than 10 metres in length. Vessels in this latter category form the majority of the UK fishing fleet. As a result, estimates of discards given as weight per vessel may not be representative. Estimates of discards by UK vessels for some important fish stocks are given for 1998 to 2007 (where available), and numbers of fishing vessels registered in the UK over the same period are given in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288W.2/1">The UK Government expressed support for the conservation principles underpinning the European Commission's original proposals on elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays). At the 2008 European Fisheries Council which was held on 17-<phrase class="date" code="2009-12-19">19 December</phrase>, the UK Government achieved a balanced package of technical and conservation measures which discourages further the targeting of vulnerable sharks, skates and rays while also recognising the importance of avoiding unnecessary discards. The final agreed package also reflects that the UK achieved a balance between the need to conserve elasmobranchs for the long- term with the need to safeguard the livelihoods of the UK fishing fleets and their local communities whose viable future depends on the sustainable exploitation of these stocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.2/2">The 2009 Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for sharks were significantly reduced to reflect the vulnerable state of these species. Spurdog was cut by 50 per cent. and porbeagle by 25 per cent. In addition to reduced TACs, appropriate technical measures were also introduced such as setting maximum landing sizes to protect larger females and encouraging the timely release of these animals to aid their future survival and subsequent recovery of the stock.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.2/3">The final package for skates and rays included a TAC for area VI and VII set at the historic baseline, but without the anticipated 15 per cent. TAC cut applied. Contrary to UK expectations, the 25 per cent. by-catch provision was only retained for vessels over 15 m long in the North sea and not in other areas. Also within this package, common skate, undulate rays and white skate caught in relevant nominated International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) zones<sup>(1)</sup>, and angel shark in all European Community waters, should not be retained on board. The proposal requires that catches of these species shall be promptly released unharmed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.5/2">Following an extensive public consultation exercise on the implementation of the new motorcycle test, the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) recognised that a network of multi-purpose test centres (MPTCs) would be needed to deliver the new motorcycle test.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/3">The criterion used for establishing this network was that most motorcycle candidates should have to travel no more than 20 miles or 45 minutes to a MPTC. While not every candidate would be able to reach a test centre within this time/distance criterion, DSA had to strike a balance between convenience for candidates and the efficient provision of testing services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/4">A key factor in deciding on search areas was the need to identify sites which would give the best geographical coverage for most test candidates and where MPTCs would be used efficiently based on demand for tests in those localities. It follows that those areas with a high population density were the main search locations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299W.8/1">The Department for Transport assists the road haulage industry through two key programmes, the Freight Best Practice (FBP) programme and the Safe And Fuel Efficient Driving (SAFED) programme. These provide advice, tools and training programmes which reduce CO2 and other emissions as a direct consequence of reduced consumption of fossil fuel. We have invested &pound;7 million in FBP and &pound;7.5 million in SAFED since 2003. The latest assessment of the effectiveness of the programmes in 2006 showed them to have saved around 120,000 tonnes of CO2 and 52,000 tonnes of CO2 respectively each year since 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299W.8/2">The Department for Transport funding for these programmes applies to England only. The current FBP programme has the facility to be supported by funding from the Devolved administrations while maintaining a single management process. This is proving attractive and cost-effective for them with Scotland and Northern Ireland currently funding specific programme activities for their areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1307W.2/1">The Department for Transport recently completed research into intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) systems, the main aim of which was to look at the effect on driver behaviour over time. This found that ISA has the potential to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on our roads, suggesting that ISA could be a useful road safety feature for drivers who wish to use it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307W.2/2">The results were published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-15">15 September 2008</phrase> and the final report and an executive summary were placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The report is also available on the internet at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1307W.2/4">Data from this work has subsequently been used by the Commission for Integrated Transport and the Motorists' Forum for independent research looking at speed limit adherence and its effect on road safety and climate change. The Department was represented in an advisory capacity on the working group for this research. We have received a copy of their report which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-30">30 December 2008</phrase>. We are clear that any future use of ISA should be taken forward by the motoring industry in response to consumer demand, just as with other technologies available for consumers to purchase if they so choose. We are working with industry and other stakeholders to facilitate the future availability of the technology.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308W.3/1">The UK has contributed US$35 million to a World Bank led Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (MDRP), which supports the demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants in the greater Great Lakes region of Central Africa . The largest programme of its kind in the world, the MDRP, with a budget of US$500 million, targets an estimated 450,000 ex-combatants in seven countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The programme has already funded the demobilisation and reintegration of more than 100,000 former combatants in DRC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308W.3/2">Of the 100,000 who have benefited from the programme 33,708 were from Mai Mai groups, of which 28,235 were demobilised and the remaining 5,503 were integrated into the army. We do not have a breakdown for South Kivu. One challenge for the MDRP has been the large number of supposed 'combatants' who have tried to enter the programme without a weapon to hand in (a necessary determinant of eligibility). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is currently developing complementary community reintegration programming to target those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the national MDRP programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1311W.6/1">The latest and most comprehensive assessment of global progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including the goal to improve maternal health (MDG 5), is contained in the 2008 United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report. This noted that the maternal health MDG is severely off-track with little progress having been made in saving mothers' lives. The report is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.6/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/The%20Millennium%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202008.pdf">http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/The%20Millennium%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202008.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.6/3">DFID continues to work to accelerate progress to achieving both the targets of MDG 5. In October 2007 DFID announced an additional &pound;100 million over five years to prevent unwanted pregnancies and make childbirth safer. This money is helping the UN Population Fund provide condoms, contraceptive pills and sexual health advice to poor people in South Asia and Africa. In June 2008, the UK Government announced a commitment to spend &pound;6 billion on improving health systems and services over seven years to 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.6/4">Work is currently under way to revise and update DFID's Maternal Health strategy for publication later this year. The strategy will set out what DFID will do to contribute to the achievement of the MDG 5 targets. A stakeholder consultation day was held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-13">13 January 2009</phrase> at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Further consultation is planned in the near future.</p>

This flexibility is used by over three million employees in the UK who choose to work longer hours. Loss of this opt-out would therefore cost the UK billions both in costs to industry and lost earnings. As a result, it could also only have a negative impact on overall employment levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.1340W.5/2">It is not possible to say how many prison places have been taken out of use since 1997 as the total number of prison places fluctuates depending on temporary schemes such as refurbishment and changes in use. Prison places may be permanently taken out of use as a result of prison closures or may be decommissioned due to the unsatisfactory state of the accommodation. Where decommissioned, and as part of our ongoing maintenance programme, many of these have been rebuilt and re-opened as new accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1340W.5/3">There are at present five wings/spurs across the estate that are not fit for purpose and are permanently out of use, with a total of around 350 places. This in is in addition to the total of 540 places taken out of use following the closure of the two prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1340W.5/4">Despite the loss of these places, since 1997 we have overall increased prison capacity and improved the standard of prison accommodation available in both new and existing prisons. We have opened a total of 10 new prisons (see following table):</p>

			<tr pid="b.1352W.2/25"> <td colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i><br/> Includes activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> <i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br/> Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol - that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (I42.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/> <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnoses</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data Quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="b.1354W.2/55"> <td colspan="6"><i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> 2. Small numbers: To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with '*' (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> 3. Alcohol-related admissions: The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br/> 4. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&mdash;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9).<br/> 5. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> 6. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 7. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> 8. Secondary diagnoses: As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> 9. Data Quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1362W.0/1">The Cancer Reform Strategy, published in December 2007, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, said that we wished to reduce the variation of cervical screening coverage between primary care trusts. National health service (NHS) Cancer Screening Programmes have commissioned the Improvement Foundation to work with six primary care trusts with deprived communities to develop and test initiatives to improve uptake. The Improvement Foundation are expected to deliver the outcomes from their work to NHS Cancer Screening Programmes by the end of 2009, and the lessons learned will be shared with strategic health authorities and local screening programmes to develop best practice.</p>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> * Cause Code - Gunshot Wounds</i><br/> The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. HES has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes when referring to gunshot wounds<br/> <i> Gunshot wounds:</i><br/> W32.- Handgun discharge<br/> W33.- Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br/> W34.- Discharge from other and unspecified firearms<br/> X72- Intentional self-harm by handgun discharge<br/> X73- Intentional self-harm by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br/> X74- Intentional self-harm by other and unspecified firearm discharge<br/> X93- Assault by handgun discharge<br/> X94- Assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br/> X95- Assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge<br/> Y22.- Handgun discharge, undetermined intent<br/> Y23.- Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge, undetermined intent<br/> Y24- Other and unspecified firearm discharge, undetermined intent<br/> Y35.0 Legal intervention involving firearm discharge<br/> Y36.4 War operations involving firearm discharge and other forms of conventional warfare.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> PCT/SHA data quality</i><br/> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all<br/> finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

The strategy also makes clear that those with aphasia and related conditions should be involved in the planning of the support services they require.</p>

We expect that PCTs and local authorities will use the funding available to meet these needs in line with local needs and priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1390W.2/5">For all programmes or projects the costs and dates reported relate to the total project or programme and not only the IT element.</p>

	<p pid="b.1390W.2/7">Overall, the Department has a very strong track record in delivering major and complex change involving IT, of which the successful introduction of the employment and support allowance is the most recent example.

	<p pid="b.1406W.5/15">Information on the number and proportion of adults who had moved out of poverty as a result of moving into work is not available. Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue with many different factors acting at the same time in moving individuals into or out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1406W.5/16">The risk of a working age adult who is working being in a low income household in the United Kingdom in 2006-07 is much lower at 7 per cent. (before housing costs) and 11 per cent. (after housing costs), than for workless working age adults, where the equivalent proportions are 38 per cent. (before housing costs) and 48 per cent. (after housing costs) as shown in the aforementioned table. Data from the Low Income Dynamics publication illustrates that an increase in the number of workers or full time workers in a household greatly increases the likelihood of that household moving out of low income. The Low Income Dynamics paper is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1409W.3/2">This is not a practicable proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.3/3">The need for such a transfer mechanism will be very limited under the reformed state pension scheme because the majority of both men and women in the UK&mdash;over 90 per cent. for those reaching state pension age in 2025&mdash;will have entitlement to a full basic state pension and are therefore less likely than under the current scheme to need to access their spouses' contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.3/4">It is not necessarily the case that qualifying years of contributions beyond those required for entitlement to a full basic pension are in effect surplus and not generating pension entitlement. State second pension will accrue on paid Class 1 contributions. Therefore on transferring the contributions from one spouse to another, the spouse donating the contributions would also be forfeiting any state second pension entitlement derived from them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.3/5">Overall the complexity for both customers and staff inherent to such an arrangement could not be justified given the relatively low numbers it could potentially benefit in the future under the reformed scheme.</p>

Warm Front funding has been increased to over &pound;950 million for the three-year period to March 2011, (with &pound;50 million of the existing allocation being spent a year sooner than planned, ensuring that up to 30,000 vulnerable households will have less time to wait for their heating or insulation measures to be fitted).</p>

	<p pid="b.1411W.2/2">People with cancer may also receive financial support through the disability benefits and the disability premiums in the income-related benefits in recognition of the extra costs, including heating, which they may have. These are spread over a 52 week period and can have a substantial annual value, up to around &pound;8,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.1413W.2/1">Our guidance, which applies to all secondary schools including those in BSF, &quot;Building Bulletin 98, The Briefing Framework for Secondary School Projects&quot;, sets out recommendations for a range of options to suit the catering arrangements of the school. All of which is designed to promote healthy eating to children and young people. We do not require that every school have a kitchen on site big enough for all purposes, because it is up to local authorities and schools to decide how best to meet the Government's nutritional standards. The Department's &quot;Inspirational Design for Kitchen Spaces&quot; provides technical guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1413W.2/2">Integration of existing onsite catering services into BSF facilities management contracts is not mandatory. It will vary within each local authority according to the current contractual arrangements for the services and the proposed future model of delivery for BSF. We would of course expect local authorities to make decisions following consultation with schools and based on value for money.</p>

A new long-term child advertising campaign&mdash;Tales of the Road&mdash;has been launched and in order to develop a strategic framework for road safety education, the Department for Transport has commissioned a project, which is now well advanced, to review existing materials and then produce a comprehensive set of road safety educational material.</p>

These requirements are set out in the &quot;Sure Start Children's Centre Planning and Performance Management Guidance&quot;, published in November 2006.

	<p pid="b.1422W.11/1">In 2006, we asked the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) to develop and lead a succession planning strategy. As part of this, NCSL has rolled out the local solutions approach nationally. 148<sup>(1)</sup> local authorities have signed partnership agreements with NCSL to continue to address the succession challenge, which includes a particular focus leadership diversification and the challenges faced by small primaries and faith schools. The local solutions programme is being evaluated externally by Warwick university and is due to report in early 2010. Evidence so far shows that 91 per cent. of LAs are better prepared to tackle succession planning than when they first engaged with the programme in 2007, and that LAs are making progress in supporting schools to better develop and mentor leaders and establish effective leadership cultures. NCSL's internal evaluation indicates that LAs are making good progress in assessing their data and developing, implementing and monitoring their local strategies. The succession planning programme met its 2008-09 targets to stabilise headship vacancies and temporary filled posts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1423W.2/1">The operation of disciplinary procedures, including those that result in suspension, is a matter for local determination. To support schools in this area there are a variety of sources of advice available to help governing bodies with their responsibilities. The DCSF's 'A Guide to the Law for School Governors and Staffing' guidance set out the statutory responsibilities falling to schools and local authorities as employers. This guidance is available through <a href="http://www.governornet.co.uk">www.governornet.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.teachernet.co.uk">www.teachernet.co.uk</a>. These sources also provide access to an extensive range of additional guidance material including materials from the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1423W.2/2">Schools and local authorities are therefore able to draw from a wide variety of guidance when devising their policies and handling disciplinary cases, including suspension.</p>
	<p pid="b.1423W.2/3">In respect of both head teachers and other teaching staff our guidance makes it clear that suspension is a neutral act allowing time to assess the situation before a final decision is taken. It does not imply guilt but provides an opportunity for matters to be investigated; nor does it go into detail about issues such as the length of any suspension. Decisions of this nature are best left to schools to determine, drawing on the guidance that is available and where appropriate on advice and support from local authorities. The only circumstances where the Secretary of State may become involved would be when an individual seeks intervention on the basis that the suspension is taking an unreasonably long time or the governing body appear not to be taking any further action.</p>
	<p pid="b.1423W.2/4">There is no duty on local authorities to report suspensions of headteachers to the Department. Other than the circumstances described above the Secretary of State would not ordinarily become involved in suspensions of head teachers or other senior staff and there are no centrally held records setting out when and to what extent the Secretary of State has been involved. Accordingly the information requested is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1425W.5/1">Consistent financial reporting provides a detailed breakdown of the income and expenditure of each maintained school in England. It was introduced in 2002-03 and has subsequently undergone only minor revisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1425W.5/2">The data underpins the schools financial benchmarking website. The site provides schools with the tools to compare their expenditure with that of similar schools. They can then tailor their spending and re-allocate resources to ensure that education spending reflects local educational policy and priorities and is effective in delivering them. During the 2007/08 academic year the site was accessed by over 10,000 schools and it is also used by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1425W.5/3">There may be occasions where a school might want to contact another about its data, clarify their expenditure and discuss ways to address particular problems. In order to facilitate this, charts are now labelled with school names and their unique seven digit local authority and establishment number. Where names and number labels do not appear, the data has been suppressed in line with data protection rules to ensure that salary information for individuals cannot be identified. School names are only made available for registered users of the website, specifically schools and local authorities. Other users may access benchmarking information under 'guest user' terms but named data will not be visible to further protect the anonymity of individuals and schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1425W.5/4">In October and November 2008 the Department's efficiency and value for money team included CFR and benchmarking presentations in six regional conferences. These conferences were aimed at local authority education finance staff and auditors. Overall, participants were very positive about the effectiveness of the benchmarking website and CFR. They particularly welcomed the ease with which they were able to access information to allow comparison and to identify and flag up important resource trends.</p>

Since then this has risen to some 130 organisations supporting the programme by agreeing to promote teaching as a second career to their staff. In addition to this, many outplacement organisations have recently agreed to promote Transition to Teaching to companies they work with, and many influencing organisations, including the CBI, are supporting the programme. Transition to Teaching consultants are currently supporting 58 individuals at different stages of the process of deciding whether or not to become a teacher. So far five of these have entered teacher training, a further four have been offered teacher training places and most of the rest have applied for a place or intend to do so soon.</p>
