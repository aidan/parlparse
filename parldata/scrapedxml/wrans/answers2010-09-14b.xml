As a result, Heathrow airport is currently preparing a revised plan for further consideration. Once the plan has been formally adopted by Government, it will be published on both DEFRA's and the airport's website by the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.0/2">The Noise Action Plans are required by EC law to cover a five-year period. The scope for the second stage of implementation of EC directive 2002/49 (the environmental noise directive) has yet to be determined.</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.0/3">Major airports in England have been encouraged to include an annual review as part of their plan rather than reviewing the plan after five years. In the case of Heathrow, the airport is also proposing to make the plan subject to independent audit.</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.0/4">Airports were required to produce strategic noise maps covering a range of metrics including Lden. While the directive requires airports to include provisions for evaluating the effect of actions proposed in the plan, there is no specific requirement for an Lden target. However Heathrow, in common with other airports, is understood to be considering the use of annual and forecast noise contours as an evaluation measure.</p>

	<p pid="b.917W.6/1">The Government fully recognise the importance of the need to protect communities affected by aircraft noise. Noise control measures including restrictions on night flights at the three London strategic airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) have been in place for many years. Elsewhere we believe that airports should engage actively with their communities in determining what noise control measures provide the right local solution. This process has recently been strengthened by the requirement for airports to develop and publish noise action plans in consultation with communities living around airports. These plans and the associated consultation process will play a central role in ensuring that airports mitigate against noise at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="b.920W.5/1">The Department for international Development (DFID) is currently developing its plans on how best to tackle malaria mortality in high burden countries. DFID will focus on increasing the use of interventions which work for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and will work to ensure that coverage extends to the most vulnerable, especially through prevention services like insecticide treated bednets.</p>
	<p pid="b.920W.5/2">We want to ensure that our impact is sustainable by strengthening health services and national capacity to deliver malaria interventions. As a component of this health systems strengthening, DFID funding supports the training and deployment of health care workers through our bilateral programmes, direct support to national health plans of partner countries, and our funding to multilateral organisations and global funding instruments such as the World Bank, and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.</p>

	<p pid="b.921W.2/1">At a global level, physical supplies of all the main cereals remain secure. 2010 is likely to produce the world's third largest cereals harvest ever. Food stocks, following two years of excellent harvests, remain high, at around 23% of annual consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.2/2">This summer's drought in Russia and Ukraine has significantly reduced the size of the harvest there, but this is only likely to reduce global wheat production by about 3% compared with earlier forecasts. The international price of wheat has risen steeply since June, reflecting current market concerns about possible shortfalls. Our assessment is that the price should adjust over the autumn as this summer's cereals crop is harvested.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.2/3">We shall continue to monitor the situation carefully, and encourage national governments to liberalise trade in agricultural commodities to enable shortfalls in one region to be balanced by surpluses in others. As part of the G20, we will also discourage governments from imposing export bans and from panic buying, actions which exacerbate price volatility.</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.6/2">The research involving the use of animals is only one small aspect of a much wider research programme and animal studies are only ever undertaken if there is no viable alternative. Dstl Porton Down operates a continuous policy in accordance with the principles of the 3 R's (replacement, reduction and refinement) and has an active programme to increase the implementation of the 3 R's by exploring the use of non-living models in order to reduce the requirement for animal experimentation. Accordingly, tissue and cell cultures, physical or computer-based modelling, are used wherever possible and commensurate with good practice. Dstl continues to actively develop and further investigate the use of non-living models to reduce the requirement for animal studies. However, where these alternatives are considered inadequate as a means of predicting the overall human response, experiments on animals will continue to be necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.924W.0/2">The Ministry of Defence expects to be in a position to place a contract for the first batch of light protected patrol vehicle (LPPV) in the coming weeks. While milestones such as delivery dates will be subject to agreement with the contractor, we expect the first vehicles to be delivered to training in late 2011, with deliveries to operations in 2012. Any further buys of LPPV will be subject to the confirmation of our wider requirement, which is being assessed in the Strategic Defence and Security Review.</p>

	<p pid="b.926W.5/3">In April 2009 the UK joined other Partner Nations in a &quot;standstill&quot; agreement with Airbus Military. This enabled a period of discussions on options and possible outcomes for the A400M programme to take place whilst the rights of all parties under the existing contract were protected. Discussions continued throughout the remainder of 2009 and into 2010, culminating in agreement in principle on the future of the A400M programme being reached in March of this year.</p>

Subject to agreement of the amended contract, the UK off-take will be reduced by no more than three aircraft to a total fleet of 22 A400M. As intensive discussions on the details of the amended contract are ongoing, I am unable to provide any further information at present, save that we expect it to be concluded later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.930W.5/1">The European Habitats Directive places member states under an obligation to ensure that species listed in annex IV to the directive are given strict legal protection and this includes all species of bats. All public bodies are also under a general legal obligation to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive in the exercise of their functions by virtue of regulation 9(1) of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. Measures taken to comply with these obligations can take many forms dependent on the individual circumstances of the case in question, and the extent of any feasible or necessary measures will very much depend on the degree of harm to the species that is foreseen.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.5/2">The UK is a party to the Agreement on the Conservation of European Bats (the Eurobats Agreement) which promotes their protection internationally. In addition the Joint Nature Conservation Committee contributes to the National Bat Monitoring Programme, and Natural England carries out work to protect bats.</p>

The Treasury hosted a Government Economic Service conference in March 2010 to raise awareness among those responsible for policy development and appraisal. All departmental chief economists have been asked to promote the guidance. It has been downloaded over 20,000 times from DEFRA's website since it was put in place in 2009, and 13 Departments reference to it in their Departmental Adaptation Plans. We intend to evaluate the impact of the guidance in the coming year and continue to promote its use.</p>

	<p pid="b.940W.6/14">The response to PQ/10/8648 gave the costs of administering DLA for 2009-10 as &#163;163.4 million-a difference of &#163;30 million compared to the figure in the table above. That answer was taken from the DWP Activity Based Management System which does not provide information for previous years. This answer estimates the DLA share of the total PDCS agency from financial data included in the annual report and accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.6/15">The accounts use a method of allocating overhead costs controlled outside the agency different to the Activity Based Management System. It is the method of apportioning those indirect overheads that lies behind the different numbers, rather than a change in the estimated costs incurred in the agency of administering DLA.</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.6/16">The overheads which are excluded in the costs quoted in the answer to PQ/10/8648, and included in this answer in the table above, relate to information technology and cost of capital. In the management information used to answer PQ/10/8648, they were not attributed to the cost of delivering DLA; whereas they were included in the audited accounts. They account for about 90% of the difference. The remaining 10% of the difference relates to timing issues-the data in the financial systems used for the published accounts included the effect of accounting adjustments not included in the management information underpinning the answer to PQ/10/8648.</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.6/17">Steps are now being taken to ensure complete consistency between the internal management information and the financial information in published agency accounts.</p>

	<p pid="b.947W.9/13">This information is from the Annual Population Survey, which covers the period January to December of each year, with 2009 being the most recent estimate available. The Annual Population Survey is the only available source of data with a sample large enough to provide local authority estimates of the number of young people up to the age of 24 who are NEET, However, the sample is not large enough to provide estimates for smaller geographies, such as parliamentary constituencies, or to provide local authority estimates for age ranges narrower than 16 to 24.</p>
	<p pid="b.947W.9/14">It is important to note that these estimates are subject to large sampling variability and should therefore be treated with caution and viewed in conjunction with their confidence intervals, which indicate how accurate an estimate is. For example, a confidence interval of +/-6.6 percentage points means that the true value is between 6.6pp above the estimate and 6.6pp below the estimate.</p>
	<p pid="b.947W.9/15">Quarterly estimates of the number of people aged 16 to 24 not in education, employment or training (NEET) derived from the Labour Force Survey are published by the Department for Education. The latest publication can be found online at:</p>
	<p pid="b.947W.9/16" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/STR/d000950/index.shtml">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/STR/d000950/index.shtml</a></p>
	<p pid="b.947W.9/17">This includes supplementary tables giving breakdowns of 18 to 24-year-olds NEET for each region.</p>
	<p pid="b.947W.9/18">Addressing the problem of young people who are not in education, employment and training is one of our key priorities. A lack of skills can be a barrier to gaining employment for some unemployed young people. Young people who are NEET are entitled to face to face support from the adult careers service, Next Step, and can expect to be referred to an adviser early on after claiming out-of-work benefits. A range of training options is already available and we are starting to give colleges and other providers more freedom to develop training programmes which reflect the needs of young people in their areas. For those young people who stay NEET and are claiming benefits for six months or more, the Work Programme will provide a tailored package of support to get people into work.</p>

This glide path is designed to minimise the impact of the lost revenue on operators and will also help to ensure that operators do not look to recoup the cost of lower termination rates from their customers as they might with a steeper glide path.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.5/14">Ofcom are considering submissions received from consumers, consumer groups and operators and they expect to announce the results of this consultation early in 2011.

The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains. The ODA is unable to release the value of individual contracts at this time as this is commercially sensitive information. These figures represent the committed spend to date, rather than the end contract value, as in many cases this will not yet be known.</p>

These gas lamps are used throughout London's Royal Parks.</p>
	<p pid="b.953W.2/3">The recent gas smell has been investigated and the lantern is now isolated awaiting repair. In the meantime a pressure drop test on the gas supply pipework has revealed no leaks.</p>

Surveys carried out by accredited ecologists usually cost between &#163;1,000 and &#163;2,000. Cleaning where colonies of bats exist is a major outlay for any parish church, an example of this is St Andrew's Church in Holme Hale, Norfolk, one of the worst effected in the country, in the last year this church has paid &#163;2,600 in cleaning costs to clear up after its resident bats.</p>

The Church Buildings Council is working closely with Natural England and DEFRA to try and find ways of mitigating the burden to churches within the law, and is currently conducting a pilot project in Norfolk to explore ways of encouraging the bats to find alternative accommodation by for example the use of bat boxes outside on the eaves. The results of the pilot will be reported at a conservation conference to be held at Lambeth Palace in November. Norfolk has the highest number of medieval churches in Europe. In many instances bats and congregations can co-exist quite happily. The problems and costs escalate where the bats occupy churches in large numbers. I undertake the hon.

The consultation in autumn 2010 on electricity market reform will consider how an EPS would be introduced alongside wider reform of the electricity market. An EPS may interact with many of the other policy instruments being considered. With significant challenges ahead for the energy sector and a need for substantial new investment in order to deliver secure, affordable and low carbon energy, it will be critical that all action taken over the next decade and beyond is closely aligned, and that the impacts an EPS may have on the market alongside other mechanisms are properly understood.</p>

This is for a number of reasons including the way in which it has been implemented, which is why I have asked Hayes McKenzie to carry out new analysis of this particular issue. In the light of such concerns presented to them, planning inspectors have reflected these comments.

	<p pid="b.960W.9/1">There are currently no plans to introduce a proximity rule. The assessment of an application to develop a wind farm already includes, among other things, an analysis of visual and landscape impacts to ascertain whether the location and height of the wind farm is acceptable. The Government consider that these impacts are best assessed on a case by case basis so that local factors can be taken fully into account, regardless of whether applications are dealt with at national or local level. Where applications are dealt with at local level, we believe that councils should have the opportunity to decide these matters on behalf of their local community.</p>

There can be no negotiations on sovereignty unless and until the islanders so wish. The UN continues to recognise UK administration of the Falkland Islands.</p>

	<p pid="b.975W.0/2">June's Budget announced a series of measures aimed at helping small businesses including:</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.0/3" class="indent">A &#163;200 million extension to the Enterprise Finance Guarantee. In total, the EFG will now support up to &#163;700 million in bank lending to viable small businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.975W.0/5" class="indent">Confirmation of a Growth Capital Fund, to provide funding of between &#163;2 million and &#163;10 million for SMEs with strong growth potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.0/6">We are committed to introducing a &quot;one-in one-out&quot; rule for new regulations, sunset clauses, and an immediate review of all inherited regulation in the pipeline. We will also make it easier for small businesses to bid for public sector contracts, with an aspiration that 25% of all government procurement should be from SMEs.</p>

The public cost of delivering an apprenticeship varies significantly depending on the industry; length of the programme; whether the framework is at level 2 or 3; and the apprentice's age.

These talks form part of the UK-Algeria Ministerial Dialogue Forum which started in 2006.

To ask the Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, whether the Skills Funding Agency awards monies in respect of contracts with a monetary value of &#163;250,000 or less.</p>
	<p pid="b.980W.6/4" class="indent">The Skills Funding Agency does currently have contracts for less than &#163;250,000. However, the Skills Funding Agency has previously set out (in Guidance Notes 2,3,4 and 5) its intention to introduction a minimum contract level to achieve efficiencies through rationalising the number of direct contracts it manages.</p>
	<p pid="b.980W.6/5" class="indent">The Agency's initial plans were to introduce a minimum contract level of &#163;250,000 by the end of the 2010/11 academic year to those organisations that only deliver Train to Gain. However, following the decision to introduce a single budget, it is no longer appropriate to implement the minimum level in this way.</p>
	<p pid="b.980W.6/6" class="indent">The threshold and application of the minimum contract level is therefore being considered as part of the funding consultation launched on 22nd July &quot;A Simplified Further Education and Skills Funding System and Methodology&quot;. The level will be announced in the autumn following the consultation and is likely to be higher than the &#163;250,000 originally planned for those only delivering Train to Gain.</p>
	<p pid="b.980W.6/7" class="indent">It is expected that the Agency will cease to issue direct contracts to organisations for less than the minimum contract level for 2011/12 (subject to any exceptions agreed following the consultation).</p>

Due to the small sample size of the APS at constituency level it is not possible to provide reliable estimates for Peterborough constituency.

	<p pid="b.999W.3/5" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the APS are subject to a margin of uncertainty as different samples give different results.

The tables will also be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.3/11" class="indent">The National Statistics definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. It includes all deaths from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (excluding biliary cirrhosis), even when alcohol is not specifically mentioned on the death certificate. Apart from deaths due to alcohol poisoning, the definition does not include deaths from external causes, for example, accidents where drinking might have been a contributory factor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.3/12" class="indent">It is not possible to provide figures for deaths involving drowning (c) or asphyxiation (e) where alcohol consumption was a causal factor since internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to the death to be recorded on the death certificate. Doctors and coroners are not required to record whether or not the deceased had consumed alcohol.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001W.5/2">The survey of psychiatric morbidity among adults in private households in Great Britain was first carried out in 1993 with a second survey conducted in 2000. In 2007, The NHS Information Centre commissioned the National Centre for Social Research to carry out a third adult psychiatric morbidity survey covering adults living in private households in England. The survey assessed alcohol dependence from answers to a different self-completion questionnaire which consisted of 20 questions focusing on the three components of dependence: loss of control, symptomatic behaviour and binge drinking.</p>

Consortia will have the freedom to decide which aspects of commissioning activity they undertake fully themselves and which aspects require collaboration across several consortia, for example where proposed reconfigurations cross consortia boundaries. As existing consortia structures vary across the country, and until GP commissioning arrangements are fully established, primary care trusts will have an important role in supporting practices to prepare for these new arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1012W.5/1">Motor neurone disease is a long-term neurological condition; the national service framework for long-term neurological conditions (NSF) was developed to address long-standing issues in neurological care, e.g. inequity in access to services; work force shortages and variable quality of care across the country. The NSF's quality requirements include a separate section on addressing the needs of people with rapidly progressing conditions, such as motor neurone disease, where services need to respond quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.5/2">We have no plans to introduce a national strategy for motor neurone disease.</p>

	<p pid="b.1012W.8/1">It is the responsibility of local health and social care bodies to ensure that they commission services to meet the needs of those living with multiple sclerosis (MS) and ensure that they are enabled to continue working as long as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/2">In the future, outcomes, which the national health service and social care will be expected to achieve, will be set via the NHS Outcomes Framework and its social care equivalents. We will not tell the NHS how to achieve these outcomes but will hold the NHS Commissioning Board to account for delivery through the framework. Similarly, we will not direct local government how to achieve social care outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/3">The NHS Framework, which is currently out for consultation, contains domains specifically relevant to long-term neurological conditions such as MS:</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/4" class="indent">patient reported outcome measures for specific long-term conditions; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/5" class="indent">proposed indicators for emergency hospital admissions for both acute and chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/6">Officials are working with the Neurological Alliance to ensure that these outcomes are relevant to those living with long-term neurological conditions. We will set out, for consultation, an outcomes framework for social care later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/7">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has published a guideline on the management of multiple sclerosis in primary and secondary care in the NHS. It offers best practice advice on the diagnosis and care of patients with MS, focusing on the quality and configuration of services for patients and their carers, emphasising the need for flexible services to address the whole range of patient needs across primary, secondary, tertiary and social care. The guideline offers advice on rehabilitation services specifically designed to allow those living with multiple sclerosis to remain active and in work as long as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/8">The White Paper 'Equity and Excellence liberating the NHS' proposes that NICE will take the responsibility for devising quality standards that cover both health and social care. This will support commissioning collaboration to ensure a more personalised and integrated approach to health and care.</p>

The monthly work force data is not directly comparable with the annual work force census; it only includes those staff on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) (i.e. it does not include Bank staff). There are also new methods of presenting data (headcount methodology is different and there is now a role count).

Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.<br/> <i> Note:</i><br/> Maternity Support staff are: Nursery nurses, Nursing Assistant/auxiliary's, Health Care Assistants and Support Workers in the Maternity Services area of work.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Provisional Monthly NHS Hospital and Community Health Service Workforce Statistics</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1023W.5/1">This information is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.5/2">There is no standard template for funding because these partnerships have grown up over the years to reflect the public health priorities in the particular areas which they serve. Smoking is a major cause of early death and disease and we will make clear our priorities in this area in the Public Health White Paper later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.5/3">Smokefree partnerships vary in composition but they have in common close cooperation at the local and regional levels between national health service, local government, other Government Departments such as HM Revenue and Customs, voluntary sector groups and private sector organisations with an interest in tackling smoking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.5/4">They have developed as a result of local initiatives to prioritise activity on smoking in those regions which have the highest prevalence and the greatest health burden resulting from smoking. They originally grew out of initiatives in the early 1990's when the White Paper The health of the nation published in July 1992 encouraged activity at this level. They have evolved into their existing form during the last ten years. The smokefree partnership in the south west has only been operating for the last two years and has the highest level of funding from its agreement with the primary care trusts (PCTs) in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.5/5">Levels of funding and sources of funding for the partnerships has changed over the years. There have been some years especially between 2004 and 2009 when central funding was made available. In those regions with smokefree partnerships this central funding would have been added to the funds raised locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.5/6">Those regions which do not have a smokefree partnership have in recent years been more heavily dependent on central funding and on the activities of the Regional Tobacco Policy Manager. With the changes brought about in response to the current financial situation some regions have dispensed with their Regional Tobacco Policy Managers. The levels of activity on smoking issues therefore varies considerably.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.5/7">The regions with smokefree partnerships are currently principally funded from agreements developed with PCTs. Changes in the NHS (as set out in the recently published NHS White Paper) and the ending of PCTs will result in further changes in the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.5/8">The publication of the Public Health White Paper later this year and the development of the Public Health Service in line with the Government's new priorities will also impact on the smokefree partnerships, their future work and funding. Whether previous funding arrangements remain appropriate for the future is an issue, which will have to be considered in due course both at national level and by their funders at local and regional level.</p>
