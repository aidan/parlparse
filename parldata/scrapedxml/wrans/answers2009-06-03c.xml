	<p pid="c.479W.2/1">Animals and animal products are imported from EU member states and from third countries approved as having equivalent animal health status to an EU member state for the species in question. Strict EU rules are imposed to prevent disease entering the European Community.</p>
	<p pid="c.479W.2/2">As soon as an animal is captured and transported it becomes a 'kept animal' and therefore animal health import legislation applies. This includes ensuring a veterinary health check is undertaken within the 24-hour period prior to loading at the country of origin in order to determine that no clinical signs of disease are present&mdash;the cost is met by the importer. An animal cannot travel to this country unless accompanied by a valid veterinary health certificate. Live animals imported from approved third countries must enter at a designated Border Inspection Post (BIP) where they are again subject to veterinary inspections for clinical signs of disease and the accompanying health certificates are verified. However, Animal Health does not keep a record of the individual costs for imported animals tested as part of its disease prevention measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.479W.2/3">When there is a significant increase in disease risk, DEFRA's Global Animal Health Division will act quickly to mitigate it, usually in concert with the EU. DEFRA may take unilateral safeguard measures to block legal imports from countries or regions with outbreaks of disease. Recent imports of animals which might present a risk would also be traced and checked.</p>
	<p pid="c.479W.2/4">DEFRA also carries out international disease surveillance work and takes emergency safeguard action to restrict or ban imports from countries that have reported an outbreak of disease.</p>

Following consideration by the Agency of the responses to that consultation, the terms of the protocol were expanded to cover &quot;the production and use of biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil and rendered animal fat&quot;. On this basis, a post-consultation draft of the protocol was notified to the European Commission under the Technical Standards Directive (98/34/EC). The notification period required under the directive has now ended and the Agency proposes to publish the final protocol in the next few weeks, and to review the published protocol in June 2011.

	<p pid="c.481W.0/2">DEFRA funds a surveillance programme for swine influenza in England and Wales. This is delivered by Veterinary Laboratories Agency and has been in operation since 1991. Private veterinary practitioners can submit samples for swine influenza testing in cases where this disease is suspected. This testing is performed free of charge. Under this programme, samples are tested from pig herds from various types of production system. If virus is isolated from a sample, further genetic analysis is performed to determine if there is any evidence that the virus may be genetically different from commonly seen swine influenza viruses in the UK. In addition, a random subset of influenza viruses is subjected to further genetic analysis. The aim of the programme is to identify any unusual changes in swine influenza viruses and to monitor the natural evolution of the virus over time.</p>

	<p pid="c.482W.8/1">No assessment of the financial and other effects on zoos of banning the feeding of necrophagous birds with category 1 material has been made. The EU Animal by-products regulation 1774/2002/EC only permits the feeding of category 1 material to endangered or protected species of necrophagous birds and other species living in their natural habitat, for the promotion of biodiversity. However, it does permit member states to authorise the feeding of animal by-products which do not contain specified risk material and other category 1 animal by-products to birds of prey and other carnivorous animals in zoos. The UK exercises this derogation.</p>
	<p pid="c.482W.8/2">The European Council and Parliament are likely to shortly agree amendments to the regulation which, among other things, would allow member states to permit feeding of certain category 1 material to necrophagous birds and other carnivorous animals in zoos. The UK would be looking to take advantage of such a provision and understands that after the amended regulation is agreed, work will commence on laying down implementing rules in Brussels which would permit such feeding while ensuring protection of animal and public health.</p>
	<p pid="c.482W.8/3">A derogation to permit the feeding of fallen stock to necrophagous birds is available to Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal and France as part of approved conservation measures for vultures. This derogation is not available in the UK. We understand that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is content with the existing arrangement of the feeding of category 2 and 3 material (ie butchers' waste) to wild necrophagous birds and that a derogation to permit the use of ruminant fallen stock as feed material is not, therefore, necessary.</p>

	<p pid="c.483W.3/3">In line with international protocols, and the UK's international commitments in this respect, a relatively small number of individuals in recognised positions are exempt from these screening procedures.

	<p pid="c.484W.2/2">Regulation (EC) 80/2009 results from a Commission proposal to simplify and update the Code to safeguard its key principles while increasing its relevance to today's market conditions. The Commission conducted a public consultation and an impact assessment when it proposed the legislation in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.484W.2/3">Regulation (EC) 80/2009 as adopted should enhance the ability of airlines and Computerised Reservation Systems (CRS) to negotiate competitive deals and bring reductions in booking costs or increased travel options which benefit the consumer. The Government considered that full deregulation was not yet appropriate and that safeguards should remain in place to guard against discriminatory behaviour, especially in view of the continued existence of some ownership links between airlines and some CRS.</p>

	<p pid="c.488W.12/1">The South West Regional Development Agency's activity to support SMEs during the recession involves two key strands:</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/2" class="italic"> 1. Strategic Leadership</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/3">The South West RDA is an integral part of the South West Regional Economic Task Group (RETG), chaired by the Regional Minister for the South West, which is responsible for co-ordinating the region's overall response to the recession. It leads on work strands focusing on business support, skills and employment, and green economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/4">In December 2008 the RDA established a Regional Business Forum to enable regular dialogue with key business representative organisations in the region. It acts as a sounding board for new plans and initiatives and provides business a voice to help shape policy development.</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/5">Through its management of South West EU programmes, the RDA is ensuring that over &pound;1 billion of EU and domestic investment from 2007 to 2013 is being targeted at improving the productivity of small and medium-sized businesses in the South West.</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/6" class="italic"> 2. Support for Business</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/7">The RDA has been working to enhance the support already available through the Government's Solutions For Business services provided via the Business Link network. Since October 2008, Business Link has provided over 4,350 free Business Health Checks to local SMEs, and developed a Business Survival Guide to help small businesses cope with the downturn and prepare for recovery.</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-14">14 April</phrase> the RDA launched its &pound;10 million business loan fund which offers viable businesses with growth potential loans of up to &pound;250,000. This augments the financial support available through the Government's Real Help for Business support package launched earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/9">The RDA organised eight workshops in April and May which provided 500 businesses in the region with advice, guidance and networking opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.488W.12/10">In November 2008 the RDA established eight Area Action Forces across the region to co-ordinate the public sector response to individual businesses in difficulty.</p>

	<p pid="c.506W.0/1">Data from the 2006 Health Survey for England suggest the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in England was 6.5 per cent. in men and 4.0 per cent. in women. Prevalence rates increase with age, with more than one in three men and around one in four women aged 75 and over living with CHD.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/2">Overall we estimate that there are just over 1.1 million men living in the United Kingdom who have had angina and around 970,000 who have had a heart attack and around 850,000 women who have had angina and around 439,000 who have had a heart attack. Combined, these estimates suggest that 2.1 million men and 1.3 million women, around 3.4 million adults, in the UK reporting angina and/or a heart attack. This is likely to be an overestimate as those suffering from angina are not an independent group to those suffering from a heart attack.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/3">Comparable data on prevalence of the cardiovascular diseases are difficult to access. At present there is no routinely updated source of Europe-wide data.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/4">With regards to plans for tackling heart disease, the Department is commissioning an external review of the implementation and delivery of the Coronary Heart Disease National Service Framework. We are also undertaking an analysis of the trends in the burden of cardiac disease including patient expectations and needs, technology and working practices and how these are likely to affect future demand and patterns of service provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/5">We understand that a report on Access to Cardiac Care in the UK commissioned by the Cardio and Vascular Coalition, the British Heart Foundation and the British Cardiovascular Society was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-02">2 June 2009</phrase>, which includes some comparison with other European countries. This will be a helpful contribution to our work on future needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/6">The Department contributed information to the Euro Consumer Heart Index in 2008, which provides comparisons between European countries across a number of indicators including access to treatment, prevention, national guidelines and outcomes. In this index, the UK ranked 9 out of 29 European countries. No separate score was available for England.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/7">The number of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not accurately known, because a lack of symptoms in the early stages means it often remains undiagnosed. However, a survey of blood samples in South East England in 2000-01 indicated the prevalence of CKD to be 5,554 per million population. Also the introduction of CKD into the Quality and Outcomes Framework has determined that there are 1.5 million people with CKD stages 3-5 (5 being established as renal failure).</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/8">Part 1 of the National Service Framework for Renal Services, published in January 2004, sets five standards and identifies 30 markers of good practice in the areas of dialysis and transplantation, aimed at improving fairness of access, patient choice about the type of treatment they receive and reducing variation in the quality of dialysis and kidney transplant services. These standards and markers of good practice will help the national health service and its partners to manage the increasing demand for renal services.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/9">Future plans for renal services are to identify people at risk of kidney disease in a timely manner to optimise care, ensure kidney patients receive high quality care and to offer patients a choice of all forms of replacement therapy.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/10">Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in England, with over 110,000 strokes happening every year.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/11">The National Stroke Strategy for England (December 2007) sets 20 'quality markers' which outline the features of a good service in the assessment and treatment of strokes, and those support services needed for stroke survivors to return to as full as possible a life in their community.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.0/12">The National Stroke Strategy was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase> following extensive consultation. It provides a 10-year framework setting out key elements of an improved stroke service. At the launch of the strategy, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) announced &pound;105 million of central funding over three years would be spent to support implementation.</p>

	<p pid="c.507W.2/1">The Government have made tackling health inequalities a top priority, and have set a challenging target to reduce inequalities in infant mortality and life expectancy. The most comprehensive programme ever in this country is in place to address them. This draws on a wide range of data and analysis, some carried out within the Department and the national health service and some carried out by academic units.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/2">Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for about a third of the gap in life expectancy and a range of programmes are reducing deaths and closing the inequalities gap.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/3">In 1999 a target to reduce the mortality rate from CVD (coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and related diseases) by at least 40 per cent. in people under 75 by 2010 was established. This has been the subject of annual monitoring. Data from 2004-06 indicate that this target was met five years early and the mortality rate has now fallen by 44 per cent. when compared to the 1995-97 baseline. The gap in death rates from CVD between the most health-deprived areas and the national average has narrowed by 36 per cent. over the same period, and we are on track to deliver the 2010 target of at least a 40 per cent. reduction in the gap.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/4">With regard to cardiac disease, a major assessment of the burden of CHD informed the development of the Coronary Heart Disease National Service Framework (CHD NSF) published in March 2000. The findings of this assessment are included in the first chapter of the NSF 'Modern Standards and Service Models'. A copy has already been placed in the Library and is available online at:</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094275">www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094275</a></p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/6">A key project to address the inequalities recognised in the NSF has been a major investment programme of &pound;735 million in facilities and equipment aimed at improving and increasing access for appropriate cardiac interventions. Full details are available in the 2007 CHD NSF progress report, 'Building for the Future'. A copy has been placed in the Library and is available online at:</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_083060">www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_083060</a></p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/8">Progress on the standards in the CHD NSF has been monitored annually including the impact on inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/9">The Department developed a National Service Framework for Diabetes in 2003 and a National Service Framework for Renal Services in 2004. In 2007, the National Stroke Strategy was published. The implementation plans for all three include a strong focus on tackling inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/10">A range of other initiatives to tackle inequalities is being taken forward. For example, the Department has commissioned the Improvement Foundation to work in the 20 areas with the worst health status to improve the identification and treatment of people at risk of cardiovascular disease:</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/11" class="indent"><a href="http://www.improvementfoundation.org/theme/reducing-health-inequalities">www.improvementfoundation.org/theme/reducing-health-inequalities</a></p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/12">In addition to this the primary care trusts (PCTs) in the most deprived areas are working with the National Health Inequalities Support Team. Using the Health Inequalities Intervention Tool they are being supported in priority setting (including prioritising vascular conditions), planning and commissioning of services.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/13">On the prevention front, from April 2009, the NHS has been asked to start implementing a systematic and integrated vascular risk assessment and management programme&mdash;the NHS Health Check programme. This will provide a mechanism to identify earlier people who are at risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease and support them to reduce their risk through the provision of lifestyle advice and interventions, and preventative medication, for example statins. Before the implementation of this programme, the Department undertook an Equality Impact Assessment. This assessment used existing evidence that gave details of inequalities in the prevalence of vascular disease of both genders, people of transgender, by age, sexual orientation, geographical regions, socio-economic groups, ethnic groups and disability. The programme has significant potential to narrow inequalities and many PCTs are using it as a major tool in tackling health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/14">The Department is also funding a number of third sector projects to deliver work focused on particular minority communities. These include nine stroke projects including the Stroke Association's 'Blood Pressure Awareness&mdash;African Caribbean and South Asian Communities', Connect's 'Provision of training and support for people with Aphasia' and the Afiya Trust's 'Stroke Awareness for Black and Minority Ethnic Communities'. For renal services, the Department is funding a project managed by the Black Organ Donor Association that will promote awareness of the need for organ donation in black and minority ethnic communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/15">With regard to longer term plans, the Department is commissioning an external review of the implementation and delivery of the CHD NSF. In addition to this, we will undertake an analysis of the trends in the burden of cardiac disease and look at how patient expectation and need, technology and working practices are likely to affect future demand and patterns of service provision. We will also continue to develop our cross-vascular work programme. We will feed our findings to the Department's National Quality Board, which has been set up to oversee the priorities for the service in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.509W.9/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April 2009</phrase> the size of the Afghan National Police (ANP) was estimated to be 81,584. The authorised strength (tashkil) of the ANP is 86,800. This includes an increase of 4,800 to bolster security in Kabul in the lead-up to the August elections. The ANP includes the Afghan Uniformed Police (AUP), Border Police (ABP) and Civil Order Police (ANCOP). The capability of the ANP varies across the forces and continues to suffer from major problems including low levels of literacy and high levels of corruption.</p>
	<p pid="c.509W.9/2">The AUP provides basic security and policing and is currently receiving US-led training under the Focused District Development Programme. ANCOP plays a niche but vital role in the counter-insurgency campaign and regularly supports the Afghan national army on operations. It also backfills the AUP during its participation in training. It is judged to be a more effective force compared with the other elements of the ANP. The Afghan Border Police needs more development although it has made some progress in policing Afghanistan's airports, following training.</p>

	<p pid="c.515W.6/1">There are two types of smuggling into Gaza. The majority of smuggling is for commercial goods, including fuel. We believe that this continues to be a major part of the Gazan economy, primarily because of the continuing Israeli restrictions at the commercial crossings into the strip. The UK continues to call on the Israeli Government to reduce restrictions at the Gaza crossings on trade goods, reconstruction materials, and aid, as well as flows of people. The second type of smuggling is arms smuggling. We believe that recent actions have disrupted this to some extent but that it does continue. UK officials will attend a meeting in Ottawa in June 2009 (following earlier meetings in Copenhagen and London) to address further measures to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza.</p>

We endorse the EU's call for an independent inquiry into alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and for those accountable to be brought to justice. We believe this could play an important role in the post-conflict reconciliation process. I refer the right hon.

They met representatives of the regional government, Lhasa Municipal government, the Regional People's Congress, and representatives of non-governmental organisations working there. They were also able to observe daily life and visit a monastery to assess the situation there. I intend to visit Tibet shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.526W.6/1">The UK welcomes this framework decision, since it will ensure that there is consistency and clarity throughout Europe regarding the circumstances in which a European arrest warrant should be executed, where the person has been tried in their absence. It will not require us to change our law regarding when a trial may proceed in a person's absence. In operational terms, when it has come into force we will need to ensure that our authorities are using the revised European arrest warrant form. This will be picked up in the implementation phase of the framework decision when this Department will work alongside colleagues in the Home Office and others, including the judiciary and devolved Administrations on detailed aspects of implementation.</p>

We have not reduced the family legal aid budget. The consultation document, 'Family Legal Aid Funding from 2010', published by my Department and the Legal Services Commission, set out proposals aimed at maintaining legal aid expenditure at 2007-08 levels. The LSC and MOJ have discussed these proposals with a wide range of stakeholders, including the Local Government Association. The LSC has also received responses from a number of councils, which are being considered along with all the other responses received.

	<p pid="c.529W.8/1">The National Offender Management Service, (NOMS), has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of Prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures, a prisoner-focused care planning system for those at risk, which has helped prisons manage self-harm. Most self-harm is not directly life-threatening, but nevertheless can be extremely distressing for those who have to deal with it. There are no easy answers to preventing self-harming behaviour but we remain committed to finding ways to manage it.</p>

	<p pid="c.532W.2/1">Figures for Reading, East constituency are not available. However, the tables show the number of mortgage and landlord possession orders made in Reading county court for each month from 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.532W.2/2">These figures do not indicate how many homes have actually been repossessed. Repossessions can occur without a court order being made while not all court orders result in repossession.</p>
	<p pid="c.532W.2/3">The civil procedure rules state that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, geographical boundaries of county courts may not necessarily be consistent with other administrative or constituency boundaries. Repossession orders made at Reading county court may therefore relate to properties in other constituencies besides Reading, East constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.532W.2/4">The Ministry of Justice has published a consultation note on proposed changes in the National Statistics on mortgage and landlord possession actions in the county courts of England and Wales. One of the proposed changes is to publish these statistics by local authority area, based on the physical locations of the properties which are the subject of the possession actions, as part of the regular statistical publication from 2009 quarter 2.</p>

	<p pid="c.534W.2/1">A persistent young offender (PYO) is a young person aged 10 to 17 who has been sentenced guilty by any criminal court in the UK on three or more separate occasions for one or more recordable offence, and within three years of the last sentencing occasion is subsequently arrested or has an information laid against them for a further recordable offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/2">This definition is designed to measure the speed and efficiency of the youth justice system, through monitoring the pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for dealing with PYOs in England and Wales from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days. However, the definition is not designed to provide a reliable measure of the level of youth offending over time, and it will give a misleading picture of the true trend if used for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/3">The above pledge was first met over a full calendar year in 2002 and has been met in all but one calendar year since then. Youth sentencing is therefore now more timely, and for repeat offenders more frequent, than it used to be prior to 1997. As the PYO definition relies on repeat sentencing occasions, a side-effect of the Government's success in bringing much swifter justice to young repeat offenders is that more of them end up being defined as PYOs.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/4">The table shows the number of individual PYOs sentenced in 2008, for each police force area.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-10">10 December 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-12-10.58"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 58-59WS</phrase>, I announced in a written ministerial statement that the PYO pledge would be dropped with effect from the end of 2008. This is therefore the last year for which PYO statistics will be published and compiled.</p>

	<p pid="c.535W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="c.535W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many child maintenance cases are currently unable to be processed due to technical faults with the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission's computer systems; how many cases have been so affected in each of the last five years; and what the (a) longest and (b) average delay in processing claims due to computer system failures was in (i) North West Cambridgeshire (ii) Cambridgeshire (iii) the East of England and (iv) North West England and Wales in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.535W.3/5" class="indent">Technical faults with the Child Support Agency's computer systems result in cases being progressed clerically rather than not being processed. The Commission routinely publishes information on the number of cases which are processed clerically. This information is not available at regional level, and the latest national figures are available in Table 20 of the Child Support Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics; a copy of which is available in the House of Commons library, or online at:</p>

Although the need to progress such claims clerically is not ideal, around &pound;1 million in child maintenance is now collected each week for these cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.535W.3/8" class="indent">The growth in the number of cases progressed clerically in the last six months is primarily a result of an upgrade to the Agency's computer system in September 2008 which allowed the Agency to identify cases previously stuck and take action to progress them clerically. Information about any delays in processing individual claims clerically due to technical or other problems with the computer system is not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.536W.0/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.0/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.0/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how much was owed in arrears of child maintenance payments in each quarter of each of the last two years; what recent progress has been made towards the payment of such arrears; what priority the payment of such arrears has in the work programme of the Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission; whether such targets have been set for the reductions of levels of such arrears; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.0/6" class="indent">Information on the amount of child maintenance arrears owed by non-resident parents is routinely published in both the Child Support Agency Annual Report and Accounts and the Quarterly Summary of Statistics, both of which provide the latest audited estimate of child maintenance arrears to the end of March 2008. This information by quarter is set out in the attached table. The Commission's latest estimate on the amount of child maintenance arrears owed by non-resident parents in each quarter of the last year to March 2009 is also set out in the attached table. The table also includes the amount of child maintenance collected and arranged for each quarter from March 07 to March 09. This estimate is based on the Commission's internal analysis and is subject to year end audit. The fully audited estimate will be published in the Child Support Agency Annual Report and Accounts 2009, currently expected to be published in July.</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.0/7" class="indent">Collection of maintenance including arrears remains a priority for the Child Support Agency and its targets for the current year include the collection of &pound;1135 million of which &pound;170 million should be arrears. It is the total collected, rather than the separate amounts of current maintenance and arrears which affects movements in the total arrears outstanding, and there is no separate target to reduce the total. The Child Support Agency has made significant progress in the amount of maintenance collected over the period of its Operational Improvement Plan and as a result the rate at which arrears has grown has slowed dramatically from &pound;23 million per month in 2004/5 to less than &pound;2 million per month in per month in 2008/9 (based on un-audited figures).</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.0/8" class="indent">However the current amount of arrears owed by non-resident parents is the cumulative total of sixteen years of maintenance owed and new arrears will continue to accrue as it is not possible to achieve total compliance.</p>

	<p pid="c.540W.0/1">Government policies and programmes affect the lives of millions of people and in order for them to work they must be communicated effectively.

	<p pid="c.540W.0/2">Much Government advertising aims to alert people to things that can save lives&mdash;and we make no apologies for campaigns like this&mdash;such as wearing seat belts, not drinking and driving, quitting smoking and what to do in an emergency.

	<p pid="c.546W.5/2">Differences have existed in relation to dependency increases of benefit since the inception of the Social Security scheme in 1948, mainly because women were not regarded in general as having to support their husbands who would tend to have their own personal access to national insurance benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.5/3">The Pensions Act 2007 abolished these outdated dependency rules for state pensions and from April 2010 no further increases will be awarded with the state pension. By April 2020 any remaining adult dependency payments paid with a state pension will cease completely.</p>

	<p pid="c.550W.9/1">We take our responsibilities for those who are medically discharged from the armed forces seriously. For those requiring assistance, MOD provides health care and welfare support in service, but at service termination the primary responsibility passes to the normal civilian agencies. The Department's Veterans Welfare Service is there to provide advice on issues such as entitlement to pensions and compensation under the Department's no-fault schemes. In the case of the severely injured, the welfare service monitors those discharged for a period of at least two years to provide advice should difficulties arises.</p>
	<p pid="c.550W.9/2">Working together with civilian and third sector agencies, our aim is to achieve a smooth and seamless transition. Those invalided from service are eligible for the MOD's full resettlement package, including support into work where this is appropriate, and automatic configuration of pension. Where the invaliding disorder is due to service, no fault compensation benefits will be assessed and paid, and for the relevant condition the individual will be eligible for NHS priority treatment with additional benefits such as free prescriptions.</p>
	<p pid="c.550W.9/3">In July 2008 we published the Service Personnel Command Paper, 'The Nation's Commitment: Cross-Government Support for our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans', which outlined the pledges we made to ensure service personnel, their families and veterans are not disadvantaged by the unusual demands of serving in the armed forces and to recognise the sacrifices made by their families and those who have served.</p>
	<p pid="c.550W.9/4">As Minister for Veterans, I meet regularly with veterans and ex-service organisations. Topics raised since 2008 have included priority treatment, civilian mental health services, a new study being undertaken into British Nuclear Test Veterans and the issues of cultural understanding that can arise for those who have served when they seek help from civilian health professionals. Officials from the MOD, other Government Departments, the devolved Administrations and the charities continue to work together to address all key concerns, communicating existing entitlements to all those involved, and areas where improvements might be made to arrangements for ensuring a seamless transition back into civilian life.</p>

	<p pid="c.557W.8/1">Internal management information, which is unaudited data and is subject to change, indicates that there were around 1,000 occasions in 2008 where there was a need to reschedule removal directions for those who were subject to deportation orders. These data are centrally collated and are not broken down to account for the number of individuals they refer to or the reasons as to why removal directions were rescheduled.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.8/2">The chief executive of the UK Border Agency has regularly written to the Home Affairs Select Committee in order to provide robust and accurate information on the deportation of foreign national criminals. She has explained that there are several issues which may cause deportation to be rescheduled. For example, there may be occasions when it is administratively cheaper or easier to reschedule a flight or last minute representations and judicial reviews launched by legal representatives or individual's behaviour becomes unmanageably obstructive, including use of 'dirty protests', and when there are last minute documentation issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.8/3">Much progress has been made to minimise the impact of these issues which is demonstrated in the continued record performance of the agency in deporting or removing foreign national prisoners, where nearly 5,400 were removed in 2008. As confirmed in the UK Border Agency's 2009-10 business plan, it will continue to aim to deport or remove record numbers of foreign criminals in the forthcoming year.</p>

	<p pid="c.560W.0/1">It is difficult to isolate the effect of the change in the length of the probationary period from the effects of other factors, including the no-switching provision which was made at the same time. An initial examination of the data shows a significant increase in the percentage of applications refused after the rule change in 2003. The increase in the length of the probationary period is likely to have been one significant factor in the increase.</p>

	<p pid="c.586W.8/2">In the past year, a range of measures have been announced to support the construction industry and boost housing supply.

	<p pid="c.586W.8/3">Last month, the 2009 Budget announced a further &pound;1 billion of additional resources for housing which included a &pound;400 million kickstart housing delivery fund to restart stalled construction activity across the country. This should help developers retain jobs and skills, and boost the supply of homes over the next year&mdash;benefiting first time buyers and social tenants. The Budget also allocated &pound;100 million over two years to enable local authorities to deliver new social housing on land they already own that can be developed only by them.</p>
	<p pid="c.586W.8/4">In order to compliment this investment, the Government are taking a range of measures to ensure that the housing sector grows strongly over the longer term. These measures will: ensure sufficient land for development, through housing allocations in local plans and further action on public sector land, supported by a responsive and efficient planning system; deliver effective and coordinated infrastructure provision; promote a strong and diverse house building sector; continue to ensure the increased long-term supply of social and affordable housing; and. ensure a proportionate approach to land-value capture and cumulative regulation. The Government will report on progress at the 2009 pre-Budget report.</p>

	<p pid="c.598W.11/3" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-20">20 May 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/5" class="indent">Under section 11A of the Education Act 2005, as amended by the Education and Inspections Act 2006, Ofsted may consider whether to investigate certain complaints, known as qualifying complaints, made about schools. Table A shows the number of complaints about schools made to Ofsted in the last two years and how many of these qualified for further investigation. Ofsted may consider a complaint about a school from any person, not just a registered parent. The data in Table A may include complaints from persons other than parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/6" class="indent">To qualify, the subject of the complaint must fall within one of the areas covered by Ofsted's school inspection remit, as defined by section 5 of the Education Act 2005 and the relevant regulations. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/7" class="indent">The quality of the education provided in the school</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/8" class="indent">How far the education provided in the school meets the needs of the range of pupils at the school</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/9" class="indent">The educational standards achieved in the school</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/10" class="indent">The quality of the leadership in and management of the school, including whether the financial resources made available to the school are managed effectively</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/11" class="indent">The spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of the pupils at the school</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/12" class="indent">The contribution made by the school to the well-being of those pupils</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/13" class="indent">From September 2008, the contribution made by the school to community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/14" class="indent">In addition, a complaint must be made in writing and must not fall within the remit of another statutory complaints process. Furthermore, the complainant must normally have already exhausted local complaints procedures. Ofsted may waive this particular requirement, but will normally only do so in exceptional circumstances. This is because it is appropriate that a school and/or the relevant local authority have the opportunity to put right a complaint before it is referred to Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.11/15" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

At this point, we are normally able to determine what action should be taken, which may lead to an inspection of the school or the information being retained for the next scheduled inspection. Alternatively, we may further investigate the issue raised by the complaint, which may include requiring the school or local authority to provide information relevant to the complaint or to hold a meeting of parents.

	<p pid="c.600W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.2/4" class="indent">Ofsted is a non-ministerial government department and its funding is provided by HM Treasury. Table A shows Ofsted's total expenditure related to the inspection of schools, and the inspection and regulation of nurseries and other pre-school provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.2/5" class="indent">The financial data are derived from Ofsted's audited accounts, which reflect as consistently as possible the cost of inspection and regulation. The accounts do not separately distinguish the cost of inspecting nurseries and other pre-school provision, from the cost of regulating these services. The full cost of inspection and regulation activity is provided and includes direct, indirect and overhead costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.2/6" class="indent">Please note that while the inspection of schools has been a major element of Ofsted's work for the last 12 years, information included in Ofsted's audited accounts does not separately identify this cost until financial year 2003-04. The cost of school inspection has, therefore, only been provided from this point onwards. Similarly, Ofsted assumed responsibility for early years inspection and regulation from financial year 2001-02, and the cost of delivering our programme of early years inspection and regulation has been derived from Ofsted's summary accounts from this point onwards.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.2/7" class="indent">As outlined above, Ofsted has undergone considerable change since the financial year 1997-98. From 1997-98 to 2000-01, Ofsted was primarily responsible for the inspection of schools, local education authorities and teacher training. From 2001-02, Ofsted's remit expanded to include early years inspection and regulation. Since April 2007, Ofsted has also had responsibility for the inspection and regulation of care for children and young people, and the inspection of education and training for learners of all ages. Over the same period, improvements to the way we deliver inspection and regulation have enabled Ofsted to make substantial savings. These changes have affected the costs of regulation and inspection and year on year comparison of these costs. Further explanatory notes accompany the table below.</p>

The costs of inspecting and regulating these providers are included in the totals relating to nurseries and other pre-school provision.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> In the financial year 2005-06, Ofsted used an improved method for calculating total costs of inspection and regulation. The 2004-05 figures above are the recalculated figures based on this new method.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Between the financial years 2004-05 and 2006-07 Ofsted established a new regional structure, rationalising the support for inspections within three regional offices. These changes led to substantial reduction in the cost of inspection and regulation activity.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup> Ofsted recently performed a more detailed, comprehensive and robust analysis of Ofsted's 2007-08 financial accounts to identify the cost of the inspection of schools, and the inspection and regulation of nurseries and pre-school provision. We have used information from this analysis to complete the table above. In the absence of such an analysis for previous years, it is not possible to make a consistent comparison between years.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.601W.2/1">Academies built through the Building Schools for the Future Programme (BSF) will follow a timeline similar to the average for that programme. The time taken for academies built through the traditional procurement model varies depending on the nature of the project. We do not hold precise data centrally and it would exceed the cost threshold to compile.</p>
	<p pid="c.601W.2/2">The average procurement time to completion for new or replacement schools in BSF has been 176 weeks. This includes the time in procuring authorities' private sector partners, Local Education Partnerships, each of which is responsible for rebuilding or refurbishing a package of several schools. Partnerships for Schools expect times to reduce, following changes in the procurement process.</p>
	<p pid="c.601W.2/3">The BSF Procurement Review, the outcome of a major consultation exercise with stakeholders including local authorities, contractors, industry groups and the design community, promises savings of up to &pound;250 million across the national programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.601W.2/4">It will also make this part of the BSF process more timely, streamlined and efficient, reducing procurement times by up to two months.</p>
	<p pid="c.601W.2/5">The Department does not hold information on procurement times for other secondary schools, nor for primary schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.602W.8/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.8/4" class="indent">Tables A and B show which schools have been placed in special measures twice and three times. Between <phrase class="date" code="1997-09-01">1 September 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>,1,940 maintained schools were placed in special measures once, and 67 schools were placed in special measures twice. One school, Malvern Hills Primary School, was placed in special measures three times. This school has now closed. No school has been placed in special measures more than three times.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.8/5" class="indent">Of the 67 schools that required special measures a second time, five were found to require special measures at their re-inspection without ever being removed from this category. Technically, they remained in special measures. They are included at the foot of Table B. Data for the spring term 2009 have not yet been published and are not included in these figures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-06-03c.271339.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-06-03c.604W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" speakername="Beverley Hughes" colnum="604W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090603/text/90603w0034.htm#09060376001189">
	<p pid="c.604W.2/1">The framework for planning looked after children in and leaving care is established in very detailed regulations and guidance setting out the requirements established by the Children Act 1989 and the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000. This framework is intended to ensure that there is proper and thorough planning on behalf of each child wherever they are placed. Every child and young person must have a &quot;care plan&quot;. This becomes their pathway plan from age 16 when local authorities must begin to prepare them for the time when they will no longer be looked after. Where young people have been placed outside of their local area, the pathway planning process must identify whether they will continue to remain in the area where they are placed into adulthood or whether they will return to the area of their responsible authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/2">Government have published the National Protocol on Inter-Authority Arrangements for Care Leavers as a model to assist in managing joint working arrangements between local authorities where a care leaver who is the responsibility of one authority is a resident in another authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/3">This protocol can be accessed on the 'Children Leaving Care' page of the Every Child Matters website.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/4">The Children and Young Persons Act 2008 received Royal Assent in the last session of Parliament. Section 8 of this Act sets out the factors that local authorities must consider when they make a placement for children in their care. This clarifies that as far as reasonably practicable authorities must attempt to secure placements that are within their area and close to children's homes. The priority given to these factors will depend on a detailed assessment of the circumstances in each individual case.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/5">Later this year we will be consulting on planned revision of the Children Act statutory guidance which will include revision of leaving care guidance. This revision provides us with the opportunity to provide more information about how we expect local authorities to plan for looked after children and care leavers who have been placed away from their responsible authority.</p>
