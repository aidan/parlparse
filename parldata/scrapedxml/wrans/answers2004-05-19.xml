	<p pid=".974W.2/1">The annual June Agricultural and Horticultural Census is an important survey. We continue to develop it with a view to reducing the burden on both respondents and the taxpayer. Following a review with our statistical advisers, we have concluded the sample sizes can be reduced in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2009 when we do not need to run such large surveys for EU purposes. The sample size for 2004 is being reduced from 75,000 holdings to about 50,000. While this will reduces the precision at the local levels, this will be minimised by the use of available administrative sources. Increasing numbers of farmers and growers are now completing survey forms electronically and we will be developing our electronic data collection as part of the Whole Farm Approach initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".975W.5/1">Decoupling will provide the basis for all farmers to improve the market orientation of their business and will free them from many of the bureaucratic rules associated with production linked subsidies. Decoupling has the potential to bring considerable benefits to agriculture as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.5/2">The scope for dairy farmers to realise these benefits as members of co-operatives is not inherently different from those that supply milk direct to processors.</p>

	<p pid=".976W.2/1">The use of milk quota to generate &quot;historic&quot; entitlements would tend to favour larger, more intensive, producers compared to the flat rate area based entitlements that are being adopted in England over an eight year transition period.

	<p pid=".977W.2/1">The rules in relation to prescription-only farm medicines have been the subject of three reviews. In the UK, the Independent Review of Dispensing by Veterinary Surgeons of Prescription Only Medicines (the Marsh Report) in 2001 and the 2003 Competition Commission Inquiry into the Cost of Prescription only Medicines both recognised the benefits of retaining the UK's distribution system for veterinary medicinal products while recommending changes to its detailed operation. This was, therefore the Government's aim during negotiations on the Review of European medicines legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.2/2">The Review of European medicines legislation has been completed and an amending Directive 2004/28/EC was published in the Official Journal on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase>. We are now able to implement the changes agreed in the three reviews. In taking forward the provisions for veterinary POMs we expect to establish a system that will retain the key elements of the current distribution arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.2/3">We will consult widely on these proposals and on their cost. Officials from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate are already carrying out informal discussions with interested organisations. We intend to carry out a formal consultation exercise, when our proposals are developed further, at the beginning of next year so as to meet the deadline for implementation of the changes to the legislation of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-30">30 October 2005</phrase>.</p>

By using values given in the &quot;Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&quot;, and estimates of sea level rise of 0.4 mm per year during the 1990s, it is estimated that glacier volume decreased by approximately 0.2 per cent. per year during the 1990s.</p>

	<p pid=".980W.11/2">Article 2 of the Waste Framework Directive exempts sewage sludge from waste management licensing requirements if it is used in accordance with the separate Directive on use of sludge in agriculture. This Directive, which is implemented by the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989, as amended, requires sludge to be used in such a way that the quality of the surface and ground water is not impaired. In addition, there are statutory requirements to ensure that only treated water may enter the public drinking water supply, to comply with European and national standards.</p>

The correct number is 330. The previous response included some duplicated responses. As a result the percentage of responses supporting a ban was also incorrect in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March</phrase> for which I apologise.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/2">The date of receipt of the responses (other than those by e-mail) is not recorded. It is not possible therefore to give the figures with the degree of accuracy that you seek. I have, however, had the responses reviewed and recounted. Respondents replied to a consultation document that asked a series of questions. The questions were:</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/3" class="indent">&quot;(a) Should swill feeding of catering waste containing animal by-products be banned?</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> If yes, should (i) fish and poultry animal by-products fed on-farm be included in the ban, and (ii) non-meat containing catering waste be included in the ban? [It was explained that a ban on all catering waste would include non-meat containing catering waste e.g. bread, brewers waste.]</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/5" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> Should a three-four week transitional period apply?</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/6" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> any other comments, including on whether or not it would be practicable to place obligations on the producers of catering waste e.g. restaurants to ensure that it is not fed to animals; and [comments] on the enclosed draft Order.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/7">Some respondents tailored their responses to five options set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment. Those were:</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/8" class="indent">&quot;(a) Do nothing, i.e. permit the feeding of swill under current controls.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/9" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> Tighten up current controls.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/10" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> Ban the feeding of catering waste (waste from kitchens, restaurants and some food factories) and processed poultry and fish waste as swill.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/11" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> Ban the feeding of catering waste and poultry as swill.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/12" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> Ban the feeding of swill and all catering waste (including that which does not contain meat or meat products e.g. biscuits, yoghurts, brewers grain, vegetable waste, etc).&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/13">In view of the detailed questions asked by the consultation document it is not surprising that the replies were often equally diverse and detailed. But the responses have been re-read as objectively as possible to place them in the categories you seek.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/14">There were 303 responses dated by the sender on or before <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">26 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/15">Those against the ban on the swill feeding of catering waste that contains animal by-products totalled 77 (26 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/16">Those that were in favour of a ban on swill feeding of catering waste that contains meat or meat products totalled 105 (35 per cent.). There was an additional 35 (12 per cent) that favoured a complete ban on swill feeding of all catering waste including non-meat waste. The combined figures of these respondents total 140 (46 per cent.) in favour.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/17">There were 31 (10 per cent) respondents where no particular preference was stated.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/18">An additional 55 (18 per cent.) respondents were against a ban being extended to non-meat waste foods, e.g. from millers, vegetable producers, brewers, etc.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/19">Between <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-27">27 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase> there were three additional responses (one against, one in favour of a ban on swill feeding meat waste, and one no preference). One further response was received after <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase> which was against a ban.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/20">There were also an additional 23 undated responses. 11 were against a ban, three favoured a ban on all catering waste (i.e. including non-meat waste), eight favoured a ban on swill feeding meat waste and one was against an extended ban to non-meat waste.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/21">In total therefore, of all responses received, 208 (63 per cent.) respondees supported a ban on swill feeding of catering waste containing meat. There were 90 (27 per cent) against a ban and 32 (10 per cent) where no preference was expressed.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/22">I believe the House can be reassured therefore that not only was there a numerical majority in favour of a ban but also that it was widely supported when account is taken of the support expressed from associations that represented large memberships (including the NFU, Tenant Farmers Association, the British Pig Association, the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, the National Beef Association, the National Consumer Council, the Meat and Livestock Commission and qualified support from the National Pig Association).</p>
	<p pid=".982W.6/23">All the responses were placed in the library after the consultation period, which was in accordance with normal procedures, and the responses continue to be available for others to scrutinise.</p>

	<p pid=".987W.9/2">The national Work-life Balance (WLB) campaign was launched by the Prime Minister in 2000. Using case studies, a body of research evidence, and a dedicated website the campaign seeks to demonstrate to employers and employees the case for adopting flexible working practices, and highlight the business benefits that can accrue to companies who have considered, and then implemented, alternative ways of working. The campaign has historically provided practical help in implementing Work-life Balance initiatives through the DTI Challenge Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".987W.9/3">At present only one Challenge fund project, from the fifth and final round, is operating in Hampshire. New DTI arrangements to support best practice in business, and other employer organisations, are now in place. These arrangements will be the means by which work-life balance, and the DTI financial support to promote the take-up and growth of flexible working opportunities, will be delivered.</p>
	<p pid=".987W.9/4">Financial assistance to implement best practice in work-life balance and flexible working (and a range of other best practice areas) will be accessible via Business Link offices. Advisers in these offices, in Hampshire and the rest of the country, will provide local points of access for this support. Further details on these arrangements are available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk">www.dti.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".989W.5/1">The UK fully supports the cancellation of debt of the world's poorest countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. We were instrumental in securing international agreement to enhance the original Initiative in 1999, to ensure that as much debt relief as possible is granted to as many countries as possible. The UK continues to be a champion of the HIPC Initiative. We have provided commitments of &pound;2.3 billion of debt relief to eligible countries and have pledged a total of US$474 million through multilateral institutions to support the Initiative further. The UK goes even further than is required under the Initiative, and is committed to providing 100 per cent. debt relief to eligible HIPC countries.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.5/2">The HIPC Initiative is delivering real benefits to participating countries. It is providing over $70 billion of debt relief to the 27 counties that have reached Decision Point. We are committed to maintaining the momentum of the HIPC Initiative and continue to ensure that it is fully implemented. Ethiopia and Niger's exits from the Initiative in April mean that five countries have now reached Completion Point since September 2003 (Ethiopia, Guyana, Nicaragua, Niger and Senegal), bringing the total number to 13.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.5/3">The HIPC Initiative is also helping increase annual social expenditures in countries receiving debt relief. Total social spending has increased by around $4 billion since 1999&mdash;equivalent to 2.7 per cent. of GDP. On average, health and education spending account for 65 per cent. of the use of HIPC debt relief.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.5/4">However, debt relief alone is not sufficient. All HIPC countries will need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This is why the UK has proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF), which could provide the much-needed substantial increase in aid&mdash;in the form of grants, concessional loans, or further debt relief&mdash;needed to attain the MDGs without threatening the long-term debt sustainability of the world's poorest countries.</p>

	<p pid=".992W.2/1">Under normal VAT rules, VAT incurred on goods and services relating to non-business activities cannot be recovered. Free admission of persons to premises is a non-business activity for VAT purposes, therefore museums which do not charge for admission cannot recover the VAT they incur on related purchases. These principles apply irrespective of the source of the funding used to make the purchases.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.2/2">In September 2001, the Government introduced a VAT refund scheme that allows the main national museums and galleries which do not charge admission to recover VAT they incur on related purchases. This scheme is designed to remove the obstacle VAT was creating to the delivery of the Government's 1997 manifesto commitment that there should be free access to the main national museums and galleries.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.2/3">As the Chancellor announced in his Budget statement this year the commitment to achieve free access has been an outstanding success. Building on that success, and in light of the Goodison Review, the Government are considering in the context of the forthcoming spending review the issue of extending the free access commitment for the main national museums and galleries, and the VAT refund scheme that has helped to deliver it, to university museums.</p>

The figure for London was 97.5 per cent. and that for the rest of England 98.8 per cent. In the baseline year, 2000&ndash;01, 98.2 per cent. of scheduled local bus mileage was operated.

The target is to maintain an average fleet age of no more than eight years. Data for <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase> should be available shortly.

This has increased from 22.0 per cent. at <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>. The target is for half of all full size buses to be wheelchair accessible by 2010.

	<p pid=".1000W.5/5">Survey results for the quarter year October to December 2003 showed that bus passenger satisfaction with information at bus stops was rated at 66 out of 100, for England, using seasonally adjusted data. This is up from 61 in 2000&ndash;01 and 63 in 2002&ndash;03. The figure for London was 73 out of 100 as against 60 out of 100 for the rest of England. The target is to improve the rating year on year.</p>
	<p pid=".1000W.5/6">The Government and the CPT remain committed to achieving these targets, underlining the good working relationship that we have with the bus industry, as well as demonstrating the industry's continuing commitment to delivering improved services.</p>

Figures from 1997&ndash;98 to 1999&ndash;2000 are cash based. Figures for 2001&ndash;02 onwards are resource based.

As in previous years, the GDS budget for 2004&ndash;05 is a central non-discretionary budget and expenditure will be determined by dental activity. We have not yet made allocations for 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07. These will be notified to Parliament in due course. However, we have already announced further supplementary investment totalling &pound;90 million to support dentistry through to 2005&ndash;06. &pound;59 million will support access, and strategic health authorities have been advised of their shares and are working with their primary care trusts to address access issues. &pound;30 million is to support information technology and the balance of &pound;1 million will support organisational development locally.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.2/19">The funding has been spent in paying fees to dentists for the provision of dental services through the GDS and the PDS and includes increases in fees in line with the Doctors and Dentists Review Body recommendations, as well as the introduction of schemes such as rewarding NHS commitment. Over this period, the number of adult courses of treatment in the general dental service increased from 25.3 million in 1997&ndash;98 to 26.7 million in 2002&ndash;03, which includes 0.4 million courses in the personal dental service.</p>

	<p pid=".1011W.6/1">We announced in January that we are to support the transition to identifiable gamete donors, subject to Parliament's approval of the regulations, by increasing public awareness of the importance of such donors. The investment that we are making in the promotion of gamete donation involves time and effort as well as the provision of funding.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.6/2">We are working with a range of organisations including the Donor Conception Network, the National Gamete Donation Trust and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) on collaborative arrangements to encourage the recruitment of identifiable donors. We will be supporting the National Gamete Donation Trust (NGDT) to make contact with fertility clinics about current recruitment arrangements and the dissemination of good practice. The NGDT will also run an improved helpline for people interested in being gamete donors on 0845 226 9193. To date we have decided to provide the NGDT with some &pound;100,000 for this work and are currently in discussion with them about further funding for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.6/3">Raising awareness of the value and importance of identifiable gamete donors will also take place in other ways. The HFEA will, for instance, include it as part of their inspections of clinics. We will also be promoting public awareness of gamete donation with other organisations and with the media in preparation for the introduction of identifiable donors from April 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.6/4">The donation of sperm, eggs or embryos is entirely voluntary. The code of practice issued by the HFEA makes clear that gamete donors must be paid no more than &pound;15 for each donation plus reasonable expenses. It also makes clear that where a person is undergoing a treatment cycle, there must be no pressure or undue influence on a patient to donate supernumerary gametes or embryos.</p>

	<p pid=".1021W.2/2">All acute trusts in England have broadband connections to the national health service national network. Information about the type of local authority organisation within which the trust is based is not collected.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.2/3">A major part of the infrastructure programme is the implementation of the NHS national broadband network. This will provide the NHS with world class networking services, including secure broadband connectivity, for the future. The substantially enhanced bandwidth, intelligent network services and new network technologies will meet increasing demand and offer a range of new opportunities. It will enhance services and allow for the further development of remote centres, with increased access to specialist support.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.2/4">The broadband network will provide access to the patient record in the various care locations, support on-site procedures and allow consistent access to knowledge for all clinicians. Care will be provided using telemedicine and telecare techniques in a wide range of locations, for example, minor injuries units, enhanced general practices and diagnostic and treatment centres. This will relieve acute trusts and accident and emergency departments by taking on investigations, treatment for minor injuries and procedures such as some day-case surgeries.</p>

	<p pid=".1024W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-27">27 April 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/2">The Department annually collects retrospective cost and activity data from all English national health service trusts, including collections of elective in-patient, non-elective in-patient, and day case activity. The national tariff for 2004&ndash;05 includes some 550 or so healthcare resource groups (HRGs) covering activity in these categories. HRGs are groups of procedures and treatments that are clinically similar and involve similar use of resources.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/3">Though the tariff is based on national average reported costs (Reference Costs), it is not meaningful to make direct comparisons between the two because of the prospective nature of the tariff. For example, the latest reference costs refer to 2002&ndash;03, and the tariff to 2005&ndash;06. However a realistic guide to the relative cost efficiency of a NHS Trust is given by the National Reference Cost Index (RCI). The RCI gives a single figure for each NHS trust which compares the actual cost of its activity with the same activity at national average cost. The 2002&ndash;03 RCI score for North Bristol NHS Trust indicates that across the board its activity costs are 26 per cent. above the national average. This reflects the significant extra unplanned expenditure incurred by the trust in that year.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/4">Payment by results began in a small way in 2003&ndash;04, is extended in 2004&ndash;05, and becomes fully operational in 2005&ndash;06. There will be a further three-year transition period to full impact of the new system until 2008, during which the effect of the tariff will be phased to allow trusts to adjust local costs so as to be able to live within the tariff.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/5">We anticipate there may be some NHS trusts that will not be able to reduce costs to the extent necessary. The numbers in this position are likely to be very few as new and better costing and HRG definitions are introduced, and when the system has been fine-tuned to take account of exceptionally expensive patients not well covered by the tariff. We also recognise that where organisations are recovering an accumulated deficit, recovery plans will need to be revisited in the light of transition.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/6">Latest thinking on how these and a number of other operational issues might be resolved in practice is described in the Department's formal response to the latest round of consultation on payment by results, which will be published shortly. Final guidance will be issued later this year in time to inform the normal planning and contracting processes for 2005&ndash;06.</p>

But Part 5 of the Police Act 1997, under which the CRB operates, does not empower the CRB to search data sources outside the United Kingdom for conviction and other information shown on its Disclosures. The value of a CRB Disclosure may therefore be limited if the applicant has been resident in the UK for no more than a short time.</p>
	<p pid=".1038W.8/2">Some other countries, including most in the EU, have arrangements in place which allow their citizens to obtain certificates of good conduct or extracts from the criminal record to show to prospective employers. The CRB has developed an Overseas Information Service for the benefit of employers. This supplies advice and information about arrangements and contact points in a number of other countries in order that the employer can make inquiries or ask the employee to do so. At present, this covers 16 countries, including nine in Europe, and work is in hand to extend the service to a further 15 countries, including 14 in Europe. The CRB advises that Disclosures should complement and not replace other checks and inquiries under good recruitment practice. It is for employers (or regulatory bodies) to determine the arrangements that are to apply.</p>

	<p pid=".1044W.5/1">Recorded crime figures, which are used to measure trends in crime, include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on property crimes, such as burglary, do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits. There are therefore no figures currently available for the proportion of crime in Greater London, by borough, which was connected to drug addiction.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/2">The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, provides an insight into the proportion of crimes that are drug related. However, this survey does not provide sub-national data and is also not nationally representative.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/3">A comparison of the survey's findings from eight sites across the country (including custody suites in Bethnal Green and Hammersmith) visited in 1999 and 2002, indicate that there was no change in the proportion of arrestees testing positive for one or more of six illicit drugs. Nearly two-thirds (65 per cent.) of arrestees in each year tested positive for any drug.</p>

	<p pid=".1045W.9/1">The Government's advice to local planning authorities is contained in Circular 22/91, 'Travelling Showpeople'. This recognises the need for showpeople's winter quarters and describes the particular character of showpeople's sites. It puts emphasis on early discussion between local planning authorities and showpeople whenever local development plans are being prepared in order to help ensure suitable sites are available for purchase. It also advises early discussion between local planning authorities and showpeople before land is purchased for the setting up of winter quarters. Where plans do not contain a policy relating to the provision of showpeople's quarters, applications should be determined on their merits.</p>

	<p pid=".1049W.2/1">Statistics on the percentage of families with disabled children who received assistance from statutory agencies to address their housing needs are not collected centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/2">Local housing authorities in consultation with social service departments have the leading role in assessing the housing needs of disabled children.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/3">The Government have a number of policy initiatives designed to increase the supply of accessible housing including the provision of suitable housing to families with a disabled child. All newly built homes are required to comply with &quot;Part M&quot; of the building regulations. These provisions are expected to enable occupants to cope better with reduced mobility. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced earlier this year that we will carry out a further review of Part M, with the aim of incorporating Lifetime Home standards for accessibility into the Building Regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/4">Furthermore, in relation to new social housing, the Government requires that all schemes funded through the Housing Corporation comply not only with the Building Regulations, but also with additional criteria for accessibility and internal environments set out in the Corporation's scheme development standards. Reforms of the planning system are also seeking to address issues of access and inclusion. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill introduces a statutory requirement for those responsible for preparing regional spatial strategies and local development documents in England to undertake these functions with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. Our consultation draft of Planning Policy Statement 1 (PPS1) makes it crystal clear that development plans should contain clear and comprehensive inclusive access policies.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not only taking action to improve accessibility in relation to new developments. We have also substantially increased Government resources available to the Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) scheme to help with adaptations to the existing housing stock to meet the needs of disabled people. Since 1997, Government funding for DFGs has nearly doubled, rising to &pound;100 million a year. This year, over 33,000 homes will be adapted to meet the needs of disabled people through the programme&mdash;a 50 per cent. increase on 1997&ndash;98. The 1996 report into the Evaluation of the DFG system published by the Department of the Environment showed that 5 per cent. of all successful DFG applicants were parents with a disabled child.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/6">The Government announced a review of the operation of the DFG programme on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-05">5 January 2004</phrase>. In answer to a Parliamentary Question from Baroness Wilkins, Lord Rooker in the House of Lords said that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, jointly with the Department of Health will be reviewing the disabled facilities grant programme, including the operation of the means test, in the context of the Spending Review 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/7">This Review is now under way and will include an assessment of the equity of the DFG means test as it affects applications from families with a disabled child and any disincentive effect of the test on a parent's decision to work. The conclusions of this review will be announced by the end of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1051W.14/1">The current role of the Community Housing Task Force (CHTF) is to lead the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's work on options appraisal. The CHTF offers free, 'hands-on' advice to local authorities who are going through the process, and this advice continues when an authority decides on, and progresses with, any one or more of the options available to them. The Task Force advisers check proposals at key stages, assist with the development and sharing of good practice, and offer support to allow tenants and other key stakeholders to make informed decisions on the future of their housing stock.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.14/2">The CHTF has never had a formalised mission statement. However, on the front of all CHTF publications there is a quote from the Head of CHTF, which adequately describes the main ethos and aims of the division. This reads as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.14/3" class="indent">&quot;The CHTF is dedicated to ensuring that the Decent Homes target is met. We will work closely with local authorities and tenants from the beginning of the Option Appraisal process to develop the most appropriate option for them. The end result must be sustainable communities where people want to live.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1062W.2/1">History is a statutory subject in the National Curriculum for all primary age pupils, which requires that pupils are taught knowledge, skills and understanding through various areas of study. At Key Stage 2 these include studies of local, British, European and world history. Within that framework, schools have considerable flexibility over the detailed content of their history courses as long as the statutory requirements are met. The full Programmes of Study for History can be viewed at <a href="http://www.nc.uk.net">www.nc.uk.net</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.2/2">All primary schools have received copies of the DfES/Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) scheme of work for primary history. This was specifically developed to help teachers plan courses aimed at developing children's historical knowledge and skills in a coherent and rigorous way. This is widely used and Ofsted has found that it is having a positive impact on standards in many primary schools. The Department is also funding the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to produce an &quot;Innovating with History&quot; website which will provide further support for primary and secondary history teachers encouraging them to explore more innovative and creative approaches to planning in history.</p>

When a child enters the country alone and claims asylum or there are concerns that he or she may have been trafficked, the immigration service should immediately refer the child to the relevant local authority's social services department. The social services department will undertake a needs assessment and will provide services in the light of the outcome of that assessment. These services should be tailored to the individual needs of the child, just as they should be for any child in need.</p>

	<p pid=".1068W.3/1">The Department continues to explore ways to increase investment in our sports facilities working with partners in the voluntary, public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.3/2">One of the key routes for DCMS to invest in the delivery of local authority leisure facilities is through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). This is one of a range of Government policies designed to increase private sector involvement in the provision of public services. DCMS is currently supporting 21 local authority PFI projects nationwide, 12 of which include the provision of new or refurbished sports and leisure facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.3/3">DCMS has participated in various cross-government initiatives aimed at informing both the public and private sector about the PFI process. However, DCMS does not directly enter into discussions with the private sector on individual PFI projects since it is a matter for local authorities to negotiate the specific terms by which they might contribute to the provision of their leisure facilities.</p>

In 2002&ndash;03, the consortiums were funded as part of the Department's core programme business and all of their costs, including administration costs, were included as part of the 'Administration and Research' heading of the Department's main estimate. Figures for each consortium's administration costs are not available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The consortiums did not receive any grant in aid funding in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".1078W.0/1">No universally accepted figures of displaced Colombians exist. In his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-10">10 May 2004</phrase>, the Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Jan Egeland, stated that 2 million people had become displaced in Colombia in the past 15 years. According to CODHES, a Colombian NGO, about 3,090,000 people were internally displaced from 1984&ndash;2003, of which 1,247,000 were over the period 2000&ndash;03. The Colombian Government figures estimates a figure of 1,148,000 over the latter period.</p>
	<p pid=".1078W.0/2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are 2,430 Colombian 'persons of concern' in Panama and around 8,860 in Venezuela. However, these figures are generally considered to represent only a proportion of displaced people to these countries, particularly in Venezuela given the effect the Venezuelan Government's concern about the influx of displaced Colombians is having on Colombians' desire to register.</p>

	<p pid=".1079W.0/1">Extensive measures are taken to protect all DFID staff and contractors. All DFID staff and consultants employed individually are provided with body armour, safety and communications equipment, security training, briefing and armed protection. Contractors are responsible for the security arrangements of their staff but the costs are covered by the UK Government. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in receipt of DFID support are also responsible for their own security. DFID maintains a regular dialogue with them on security issues and will fund their security needs where appropriate. All of these security arrangements are kept under constant review.</p>

	<p pid=".1081W.0/2">While both the IDB and the World Bank have a number of projects, or components of projects, specifically targeted at indigenous people, other projects, not so targeted, often have a similar or greater impact.

	<p pid=".1081W.0/3">DFID is specifically working with the IDB to contribute to its efforts to ensure appropriate account is taken of indigenous people's issues in its policies and their implementation. DFID is providing US$203,500 contribution to the consultation process in the IDE's preparation of an updated strategic framework on indigenous development. At present, DFID does not have any specific programmes targeted at indigenous people in Latin America with the World Bank.</p>

The IMF explained that much of its advice on fiscal and other economic matters had been reflected in the plan, which it would help the parties implement with technical assistance, and&mdash;if necessary&mdash;balance of payments support. The IMF's considered view was that the Annan Plan was &quot;economically and financially viable&quot;, and would deliver a higher rate of growth for the United Cyprus Republic than was likely to be achieved under the status quo. The World Bank also signalled its intention to support implementation of the plan, including to help address income disparities. The EIB and the Council of Europe Development Bank supported this analysis. Representatives from many countries, with the UK to the fore, made financial and political commitments to support the UNSG's proposals.</p>

	<p pid=".1083W.9/2">The applicability of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to the actions of UK personnel in Iraq is a matter which is in issue in the current cases before the High Court brought by the families of 13 Iraqi civilians. The Government's position in those cases is that ECHR rights have no application in Iraq. The citizens of Cyprus, prior to invasion by Turkey, were the beneficiaries of rights under the ECHR, by virtue of Cyprus' membership of the Council of Europe. The decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Loizidou was to the effect that they did not lose those rights when Turkey assumed sole effective control of part of the territory of Cyprus. The position in Iraq, of course, is critically different. The citizens of Iraq had no rights at all under the ECHR prior to military action by the coalition forces; furthermore, the UK does not exercise the same degree of control over Iraq as existed in relation to the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.</p>

We will be considering the best way in which to build on the success of the CLS in the light of the Review's recommendations and the comments we receive. In addition, we have announced a fundamental legal aid review, which will look at the long-term future of the legal aid system, focusing on how best to provide publicly funded legal services to those who need them.</p>

The paper recommended that policy consideration be given to the introduction of an ASBO regime for Northern Ireland, that consideration be given to the use of section 108 of the Terrorism Act, that the DPP and Police should give further consideration on how co-operation could be improved, and that policy consideration be given to introducing pre-charge bail conditions.

However, the details for the annual report for 2003 which I expect to be very similar to those for 2004, are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.0/2" class="indent">The Northern Ireland Office Departmental Report 2003 was produced by The Stationary Office (TSO). Costs of printing and publication are met directly by TSO and do not fall to Government. The Department was invoiced for the 180 copies that it requested. 856 copies were printed and TSO's records show that eight copies have been sold at its cover price of &pound;30, and an additional 597 copies were sold at a reduced charge. The NIO supplied copies of the report free of charge to 159 parties. A list of those interested parties is set out in the following table.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.0/3" class="indent">The 2004 report is available in the Libraries of the House and to the public free of charge on the NIO website at <a href="http://www.nio.gov.uk/pdf/deptreport2004.pdf">http://www.nio.gov.uk/pdf/deptreport2004.pdf</a>.</p>
