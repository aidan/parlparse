	<p pid="a.7W.6/1">Evidence on office space allocation and occupancy was submitted to the Administration Committee's inquiry into House of Commons Accommodation earlier this year. This evidence is published with that Committee's Third Report of the Session, HC 1279. The answer that follows is based on that information, which represents a sample at a given moment in time.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/2"><i> (a)</i> The Accommodation Whips have approximately 14,800 sq m of office space available to allocate to Members, an average of 22.9 sq m per Member. In practice, however, some of this accommodation is unoccupied or occupied by Members' staff. Of the office space currently used by Members, the average area available for each Member is 14.3 sq m.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/3"><i> (b)</i> and <i> (c)</i> Of the total office space available to the Accommodation Whips, 1,300 sq m is designated ministerial accommodation, an average of 16.9 sq m per Minister. This leaves 13,500 sq m of office space not designated ministerial accommodation which the Accommodation Whips have available to allocate to other hon. Members. However, Ministers also occupy some Members' accommodation not designated for Ministers, while some ministerial rooms are occupied by Members' staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/4"><i> (d)</i> The average space available to individual Members' staff is estimated at 9.2 sq m per person, based on 1,230 desk spaces in areas allocated by the Serjeant at Arms and in Members' accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/5"><i> (e)</i> 1,735 staff of the House, 1,257 of whom are desk-based, occupy 13,140 sq m of office space, giving an average density of 7.6 or 10.5 sq m per person depending on the method of calculation used. Disaggregated information is not held on space occupied by senior staff of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.22W.2/1">The average domestic rate for households in Northern Ireland consists of the average of the 26 district council domestic rates plus the domestic regional rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/2">The formula for calculation of the average rate for households is as follows: Each year, district councils' estimated net expenditure is reduced by anticipated general grant payments and any balance that councils have indicated they wish to apply, to determine the net amount to be raised from district rates. This figure is divided by the total penny product (the income from one penny in the rates) to give the average non-domestic rate. The average non-domestic rate is then multiplied by the Northern Ireland growth factor to determine the average domestic rate. The average domestic rate for 2006-2007 is 157.33 pence</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/3">The regional domestic rate is a single rate applied uniformally across Northern Ireland. It is determined by dividing the domestic rate revenue required in the Budget by the domestic tax base, currently defined in rental values.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/4">The average domestic rate in 2006-07 is 355.50 pence, which is the sum of the uniform regional domestic rate of 198.17p and the average district rate of 157.33p.</p>

Instead Government have set targets on overall energy efficiency, carbon emissions and carbon neutrality, all of which will apply from April 2006. A table of the new targets follows as annex A. In addition, the existing commitment that Government Departments should source at least 10 per cent. of their electricity from renewables will remain in place until 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.13/3">Departmental performance against Government estate targets, including carbon emissions and energy efficiency, has been published in annual Sustainable Development in Government Reports.

	<p pid="a.28W.3/1">Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are required to submit Greenhouse Gas Inventories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) every year. These inventories are compiled using methodologies devised by the International Panel on Climate Change and agreed by the UNFCCC. Once submitted, the inventories are scrutinised by international experts to ensure their completeness and accuracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.3/2">In the UK, inventory data are subject to an audited quality control and assurance programme. This ensures that the data sources are reliable and quality checked, that the choice of methodologies is transparent, and that data are consistent over time, complete, comparable, and assessed for uncertainties. When required, methodological changes are made to take account of new data sources, new guidance fromthe IPCC, relevant work by other international organisations, new research, or specific research programmes sponsored by Defra. Such improvements to the methodology are applied retrospectively to ensure a consistent time series of emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.3/3">Defra periodically tests the accuracy of key source sector estimates in the national inventory by undertaking independent peer review. Reviews completed to date include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion and agriculture. Defra also funds independent verification of the reliability of the emissions estimates by combining measurements of the concentrations of selected greenhouse gases at Mace Head in Ireland and a model of atmospheric transport developed by the Met Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.8/1">No. It is inappropriate to place private ministerial correspondence in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.8/2">However, it might be helpful to explain and put into context the current role of Nirex in the management of radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.8/3">Responsibility for securing the safety of the public and the environment rests with the independent regulators&mdash;the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the environment agencies (the Environment Agency, EA, in England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, SEPA, in Scotland).</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.8/4">The nuclear operators are required to demonstrate to the regulators that the risks to the public and the environment from their activities, including the management of radioactive waste, are reduced to as low as reasonably practicable. In support of their safety cases for packaging and disposal of radioactive waste, the operators may seek advice from Nirex.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.8/5">Nirex is not a regulator. It is a company that is jointly owned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) that advises nuclear site operators on the preparation of the industry's safety case submissions to the regulators for the conditioning and packaging of waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.8/6">It is the independent regulators who take decisions on the acceptability of waste conditioning and packaging safety cases submitted to them. The environment agencies have teams that scrutinise Nirex's contribution to the safety case process. It is regulators who are responsible for applying and determiningthe statutory safety requirements of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and the Radioactive Substances Act 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.8/7">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is the strategic UK-wide body with responsibility for securing the clean up and decommissioning of public sector nuclear liabilities and the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials including radioactive waste. It is the owner of most of the UK's radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.8/8">The majority of Nirex's current funding&mdash;over90 per cent.&mdash;comes from a contract with the NDA. The remainder comes through an agreement withthe Ministry of Defence (MoD). The company also receives payment from nuclear site operators for supply of their waste conditioning and packaging advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.31W.7/1">Afghanistan is a sovereign nation which has an elected Parliament and President. The Government of Afghanistan is therefore the civilian body responsible for overseeing the reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Compact signed at the London Conference in January 2006, commits the Government of Afghanistan to lead on the reconstruction process in Afghanistan over the next five years, with support from the international community. The Government's plans are described in the interim Afghan National Development Strategy (iANDS), also launched at the London Conference. The UN has a Special Representative of the Secretary General in Kabul (currently Tom Koenigs). It is the responsibility of this person to help co-ordinate the international community's efforts. He is the joint chair of the Joint Co-ordination Monitoring Body (JCMB) which helps to make sure progress is seen against the targets set in London.</p>

This includes an increase in international aid of around 25 per cent. between 2004 and 2005 to over $100 billion, putting us well on track to reach the target of $130 billion in global aid by 2010. Half of this extra money will go to Africa, so that by 2010 it will be receiving $50 billion a year&mdash;double the aid it received in 2004.

	<p pid="a.33W.2/1">The UK is in regular contact with both the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF, the lead UN agencies working to eliminate child labour. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Department of International Development's recent discussions with these organisations have not focused specifically on child labour. DFID is a major funder of both organisations, with a current commitment of over &pound;15 million to the ILO's programmes to combat child labour andthe trafficking of children. DFID also provided&pound;19 million in core funding to UNICEF programme in 2005, including support to their Child Protection programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.33W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development regularly holds meetings with UK based non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which often have issues relating to child labour on their agenda. However there has been no specific discussion of child labour in recent meetings. DFID funds a number of UK based NGOs, including Save the Children Fund (SCF) and World Vision, to implement projects addressing child labour issues, including trafficking and street children.</p>

One of the flagship projects of this strategy is the provision of cash payments to families living in chronic poverty, some of whom currently depend on their children's income. In Zimbabwe, DFID is providing &pound;30 million to the Protracted Relief Programme which is supporting food security for &pound;1.5 million households in extreme poverty and will mean that many children, including those orphaned by AIDS, will not have to undertake harmful work to survive.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.2/1">DFID uses data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF to estimate the extent of child labour.

	<p pid="a.36W.2/1">Since October 2004, when an electronic absence recording system was introduced, records of sick absences have been held centrally by DFID. This has afforded better management control of frequent and long-term sick absences. However, we are still in the process of defining the types of reports we will require on a regular basis. To provide the information in the format requested requires intensive manual manipulation of the data. We have also changed the basis of recording working patterns from days to hours which compounds the problem of producing ad hoc reports. We are working with an external consultant towards implementing a simpler process for extracting information from existing systems, but we are unlikely to be able to produce the data until later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.36W.5/19">DFID's domestic travel policies ensure that staff travel only when necessary, to minimise cost and environmental impact from carbon emissions. Only top management staff may buy business class tickets. However, DFID benefits from an arrangement usedby a number of Government Departments whereby travellers on flexible economy tickets may be upgraded to business class at no extra cost. We are keen to reduce the number of internal flights and time spent travelling. We instruct staff to consider whether meetingsare essential, and we have invested in modern communication systems including video conference facilities to reduce the need for travel.</p>

	<p pid="a.37W.2/4">DFID is also consulting disabled peoples' organisations, and development organisations with a disability remit, about the development of a good practice note for its staff on Inclusive Development. This will have a strong focus on the involvement of disabled people and their representatives in partner countries to ensure that disability issues are taken into account across DFID's programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.37W.5/1">DFID has committed some &pound;2 billion to education over the last 10 years. In April, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pledged to increase this sum to &pound;8.5 billion over the next10 years and last month the Prime Minister promised to increase DFID's annual budget for education to&pound;1 billion a year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.37W.5/2">Most of this funding will be channelled to the governments of developing countries to invest in long term, comprehensive investment plans for the education sector. We will be working with our partners to ensure that access to education by children with disabilities is part of these plans. For example, in India, DFID has supported the District Primary Education Programme, which promotes inclusive education and has helped states integrate disabled children into mainstream schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.37W.5/3">We will also continue to fund discrete civil society projects focused on children with disabilities. DFID has partnership agreements with a number of organisations that support disability-focused activities, such as World Vision, HelpAge International, Save the Children and VSO, among others. In addition, through our partner Action on Disability and Development, with whom we have a six-year Programme Partnership Agreement, we work to promote greater participation and inclusionof disabled people and their organisations in decision-making processes, particularly on partner governments' Poverty Reduction Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.38W.2/1">The Global Monitoring Report, which we regard as the most reliable source of education data, estimates that only 2 per cent. of children with disabilities in developing countries are enrolled in school. Civil society organisations working in this field make similar estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.2/2">All children, including those with disabilities or living in difficult circumstances, should have equal access to a good quality basic education. DFID is committed to working with the Governments of developing countries towards the education of all children, including those with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.2/3">DFID's policy paper 'Reducing poverty by tackling social exclusion', which has been deposited in the Libraries of the House, sets out our broad based approach to tackling social exclusion across all sectors.

	<p pid="a.38W.5/1">The negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are continuing and are due to be finalised by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.5/2">Based on our strategy on development and trade as outlined in the Trade and Investment White Paper 2004 (in which we supported improved trade opportunities for developing countries in line with their broader development strategies), the Government have responded to the EPA negotiations. We published a policy statement in March 2005 on how we think EPAs should be designed if they are to help the ACP countries develop. This policy determines how we will influence the EPA negotiations and assess their outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.5/3">Secondly, at ACP countries' request, DFID has provided substantial financial and independent technical assistance to help inform their positions in the negotiations. This includes support for the west African, eastern and southern African and Caribbean countries as well to the regional bodies which negotiate on their behalf. The UK is the largest bilateral donor in the EU providing such assistance for EPAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.5/4">Thirdly, UK international development assistance will also respond to the needs and priorities of the ACP arising from EPAs in order to help them develop their ability to trade. DFID will provide funding through the European Development Fund. Support for developing countries, including the ACP, will also be provided through our own bilateral initiative, Aid for Trade, to which we have committed &pound;100 million per year by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.2/2">I attach details of our bilateral general health sector spend by country for the financial years 1997-98 to 2004-05. This totalled nearly &pound;267 million in financial year 2004-05. We are still in the process of validating expenditure data for 2005-06 and cannot release this under National Statistics Protocols.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.2/3">DFID also supports work to improve health through our regional and central programmes (including research programmes) that complement the work of our country programmes. In 2004-05, this additional support brought our total bilateral spend on the health sector to some &pound;363 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.2/4">In addition, we provide funding to UN agencies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, and bodies such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, which are all primarily concerned with helping countries improve their health services. In 2004-05, expenditure on multilateral organisations that have a significant focus on health was &pound;108.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.2/5">DFID also provides general Poverty Reduction Budget Support to several developing countries to help build basic services. Some of this funding goes on health services, but is not captured within our sector specific spending figures which therefore somewhat underestimate our overall contribution to improving health in developing countries.</p>

In Kenya, DFID is supporting an innovative pilot project with Sightsavers and the Ministry of Education to provide assistive technology to all totally blind and severe low vision students at Kenyatta University and three Teachers Training Colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="a.50W.2/1">In the three financial years from 2002-03, DFID spent &pound;3.1 million, &pound;2.5 million and &pound;2.12 million in Kosovo, all on technical assistance.

	<p pid="a.52W.8/1">Improving infrastructure is essential for achieving economic growth in developing countries. There is also a pressing need to increase the efficiency of infrastructure to give greater access to the poor and better value for money. Current investment flows are insufficient to fund these additional needs and the public sector alone cannot bridge the financing and efficiency gaps. A significant contribution from the private sector will be required. However, attracting private capital and participation is difficult&mdash;according to World Bank figures, private investment in developing country infrastructure fell from US$ 49.6 billion in 1997 to US$ 12.5 billion in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/2">Among the main constraints to successful private sector participation in infrastructure are the lack of appropriate policies, laws, regulations and institutions and the weak capacity of the public sector to effectively manage private sector involvement. The PPIAF is a global technical assistance facility managed by the World Bank to address these constraints and, where requested to do so by developing country governments, facilitate and, where appropriate, raise the quality of private sector involvement in infrastructure. The PPIAF is a good example of successful donor harmonization in development. It is supported by 14 donors with a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience. As of April 2006, it had approved $US 108.7 million funding for 495 activities in 101 countries. This funding mobilised an additional US$ 59.8 million co-financing from governments and other donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/3">A particular strength of the PPIAF is its open and transparent systems of governance. These include procedures governing the application for and allocation of activity funds. As a partner in a multilateral facility, DFID abides by the endorsed systems and governance arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/4">DFID fully endorses the PPIAF's objective to help developing countries to improve the quality of their infrastructure to the benefit of the poor through effective public-private partnerships. In practice, this is largely achieved by helping governments improve their policies, laws, regulations and institutions (their &quot;enabling environment&quot;). Our other objectives are to encourage greater donor coordination in designing solutions to meet the demands of developing countries, reducing transaction costs for developing countries and effective dissemination of lessons learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/5">DFID does not earmark its contribution to the PPIAF. Funding is pooled with that of other donors. The breakdown of total PPIAF expenditure in US$ by sector for each of the last three years is provided in the table. Future allocations will depend on demand from governments of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.8/29">As a partnership arrangement, the PPIAF is jointly governed. The PPIAF has four policy and administrative organs. DFID is represented on the first two:</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/30" class="indent">The Program Council is the governing body of the PPIAF, composed of representatives of the 14 donors contributing resources to the PPIAF, and chaired by the World Bank. The Program Council, which meets once a year around June time, is responsible for defining programme policies and priorities, approving an annual work plan and financial plan, reviewing PPIAF performance and overseeing other PPIAF organs.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/31" class="indent">The Donor Steering Group provides strategic direction to the Program Council. Membership of this group is on a voluntary basis and decided in consultation with the full Program Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/32" class="indent">The Technical Advisory Panel (TAP), comprises six international experts, it provides independent advice on strategy and evaluates the impact of the PPIAF programme by carrying out evaluations of a sample of PPIAF projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/33" class="indent">The PPIAF Program Management Unit (PMU) is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the facility with a focus on reviewing proposals, arranging delivery of PPIAF programmes and activities, and proposing and administering the work plan and budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/34">Further details on these organs and the PPIAF governance structure are provided in the PPIAF Program Charter, dated May 2001, as amended from time to time, available from its website:</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/35" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ppiaf.org">www.ppiaf.org</a></p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/36">All project proposals are assessed for value for money and their potential for impact by the PPIAF. Once approved, all activities follow World Bank procurement rules that require open and transparent competition to ensure value for money. A sample of activities are systematically evaluated by the Technical Advisory Panel of independent experts that reports to the Programme Council. PPIAF evaluations have confirmed that 84 per cent. of its activities have satisfactorily achieved their original objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/37">In 2004, PPIAF donors also commissioned an independent evaluation&mdash;the 'Strategic Review', of the first five years of PPIAF's operations. The objective was to evaluate PPIAF's progress against its original objectives and identify ways for improving its performance. The report, issued in the final quarter of 2004, was very positive, concluding that the PPIAF is making an important contribution to development.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/38">A number of recommendations were made that the PPIAF has since implemented. The recommendations included strengthening the strategic direction of the programme; increasing stakeholder involvement in the Program Council, more focus on outcomes ratherthan outputs; enhancing PPIAF's identity as an autonomous multi-donor facility and improving impact measurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/39">Changes facilitated by the PPIAF often take a few years to deliver the anticipated improvements to the enabling environment. This has made it difficult to assess direct poverty impact to date. Improving impact measurement is an issue that is currently being addressed. One proposal is that PPIAF activity should be more closely anchored to planned infrastructure projects. Further work is in hand to gauge the impact of PPIAF activity on the International Financial Corporation's national 'doing business' ratings that address various aspects of the enabling environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/40">Country-specific activities may be undertaken only where governments seek the assistance of the PPIAF.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/41">Consensus building is essential if reforms are to be successful. Governments are responsible for leading the process. The PPIAF has played an important supporting role. For example, the PPIAF has supported the development of a series of training courses on utility regulation and finance that have been targeted at key stakeholder groups including Ministers and senior Government officials, journalists and consumer associations. The aim of the training courses is to equip stakeholders with a sound knowledge on which to appraise reforms. Two training workshops have also been held for stakeholders. The first workshop was held in South Africa in June 2005 and the second was held in Costa Rica in February 2006. Feedback provided to PPIAF on the workshops has been very positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/42">DFID last reviewed its involvement with the PPIAF in July 2005, when considering a request for continued support. This review drew heavily on the findings of the independent strategic review and progress on implementing its recommendations. The strategic review reported that the PPIAF has a comparative advantage over other facilities by demonstrating clear focus, global reach, strong donor support and efficient management. It confirmed that demand for PPIAF services by governments of developing countries is growing and that continued DFID support is critical to growth and increasing the leverage of funds required for scaling up. On this basis, DFID agreed to continue its contribution to PPIAF for a further three-year period&mdash;July 2005 to June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/43">Donors are asked annually to consider a financial plan incorporating an estimate of future calls on donors based on the anticipated demand by governments. The PPIAF then considers requests for funding from governments once a quarter in light of available funds and donor pledges. DFID has agreed an indicative biannual payment schedule for meeting our commitment to the PPIAF based on the financial plan. DFID funds are only ever released on evidence of need and good performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/44">DFID consults with members of the public, NGOs and other stakeholders when setting the UK policy for international development. It is not practical to consult the public on the many individual funding decisions that DFID takes to deliver this policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.2/1">Improving infrastructure is essential for achieving economic growth in developing countries. There is also a pressing need to increase the efficiency of infrastructure to give greater access to the poor and better value for money. Current investment flows are insufficient to fund these additional needs and the public sector alone cannot bridge the financing and efficiency gaps. A significant contribution from the private sector will be required. However, attracting private capital and participation is difficult&mdash;according to World Bank figures, private investment in developing country infrastructure fell from US$ 49.6 billion in 1997 to US$ 12.5 billion in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/2">Among the main constraints to successful private sector participation in infrastructure are the lack of appropriate policies, laws, regulations and institutions and the weak capacity of the public sector to effectively manage private sector involvement. The PPIAF is a global technical assistance facility managed by the World Bank to address these constraints and, where requested to do so by developing country governments, facilitate and raise the quality of private sector involvement in infrastructure. The PPIAF is a good example of successful donor harmonization in development. It is supported by 14 donors with a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience. As of April 2006, it had approved $US 108.7 million funding for 495 activities in 101 countries. This funding mobilised an additional US$ 59.8 million co-financing from governments and other donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/3">A particular strength of the PPIAF is its open and transparent systems of governance. These include procedures governing the application for and allocation of activity funds. As a partner in a multilateral facility, DFID abides by the endorsed systems and governance arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/4">DFID fully endorses the PPIAF's objective to help developing countries to improve the quality of their infrastructure to the benefit of the poor through effective public private partnerships. In practice, this is largely achieved by helping governments improve their policies, laws regulations and institutions (their &quot;enabling environment&quot;). Our other objectives are to encourage greater donor coordination in designing solutions to meet the demands of developing countries, reducing transaction costs for developing countries and effective dissemination of lessons learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/5">DFID does not earmark its contribution to the PPIAF. Funding is pooled with that of other donors. The breakdown of total PPIAF expenditure in US $ by sector for each of the last three years is provided in the table below. Future allocations will depend on demand from governments of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.2/41">All project proposals are assessed for value for money and their potential for impact by the PPIAF. Once approved, all activities follow World Bank procurement rules that require open and transparent competition to ensure value for money. A sample of activities are systematically evaluated by the technical advisory panel of independent experts that reports to the Program Council which is composed of representatives of the 14 donors members. PPIAF evaluations have confirmed that 84 per cent of its activities have satisfactorily achieved their original objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/42">In 2004, PPIAF donors also commissioned an independent evaluation the 'Strategic Review', of the first five years of PPIAF's operations. The objective was to evaluate PPIAF's progress against its original objectives and identify ways for improving its performance. The report, issued in the final quarter of 2004, was very positive, concluding that that PPIAF is making an important contribution to development. A number of recommendations were made that the PPIAF has since implemented. The recommendations included strengthening the strategic direction of the programme; increasing stakeholder involvement in the PPIAF's Program Council, more focus on outcomes rather than outputs, enhancing PPIAF's identity as an autonomous multi- donor facility and improving impact measurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/43">Changes facilitated by the PPIAF often take a few years to deliver the anticipated improvements to the enabling environment. This has made it difficult to assess direct poverty impact to date. Improving impact measurement is an issue that is currently being addressed. One proposal is that PPIAF activity should be more closely anchored to planned infrastructure projects. Further work is in hand to gauge the impact of PPIAF activity on the International Financial Corporation's national 'doing business' ratings that address various aspects of the enabling environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/44">DFID is an active member of the PPIAF's Program Council and we are involved in discussions about the strategic direction of the PPIAF. Over the past couple of years, DFID and other donors have sought to encourage the PPIAF to make better progress on measuring the impact of its activities on poverty alleviation and to better co-ordinate its activity with others.</p>

	<p pid="a.57W.2/2">The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI) alliance board recently approved US$15 million for the completion of clinical trials of rotavirus vaccines in Africa and Asia during the period 2006-09. Furthermore, the board requested the development of an 'investment case' for the introduction of rotavirus vaccine, to be submitted to the November 2006 joint meeting of the GAVI alliance and GAVI fund boards. If approved, GAVI would finance rotavirus vaccine in GAVI-eligible countries (those with GNI of below $1000 p.a). The request for an investment case clearly signals GAVI's interest in supporting rotavirus vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="a.57W.2/3">DFID is a strong supporter of GAVI. We have committed &pound;68.5 million between 2000-08. Our main approach to financing GAVI over the next decade is through the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm). The IFFIm is expected to provide GAVI with $4 billion over 10 years and DFID has committed to provide one third of the finance required to deliver this (approximately &pound;1.38 billion to 2025).</p>
	<p pid="a.57W.2/4">DFID plans to sign a memorandum of understanding with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh for &pound;7.5 million core funding for five years. This includes funding their work on a new oral vaccine for rota virus.</p>

	<p pid="a.59W.2/1">The health impacts of tobacco use in developing countries are of increasing concern. By 2030, tobacco will be responsible for ten million deaths per year, and 70 per cent. of these deaths will be in the developing world. The UK is taking action to address this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.2/2">Firstly, the UK played a key role in negotiating and ratifying the WHO'S Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which sets international standards on tobacco price and tax increases, tobacco advertising and sponsorship, labelling, illicit trade and second-hand smoke among others. Secondly, we have recently given the International Development Research Centre a &pound;1.1 million grant over 3 years for research into effective tobacco control policies and programmes that will minimize the threat of tobacco production and consumption to health and human development in developing countries.

	<p pid="a.74W.2/1">Code of practice A issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 regulates contacts with the police and the public in the exercise of police powers to stop and search.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.2/2">Code A requires that a record of the stop or stop and search must be made at the time unless there are exceptional circumstances. If the record is not given at the time, the person must be notified by the officer of their entitlement to a record if requested within 12 months and informed how a copy can be obtained. The decision to retain records after that period is a matter for individual chief officers, irrespective of whether the record relates to an adult or a juvenile and the outcome of the stop or stop and search.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.2/3">Code A does not make special provision for the handling of a stop or stop and search involving a person under the age of 17 years old. Officers exercising these powers must do so fairly, responsibly and with respect for people being stopped or stopped and searched. It would be whether any additional support or action would be required owing to the vulnerability of the individual; and guidance due for publication this summer by the National Centre for Policing Excellence highlights the need for officers to take account of the person's age and vulnerability .</p>

	<p pid="a.75W.2/2">At present, improvement in literacy and numeracy for adults in custody is measured by reference to their overall contribution towards the Government's Skills for Life targets by counting the qualifications achieved. For young offenders and juveniles in custody, the Youth Justice Board measures improvement by those serving custodial sentences of more than six months through an assessment at the start and end of the sentence that shows what they have achieved, and whether or not they have gained a qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.2/3">As new Learning and Skills Council-led delivery arrangements for offender learning are introduced across England from <phrase class="date" code="">31 July</phrase>, data on individual achievement by offenders will start to become available for adults, young offenders and juveniles in custody, and on those serving sentences in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.2/4">A system of star ratings exists for prison health services. This is based on a framework of measures, including prison self-assessments, external inspection reports and prisons' performance against key areas such as mental health and dental waiting times.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.2/5">Since April 2006, HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) and the Healthcare Commission haveworked in partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding. HMIP continues to inspect and report on the health outcomes for prisoners in all public sector establishments. The Healthcare Commission now assesses the effectiveness of primary care trusts' commissioning arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.75W.5/1">All public service schemes pay cash equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in respect of accrued rights in compliance with pensions law. Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there isa requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under Public Private Partnerships or Public Finance Initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.76W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department has not issued any advice in response to this case. However, The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) National Fingerprint Board has issued a document dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-04">4 April 2006</phrase> entitled 'Erroneous and disputed identifications: Learning from experience elsewhere'. This document is for guidance only and is not a policy document; it was circulated to all fingerprint bureau in police forces in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/2">The ACPO report referred to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary Scotland's inspection of the Scottish Criminal Records Office (SCRO) that commenced on April 2000. The key recommendations of the inspection report were that the SCRO should:</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/3" class="indent">Move towards a non-numeric standard;</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/4" class="indent">Reform management and scope demands for staff levels;</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/5" class="indent">Consider moving to a centralised model for a national fingerprint service;</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/6" class="indent">Have external provision and management of competency testing for experts to provide a sustainable and defensible programme;</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/7" class="indent">Move towards a competency-based standard for expert qualification that all fingerprint experts within the SCRO should undergo;</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/8" class="indent">Provide a common procedure to deal with failure in the course of competency testing; introduce an improved automated manual system of case tracking.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/9" class="indent">Produce national guidance on fingerprint standards and procedures and issue it to all fingerprint staff;</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/10" class="indent">Establish a national policy which encapsulates an independent review process to deal with all erroneous and disputed fingerprints.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.2/11">ACPO and the Home Office place a strong emphasis on ensuring forensic standards in fingerprinting. The Home Office will shortly be consulting about the creation of a forensic regulator (in accordance withthe evidence given by the then Minister of State, Andy Burnham, before the Science and Technology Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase>). The creation of the National Policing Improvement Agency through the Police and Justice Bill will also be very significant in providing an Agency dedicated to continuous improvement of policing, including the area of forensic science.</p>

	<p pid="a.77W.3/1">Police forces do not routinely provide the Home Office with information on specifically alcohol-related crime, and so it is difficult to gauge the effect of occasional events such as the World Cup on this. Police recorded crime statistics covering the period of the World Cup will be released in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.3/2">The Home Office funded an Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC) during the month preceding the World Cup. Part of the intention for this was to set the tone of acceptable behaviour during the competition itself. Results from this campaign will be released shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.3/3">Research has suggested a link between major sporting events and domestic violence. Because of this, a Domestic Violence Enforcement Campaign took place in some areas during the World Cup. Data from this campaign are still being collected and analysed, and the results will be released when they are ready.</p>

	<p pid="a.78W.3/1">The information requested is not collated centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost (code of practice on Access to Government Information, part 2, clause 9). The cost of a stamp is a post office cost. The cost of stationery is difficult to estimate but around &pound;1 when all the overheads in terms of posting, computer costs and paper are taken into consideration. Staff time varies considerably based on the length of the letter. It is impossible therefore to estimate an average cost for all the letters sent out.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.15/1">There is no compulsory retirement age for all coroners. However, coroners who held office immediately before April 6, 1978, and did not opt out of the statutory provisions, can be required by the relevant council to vacate office if they have completed 15 years service and attained the age of 65 years. Coroners' pensionable service under the applicable local government scheme will come to an end at the age of 70 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.84W.3/1">The following table shows the number of mortgage possession orders made in countycourts in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight (includes Aldershot and Farnham, Basingstoke, Portsmouth, Southampton, Winchester and Newport) since 1987. These are the only county courts in Hampshire andIsle of Wight that deal with mortgage repossession matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.3/2">The civil procedure rules provide that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, these county courts cover areas that are not necessarily consistent with other administrative or constituency boundaries, and therefore for instance repossessions at Portsmouth county court may relate to properties in other constituencies besides Portsmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.3/3">These figures do not indicate how many houses have been repossessed through the courts, since not all the orders will have resulted in the issue and execution of warrants of possession.</p>

Housing cases are considered a priority for funding, and the Funding Code criteria for legal representation in housing cases reflect this.

	<p pid="a.86W.20/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that criminal cases are dealt with in a speedy fashion commensurate with the interests of justice. In the DCA command paper 'A Fairer Deal for Legal Aid' we clearly stated our aim to improve the financial control and overall management of the highest cost cases, achieving more timely and effective disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.20/2">We have put in place a number of measures to work towards this aim, such as the High Cost Cases Review Board, a cross-CJS board which aims to bring greater scrutiny to the way that high cost cases are managed.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.20/3">The judiciary have also issued a number of protocols on the management of heavy fraud and other complex cases, terrorism cases and of the disclosure process, which are intended to ensure that judges actively case manage to minimise the length of trials, and that prosecution and defence teams comply with deadlines and directions.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.20/4">The Criminal Case Management Framework promotes robust judicial case management among operational practitioners and provides guidance as to how cases should be managed efficiently and effectively from pre-charge through to conclusion. The Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 add a degree of prescription to the practices outlined in the CCMF by ensuring that criminal cases are dealt with efficiently and expeditiously.</p>

	<p pid="a.89W.6/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) has an important role in the social exclusion agenda. We are promoting the benefits of good early advice services for those most in need. Evidence shows that this can prevent relatively simple civil legal issues spiralling into more complex problems. We are also encouraging closer working across Whitehall. Our role is crosscutting in highlighting the worth of advice services to Government colleagues. DCA is also the facilitating Department for other Government Departments that require a final remedy to be decided upon by a court or tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.6/2">Specialisation and innovation in the courts systemis also relevant. We are looking at both preventing crime through community justice initiatives, and re-integrating offenders into society. The Community Justice Centre in North Liverpool is spearheading such an approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.6/3">Another main area of influence is the role of family courts. The recent Review of the Child Care Proceedings System in England and Wales (produced jointly with DfES) aims to achieve better lives for children and their families by improving the care proceedings system and eliminating unnecessary delay in care cases, while ensuring that the process remains a fair one. The DCA is also a key player on the Domestic Violence Inter-Ministerial Group. There are currently 25 Specialist Domestic Violence (DV) courts. A bidding process is currently under way to establish a second tranche of these courts by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.2/1">Good, early advice services can prevent relatively simple civil legal issues developing into more complex and numerous problems. This is evidenced by the recent Legal Services Research Centre's &quot;Causesof Action&quot; publication, which also highlights the tendency for inter-related problems to develop around a key theme (broadly around 'family', 'homelessness' and 'economic' clusters). The Legal Services Commission's new Community Legal Service Strategy is informed by this research, and proposes that newly created Community Legal Advice Centres are located in areas of high deprivation in order to target the most vulnerable. My Department's recent Getting earlier, better advice to vulnerable people document underlines the need for ensuring advice is people focussed, with problems not being considered in isolation. It also highlights the importance of getting advice right first time, and ensuring more effective referral networks are in place so that people get the service they need regardless of their point of access to the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.5/1">As part of its role in delivering legal aid, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) considers the need for its services to help prevent social exclusion. The LSC can play its part by ensuring that services are better co-ordinated, focussed and effective, and that acts of advice/assistance increase. The new Community Legal Service (CLS) Strategy proposes that Community Legal Advice Centres (CLACs) are located in areas of high deprivation in order to target the most vulnerable. In less densely populated areas Community Legal Advice Networks (CLANs) will ensure that clients are able to access a range of high quality advice services regardless of their geographic location. Community Legal Service Direct also allows easy access for clients. The new CLS Strategy, in proposing that CLACs and CLANs will cover all five areas of social welfare law (Community Care, Housing, Debt, Employment and Welfare Benefits), will further promote social inclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.93W.7/1">My Department sees maintaining the pre-eminent position of London within the global art market as vitally important. Through Arts Council England, we have invested around &pound;480,000 of lottery capital funding into London studio spaces for artists. The Arts Council also supports a number of art fairs, including the Frieze Art Fair which last yearattracted 31,497 people, encouraging new buyersfor contemporary art and leading to &pound;32 million of sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.7/2">My Department sponsors a number of museums and galleries, a number of which have important contemporary collections. The Arts Council has also stimulated public interest in contemporary art through its Own Art Scheme, which offers interest free loans to open up the market to a wider range of people. Own Art, although primarily focused on the regions, is to be expanded to involve a number of art colleges in London.</p>

In addition, by 2010 all children will be offered a further two to three hours of sport every week. We are also putting in place competition managers so that all pupils can compete individually or in teams. 20 managers have been in post since September 2005 and the next wave will be in place by September 2006.

However, should English Heritage's plans for a new visitor centre and access arrangements at Stonehenge go ahead, along with the published scheme for improvements to the A303, it is estimated that visitor numbers are likely to stay the same as at present. Any increase in visitor spending is likely to be balanced by the cost of operating the new facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.105W.2/1">Access to good quality sporting provision, including swimming pools, is essential if we are to encourage people to lead healthier, more active lives. There has been significant public investment in sports facilities in recent years&mdash;by 2006 over &pound;1 billion of exchequer and lottery funding will have been committed to develop over 4,000 new or refurbished facilities. Swimming has been the single greatest beneficiary of sport lottery funding, having received some &pound;249 million since 1997. Peterborough has benefited from 31 awards totalling &pound;699,823.</p>

However, Sport England are encouraging and helping local authorities through the development of swimming strategies and toolkits to aid strategic planning. According to the Active Places database (available at <a href="http://www.activeplaces.com">www.activeplaces.com</a>) there are 14 swimming pools within a 10 mile radius of Peterborough.</p>

	<p pid="a.106W.6/1">At its meeting in December 2005 the Commission gave outline approval to the NAO's proposed refurbishment of its headquarters building in Buckingham Palace Road, London, subject, however, to three conditions. First, that the NAO should produce a detailed, fully costed business case for the project. Second, that the NAO should carry out a cost-benefit analysis of an alternative approach to its accommodation requirements, namely moving its headquarters to a North of England location. And third, that the NAO should provide a fuller explanation of its decision to rule out the possibility of acquiring alternative accommodation in London as part of the Government estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.6/2">At its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-04">4 July 2006</phrase>, the Commission considered the NAO's response under each of those headings.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.6/3" class="italic"> The Business Case</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.6/4">The business case produced by the NAO gives the total cost of the project as &pound;77.44 million, spread over five years starting in 2006-07. In the longer term, there will be a small increase in annual resource costs to the NAO, resulting from higher business rates, capital charges and depreciation, partially offset by reduced running costs through greater building efficiency. Since submitting its original proposals the NAO has revised its approach to the decanting of staff which will be necessary while the building work is in progress. It is now hoped to carry this out in a single rather than a two or three stage process, depending on the availability of suitable decant accommodation. On the basis of the business case, the NAO made a persuasive argument in support of refurbishment as the most cost-effective way of avoiding what would otherwise be&mdash;because of the building's current deficiencies&mdash;an unacceptable risk to the Office's continued ability to function efficiently. The Commission was, however, conscious of the sensitivity surrounding the timing of the project, since, under the NAO's plans, the bulk of the expenditure would occur in the year's covered by the next, and potentially difficult, comprehensive spending review. We therefore pressed the NAO on the implications of deferring the project (which, because of the need to avoid coinciding with the competing demands on the construction industry from Olympics-related activity, would entail a delay until 2013). The NAO satisfied the Commission that, given the deteriorating condition of the current building, waiting a further seven years before undertaking remedial work would pose an unacceptable risk to the NAO's operations and therefore to the service it provides to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.6/5" class="italic"> The Possibility of Relocating to the North of England</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.6/6">In response to the Commission's request, the NAO examined Manchester as a possible location for a provincial headquarters building. Of a number of cities considered, Manchester was judged to come nearest to meeting the Office's principal requirements: good transport connections; and a sufficiently large local pool of qualified accountants to enable the NAO to recruit and retain key professional staff. On the latter count, the available pool in Manchester, though large in comparison with other provincial cities, is much smaller than London's and is insufficient to support the NAO's requirements. The cost-benefit analysis carried out by the NAO indicated that the basic costs associated with relocating would be broadly similar to those for the option of staying on in a refurbished Buckingham Palace Road. On the other hand, the analysis suggested that the uncertainty over the number of staff who would be willing to relocate posed a risk both of additional, but unquantifiable costs of redundancy and resettlement packages, and of disruption of core business activity. The Commission was satisfied that, for these reasons, relocation was not a realistic option. The NAO is, however, proposing to expand its presence in the North, concentrating on its existing team in Newcastle.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.6/7" class="italic"> Alternative Accommodation in London</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.6/8">As part of its consideration of alternative sites in London for its headquarters building, the NAO has examined the portfolio of vacant, or about to become vacant, properties maintained by the Office of Government Commerce. The NAO's assessment, which the Commission accepted, is that there is at present no building available of a size and configuration to meet the NAO's requirements on a long term basis, and at a cost competitive with the headquarters refurbishment option, taking account of the resultant loss of the current peppercorn rent. Taking all these factors into account, and having carefully considered the NAO's business case, the Commission gave its formal approval to the proposed refurbishment of the Buckingham Palace Road building. The Commission noted that, depending on how quickly the refurbishment work can begin, it may be necessary for the NAO to submit a supplementary estimate for the financial year 2006-07. The Commission will consider any such request if and when it is received. In the meantime, the Commission looks to the Treasury to make room within the public expenditure envelope for the relevant years for the resources needed for the refurbishment. For its part, the Commission will monitor carefully the progress of the project against both time and budget.</p>

In addition, the Government received 104 expressions of interest in January 2005 for the remaining &pound;166 million of CIF funding. These were reviewed and in March 2005 the Government announced that 48 schemes would be invited to prepare full bids. Following detailed assessment of the bids received, 25 schemes have been allocated CIF funding, with a further six schemes receiving Department for Communities and Local Government funding.

	<p pid="a.129W.3/1">Graphite brick cracking is a well known life-limiting feature of British Energy's advanced gas-cooled reactors, and all of these reactors are undergoing the same degradation process at varying rates. All of the UK's nuclear power stations are subject to robust regulation by the independent regulator, HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), and I am advised on nuclear safety matters by the NII's Chief Inspector.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.3/2">I am satisfied that the NII would not allow any nuclear power station to continue to operate if there was an unacceptable risk to the general public.</p>

In addition, the funding will support the development of partnerships to run campaigns in specific industry sectors, emphasising the role of enterprise in the successful start up and growth of companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.3/1">The Government consider that the world's oil resources are sufficient to prevent global total oil production peaking before 2030, by which time the International Energy Agency's reference case scenario in its 2005 World Energy Outlook shows global oil demand reaching 115.4 million barrel per day, nearly 40 per cent. higher than current levels. The exact levels and years of the peaks in global conventional and total oil production will depend on assumptions about a number of factors, including the rate of global oil demand growth, the rate of investment in the global oil sector, and technological developments in finding and producing oil.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.3/2">Market mechanisms will ration the remaining global supplies of oil and provide the incentive for a shift to alternative sources of energy. This process needs to be supported by Governments. The UK Government are already putting in place policies that will help ease the UK economy away from power supplied primarily through fossil fuels and is also promoting international efforts, for example through the G8 Gleneagles Plan of Action, to develop cleaner energy technologies and promote energy efficiency.</p>

However, net exports of refined oil products meant that the UK remained a net exporter of overall oil (crude, NGLs, feedstocks, and refined products). Details are given in tables 3.1 and 3.2 of the June 2006 version of UK Energy Trends available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/trends/index.html">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/trends/index.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.144W.2/1">The Government introduced statutory controls on spam emails by means of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which was enacted on<phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>. The regulations provide a first line of defence against spam originating in the EU where the recipient has no knowledge of the advertiser of the products being marketed. The regulations require that spam must not be sent to an individual subscriber without prior permission or unless there is a previous relationship between the parties. The regulations can be enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the EU. There is regular contact between my Department, the Department of Constitutional Affairs and the Information Commissioner's Office on the operation of these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.2/2">The Government recognise that most spam does not come from the UK and has therefore extensively promoted international co-operation. A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase> between the enforcement authorities of the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, to reduce the problem by working together to investigate those sending spam. The UK also plays a leading role in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s Anti Spam Task Force and other multilateral initiatives. In late 2004, the UK launched the world's first and only anti-spam enforcement network, the London Action Plan, which now spans five continents and includes authorities and industry from countries particularly affected by this issue, such as Nigeria, China and India.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.2/3">The end user has a role to play in acting to avoid being a target for those sending spam, as well as acting to filter spam. Information has been made available to the public and to business by the DTI, the Information Commissioner's Office, the Office of Fair Trading as well as a number of sites provided by service and software providers. These messages have been reinforced by the Get Safe Online initiative launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>. This is an initiative between Government and Industry to help individuals and businesses protect themselves against internet threats, including spam.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.2/4">Our response to the problem of spam continues to develop. I have taken careful note of the views of the Information Commissioner's Office on the powers available to him, and DTI officials are working with the Information Commissioner's Office on this matter. The Government are actively considering whether to revise the relevant legislation. DTI officials have a continuing dialogue with internet service providers regarding steps that can be taken to reduce spam. We also continue our efforts to achieve greater international co-operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.147W.2/1">Despite sustained benefits from liberalised energy markets over the past decade, the Government fully appreciates that high energy prices do create problems for the competitiveness of industry, and takes very seriously the potential loss of jobs and investment. The Government are leaving no stone unturned, working closely with industry, to find solutions and reduce the impact. The new Business Energy Forum, co-chaired by the Secretary of State and Richard Lambert of the CBI, met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase> and is monitoring this work and looking at other strategic energy issues impacting on business. Higher energy prices in the UK reflect higher global prices, caused by rising demand and supply constraints (for oil and gas), the lack of EU energy market liberalisation, and domestic factors, such as the tight winter supply demand balance in the UK gas market.</p>
	<p pid="a.147W.2/2">The importance of the Government's activity in pushing for European energy market liberalisation was highlighted in a Global Insight report in 2005. The report estimated that the lack of effective liberalisation and the dominance of oil-linked long-term supply contracts in Europe would cost UK industrial consumers of gas some &pound;2.6 billion over the following year. Ofgem analysis suggests that the cost to UK gas consumers of Interconnector flows not always being in line with price signals during the last winter was&pound;1.5 billion and would cost &pound;3 billion if repeated during the coming winter. The European Commission has been active in reviewing competition in gas and electricity markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.147W.2/3">During the past two years there have been several investigations and reports into competition in UK gas and electricity markets. These include the Ofgem gas price probe, and two inquiries from the Trade and Industry Select Committee. The Ofgem gas price probe found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in the UK gas market. More recently, Ofgem published a &quot;Domestic Retail Market Report&quot;, which concluded that, &quot;competition remains effective and vigorous in all segments of the domestic energy market.&quot; Independent research by Oxera concluded that in 2004 the UK had the most competitive electricity and gas markets inthe EU and G7 (available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file28425.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/files/file28425.pdf</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.2/1">There has been a substantial fall in UK-Zimbabwe trade in recent years. In 2000, UK and Zimbabwe two-way trade amounted to &pound;143 million. Imports from Zimbabwe were mainly agricultural products with tobacco, making up approximately31 per cent. of the total imports. Exports were mainly manufactured goods, with office machines and ADP equipment topping the table at &pound;5.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/2">By 2005, two-way trade had fallen to &pound;66 million. The principal change was in tobacco imports, which fell to &pound;4.8 million from &pound;31 million in 2000 down85 per cent. Exports also fell, with the leading export, road vehicles, topping the table at &pound;3.5 million. The decline in trade can be attributed to the policies of the Government of Zimbabwe which have brought about the fall of both imports and exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/3">A breakdown of UK exports and imports by sector for 2004 and 2005 is shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/4">HMG have not imposed any economic sanctions or restrictions on doing business in Zimbabwe and two-way trade continues, although as the aforementioned figures show, at a substantially reduced level. It is our view that economic sanctions would harm the people of Zimbabwe at a time of humanitarian crisis, while having very little impact on the ZANU (PF) leadership. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered enough.</p>
