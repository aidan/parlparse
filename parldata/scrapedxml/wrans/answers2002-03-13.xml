	<p pid=".1073W.0/1">In the north-west, around 230,000 people have gained from the national minimum wage; the working families tax credit makes work pay for nearly 180,000 families. The minimum income guarantee ensures single pensioners will receive &pound;100 a week by 2003 and more than 1.4 million pensioners have seen the biggest rise in basic state pension for a generation.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.0/2">Following the Social Exclusion Unit's reports, local partnerships are harnessing the power of all the sectors to tackle the problems of deprived neighbourhoods supported by new minimum standards for mainstream services.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.0/3">The Government Offices for the Regions administer programmes to tackle deprivation and poverty. For example, the north-west receives &pound;243 million through the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund.</p>

	<p pid=".1073W.3/1">The National Strategy for neighbourhood renewal action plan was published by the Social Exclusion Unit in 2001. Its goal is to ensure that no one is seriously disadvantaged by where they live within 10&ndash;20 years and to narrow the gap between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest. Many of the most deprived neighbourhoods are in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.3/2">The strategy addresses the wider causes of poverty and social exclusion with targets to improve employment levels, educational attainment, health and housing and to reduce crime in the most deprived neighbourhoods. This is backed up by substantial investment. The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, based in Department for Transport Local Government and the Regions, is responsible for taking this forward. The Government Offices for the Regions work with the NRU and other Departments to administer specific programmes like the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.3/3">The SEU continues to work with all Government departments to ensure that social exclusion issues are addressed.</p>

Mandate is a central computer based record of information for almost all civil servants in the home civil service. For some Departments and agencies, summary figures are provided in a manual return, which may not always be fully consistent with Mandate information, for example, because of minor differences in timing.

	<p pid=".1093W.2/1">I have today placed in the Libraries of both Houses a report to me on homelessness entitled &quot;More than a Roof&quot; together with my response to it.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/2">The serious and growing problem of homelessness needs to be addressed if this Government is to achieve our aim to ensure that everyone has access to a decent home.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/3">Although many members of the public think homeless people are only those they see on the streets, homelessness is more complicated. As this new report makes clear, it is more than simply being without a roof.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/4">There are still some people sleeping on the street but there are even more people living in night shelters and hostels, and there are thousands of families living in temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/5">Over 6,000 families are bringing up their children in bed and breakfast hotels. The damage caused to those children may live with them into adult life. But certainly living in a cramped room without anywhere to do their homework or to play does not give them the start in life they deserve.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/6">To tackle this we need a new approach. One that concentrates as much on the people as on the places that they live. That is what &quot;More than a roof&quot; proposes. We accept it. There are six key objectives that underpin our new approach.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/7" class="indent">1. To strengthen help to people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/8" class="indent">2. To develop more strategic approaches to tackling homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/9" class="indent">3. To encourage new responses to tackling homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/10" class="indent">4. To reduce the use of B&amp;B hotels for homeless families with children.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/11" class="indent">5. To sustain the two-thirds reduction in rough sleeping.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/12" class="indent">6. To ensure the opportunity of a decent home for all.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/13">While plans and objectives are critical, they can only work if underpinned with resources. Over the next year, we will spend a total of &pound;125 million on tackling homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/14">I have established a new Homelessness Directorate that will comprise the Bed and Breakfast Unit, currently in the Government Office for London, the former Rough Sleepers Unit, and a new unit to assist local authorities in tackling homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/15">The Homelessness Directorate will join-up policy at a national level. The Rough Sleepers Unit had a cross- cutting brief to work with other Government Departments with champion Ministers and a ministerial committee to support their work. I have asked Lord Falconer to chair a new ministerial committee on homelessness to oversee the new approach.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/16">The new Homelessness Act will bring about radical change in the way that central and local government, and all other partners, work together to tackle homelessness. For the first time ever, local authorities will be required to carry out a review and develop a strategy for their area that prevents homelessness and provides solutions for people who are, or who may become, homeless.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/17">In addition to the help provided to local authorities by the new Homelessness Directorate, a range of measures are being established to help local authorities respond to this new duty.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/18">I have published today &quot;Homelessness Strategies&mdash;a good practice handbook&quot;, a document which provides a framework for local authorities, and all key local agencies, to work together.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/19">Also, my Department will contribute to a series of seminars to help organisations prepare for the new Homelessness Act. Organised in partnership with the Chartered Institute of Housing, the Local Government Association, Shelter and others, they will focus on practical implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/20">We are determined to ensure that vulnerable people leaving institutions, young people including those coming out of care, and people fleeing domestic, racial and other forms of violence, are helped effectively. Although this may mean that the number of people who local authorities accept as homeless increases, I am more concerned to ensure vulnerable people get the help they need.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/21">Therefore we will be issuing a revised statutory Code of Guidance on Allocations and Homelessness, reflecting changes brought about by the new Homelessness Act and our proposed Priority Needs Order.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/22">I will allocate additional resources in order to help local authorities deliver the new Priority Needs Order. I am also considering making &quot;tackling homelessness&quot; a future Beacon council theme.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/23">But we also need to understand more about the most effective ways to tackle homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/24">In order to do this, the Homelessness Directorate will investigate the underlying causes and trends of homelessness, collect information more effectively and test new and innovative approaches which can be taken to reduce and prevent homelessness. I have asked for a progress report on this work in the autumn outlining what future action can be taken.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/25">An important part of the Homelessness Directorate's work will be to encourage best practice. Where public resources fund services, it is vital that the taxpayer gets value for money. The use of local targets and protocols, such as reducing the number of tenancy breakdowns or ensuring appropriate numbers of lettings to homeless households, will be important.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/26">There are many people living in very different sorts of hostels across the country, and with the onset of &quot;Supporting People&quot;, it will be important to ensure that best practice is established across all publicly funded hostels. I am keen, therefore, to ensure that hostels are inspected in a structured way by either the voluntary or statutory sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/27">Although many former rough sleepers have now moved into shelters, hostels, or their own homes, they still need help to rebuild their lives away from the streets. We must also continue to do everything we can to help those people who sleep rough, while at the same time prevent new people from ending up on the streets.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/28">This is why we will allocate over &pound;30 million during 2002&ndash;03&mdash;the same level of revenue investment that delivered the two-thirds reduction in rough sleeping.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/29">No one in this country wants their fellow citizens to have to sleep in a cardboard box at night because they have nowhere else to go. In the same way, we should not tolerate children being forced to stay in over-crowded and expensive B&amp;B hotels for weeks, months, and sometimes years, on end.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/30">Today, I am making a commitment that by March 2004 local authorities will ensure that no homeless family with children has to live in a B&amp;B hotel except in an emergency.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/31">There may be exceptional circumstances, where some families have specific needs, or when the local authority is still processing a homelessness application, where B&amp;B hotels of an acceptable standard may be used for a limited period. But I believe this should only happen where no reasonable alternative exists, and should not be for any more than six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/32">In order to help local authorities achieve this target, we are making a number of changes.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/33">Jointly with Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, I am announcing changes to housing benefit rules to boost incentives for private sector leasing by local authorities and housing associations.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/34">As these changes will take time to make the impact we want, we are introducing urgent measures to ensure that children are not forced to live in B&amp; B hotels any longer than is absolutely necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/35">Therefore &pound;35 million will be allocated during 2002&ndash;03 on a range of alternatives to using B&amp;B hotels.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/36">In order to ensure that local authorities do not use B&amp;B hotels inappropriately in the future, we will revise the statutory guidance on homelessness. We will also ensure that, in the exceptional circumstances where it is used, it is of a reasonable standard.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/37">I am also concerned that children and babies placed in temporary accommodation, including B&amp;B hotels, should not miss out on important health care to give them a proper start in life. My Department is today issuing new advice to housing authorities on the arrangements that I consider should be put in place to ensure that all babies and children placed in temporary accommodation receive their health and developmental checks from health visitors and other primary health care professionals.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/38">This Government is determined to tackle homelessness more effectively and to work in partnership with organisations and individuals across the country to make a real difference to the lives of homeless people.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/39">Today we make a significant contribution towards achieving this objective and help build a Britain, which is modern, fair, and strong.</p>

	<p pid=".1100W.8/1">The courts already have robust sentencing powers for offences of assault. The maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm or wounding with intent to cause such harm is life imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offences of causing grievous bodily harm in the absence of intent to do so and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is five years' imprisonment. Common assault attracts a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.8/2">Specific sentencing provisions for vulnerable groups would not only make criminal law more complex but contradict the important principle that the law is there to protect all members of our society. However, in passing sentence, the courts, as a matter of general principle, regard the fact that an offence has been committed against a vulnerable person as an aggravating factor that would ordinarily be persuasive of a more severe sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.8/3">There is no room for complacency. However, the Government are uncompromising in their response to serious and dangerous offenders. We believe that prison sentences must be as long as is necessary to punish and to protect the public. And where release eventually occurs, supervision must ensure that the risks are rigorously managed in the community for as long as necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.8/4">That is why we are looking seriously at the Halliday proposal for tougher determinate sentences for sex and violent offenders that will ensure they stay in prison, up to the full term if necessary, so long as they continue to present a risk of harm to our communities and that they are subject to strict and extended supervision on release.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.8/5">We are also considering a requirement that where a life sentence is an option judges should not shy away from using it if the professional evidence shows that there is a clear risk that the offender will commit further sex offences. We want greater clarity and transparency, with indeterminate sentences given to serious offenders where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.8/6">The Government are also taking forward work to create a set of sentencing guidelines which are easily accessible and which command the respect of the judiciary, practitioners and the wider public.</p>

	<p pid=".1103W.5/1">The Home Office does not keep records of those convicted of offences abroad, including those involving a sexual element, who have returned to the United Kingdom. We are therefore unable to supply figures for the last three years.</p>
	<p pid=".1103W.5/2">Mechanisms already exist for the monitoring and controlling of dangerous offenders who come to the UK after having been convicted of an offence abroad.</p>
	<p pid=".1103W.5/3">The Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 imposed in relation to any area, a statutory duty on the chief officer of police and the local probation board to establish arrangements for assessing and managing the risks posed by persons who may cause serious harm to the public. This would include those convicted abroad.</p>
	<p pid=".1103W.5/4">If someone falls into this category, for example if a person who has been convicted of a violent offence with a sexual element abroad returns to this country, these multi-agency public protection arrangements will come into play.</p>
	<p pid=".1103W.5/5">Multi-agency public protection arrangements provide for the risk assessment of all potentially dangerous offenders. Following this a management plan is formulated according to the level and nature of risk that the offender poses. Typically, this would have components of monitoring, interventions designed to reduce re-offending and steps necessary to protect victims or potential victims. After the risk assessment, if it is in the interest of public protection, the police may also disclose information about the offender to relevant members of the community. Social Service departments who are the lead agency for child protection are members of the multi-agency public protection panels.</p>
	<p pid=".1103W.5/6">The review to the Sex Offenders Act 1997 looked at requiring those convicted of sex offences abroad to register on their arrival in the UK. The Government have asked for consultation and responses are currently being analysed to decide what appropriate action, if any, the Government should take.</p>

	<p pid=".1105W.3/1">There are no national guidelines to police forces on dealing with domestic violence among their staff or on action to be taken in respect of staff committing acts of domestic violence. Many forces do however have local policies and guidelines detailing how to deal with officers who are alleged to have committed domestic violence offences.</p>
	<p pid=".1105W.3/2">Police forces and authorities keep disciplinary records for individual officers, but there is no central guidance on what should be recorded, other than information that is returned to the Home Office for monitoring purposes. These centrally held figures do not separately identify numbers of police personnel who were subject to disciplinary action in respect of domestic violence, or the number of incidents concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".1105W.3/3">Work is however in progress to ensure that police forces respond effectively to any indication that police staff may be perpetrating domestic violence. This includes a redraft of note C of the Code of Conduct of the Police Regulations 1999 which concerns off duty conduct. Regional professional standards practitioners within police forces have suggested that this amended section will strengthen their powers when dealing with personnel who have allegedly perpetrated domestic violence.</p>

	<p pid=".1107W.2/1">The conclusions of the European Council meeting held at Laeken identified areas in which further work is needed in order to progress towards a common European policy on asylum and immigration. The commitment made at Tampere to establish a common European asylum system is a top priority for the United Kingdom (UK). The treaty of Amsterdam committed member states to a broad range of measures designed to establish minimum standards for asylum procedures and policies across the Union within five years. The UK is participating actively in this process and has opted into all measures to date. We judge there are significant potential long-term benefits for the UK in terms of levelling the playing field across the Union.</p>

Bristol, East, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken since 1997 to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Claimant count unemployment in the constituency, for example, fell by over 737, or 21 per cent., between May 1997 and May 1998; and has fallen by a further 900, or 32 per cent., since May 1998 <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid=".1112W.8/2">Macroeconomic stability is being complemented at the microeconomic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay for lower and middle income families, and to reduce child poverty. The Government are also committed to enabling all persons to share in the country's rising prosperity. The numbers of beneficiaries of the new deal, the working families tax credit, child benefit, state retirement pension, winter fuel payments, free TV licences and minimum income guarantee in the Bristol, East constituency are given in the table. These data are also available in the Library of the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid=".1117W.2/1">The overall cost of running the House administration (excluding capital works, etc.) in 2000&ndash;01 was some &pound;103 million, giving an average daily cost of the order of &pound;280,000. The difference in cost between a sitting day and a non-sitting day is negligible: the major costs, of accommodation and staffing, are not affected appreciably by sitting times. These figures do not include the cost of paying Members' salaries or allowances, which are not normally regarded as part of the cost of running the House itself.</p>

	<p pid=".1120W.5/2">The available information on the breakdown of incidents in the last five years is set out in the table. The figures reflect the improvements that have been made in recent years in gathering statistics on incidents. In recent years a possible under-reporting of incidents concerned both management and trade unions. An improved reporting form was introduced in April 1999, followed by a campaign by the Public and Commercial Services Union on reporting during 2000. The rise in reported incidents in the years from 1999 reflects this. As well as verbal abuse or threatening behaviour, non-physical incidents include cases of customers fighting or arguing with each other, in which no member of staff was involved, and occasions when only equipment or furniture was damaged. Employment Service offices are visited by around 25 million people per year and Benefits Agency offices by around 20 million.</p>

For example, we have introduced Ambition: Construction which is designed to help meet skill shortages and help 1,000 long-term unemployed people into construction jobs.

	<p pid=".1123W.5/1">We will provide extra funding through the housing benefit subsidy system, worth around &pound;10 million in 2002&ndash;03, to help local authorities house homeless people in self-contained temporary accommodation rather than in bed and breakfast hotels.</p>
	<p pid=".1123W.5/2">Under current rules for temporary accommodation, the Department for Work and Pensions refunds 95 per cent. (the normal &quot;full&quot; subsidy rate) of any housing benefit that authorities pay on rents up to their subsidy threshold. Rents above the subsidy threshold up to the cap are reimbursed at 12.5 per cent., while there is no subsidy at all for rents above the cap.</p>
	<p pid=".1123W.5/3">From April 2002, we will raise the 12.5 per cent. reimbursement rate to 95 per cent. for leased and licensed accommodation, while keeping it unchanged for bed and breakfasts.</p>
	<p pid=".1123W.5/4">Paying full subsidy up to the cap should make private sector leasing an affordable option even in expensive areas, building on the significant increase in thresholds and caps that we introduced last year. It will give councils a major incentive to shift away from using bed and breakfast accommodation, benefiting thousands of homeless families. And we are considering strengthening that incentive further from April 2003, once authorities have had time to respond to the new arrangements: for example, by reducing the 12.5 per cent. subsidy on bed and breakfast rents.</p>

But we will not force people with disabilities into work and people who are eligible for Incapacity Benefit will receive it.</p>

	<p pid=".1126W.2/1">People who claim a state incapacity benefit will at some point have their entitlement reviewed under the personal capability assessment (PCA). A lack of good quality information about a customer's medical condition can in some cases mean that seriously ill people, who should be completely exempted from the PCA procedures, are not identified as early as they could be. We also believe that better quality medical information would enable more customers to be correctly assessed under the PCA without the need for a medical examination.</p>
	<p pid=".1126W.2/2">Currently the customer's own doctor, usually their general practitioner (GP) will be asked to provide the Department's medical officer with a short factual report or a special statement containing clinical details. Working in collaboration with the Department's contractor, SchlumbergerSema Medical Services, we are currently piloting an alternative evidence gathering procedure in the Sheffield and Rotherham areas. With the permission of customers and GPs in the pilot areas, we are testing whether using GP medical records will provide the Department's medical officer with better factual information to advise the decision maker. We will be carefully evaluating this pilot to see whether there are benefits in terms of improved customer service and more robust and accurate decision making. The evaluation will be used to inform any future decisions on the use of GP casenotes in relation to benefit assessments.</p>

However, further progress on the remaining 10 eligible countries (Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan and Togo) will be difficult, as they either are affected by conflict or have governance problems.

	<p pid=".1129W.9/1">Afghanistan has long been one of the countries most severely affected by land mines and Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). In the year 2000 an average of about 88 mine and UXO casualties were recorded each month. During 2000 a total of approximately 13,500 antipersonnel mines, 600 anti-tank mines and 300,000 items of UXO were destroyed.</p>
	<p pid=".1129W.9/2">The onset of hostilities after <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase> meant that mine clearance operations were badly disrupted by the departure of international staff and the threat to the safety of mine action personnel, forcing it to significantly curtail its operations. The Mine Action Programme for Afghanistan (MAPA) is now completing a period of retraining and is resuming operations wherever possible. In many areas mine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance operations have returned close to the level that existed before <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase>. In addition, the process of expanding capacity to address the UXO threat has begun. The priorities for UNMAS in 2002 are the execution of emergency operations throughout the country and a subsequent return to 100 per cent. operational capacity, and to expand mine clearance capacity as resources become available.</p>

	<p pid=".1130W.5/1">Emergency food provision in Afghanistan is primarily channelled through the UN World Food Programme (WFP). Needs have been met in most areas, but there remain pockets of unmet need in places difficult to access due to poor weather and insecurity. Badghis province is one of the most remote and seriously drought-affected areas in Afghanistan. Parts of Badghis are extremely difficult to access in the winter months.</p>

Remote areas in the west of Afghanistan have received enough food to last up to the end of March.</p>
	<p pid=".1130W.5/3">In addition, WFP is deploying six helicopter-borne rapid assessment teams for assessment and delivery of emergency aid to remote areas, including parts of Badghis province. The teams are tasked with streamlining food aid operations, assessing health conditions, investigating non-food emergency needs, monitoring food distribution and verifying reports by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on earlier food deliveries. If necessary, the helicopters will also allow WFP to airlift a limited amount of food aid on an emergency basis.</p>

	<p pid=".1136W.0/1">In their consultation document &quot;Building a Strategy for Children and Young People&quot;, the Government are seeking views on the establishment of Children and Young People's Strategic Partnerships as a vehicle for coordinating planning activity for children's services. These partnerships would bring together the full breadth of partners and services across the voluntary, community, statutory and business sectors, which impact on the lives of children and young people.</p>
	<p pid=".1136W.0/2">Later this year, the findings from a multi-inspectorate inspection of children's safeguards will be published. The inspection is looking specifically at safeguards for children in eight local authority areas, including the effectiveness of Area Child Protection Committees. The findings from both of these exercises will be of assistance in determining the most effective ways of coordinating services, including services for child protection. Any consideration of the effectiveness of child protection services will need to take into account the findings of the inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbie, which is due to report later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".1138W.2/2">The combined MMR vaccine was introduced as a replacement to the single measles vaccine and parents were advised to get their children immunised with the combined MMR vaccination. Single measles vaccine remained available for a short transitional period until the manufacturers of the vaccine advised the Department of Health that they no longer intended to supply single measles vaccine to the UK. Rubella vaccine remained part of the school girls immunisation programme until 1994 when it was discontinued. However, rubella vaccine remains available for rubella susceptible women and health care workers. Single mumps vaccine has never been routinely available.</p>

In a study of individuals aged two to over 40 years, the average age at diagnosis was five years for autism and 11 years for Asperger disorder. Age at diagnosis is likely, however, to vary greatly by region (according to services available), by year (with age at diagnosis falling in many places) and by the nature of the autistic spectrum disorder (with high-functioning, and perhaps severely intellectually impaired, people being diagnosed later).&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1147W.9/2">There is not a specific budget for information technology investment. The majority of costs are met from the baseline allocations made via health authorities. Health communities then make their investment decisions based on local priority. These investments are not aggregated at a national level but have been estimated at &pound;800 million per year&mdash;this estimate includes a very broad spectrum of costs including maintenance of finance and other administrative systems.</p>
	<p pid=".1147W.9/3">Some new funds have been made available for specific targeted information management and technology developments&mdash;&pound;113 million was hypothecated in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;82 million for 2002&ndash;03. These sums revert to baseline after one year.</p>

The Department and the national health service organise contracts in such a way as to obtain both value for money and maintain local choice where appropriate.

	<p pid=".1154W.16/2">Some 70 per cent. of English Heritage sites are already free to all visitors. In addition, over half a million children, students and teachers enjoy free admission to English Heritage sites on education visits. English Heritage estimate that extending free admission to all groups of young people would cost them &pound;650,000 a year. Following the publication of <i>The Historic Environment: A Force for Our Future</i>, we are considering, together with all relevant bodies, how the principle of free access for children might be extended to the historic environment sector. There are no plans at this stage to extend this to other groups of visitors.</p>

	<p pid=".1155W.2/1">The Film Council has undertaken a major initiative to increase the level of film activity in England under its England-wide Strategy. The most significant development within the north-east in response has been the creation of Northern Film and Media (NFM), which has developed a strategy for film in the region for the first time. Whilst NFM is responsible for activity right across the spectrum of film&mdash;exhibition and education as well as production&mdash;it is already dedicating substantial effort to supporting production companies and film making within the region. NFM also acts as a conduit between film makers in the north-east and Film Council-run film production funds and is expected to increase the take-up of these funds by north-east companies and individuals. In the next financial year NFM will directly invest over &pound;1.1 million in the development of people, companies and projects in the north-east.</p>

	<p pid=".1158W.2/2">AFFOF followed on from the publication on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-12">12 December 2001</phrase> of a Green Paper on the effectiveness of the existing planning system. This Paper is providing an opportunity for representations to be made on how best to safeguard the future of our World Heritage Sites through that system.</p>
	<p pid=".1158W.2/3">The management teams at our World Heritage Sites are, of course, eligible to apply for English Heritage and heritage lottery fund grants in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid=".1159W.9/2">The framework for independent radio licensing is contained in the Broadcasting Acts of 1990 and 1996, which set out the broad procedures which the Radio Authority must follow when advertising and awarding licences. The legislation includes general provisions for the authority to do all it can to secure a range and diversity of services, calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests. In awarding individual local licences, the authority also has to consider how far the service would broaden the range of programmes available in the area by way of independent local radio services and, in particular, serve tastes and interests not already provided for.</p>
	<p pid=".1159W.9/3">In respect of the BBC, they must apply to the Secretary of State for any new radio services. The Secretary of State will then assess any proposal against the criteria set out in the public service approvals guidelines. These include distinctiveness (in programming and content) of the proposed BBC service from those provided by other broadcasters.</p>

	<p pid=".1165W.2/43">In addition QinetiQ are leaseholders at a number of other sites.</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/44">(i) GVA Grimley, an independent professional valuation company, were engaged by DERA to perform a valuation exercise to determine the &quot;fair value&quot; of the property portfolio as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase>. The methodology used for the valuation was:</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/45" class="indent">(a) Non-specialsed properties&mdash;existing use value</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/46" class="indent">(b) Specialised properties&mdash;depreciated replacement cost</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/47" class="indent">(c) Properties surplus to requirements&mdash;open market value</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/48" class="indent">(d) Properties held as investment&mdash;open market value.</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/49">(ii) All properties were transferred to QinetiQ at the values calculated by GVA Grimley using the most appropriate methodology, as outlined in (i).</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/50">(iii) All sites where freehold or leasehold title has transferred to QinetiQ are subject to a clawback arrangement contractually agreed with the MOD. This limits QinetiQ's ability to make abnormal profits on disposal. The clawback agreement was based on the valuations conducted by GVA Grimley in 2001, with an allowance for inflation over the 12-year period of the agreement. It provides for MOD to share a proportion of any additional receipts above this value; this proportion starts at 50 per cent. and decreases gradually over the life of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/51">This clawback agreement provides an appropriate balance between sharing future benefits from estate sales and incentivising the company to manage its assets efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/52"><i>(b)</i> Due to the volume involved, it is not possible to list all the Intellectual Property (IP) transferred to QinetiQ (e.g. over 3,000 patents that have been assigned to the company).</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/53">The basic principal adopted was that QinetiQ should be put in the same position as any other defence contractor, i.e. where IP had been generated within that part of DERA that was to become QinetiQ then QinetiQ should own the IPR. As with the rest of industry, MOD retains free user rights where public money was used to create the IP.</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/54">(i) and (ii) There was no valuation attributed to the IP at vesting as value will be realised within the value of future sales of MOD's shareholdings.</p>
	<p pid=".1165W.2/55">(iii) IP clawback provision has not been provided in this PPP. This mirrors MOD policy, which is not to include any form of levy agreement when letting contracts for research and technology with other parts of industry, the reason for this being that in contrast to equipment it is virtually impossible to trace the research and technology that may have been used to generate future revenue. As a significant shareholder in QinetiQ for the next few years, we believe that the freedom and encouragement to exploit results commercially represents better overall value for money than pursuing a clawback arrangement where the extent of bureaucracy would be great and the potential returns difficult to obtain.</p>

First, 30 aircraft will be upgraded to GR7a standard by the integration of the Pegasus Mk107 engine. This will provide improved performance, particularly for carrier borne operation. This programme is due to be completed by the end of 2005 at a total cost of approximately &pound;150 million.</p>

These aircraft will be designated Harrier GR9 and GR9a. Although the detailed content of the GR9 programme and the associated procurement strategy have yet to be finalised, it is estimated that the total cost will be approximately &pound;330 million, of which 75% relates to routine maintenance and modification work being undertaken concurrently with the upgrade to minimise costs.</p>

	<p pid=".1170W.2/1">We were deeply concerned about the attack by a Sudanese Government helicopter on an area next to a World Food Programme feeding station last month. It is our understanding that 18 people were killed and several others injured. This attack is particularly distressing at a time when hopes for peace in Sudan have been growing. Following the incident we made representations at a high level of the Sudanese Government, both in Khartoum and London, and asked the Sudanese Government for a full explanation.</p>
	<p pid=".1170W.2/2">We were pleased to hear that following pressure from the US and UK, the Government of Sudan have signed an agreement with the US on monitoring of reports of attacks on civilians. We hope that this agreement will help to prevent such incidents happening in the future.</p>

The UK ambassador in Antananarivo, along with other resident ambassadors, is following events closely and maintaining close contact with representatives of the two sides.</p>
	<p pid=".1173W.2/2">In their draft report on the presidential election, and in a series of communiqu&eacute;s, the consortium of independent election observers (which the UK part-funded) raised questions about the conduct of the elections, including their organisation, as well as their transparency and fairness. Because of the current volatile political situation, there has been no opportunity to examine these claims.</p>

There were no UK ministerial visits to Madagascar in either 2000 or 2001, and there are no plans at present for visits during 2002.</p>

The advertising figure for 1998&ndash;99 includes &pound;1 million spent on a consular advertising campaign in the run-up to the World Cup 1998 in France. The figures for press and public relations include expenditure on public relations firms as part of FCO information campaigns. In addition to the expenditure identified, there was minor additional expenditure in London and overseas in the years concerned. This cannot be ascertained without disproportionate effort and cost.</p>

	<p pid=".1175W.0/1">The Lord Chancellor's Department promulgated the Guidelines during Spring 2001. A survey was carried out in the late autumn 2001 on the use and effectiveness of the guidelines. This has shown that they have been broadly well received and have resulted in a generally heightened focus on domestic violence issues. However, there are indications that awareness of the guidelines is patchy, and that more contact centres are needed. The Department is taking steps to address these issues. Copies of the analysis of the survey, including the action to be taken, have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
