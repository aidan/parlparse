	<p pid="b.1147W.6/1">The Department has a wide range of measures in place to ensure economical use of paper, following the broad policy of &quot;reduce, reuse, recycle&quot; and to meet the new targets for government on sustainable operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147W.6/2">Information for the public is increasingly available electronically and a higher percentage than in previous years of new documents are web only publications. When documents are printed, then consideration is given to the types of papers used to ensure they are fit for purpose, indicating the weight and type of the paper to minimise paper use. Any printed publications are printed on 75 per cent. recycled paper. The Department for Transport also leads on the pan- Government framework for the provision of recycled paper for printed publications.</p>

There was no evidence that the signs became less effective over the three-year period of the study.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-23b.127503.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-23b.1150W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="1150W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070323/text/70323w0001.htm#07032344002524">
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/1">The latest quarterly progress report issued by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) indicates that considerable steps have been made towards the Afghanistan Compact benchmark of increasing the amount of electricity available through bilateral power purchase by 2010. Details of this progress, extracted from the report, are listed at Annex A. Given this, we would expect the amount of electricity available through bilateral power purchase to increase by the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/2">However, the report also indicates that there are serious limitations to measuring progress in the power sector, and states that it is difficult to measure progress in the shorter-term as nearly all of these projects are long-term activities. DFID is not directly engaged in this sector. The lead donors are the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/3">In October 2002, USAID committed support for a national irrigation and power rehabilitation programme in conjunction with Afghanistan's Ministry of Energy and Water. The programme is focused on the rehabilitation of the South East Power System (SEPS), a 100 MW power generation and transmission network. It aims to provide low cost and reliable power to 1.7 million residents in Helmand and Kandahar provinces by the end of 2009. Central to this initiative is a commitment to rehabilitate the Kajaki multi-purpose dam, built by USAID in 1953 on the Helmand River.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/4">The programme is split into phases and will include rehabilitating and upgrading the dam, its power plant and associated transmission network by 2009. The first phase will increase Kajaki's generation capacity to 51 MW. Funding of $150 million has already been allocated for this work. The UK Government, through DFID, may fund smaller projects in the vicinity of the dam as part of a stabilisation programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/5">The UK-led Task Force Helmand (TFH) has been tasked through ISAF with providing security sufficient to enable the resumption and successful completion of the USAID Kajaki Dam project. Security poses a bigger challenge for the UK in Helmand where GoA authority and rule of law is fragile. The UK military is helping to create an enabling environment for development to accelerate, and for training the Afghan National Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/6" class="italic"> Annex A&mdash;Progress towards Increasing Power Purchase</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/7" class="indent">An agreement was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-21">21 February 2006</phrase> between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The agreement increases co-operation between the two countries in power transmission, reducing the purchase rate to minimum, continuity in power purchase and improve regulatory framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/8" class="indent">The Hairatan-Kabul 220 kv transmission line is currently under construction. It is due for completion by the end of 2008. This will be the main line transmitting imported electricity from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to take care of the immediate needs of Kabul.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/9" class="indent">A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Afghanistan and Turkmenistan in April 2006 on further increase of power purchase. Under the agreement Turkmenistan expressed readiness to increase its electricity export by 300 MW and support the new transmission infrastructure in the North-West (Hirat, Qala-e-Naw, Maimana, Shiberghan and Mazar).</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/10" class="indent">A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-25">25 June 2006</phrase> between Afghanistan and Iran. Part of this MOU covers the provision of electricity to the western border towns of Afghanistan (Farah and Nimroz). I.R. of Iran has agreed to undertake the necessary study of this project.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/11" class="indent">In August 2006 Afghanistan became an Observer to the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). The accession report has been prepared by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ECT. Full accession is expected in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/12" class="indent">In 2006, Afghanistan signed multilateral MOUs on 1,000 MW electricity transit with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and Iran. The four countries will meet in Kabul in June 2007 to evaluate the feasibility study which is currently under way. The Kabul sub-station of this project will allow Afghanistan to increase its power purchase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/13" class="indent">In November 2006, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), increasing Afghanistan's power purchase from 70 MW to 300 MW, beginning from October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/14" class="indent">The power purchase agreement between Iran and Afghanistan expires by the end of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March 2006</phrase>. During the Second Joint Economic Commission Meeting of the two countries (27 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-28">28 December 2006</phrase>), it was agreed to renew and upgrade the agreement. During the meeting the two countries decided to work on the contract of the construction of transmission line (220 to 230 MW) between Zabul and Farah (survey is already complete). They also discussed extending electricity to the rural areas of Robat Sangi, Gulran and Kishk in Hirat Province.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150W.0/15" class="indent">India is ahead of schedule on its $100 million Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul line and substations at Chimtala and Doshi&mdash;estimated completion date is October 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152W.2/1">Better governance is a central theme of DFID's work in Bangladesh. Programmes range from activities fighting corruption and supporting reform of the civil service and police, to supporting public debates and protecting human rights. Participation of children and young people has most impact on activities that aim to change values in relation to corruption and political governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/2">For example, DFID's support for Transparency International Bangladesh includes a component called &quot;Youth Engagement and Support&quot; (YES). Over 900 young volunteers deliver nationwide debates, competitions, and rallies against corruption. The recent Anti-Corruption Concert in Dhaka attracted 30,000 young people in a bold public statement against corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/3">DFID Bangladesh also supports a series of governance themed programmes and &quot;Question time&quot; debates broadcast in Bangla on BBC World Service radio and local satellite TV. Audiences of 17 million have included around 4 million 16 to 24-year-olds. In 2005, a special live debate went out globally on BBC World TV, with a panel including politicians from both major parties in Bangladesh. Hard hitting governance questions came from audiences of students and young people in both Dhaka and (by satellite) from the British Bangladeshi community in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/4">At global level, DFID launched its &quot;Action Plan on Children and Young People's Participation&quot; in 2004 to promote children and young people's participation in decisions affecting them. Part of a UK Government initiative &quot;Learning to Listen&quot;, the Action Plan describes how DFID is involving children and young people in its work to reduce world poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/5">DFID continues to promote the active role of children and young people in governance programmes. Our work varies at the country level depending on the context. In Sierra Leone, for example, DFID has supported work to engage young people in dialogue on the implementation of the national Poverty Reduction Strategy and the decentralisation process. Given its history, engaging young people is crucial in creating consensus and relieving tensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/6">Reflecting UN initiatives and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), we also support projects and programmes to advocate for children's rights, either directly or through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The UK Government are also a major contributor to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); one of UNICEF's roles is to advocate for the rights of children and young people.</p>

	<p pid="b.1153W.2/1">The impact of climate change on Bangladesh from rising sea levels will be gradual; felt over the next 50 to 100 years. However, there is already evidence of more severe and frequent flooding and droughts, as well as coastal salt-water intrusion, negatively affecting poor people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.2/2">DFID's draft Country Assistance Plan (2007-12) aims to help Bangladesh respond in a timelier and more effective way to acute emergencies and climate change. DFID is helping the Government of Bangladesh's Climate Change Cell develop different strategies to adapt to climate change, including impacts of migration and resettlement on poor people. It has helped 137 poor communities develop their own risk reduction strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.2/3">DFID is also helping very poor people living on Chars river islands, which are vulnerable to flooding. We have assisted 107,000 Chars dwellers to raise their houses above the flood line. We have transferred portable assets (such as cows) to almost 11,000 extremely poor Chars women, helping them to make better and more informed decisions about where and when to migrate, together with a compensation grant to those who migrate due to more acute flooding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.2/4">DFID will provide &pound;115 million over the next five years to support the very poorest people living in areas most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. By September 2007, it will develop an action plan to develop further activities, including protection of the poorest people living in the most vulnerable zones in urban areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1153W.5/1">The UK's 2006 White Paper on International Development commits DFID to tackling barriers to access to markets and financial services, and supporting microfinance initiatives in partnership with banks and regulators.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/2">DFID's financial sector programmes aim to build stronger and more inclusive financial sectors, which benefit the poor. &quot;Microfinance&quot; incorporates a full range of financial products, which includes micro-insurance as well as savings, credit and remittances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/3">At <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October 2006</phrase>, DFID has spent over &pound;165 million to support microfinance and financial sector projects and had committed 140 million more to ongoing projects. DFID does not disaggregate funding on micro-insurance specifically. It is not possible to give a meaningful breakdown of future commitments by year as new programmes to improve access to finance continue to be designed and implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/4">Examples of microfinance programmes supported by DFID include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/5" class="indent">In India, Megatop received a grant of &pound;850,000 via the Financial Services Deepening Trust, to support them in offering a range of microinsurance products and pension policies to farmers in 9,000 villages in Andhra and Madhya Pradesh using a network of village internet portals to lower costs and expand access.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/6" class="indent">Since the last review of commitments in October, DFID has approved a &pound;32.8 million seven-year PROSPER programme in Bangladesh, which will support delivery of innovative financial services to the very poor, small businesses and farmers. Around 22 per cent. of these resources will go to a Learning and Innovation Fund which will support projects to test innovative financial services, including microinsurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/7">As well as direct support to programmes, DFID also works in coordination with other donors and specialist agencies:</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/8" class="indent">DFID provides core funding to the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), a consortium of 33 public and private development agencies working together to expand access to financial services for the poor. The CGAP working group on microinsurance, in conjunction with the International Labour Organisation, has recently published a Microinsurance Compendium for insurance practitioners and policy makers in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153W.5/9" class="indent">DFID is a leading supporter of FIRST, the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative, a multi-donor trust which provides advice to developing countries on how to develop their financial sectors. In Mongolia FIRST has worked with the insurance industry, the government and the World Bank to develop a novel livestock insurance scheme that will provide microinsurance to cattle herders at affordable prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.1154W.2/1">Surveys carried out by the FinMark Trust, a DFID funded programme in Africa, show that poor people already use a wide variety of formal and informal insurance services ranging from insurance provided by multinational companies to membership of traditional burial societies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.2/2">DFID has helped support the recent expansion of micro-insurance in developing countries as an effective way to help poor people to cope with shocks and reduce their vulnerability. Poor people need to be able to access a full range of financial services including insurance as well as savings, credit and remittances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.2/3">Although it is a relatively young industry, micro-insurance is already demonstrating its potential to provide protection to low-income communities against risks such as sickness and natural disasters. There remain big challenges, however, to the long-term sustainability of microinsurance including making sure that schemes are affordable and ensuring that schemes are appropriately regulated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.2/4">Examples of DFID support to micro-insurance include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.2/5" class="indent">In Bangladesh, DFID contributed &pound;100,000 to an access to rural finance study. In conjunction with the World Bank, the study investigated the feasibility of introducing a weather linked insurance product for farmers, where payouts are directly linked to objective monitoring of floods and droughts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.2/6" class="indent">In Africa the FinMark Trust has spent &pound;271,000 over the last three years on programmes aimed at making insurance markets work for the poor and has committed a similar amount over the next three years. The funding has been provided to catalyse change in the insurance market and to leverage private sector investment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155W.2/1">Recent research by Cranfield university shows that the greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing flowers in Kenya and flying them to the UK can be less than a fifth of those grown in Holland because they are not grown in heated greenhouses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155W.2/2">Flowers imported to the UK are subject to increasingly rigorous standards that insist on good agricultural practice and prevent overuse of pesticides. In addition to these standards, flower growers may also adopt codes of conduct that require exacting social and environmental standards to be maintained. UK shoppers have played an important role in demanding better standards as have development agencies including DFID and non-governmental organisations. Consumer concern has also encouraged Kenyan flower farms to invest in water conservation and other improvements in their environmental practice. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement and we welcome efforts to develop similar codes of practice in Ethiopia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155W.2/3">While we encourage shoppers to demand continuing improvements, it is for the Kenyan and Ethiopian people to decide on the best use of their natural resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155W.2/4">Promoting developing country exports has long been central to UK development and trade policy. Agriculture remains an important source of economic growth and the best means of reducing poverty in most African countries. The Kenyan flower industry has created tens of thousands of jobs on flower farms and the Ethiopian Government have similar ambitions for their flower industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161W.3/1">The Government have already taken steps to introduce microfinance schemes to encourage entrepreneurs in deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.3/2">The Phoenix Fund, launched in 1999, was a time limited, &pound;40 million fund which pump-primed the establishment of 63 community development finance institutions that serve disadvantaged communities around the country. 4,545 loans with a total value of &pound;34,475,308 were provided by the Phoenix Fund, which closed in 2006. Future funding of CDFIs rests with the RDAs who have received a further &pound;11 million of post-Phoenix transition funding for the 2006 to 2008 period specifically for the community finance sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.3/3">Further assistance with micro-loans is available through the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI) which was announced by the Chancellor in his 2005 Budget. It aims to release the economic and productivity potential of the most deprived local areas across the UK through enterprise and investment&mdash;thereby boosting local incomes and employment opportunities, and building sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.3/4">LEGI is a &pound;300 million programme in the first instance, spread over three years. 15 local authorities have already benefited from the first round. A further 14 local authorities will benefit from the second round. Local authorities that have been successful in securing LEGI funding in rounds one and two may introduce microfinance schemes to encourage entrepreneurship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.3/5">Finally, small businesses in disadvantaged areas may seek funding from the Small Firms Loan Guarantee (SFLG). This scheme provides loans from &pound;5,000 upwards to small businesses with viable business plans that are unable to obtain a conventional loan because they do not have collateral or a proven track record. Current monthly usage is around 250 loans with a total value of around &pound;20 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1164W.3/1">There have been three confirmed outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in UK poultry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.3/2">In 1959, H5N1 avian influenza was detected in a flock of chickens in Scotland. In 1991, H5N1 avian influenza was detected in turkeys in Norfolk, England. In both cases the birds were culled and the disease was confined to a single premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.3/3">On the basis of genetic analysis, the H5N1 viruses discovered in 1959 and 1991 were a different strain to the H5N1 Asiatic strain which is currently circulating. The source of neither outbreak was ever firmly established.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.3/4">Most recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-03">3 February 2007</phrase>, H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed at a Bernard Matthews turkey farm in Holton, Suffolk. In accordance with EU legislation, a 3 kilometre Protection Zone, a 10 kilometre Surveillance Zone and a further Restriction Zone around the infected premises were put in place. Extensive guidance was issued to bird keepers in the zones on biosecurity measures to protect their birds from avian influenza. The birds on the infected premises were humanely culled and disposed of according to DEFRA's published Contingency Plan for Exotic Animal Diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.3/5">Within the area around the infected premises, there were enhanced levels of surveillance of wild birds. While the investigation in the outbreak was under way, 25 wild bird locations comprising 73 sites in the area were regularly patrolled. Laboratory tests were completed on dead wild birds found in the area as well as on live wild bird droppings from the infected premises. All results were negative.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.3/6">We are currently developing our investigation into what might have caused the outbreak of avian influenza at Holton. The conclusion of the interim report is that importation from Hungary is the most plausible route. However, investigations are still ongoing and nothing can be ruled out at this time. The final epidemiological report will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.1166W.5/1">The proposed Bill would allow, under prescribed conditions, a proportion of emissions reductions achieved overseas and paid for by UK entities, to be counted towards the reduction targets in the Bill. This is fully consistent with (and would be limited by) international law, including the Kyoto Protocol and its Marrakech Accords which state, under the flexible mechanism provisions, that countries are permitted to use credits, so long as they are &quot;supplemental to domestic action&quot;, and that domestic action comprises a &quot;significant element&quot; of the efforts made by each country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/2">The UK fully supports the principle of trading emissions at European level too through the EU ETS. There are significant advantages in allowing international trading as part of the UK's legislative framework: for example, it would encourage the further development of global emission, trading markets which, as the Stern Review showed, will be central to global collective action to tackle climate change. The Committee on Climate Change will have an important role to play in advising Government on the optimal balance between domestic and overseas effort for each budgetary period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169W.12/1">TV Licensing officials may enter premises to check for unlicensed use of a television receiver only with the consent of the occupier or with a warrant issued under section 366 of the Communications Act 2003 by a justice of the peace in England and Wales, a sheriff in Scotland or a lay magistrate in Northern Ireland. Such a warrant may be issued only if the relevant official is satisfied by information provided on oath that there are reasonable grounds for believing an offence of unlicensed use has been or is being committed; evidence of the commission of the offence is likely to be on the premises specified and a number of additional conditions are satisfied. A warrant permits the authorised person or persons to enter the premises at any time and to search, examine and test any television receiver there. It must be executed within one month following its grant.</p>

Service commencement for the work currently conducted in-house by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service is planned for October, to allow sufficient time to meet the TU Consultation requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184W.3/2">Self-employment support offers an initial awareness session for potential entrepreneurs followed by a period of supported business planning with a business expert and a period of &quot;test trading&quot;. During test trading, participants start their business while continuing to receive their benefit, an allowance or working tax credits, depending on their circumstances, to help them over any initial transitional hurdles. This period can last up to a maximum of 26 weeks.</p>

However, data indicate that of those who started the stage three self-employment test trading element of new deal for young people, 61 per cent. subsequently left to employment. Corresponding figures for the new deal for young people options are: employment option, 71 per cent.; full-time education and training option, 46 per cent.; voluntary sector, 51 per cent., and environmental task force, 52 per cent.

	<p pid="b.1187W.11/1">Some 8,506,750 households received a winter fuel payment in winter 2005-06. It is not possible to say how many households are eligible for a winter fuel payment because in order to assess whether a person is entitled to a winter fuel payment we need to establish their circumstances. A person may be ineligible for various reasons such as serving a custodial sentence, in hospital receiving free in-patient treatment for more than 52 weeks, or subject to immigration control. Over 99 per cent. of winter fuel payments are made automatically without the need to claim based on information already held by the Department. However some people aged 60 or over who are not in receipt of a benefit administered by DWP may need to claim. For winter 2005-06 we received 311,900 claim forms by the cut-off date of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>.

It is continuously updated as the basis of advice to top management in the Department about current and emerging risks to the Department's programme and the national health service, and what can be done to control and mitigate these risks. It also informs discussions between the Department and top management in the NHS about addressing key issues in policy, resourcing and service management. Putting the risk register in the public domain would be likely to reduce the detail and utility of its contents. This would inhibit the free and frank exchange of views about significant risks and their management, and inhibit the provision of advice to Ministers.

	<p pid="b.1194W.3/1">The distance between several secondary sector service targets and the service initial positions in March 2003-04 is moderately correlated to the age/needs index: the PCT health economies with low age/needs had modestly further to travel to achieve the targets. However, numerous parts of the country with low age/needs did not have far to travel in meeting these targets. The correlation is not a perfect one (with correlation co-efficients ranging from -0.28 in the case of distance to the A&amp;E four hour wait and age/needs to -0.13 in the case of distance to the outpatient booking targets and age/needs). The reasons behind the relationship are complex.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.3/2">Secondary sector under-performance in low age/needs areas is likely to have existed for some time prior to March 2003-04. By raising the quality of care to uniform national standards, the Government have significantly improved the services provided to patients in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.3/3">The age and need index, and the interactions between them, are currently being reviewed by independent academic researchers under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation. A new age and need adjustment for weighted capitation may emerge from this research for resource allocation in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="b.1201W.1/1" qnum="129776">To ask the Secretary of State for Health why the figure for the cost of the Pembury hospital private finance initiative Scheme, as used by the Minister of State in her letter to hon. Members representing Kent constituencies of 26 February 2007, differs from the figure given by the Prime Minister in his oral answer of 19 July 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1201W.2/1">The principal reason for the change to the capital values of the scheme at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells national health service trust was that in October 2006 the scheme was subject to a Departmental reappraisal. A key part of this was an assessment of the capacity assumptions to ascertain if these were realistic and properly suited to the needs of the local health economy; and a review of the estate in terms of current and planned building stock to ensure optimal use. This led the trust to reconsider how the scheme could best be structured in order to deliver services in the most cost-effective way and ensure long-term viability, and the capital value of the scheme was reduced accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.2/2">In addition, the figure given by the Prime Minister included the cost of the mental health element of the scheme, which is being funded by the Kent and Medway Partnership and Social Care Trust. The Secretary of State's letter gave a figure that related exclusively to the acute element of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.2/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published &quot;Improving Outcomes in Urological Cancers&quot;, including prostate cancer, in September 2002. The guidance recommends that the treatment each patient receives should be tailored to fit his individual values and situation, so it is essential that patients are actively involved in decision making. This requires that they receive adequate and accurate information, both through meetings with members of the multi-disciplinary team, and in published forms so that they can study at home. Patients should be given sufficient time to consider all the options available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.2/2">To support this, a number of initiatives are under way:</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.2/3" class="indent">The cancer services collaborative Improvement Partnership patient information project team has been working with cancer networks since 2003 to help them develop the resources and processes they need to provide a co-ordinated network wide approach to patient information delivery. A website has now been launched to support networks in improving patient information delivery by providing guidance and resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.2/4" class="indent">The Government will introduce Information Prescriptions for everyone with a long term condition or care need by 2008. This commitment is part of the 2006 White Paper &quot;Our Health Our Care Our Say&quot;. The information prescriptions pilots, which will trial the initiative, were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October 2006</phrase>. The pilot includes four sites focusing on cancer, and will run until the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.2/5" class="indent">From 2004 to 2005 the Action on Urology programme hosted a project designed to pilot the implementation of decision aids into routine practice in the national health service. The decision aid programme was introduced into four NHS hospital trusts in England, into either one or both of two urology pathways early-stage localised prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Phase one identified a range of improvements which participants felt should be made before the package was rolled out nationally. Phase two has been established to address these amendments in a further six pilot sites. It is planned that a final range of decision making tools will be ready for general issue across England by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.2/6" class="indent">The Department has collaborated with signatories to the prostate cancer charter for action to develop UK Prostate Link, the first comprehensive online source of information of its kind, to help prostate cancer patients, their families and health professionals to access the quality information they need about prostate cancer. The website address is: <a href="http://www.prostate-link.org.uk">www.prostate-link.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.2/7">Patient information and decision support are also being taken forward by the patient experience working group as part of the development of the cancer reform strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203W.2/1">Raising the awareness of prostate cancer is a key challenge. We want men to know what their prostate is, what it does, and what can go wrong with it. However, we have to raise awareness in a responsible way so as not to cause undue anxiety and worry. That is why we teamed up with the Prostate Cancer Charter for Action to fund a pilot public awareness programme of the prostate, and that is why we are also making raising awareness a key strand of the new Cancer Reform Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/2">The pilot public awareness programme on the prostate and its function took place in Coventry in October 2006, and an independent evaluation is now assessing the effectiveness of the messages used in the pilot, the interventions used to promote the messages, and the impact the pilot has had on national health service services. Draft reports of the evaluation are being considered by the Prostate Cancer Advisory Group's (PCAG) public awareness working group, who will advise the main PCAG on implementation of the findings in June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/3">The Department provided &pound;100,000 towards the pilot and the evaluation, with signatories to the Charter providing a further &pound;50,000 towards the pilot.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203W.5/1">The formal evaluation of the Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme (PCRMP) was undertaken between 2004 and 2006 by the Cancer Research UK Primary Care Education Research Group. Based on the results of the evaluation, the group has now begun work on revising the PCRMP materials. The group are looking to appoint to a dedicated post to continue the revision, and will begin work shortly on an update of the formal literature review that informed the original PCRMP packs. We are also ensuring that revisions to the PCRMP are consistent with the development of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's Clinical Guide on the Diagnosis and Management of Prostate Cancer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1205W.9/1">We have increased investment in further education by 48 per cent. in real terms between 1997 and 2005. We are spending more on adult learning that ever before, over &pound;3 billion in 2007-08, up 7 per cent. on 2005-06,</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/2">In 2007-08, investment in our new national employer programme, train to gain will increase by &pound;300 million to &pound;460 million between 2005-06 and 2006-07. Nearly 150 colleges and nearly 200 training providers successfully bid for train to gain contracts in 2006-07. FE allocations and train to gain together will offer 82 per cent. of all colleges the opportunity to earn more than in 2005-06, with 45 per cent. earning 5 per cent. or more.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/3">Information on the impact on individual colleges and train to gain performance data are not held centrally by the Department but Mark Haysom, as the chief executive of the Learning and Skills Council, has written directly to my hon. Friend with answers to these questions, A copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/4" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/5" class="indent">I am writing in response to your question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, about what change is being made in Barnet college's grant for adult training; how many placements at Barnet college have been made by brokers through the train to gain institution; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/6" class="indent">The 19+ adult allocations for 2007-08 for any provider have yet to be agreed however the following allocations were made in the last two academic years:</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/7" class="indent">2005-06 Barnet college was allocated &pound;14,759,408 for 19+ learners</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/8" class="indent">2006-07 Barnet college was allocated &pound;14,525,033 for 19+ learners</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/9" class="indent">2007-08 allocations for 19+ learners have yet to be agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/10" class="indent">Barnet college does not directly engage with train to gain but operates as a sub-contractor for two other lead contractors&mdash;four counties training and the college of North East London. The data therefore is a combined total for the two as all operational data goes through the consortia leads.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/11" class="indent">Skills Brokers identify learners within an organisation&mdash;some of which may be funded by train to gain discrete funding but others who may not&mdash;for instance those learners who already have a Level 2 or equivalent qualification would not be eligible for full subsidy. However the learners with a Level 2 would still be able to access training either at full cost or via further education mainstream funding with the employer making an appropriate contribution to costs. Therefore the skills broker will estimate what level of learners may be &quot;Train to Gain&quot; but the employer's choice of provider will then identify specifically eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/12" class="indent">Therefore from August 2006 to January 2007 skills brokers identified 510 learners who may have been eligible to the two consortia leads out of which 160 have actually started provision under train to gain discrete funding. However this is a dynamic process many of the 510 could still be being assessed and preparing to enter train to gain discrete provision or other provision and certainly there are increases in activity as the service gains momentum therefore these figures are probably underestimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.9/13" class="indent">I hope this response is helpful to you.</p>

	<p pid="b.1206W.2/4" class="indent">Skills Brokers in the London Region have made 2,436 engagements with employers from August 2006 to January 2007. Some of these engagements would be via telephone as opposed to a visit but would be some form of meaningful discussion beyond simple contact. Out of these engagements 1,548 are designated as &quot;Hard to Reach&quot; being employers defined as those without Investors in People recognition and have not invested in any vocational training leading to a qualification within the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206W.2/5" class="indent">Train to Gain Skills Brokers in London have made approximately 15,500 individual learner referrals to date for all types of learning provision including some at full cost to the employer as well as that funded by the LSC. Out of those individual learner referrals approximately 5,000 are related to Level 2 provision. This is a dynamic process and placement of these learners is ongoing. The Train to Gain service is still within its initial launch stage and evaluation of conversions from referrals to learners starting programmes is taking place to identify lessons learned and good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206W.2/6" class="indent">Skills Brokers in London have been paid a total of &pound;2.5 million to date, The cost of each employer engagement averages approximately &pound;670.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206W.2/7" class="indent">This would include activity such as initial marketing, visits, organisational needs analysis, identifying development opportunities and solutions for the business, sourcing training provision possibly across a range of providers, ongoing monitoring of both the business relationship and learner progress and maintaining contact for potential repeat business and support for the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1216W.6/10" class="indent">60 per cent. satisfied with local bus services&mdash;an improvement of 6 percentage points since 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.6/11" class="indent">55 per cent. satisfied with sports and leisure facilities&mdash;an improvement of 3 percentage points since 2003-04.</p>

	<p pid="b.1216W.6/15" class="indent">72 per cent. satisfied with parks and open spaces an improvement of 2 percentage points since 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.6/16" class="indent">No aggregate 2006-07 results are available yet for district councils as these data have not been fully validated and published. Similarly, because the 2006-07 average for all councils in England uses single and upper-tier data, these satisfaction figures are also not available yet.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.6/17">Given this substantial dataset of approximately 210,000 respondents only became available earlier this year, detailed statistical analysis of the causes of these trends is in its earliest stages. Work to date has concentrated on potential drivers of overall satisfaction with local government rather than individual services. This has shown that communication by local government is important&mdash;the more informed people feel the more satisfied they are with their local authority. Similarly, participation and empowerment are significant&mdash;the more satisfied people are with opportunities to participate and their level of influence in local decision-making the more satisfied they are with their local authority. Performance is also critical&mdash;the higher the CPA star category of an authority and the higher its direction of travel assessment the more satisfied people are. There are also variations in satisfaction by age and gender and direct experience of services&mdash;older people tend to be more satisfied as do women and those who are direct users of local government services. Lastly, overall satisfaction with an area is strongly associated with satisfaction with the council.</p>

	<p pid="b.1219W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.9/2">The Government have already taken steps to introduce microfinance schemes to encourage entrepreneurs in deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.9/3">The Phoenix Fund, launched in 1999, was a time limited, &pound;40 million fund which pump-primed the establishment of 63 community development finance institutions that serve disadvantaged communities around the country. 4,545 loans with at total value of &pound;34,475,308 were provided by the Phoenix Fund, which closed in 2006. Future funding of CDFIs rests with the RDAs who have received a further &pound;11 million of post-Phoenix transition funding for the 2006 to 2008 period specifically for the community finance sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.9/4">Further assistance with micro-loans is available through the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI) which was announced by the Chancellor in his 2005 Budget. It aims to release the economic and productivity potential of the most deprived local areas across the UK through enterprise and investment&mdash;thereby boosting local incomes and employment opportunities, and building sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.9/5">LEGI is a &pound;300 million programme in the first instance, spread over three years. 15 local authorities have already benefited from the first round. A further 14 local authorities will benefit from the second round. Local authorities that have been successful in securing LEGI funding in rounds one and two may introduce microfinance schemes to encourage entrepreneurship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.9/6">Finally, small businesses in disadvantaged areas may seek funding from the Small Firms Loan Guarantee (SFLG). This scheme provides loans from &pound;5,000 upwards to small businesses with viable business plans that are unable to obtain a conventional loan because they do not have collateral or a proven track record. Current monthly usage is around 250 loans with a total value of around &pound;20 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1224W.2/2">The criteria used in these assessments are: the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces; the threat level; the Iraqi governance capacity; and the capabilities of MNF-I to re-intervene at the request of the Iraqis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1224W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase> the Government announced that Her Majesty the Queen had graciously approved the recommendation by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals that veterans and others eligible should exceptionally be allowed to accept the Pingat Jasa Malaysia (PJM), offered by the King and Government of Malaysia, but that in accordance with normal policy and practice official permission to wear the medal should not be granted. Since then, a number of people have said they believe that this decision was wrong; and that those entitled to accept the medal should also be permitted formally to wear the PJM.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.5/2">Given the strength of feeling of some individuals, the committee considered the matter again very carefully. After examination of the issues involved, the policies underpinning the operation of the UK honours system and particular application of these policies in the case of the PJM, it concluded that the original decision to allow exceptions to two of the major principles of the British Honours System&mdash; the double medalling rule and the five year rule&mdash;should be upheld. Entitled individuals will continue to be allowed to accept the PJM, but there is no official permission to wear it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.5/3">In re-affirming the decision of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase>, the committee was aware that it would disappoint those who wish to wear the PJM, but they hoped that all who had been involved would understand that the decision reflected a major exception to the normal rules on acceptance of foreign medals. Exceptions to the rules are made only in exceptional circumstances, and in reaching its decision, the committee considered the importance of British involvement in the Malaysian campaign in the histories both of Malaysia and the UK in the years 1957-66, the generous gesture by the King and Government of Malaysia, as well the principles on which the British Honours System is based. Similar exceptions were made for medals from the Saudi and Kuwaiti Governments after the First Gulf War.</p>

	<p pid="b.1226W.5/1">As well as Robert Mugabe and his wife, Grace, the EU travel ban list also includes his sister (Sabina) and nephew (Patrick Zhuwao). Both are included because of their positions in Government, respectively, a Politburo member and a Minister. Should other family members take up such positions or become identified with acts of violence and abuse, we will propose that they be immediately added to the EU travel ban list. In addition, we will seek to ensure that those identified as either directing others or participating themselves in torture and beatings will be added to the EU travel ban list.</p>
