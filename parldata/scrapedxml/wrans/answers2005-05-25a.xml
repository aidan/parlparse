The letter reiterated our key priorities for 2005/06 to meet the needs of young people, those lacking literacy, numeracy and English language skills and those without a foundation of skills for employment. It also allocated an additional &pound;630 million for the financial year 2005&ndash;06 when compared to 2004&ndash;05 planned expenditure&mdash;an increase of over 7 per cent. The LSC allocates funds to providers to deliver our priorities which are set out annually in the grant letter. Individual colleges and providers agree plans with the LSC and funding is allocated accordingly.</p>

This review work will enable the Government to determine what is working and what remains to be done in tackling attrition in rape cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.110W.0/1">The joint inspection of rape cases carried out in 2002 by HMIC and HMCPSI made a large number of recommendations to improve the investigation and prosecution of rape cases, nearly all of which the Government accepted. It was not recommended that either the Law Officers or the Crown Prosecution Service monitor applications to admit previous sexual history or the timing of such applications, and no such monitoring is carried out. But the Home Office has commissioned research into the operation of section 41 Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, which it will publish in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.110W.3/1">The Crown Prosecution Service instructs experienced and committed advocates to prosecute cases involving allegations of rape. This involves seeking to instruct advocates of the necessary skill, competence and sensitivity to prosecute rape cases. In London and the south-east advocates are instructed from a specialist list. In other parts of the country, Grade 4 advocates are instructed where possible. CPS Areas have been advised in guidance issued in August 2003 that local monitoring is appropriate. Examples of local monitoring carried out by CPS Areas include the monitoring of the performance of counsel at trial by experienced caseworkers; monitoring by rape specialists for part of the trial and the raising of performance issues with local Heads of Chambers and at Joint Advocates Selection Committee as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.111W.6/5" class="indent">For patients wishing to return to the UK to begin treatment for IVF, the BFG HS makes use of the excellent facilities offered by a charity based service which is provided at Hammersmith hospital in London at no cost to the patient or the MOD. In these cases BFG HS authorises transport by air trooper. In other instances where personnel wish to be posted back to the UK and this is supported by their posting authority, they can be referred to their local primary care trust (PCT) in the UK for the duration of the treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.116W.2/1">The Department commissioned GHK Consultants to undertake a wide-ranging evaluation of the first two rounds of Phoenix Fund support for Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs). GHK published its findings and recommendations in May 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/2">The evaluation looked at many issues facing CDFIs in the provision of debt finance to enterprises in disadvantaged communities. This included the assessment of risk in relation to loan management. (The GHK report can be down-loaded from the &quot;Research and Statistics&quot; (Improving Access to Finance) section of the SBS website at: <a href="http://www.sbs.gov.uk">http://www.sbs.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/3">Through the Department's core funding of the Community Development Finance Association (CDFA), the trade association for CDFIs, more recent and specific research has been conducted into CDFI interest rates. A summary of this can be found in this year's &quot;Inside Out&quot;, the CDFA's report on the industry for 2004. (Copies available through the CDFA website at: <a href="http://www.cdfa.org.uk">http://www.cdfa.org.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/4">The CDFA's research concluded that CDFI interest rates vary, generally depending on the market being served, client type, loan size and term. Social enterprise lenders continue to operate with the lowest average rates at 9.22 per cent. static and +3.07 per cent. above base rate. A number of CDFIs targeting for-profit micro-enterprises use static rates with an average of 12.95 per cent., with others using variable rates with points above base rate at an average of +4.23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/5">CDFIs serve a diverse range of customers unable to access all the finance they need from more conventional sources and their rates reflect the risks and cost bases of the particular circumstances in which they operate.</p>

With some exceptions, they are open to people unemployed for six months or more and claiming a qualifying benefit such as jobseeker's allowance. A work trial allows a jobseeker to check whether a job is likely to work out before leaving the security of benefit. It also gives employers the opportunity to test a person's suitability for a job. A trial can last up to 15 working days for jobs of 16 hours or more a week and which are expected to last for at least 13 weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.132W.2/1">The removal of graffiti from motorway bridges is the responsibility of the Highways Agency. The agency's contractors make daily patrols to assess the problem and any obscene, blasphemous or offensive material is removed as soon as practicable after it has been observed. Non-contentious graffiti is removed at 12 month intervals or in combination with other work, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.132W.2/2">Where graffiti is persistent and widespread in environmentally sensitive areas, consideration is given to alternative solutions, other than frequent removal or obliteration. Possible strategies include involving local schools to raise awareness of the socially unacceptable nature of graffiti, and engaging with Neighbourhood Watch, local councils and the police more effectively in preventing graffiti. Physical measures include the use of anti-graffiti coatings.</p>

The Road Safety Bill, introduced into Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-24">Tuesday 24 May</phrase>, includes provisions designed to make it easier to take action against drivers who do not have a licence counterpart, which includes most foreign licence holders, by allowing enforcers to issue them with fixed penalty notices in respect of endorsable offences.

	<p pid="a.133W.5/1">The measure that has been used is derived from comparing actual traffic speeds with those that would be achievable in the absence of congestion. Full details of the methodology are available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dfttransstats/documents/page/dfttransstats021863.pdf">www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft transstats/documents/page/dft transstats 021863.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.133W.5/2">Under this measure, the estimated average congestion vehicle delay in 2000 in England was 3.8 seconds lost per vehicle kilometre (sec/vkm) on motorways, 4.5 sec/vkm on dual carriageway A roads and 4.7 sec/vkm on single carriageway A roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.5/3">These are the latest figures currently available. The Department is currently developing new, more detailed data sources and new measures of traffic congestion which will provide the basis for new targets to be set in July 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.5/1">In the event of a motorway accident the responsibility for determining temporary speed limits lies with the police. Temporary speed limits are normally set by the police control room but these speed limits, which are in any case advisory, are able to be changed by the senior officer at the scene of the accident, who may request that control room staff alter speed limits. On the M25 between junctions 10 and 16 the temporary speed limit signs are set automatically in response to sensors in the road which detect traffic speed. The signs, on this section of controlled motorway, are mandatory. Data on the level at which speed limits are set and the duration for which they are applied are recorded and available.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.6/1">The UK and the EU have repeatedly called for the release of all political prisoners in Burma. When the EU Troika, including the United Kingdom, met the Burmese Foreign Minister in Kyoto on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-06">6 May</phrase>, they handed over a list of 19 political prisoners whose release the EU requested on urgent humanitarian grounds. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-16">16 May</phrase> our ambassador in Rangoon reminded the Burmese Foreign Minister of the importance we attach to the release of prisoners on this list, and of the level of concern in both Houses over the situation in Burma and abuse of human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.6/2">We are concerned that, despite the release of a few political prisoners in recent months, arrests for political reasons have continued. In particular, we are concerned by the detention in February of a number of Shan leaders including Khun Htun Oo, Sai Nyunt Lwin and Sai Hsoten, who are being tried in secret in Insein Jail, without contact with their families, and who have been unable to appoint a lawyer of their own choosing. Furthermore we are concerned by the arrests during the last two months of elected representatives U Kyaw Hsan, U Kyaw Min, U Saw Hlaing and U Kyaw Khin, since these arrests all appear to be politically motivated.</p>

	<p pid="a.138W.5/1">We condemn the recent attacks against humanitarian workers in Darfur. Many of these attacks appear to be the result of opportunistic banditry and general lawlessness. The African Union mission in Darfur has made a positive impact on security in the areas in which it has deployed and we fully support its expansion as the best way of addressing the security situation in Darfur. We continue to make clear to the Government of Sudan that it is their responsibility to provide security for all their people, and to actively pursue those who breach the law. We have made clear to all parties that attacks against humanitarian workers are in violation of international humanitarian law and it is imperative that those responsible are brought to justice. UN Security Council Resolution 1591, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-29">29 March</phrase>, allows for sanctions to be brought against those who commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities. And Resolution 1593, which we sponsored on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>, referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. Both these Resolutions provide a means towards addressing the impunity which has been prevalent in Darfur to date; we will follow their impact closely.</p>

We continue to make clear to the Government of Sudan that it bears the primary responsibility for security in Darfur, and that it must rein in and neutralise these armed militias, as it committed to doing in the Abuja Security Protocol.</p>

	<p pid="a.140W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's recent discussions on trade with north Cyprus have been in the context of the determination, as set out by EU Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">26 April 2004</phrase>, to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.8/2">This commitment is embodied in two proposed regulations. The first would enable the disbursal of &euro;259 million aid for north Cyprus. The second would enable preferential direct trade between north Cyprus and the rest of the EU. The Government discusses these proposals regularly at senior official level with EU partners, the Commission and parties on the island, and the Foreign Secretary last discussed ending the isolation of the north with the Turkish Foreign Minister in March. The EU has yet to reach agreement on these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.8/3">The Government believe that direct trade will reduce the economic disparity between the north and south of the island and will help the Turkish Cypriots to raise standards towards EU norms. Narrowing the economic divide between the north and south will remove a major obstacle to a future settlement to the Cyprus problem. We therefore call upon all EU partners and the Commission to co-operate to find a way to fulfil the EU's commitment to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.</p>

High Court Judges who sit in the CACD do not need to be ticketed to hear rape appeals. In relation to this point I would refer the hon. Member for Redcar to my answer to the earlier question from the hon. Member. Some of the Lords Justices who currently sit in the CACD will also have attended the Serious Sexual Offences Seminar (SSOS) whilst they were High Court Judges because it would have been compulsory for them to do so. It is unlikely that any constitution of the CACD that considers a rape appeal would not include at least one member who has attended the SSOS.</p>

Government food stocks and import plans are unknown. Although widespread starvation is unlikely, up to six million people could experience serious food shortages by the end of the year. We are supporting an &pound;18 million Protracted Relief Programme to assist up to 1.5 million of the most vulnerable people in Zimbabwe. DFID, UN agencies and other donors are monitoring the situation closely and await clarity from the Government of Zimbabwe regarding their need for further assistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.150W.11/1">In common with many developing countries, Ghana uses HIV/AIDS prevalence among 15 to 24-year-old women attending antenatal care as a proxy to measure HIV/AIDS incidence&mdash;that is, the rate of new HIV/AIDS infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.11/2">Ghana's HIV/AIDS survey for 2004 reported that HIV/AIDS prevalence among 15 to 24-years-olds was 2.5 per cent., lower than any year since 2001. National prevalence was 3.1 per cent. in 2004, down from 3.6 per cent. in 2003. While encouraging, the improvements registered in 2004 are closely associated with an 83 per cent. increase in the number of antenatal testing sites in rural areas, where levels of infection tend to be lower.</p>

	<p pid="a.157W.14/1">The Government provides financial assistance for a range of town/city centre regeneration initiatives, and this forms a key part of the work of English Partnerships, the Government's national regeneration agency, in pursuance of the Sustainable Communities Plan. English Partnerships is committed to the provision of mixed-use development rather than single use: the need for facilities, including retail, to support sustainable communities is recognised and retail provision is factored into many of its projects, including at the local level. The extent of funding availability from English Partnerships will depend on specific local circumstances and whether a particular project accords with English Partnerships' corporate priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.14/2">The redevelopment of derelict retail precincts would in general terms be eligible for support from the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) Single Programme (including Single Regeneration Budget). The appropriate regional development agency should be approached in the first instance: again, funding availability will depend on specific circumstances and the fit with RDA priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.14/3">The Government also supports the introduction of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) to assist the delivery of high-quality town centre regeneration and enhance existing business environments, although this is not through large-scale capital funding. Government funding, together with assistance from private sector partners, has been provided through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for the BIDs pilot research project, which looked to test the BIDs concepts in a number of locations around the UK. BIDs do not relate solely to retail centres, but many town and local centres do include a large retail element.</p>
