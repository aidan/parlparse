	<p pid="c.1048W.9/2">All budgetary data are required to be uploaded at a high level of detail to the Treasury's Combined Online Information System (COINS), in a format that is coded to be compatible with it. This allows subsequent analysis (via COINS) across the budgets, estimates, accounts and national accounts, for publication (at aggregated level) in the national accounts, departmental report, supplementary budgetary information tables, and estimates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1048W.9/3">These raw data were designed to be analysed by COINS, and as such are of no value without the means to decode them. The complex analysis that was requested in the original question required decoding and analysis of the raw data by a means other than COINS. It would require a range of data sources to be used, to obtain both the estimate line and departmental report heading codes and related information, to allow the level of analysis required by the question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1048W.9/4">Staff investigated the most efficient way of providing this analysis, and then tested the viability of providing a full decoding and analysis of the uploaded data. This demonstrated that the extent of the work required to complete the full analysis would exceed the cost limit set for PQs. At that point, work stopped on the PQ.</p>

However under Council Decision 2005/876/JHA of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-21">21 November 2005</phrase> the United Kingdom can, in the context of criminal proceedings in the UK, send a request for criminal record information to another member state in relation to offences committed by nationals of the member state.

	<p pid="c.1054W.6/1">I meet many leaders in higher education to discuss issues of importance to them, including the reforms to our national qualifications system and admissions. Higher education institutions are solely responsible for their own admissions and it is for them to decide the entry requirements to individual courses, including prior qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.6/2">The Department does not assess the value of the wide range of entry qualifications that institutions may use to select from applicants. But the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority maintain and develop the national curriculum and associated assessments, tests and examinations, and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service's tariff is a points system used to report achievement for entry to higher education in a numerical format. It establishes agreed comparability between different types of qualifications and provides comparisons between applicants with different types and volumes of achievement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.6/3">A-levels already provide a high quality, well recognised route into HE courses for large numbers of students and the changes that are being made from September will reinforce this. New A-levels which are being taught from September this year have incorporated further stretch and challenge and the new Extended Project has been widely welcomed by admissions tutors as likely to allow applicants to demonstrate the independent study skills that they will need for HE. These will be complemented by the new diplomas and over 100 higher education institutions have already confirmed that they will include these new qualifications as part of their admissions processes. A recent report by the 1994 Group of universities shows widespread welcome for changes being made to A-levels to ensure they provide the right level of stretch and challenge for those going on to higher education. The same report was also positive about the use universities would make of the new diplomas in admissions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1056W.6/2">Schedule 1 paragraph 22 of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 provides that the functions of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission are to be exercised on behalf of the Crown. This means that all Agency employee terms and conditions are protected on transfer and that transferred Agency people will remain civil servants as stated during the passage of the Act. It is our intention that the Commission be classified as a Crown non-departmental public body once the relevant provisions of the Act have been commenced.</p>

	<p pid="c.1059W.3/1">The Air Accidents Investigation Branch investigation into LOT flight 282 on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-04">4 June 2007</phrase> concluded that the primary cause of the incident was a single error made by the co-pilot prior to take off from Heathrow by the use of &quot;E&quot; instead of &quot;W&quot; when the longitude co-ordinates were entered into the flight management system. This led to the crew experiencing difficulties navigating the aircraft and necessitated their return to Heathrow under the guidance of air traffic control.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/2">The AAIB report notes that the crew's difficulties were complicated by the commander of the aircraft having some difficulty comprehending and communicating with the air traffic controllers, a situation probably exacerbated by the high workload in the cockpit attendant on the navigational problems. The report suggests that the incident is indicative of problems which can arise through a lack of understanding between controllers and flight crews.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/3">Accurate communication between flight crews and air traffic controllers is clearly a matter of the first importance to the safety of international aviation. The requirements for language proficiency for operational personnel are determined by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which has traditionally required that air-ground radiotelephony communications shall be conducted in the language normally used by the station on the ground or in the English language.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/4">In 2003, with UK support, ICAO took steps to reinforce rules on language proficiency. It set a deadline of March 2008 for proficiency in Level 4 (operational) and above English for all pilots flying international routes, and for ATC controllers serving international airports and routes. The proficiency scale ranges from Level 1 to Level 6, with guidelines published for pronunciation, fluency, structure, vocabulary, comprehension and interaction. Level 4 (operational) proficiency is considered as a minimum 'stepping stone' to higher levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/5">The UK became compliant with ICAO's language proficiency requirements on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-05">5 March 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/6">However, in recognition that not all states would be able to comply fully by March 2008, ICAO, while urging states to meet the deadline if at all possible, has allowed for a transition period from March 2008 until March 2011. The Polish Civil Aviation Office are due to specify a date by which they will comply with the ICAO requirement for English language proficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/7">I naturally hope that all ICAO signatory states become compliant with the language proficiency requirements as soon as possible. As ICAO Level 4 (operational) proficiency in English is not yet binding on States, however, the UK, as an ICAO signatory, cannot make this a requirement for granting permission to foreign airlines to operate to UK airports.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/8">I understand however that evaluation of this incident by UK air navigation services provider, NATS, has identified to a number of learning points which have been incorporated into NATS' &quot;Training for Unusual and Emergency Circumstances&quot; package which all controllers are required to complete annually.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/9">The European Aviation Safety Agency is consulting on its draft implementing rules for operations and flight crew licensing from May to November 2008. These proposals include legal requirements on language proficiency.</p>

	<p pid="c.1060W.2/6">In addition to this many train operators have provided improved cycle parking at public interchanges often working with local authorities. For example, TfL have provided improved cycle parking including the introduction of the innovative cycle centre at Finsbury Park Station, and Surrey county council have also worked with train operators to improve cycle parking at a number of stations in the county.</p>

	<p pid="c.1063W.3/1">The Highways Agency (HA) developed a deliberately proactive stakeholder engagement strategy to support the wider implementation of ramp metering across its network. The purpose of the strategy was to explain the concepts and anticipated benefits of ramp metering, introduce the project structure and the sites selected for implementation, engender understanding, trust and support among stakeholders, provide a coherent and consistent picture of progress and minimise the risk of mis-information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1063W.3/2">Due to the extent to which ramp metering affects the operation of the motorway, the HA recognised that there would be a wide range of interested parties, both at a national and local level, with whom it would be essential to liaise. These included the network 'consumers' (nationally and local to a scheme), regional and local government, police and other emergency services, driver and business representative groups, suppliers and staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1063W.3/3">The stakeholder engagement strategy and associated communications plan provided a detailed identification of the main stakeholders and their information needs, the roles and responsibilities for stakeholder engagement and the key messages and available channels of communication. Different types of communications included presentations, press notices, briefing notes, meetings, leaflets and a publicity video.</p>
	<p pid="c.1063W.3/4">As an example, for the new sites on the M4 in the South East, liaison has taken place with the following stakeholders:</p>

	<p pid="c.1070W.9/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) does not retain data for the proportion of victim personal statements, which form part of the prosecution file or the proportion of victim personal statements which are shared with the court.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.9/2">However, the CPS recognises the importance that victim personal statements can have to inform the decision to prosecute and the appropriate charges and the added value in providing victims of crime with an opportunity to inform the court about the impact the crime has had on their lives. Systems and procedures have been developed to ensure that victim personal statements are drawn to the courts attention. Additionally, under the CPS victim focus scheme, crown prosecutors play a key role in assisting bereaved families to prepare a victim personal statement.</p>

	<p pid="c.1079W.8/1">The dredging of the Thames to provide navigation, manoeuvring and berthing depth for the ships using the new port, will be carried out under Tidal Works Approval from the Port of London Authority (PLA). An application for Tidal Works Approval is to be submitted to the PLA shortly. The Environment Agency will be consulted on this application and will consider the impact of the dredging work on the flood defence structures as part of its assessment of the application.</p>
	<p pid="c.1079W.8/2">The navigation channel, which will be deepened to accommodate vessels using the new port, is approximately 2 km from the wreck. D. P. World, the developer of the London Gateway Port, is aware of the existence of the wreck and the company's dredging contractor will have no need to work in close proximity to it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1083W.5/2">Anyone may take a prosecution under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. On conviction, the maximum penalties available for an offence of unnecessary suffering are a fine of &pound;20,000 or six month's imprisonment, or both. The maximum penalties for failing to provide for the welfare of an animal are a fine of &pound;5,000 or six month's imprisonment, or both.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.5/3">The court may, in addition to any other punishment on conviction, deprive a person of ownership of an animal. The court may also disqualify the person convicted from having custody of any animal for such a period as it thinks fit. This could mean a lifetime ban from keeping animals. Additionally, DEFRA may refuse authorisation to transport animals to farmers within three years of conviction for such an offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.5/4">If Animal Health finds that animal welfare is compromised on the farm of a single farm payment claimant, they may report this as a breach to the RPA (in England), who may apply a penalty reduction in the calendar year in which the breach occurred. While civil (via cross compliance) and criminal proceedings could arise out of the same offence, penalties cannot be applied retrospectively by the RPA in response to the conviction of a claimant for animal welfare offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.1083W.8/1">The proposed Marine Management Organisation will be the Government's regulator of most activities in the marine environment&mdash;with some exceptions, as set out in the policy document published alongside the draft Marine Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.8/2">The Marine Bill White Paper published in March 2007 explained that the current system of licensing oil and gas infrastructure and activity works well, and there is no compelling evidence that integrating it with others would achieve any benefits. The Government therefore intend the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR) to remain responsible for delivering this service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.8/3">Similarly, careful consideration has been given by DEFRA and the Department for Transport (DFT) to the relationship between the MMO and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA)&mdash;an executive agency of the Department for Transport, responsible throughout the UK for implementing the Government's maritime safety policy, including the co-ordination of search and rescue at sea, ensuring that ships meet UK and international safety rules, and the environmental control of shipping in UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.8/4">It is important to maintain the MCA as a separate organisation with a clear, single focus on shipping and maritime safety. The regulation of merchant shipping (including ship-to-ship oil transfer) sits firmly within the MCAs remit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.8/5">DEFRA and DfT officials are currently considering whether the MMO should take on responsibility for the registration of fishing vessels which is currently delivered across the UK by MCA alongside the registration of non-fishing vessels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.8/6">Part 1, chapter 3 of the draft Marine Bill provides flexible arrangements to enable the delivery of marine functions by the MMO. This provides a flexible tool which could enable any Secretary of State to enter into an arrangement with the MMO to deliver any marine functions in the future were this considered the most effective and efficient delivery mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.8/7">The MMO will need to develop effective working relationships with a range of other bodies with responsibilities in the marine area&mdash;including the MCA and BERR. We envisage Memoranda of Understanding being drawn up between the MMO and these other bodies to clarify how they will work together.</p>

	<p pid="c.1085W.0/1">The proposed Marine Management Organisation (MMO) will be an Executive non-departmental public body (NDPB) and its staff will be public servants. Staff within core Departments and the Marine and Fisheries Agency delivering functions that will transfer to the MMO are civil servants.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/2">Staff transferring to the MMO would do so under the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice using TUPE principles and there would therefore be no detriment to pay or terms of employment at the point of transfer. Any future changes would only happen through proper consultation with the relevant trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/3">The staff of the MMO will have the opportunity to work within an organisation making a significant contribution to the sustainable management of our seas&mdash;through the first marine planning system of its kind in the world, streamlined, modern and fit for purpose licensing regimes and effective, joined up enforcement. The Marine and Fisheries Agency is working to prepare itself as an organisation and its staff to form a solid foundation for the MMO.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/4">When acting in the course of their duties for the MMO employees will be unlikely to face personal litigation, in the same way that civil servants are unlikely to. Decisions taken are on behalf of the MMO so any potential claim would lie against the MMO not an individual officer. Civil servants only enjoy immunity where Crown immunity applies in specific circumstances&mdash;they have no general immunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/5">The draft Marine Bill does however give specific immunity to Marine Enforcement Officers appointed by the MMO and other enforcement officers. These officers need to be protected when they carry out inspections and investigations out at sea and on land to prevent their freedom to perform their duties being hampered by a fear of legal action being taken against them. The immunity applies so long as the enforcement officers are acting lawfully within their powers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/6">This mirrors the position for existing officers, for example, British Sea Fisheries Officers (BSFOs).</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.3/1">The economic difficulties faced by pig producers in the last year have been driven by a number of factors, in particular the rising cost of feed ingredients. On feed, the UK has supported the Commission's measures aimed at reducing market pressure, including the suspension for a further year of import duties on feed grains, the re-selling of the remaining intervention stocks of grain and the removal of the requirement for farmers to set-aside land for the 2008 harvest.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.3/2">DEFRA has been supportive of the pig industry and we worked together to reopen markets outside the EU following the FMD outbreak in 2007. DEFRA also provided, after that outbreak, a &pound;12.5 million aid package to the livestock farming sector, including &pound;2 million to promote the marketing of pork and other red meat.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.3/3">However, the long-term sustainability of the pig sector will depend on its ability to compete successfully in the market place, with performance, quality and welfare standards as essential factors.

	<p pid="c.1099W.2/2">Following the Department's 2008 planning round, we no longer intend to take up the option to place orders for further Type 45 warships beyond the six already on contract. Instead, we plan to bring forward the timetable for the introduction of the Future Surface Combatant which is intended to provide replacements for the Type 22 and Type 23 frigates. This, together with the Carrier and Astute programmes, will balance the volume of construction workload across maritime programmes to ensure retention of key capabilities and viability of the business that delivers them.</p>

Tax credits notices contain all the information used to calculate an award and it is a requirement of the primary legislation that when HMRC make a decision about tax credit entitlement, they send a notice setting out the decision to each of the partners in a joint claim.</p>

	<p pid="c.1114W.6/2">A number of initiatives have been introduced since the last amnesty and are now in operation across Northern Ireland to reduce the level of knife crime. PSNI have rolled out the use of metal detectors and also introduced a stop and search policy. New legislation has been introduced to make it more difficult to obtain knives by raising the minimum age limit for purchase to 18. Last month, it became illegal in Northern Ireland to manufacture, sell, hire or import samurai swords. The recent Criminal Justice (NI) Order contains powers which double the penalties for possessing a knife in public and also for selling/manufacturing/marketing knives to under 18's.</p>
	<p pid="c.1114W.6/3">Knife disposal bins have been retained on site at civic amnesty locations and PSNI education officers continue to raise awareness in schools on a number of key issues, including the dangers of carrying a knife.</p>

	<p pid="c.1119W.9/1">Since the creation of the Ministry of Justice, the Department uses a number of different accounting systems and each of these employs its own chart of accounts. The main accounting systems currently in use are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1119W.9/2" class="indent">the Home Office's Adelphi system, which hosts the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and the Office of Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR);</p>

	<p pid="c.1119W.9/6">The Department is taking steps to rationalise its accounting arrangements, with NOMS migrating from Adelphi to Phoenix and OCJR migrating from Adelphi to ARAMIS during the current financial year. Ultimately, the aim of the Department's Shared Service Programme will be to move to the use of a single accounting system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1119W.9/7">The charts of accounts for 2008-09 therefore reflects the Department's structure as it currently is and will not necessarily reflect the 2007-08 structure, or that of future years. The charts show the relationship between parent codes (used for preparing resource accounts) and children codes (used for more detailed management purposes).

	<p pid="c.1122W.2/1">The Mental Capacity Act 2005 came fully into force in October 2007. Prior to that point training provision was the responsibility of the Public Guardianship Office&mdash;the Office of the Public Guardian's predecessor. This included training for the new processes and procedures relating to Lasting Powers of Attorney that the Act introduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.2/2">Since October, the OPG has been responsible for meeting all ongoing training needs. Over the last 12 months, specific training on the registration of LPAs has been provided to staff in the Applications and Processing area, which deals with the registration of LPAs, and to staff in the Contact Centre, which advises clients on LPA process and the progress of individual applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.2/3">Additionally, all staff at the OPG attended awareness seminars on the new Act and LPAs. Initial training is gained through such seminars and similar themed workshops. Practical assistance has then been provided via desk bound training and a buddy scheme whereby experienced staff &quot;shadow&quot; new staff members and undertake additional floor-walking. This helps to ensure that staff are familiar with new systems and processes from which they may begin to put theory into practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.2/4">Because of the range of training offered and in particular the significant amounts of flexibly provided desk training, it has not been possible to provide exact figures on the total cost. However, based on average staff costs and reasonable assumptions of the average amount of time per staff member spent on training, we estimate a sum of &pound;73,680 has been spent on staff training in relation to LPAs to date.</p>

A letter sent to Stroud district council explained these reasons more fully. I understand that a copy of this letter was sent to my hon.

	<p pid="c.1141W.8/2">Where local housing authorities consider that there is a need to exert more control on the management of the private rented sector in specific neighbourhoods in their area, it is open to them to introduce selective licensing regimes alongside other strategic initiatives and subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. So far, seven such schemes have been introduced by five local authorities. We are aware of several other schemes in preparation. The Department has commissioned an independent review of the private rented sector which may offer a view on the issues raised. It is scheduled to report in October 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1145W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/2">Waste Strategy 2007 sets out our policy on energy from waste, and provides guidance on the various energy from waste technologies, their different feedstocks, carbon emissions, and outputs. These are described in the 'summary guidance on energy from waste technology' (Annex E of Waste Strategy 2007).</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/3">New incinerators have to meet the requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive (200/76/EC), Article 6(6) which requires that</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/4" class="indent">'any heat generated by the incineration or the co-incineration process shall be recovered as far as practicable'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/5">Guidance published by DEFRA and the Welsh Assembly Government was first issued in early 2003 and deals with this, and all other requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/6">However, technology choice is ultimately a matter for local authorities, and not DEFRA. Any plans for new energy from waste facilities must emerge out of local waste strategies, so that all options for reuse, recycling and composting can be explored first. We expect greenhouse gas emissions to be a key consideration of those developing waste to energy plants.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/7">Experience from many other European countries has shown that a vigorous energy from waste policy is compatible with high recycling rates (e.g. Netherlands 65 per cent./33 per cent.; Sweden 42 per cent./45 per cent.; Denmark 41 per cent./55 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/8">All municipal waste incinerators are tightly regulated under the Waste Incineration Directive (WID) to protect public health and the environment. Emission standards for incinerators are tighter than for conventional power stations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/9">With regard to energy from waste projects undertaken as part of DEFRA's Waste Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding scheme, the current Waste PFI criteria were issued in May 2006. Projects must meet these criteria in order to be considered for PFI credits. The criteria aim to ensure that PFI credits are allotted to projects that are value for money and enable the investment in residual waste infrastructure necessary if the demanding targets in the Landfill Directive and Waste Strategy for England 2007 are to be met.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/10">The following criteria are included:</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/11" class="indent">2. PFI credits are awarded to authorities primarily to deliver increased diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. Proposals should demonstrate how the schemes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/12" class="indent">contribute to or complement longer-term national targets for recycling and composting as well as diversion of biodegradable and other municipal waste from landfill, indicating the amount of biodegradable and other municipal waste expected to be diverted from landfill over the whole life of the project;</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/13" class="indent">support or complement the authorities' plans for recycling set out in their Municipal Waste Management Strategies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/14" class="indent">5. The use of residual waste treatment options involving recovery, including energy from waste solutions, will have an integral role in treating the waste we cannot 'design out', re-use or recycle. Such options should be considered while also demonstrating that there is no future barrier to meeting reduction, reuse and recycling targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/15" class="indent">6. Proposals should demonstrate that other relevant authorities, the public, and interested parties have been consulted and that there is a broad consensus supporting a recognised long term waste management strategy which is reflected in the proposed solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.1145W.2/16" class="indent">10. Preferential consideration will be given to capital projects which focus on residual treatment plant only, including, but not limited to, Energy from Waste, Mechanical Biological Treatments and Anaerobic Digestion.</p>

	<p pid="c.1147W.0/1">The LSC operate the education maintenance allowance (EMA) scheme for the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) and hold the information about take-up and payments made under the scheme. Mark Haysom, the LSC's Chief Executive, will write to the hon. Member with the information requested and a copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1147W.0/2">The LSC does not collect information specifically about completion rates for learners in receipt of EMA and there are no recent estimates available. However, it would be reasonable to expect improvements in completion rates to contribute to increased attainment by EMA recipients. Recent analysis commissioned by the LSC shows significant positive impacts on the attainment of young people taking Level 2 and Level 3 qualifications. These positive impacts have been particularly strong among more disadvantaged groups such as those from the most deprived neighbourhoods and those who had previously achieved less well academically.</p>
	<p pid="c.1147W.0/3">A copy of the results of this evaluation, with a summary of the key findings, was placed in the House Library on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1147W.0/7" class="indent">Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and received Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is available at Local Authority Level.

In 2005/06 EMA roll out continued and EMA was available to all 16 and 17 year olds nationally. In 2006/07 EMA is available to all 16, 17 and 18 year olds nationally.</p>

	<p pid="c.1150W.2/1">We expect UK host families involved in providing accommodation for foreign students in organised school exchange visits to undergo enhanced CRB checks. This is in line with guidance to schools in respect of volunteers involved in activities requiring an overnight stay, as set out in paragraph 4.56 of &quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot;. We also recommend that host families are given basic awareness of child protection issues and the contact details of the designated senior person within the school with responsibility for safeguarding issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/2">For other host families making private arrangements of fewer than 28 days, CRB Disclosures are not required in this area. We recommend however those involved in supervising or looking after the child are made aware of child protection issues as set out in &quot;What To Do if You Are Worried A Child Is Being Abused&quot;. Organisations setting up such visits should consider developing guidance and child protection policies to enable host families to clearly understand the issues and their responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/3">The new independent safeguarding (ISA) scheme will mean that from October 2009 those who provide care and accommodation for children under 18 for reward or in pursuance of an arrangement made by someone other than a member of the child's family will be engaged in regulated activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/4">This includes host family arrangements for fewer than 28 days made by other organisations providing tuition in languages or other subjects. It will be a criminal offence for a barred individual to engage in this activity and the person organising the host family placement will be required to check that the person providing the care and accommodation is ISA registered.</p>

The LSC has discretion over how these budgets are spent to ensure that young people are able to access learning opportunities that meet their needs, and to meet the skill needs of individuals and employers at national, regional and local level.

	<p pid="c.1151W.2/1">The available expenditure on nursery provision (including private/voluntary/independent settings, maintained nurseries and nursery units at maintained primaries) was estimated at &pound;4,027 million in 2007-08 (figure from the 2008 Departmental Report, Table 8.5). It is not possible to break down the information technology funding by phase, but the total figure within the schools budget in 2007-08 was estimated at &pound;617 million (DAR 2008 Table 8.3). This figure is capital funding and is separate from the revenue funding quoted above.</p>

	<p pid="c.1157W.5/2">We are improving mental health care for older people including pensioners through our new National Dementia Strategy and Implementation Plan, which will be out for consultation this month. The aim of the strategy is to ensure that significant improvements across three key areas in relation to dementia services: improved awareness; earlier diagnosis and intervention; and higher quality of care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1157W.5/3">In addition to this, in 2006, we produced &quot;Everybody's Business, Integrated Mental Health Services for Older Adults: A service development guide&quot;, which set out the key components of a comprehensive mental health service. Copies of the guide are available in the Library. Since April 2006, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) has rewarded general practitioner practices for maintaining a register of patients diagnosed with dementia and, more recently, the Care Services Improvement Partnership, our social care implementation arm, has been active in rolling out the Let's Respect campaign which provides guidance for general hospital staff on older people's mental health.</p>

	<p pid="c.1158W.2/17">Much of the muscular dystrophy research supported by the MRC is on-going.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/18">Over the last 10 years, the main part of the Department's total expenditure on health research has been devolved to and managed by national health service organisations. Details of individual NHS supported research projects undertaken during that time, including a number concerned with DMD, are available on the archived national research register at:</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/19" class="indent">https://portal.nihr.ac.uk/Pages/NRRArchiveSearch.aspx</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/20">The Department has additionally provided &pound;1.6 million for a four year project aimed at developing a new treatment for DMD; and through its Policy Research Programme is funding a &pound;1.1 million long term neurological condition research initiative. One of the studies commissioned as part of the initiative is specifically concerned with DMD.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/21">Implementation of the Department's research strategy &quot;Best Research for Best Health&quot; and the establishment of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has resulted in an expansion of our research programmes and in significant new funding opportunities. Two of the NIHR Biomedical Research Centres formed last year&mdash;at Imperial College and at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the Institute for Child Health&mdash;plan over the next five years to undertake research on DMD therapy.</p>

	<p pid="c.1164W.5/12">Today, patients can expect a maximum 13-week wait for their first out-patient appointment and a maximum six-month wait for an operation from a decision to admit. These improvements are a result of a combination of record investment, the hard work of national health service staff and changes in the way the NHS works.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.5/13">By December 2008, no one should have to wait more than 18 weeks from the time they are referred to the start of their treatment, unless it is clinically appropriate or they choose to wait longer. Delivery of the 18-week waiting time standard will reduce unnecessary delays and improve patients' experience of the whole journey.</p>

	<p pid="c.1166W.3/2">1. Opening three one stop border posts in the region, between: Zambia and Zimbabwe; Mozambique and South Africa; and Lesotho and South Africa.

	<p pid="c.1167W.5/1">The EU Water Initiative has helped a number of African countries prepare their own water and sanitation plans and has played a key role on creation of the EU Water Facility that makes funds available for water and sanitation. The total fund contributed by the European Commission to the EU Water Facility is &euro;500 million. This will enable 20 million people to gain access to safe water and 9 million to improved sanitation.</p>

The Africa Working Group has also played a key role in mapping member state contributions to water and sanitation in Africa. Through our involvement in the Africa Working Group, we have improved the EU's relationship with the AMCOW, to the extent that water will be a specific focus at the next meeting of the African Heads of State in July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1167W.5/3">A number of key policy reforms recommended in a DFID/German funded review of the EU Water Initiative were approved in August 2007. These reforms will result in greater focus on delivery in Africa and setting clear and measurable targets, which will help the EU Water Initiative to add real value and become more accountable to its stakeholders.</p>

Much of our work is focused on MDG 3 and includes an emphasis on women and girls' access to education, economic opportunities, public services, political participation and decision-making, and maternal mortality.

The strategy commits &pound;6 billion to strengthening health systems and services until 2015, a significant proportion of which will be spent in Africa.

DFID also provides funding towards HIV/AIDS in Africa via multilateral institutions, such as UNAIDS, WHO and the World Bank, and global funds. For example the UK has committed &pound;1 billion (2007-15) to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for Africa and other regions.</p>

More small scale producers are benefiting, and export volumes are rising, both to South African and international markets. For example, the exports of organic groundnuts to Europe increased from zero to 126 metric tonnes between 2005 and 2007; and South Africa's tea imports from Tanzania increased by 600 tonnes between 2005 and 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1172W.8/1">In December 2007, The UK Government's Department for International Development contributed &pound;417 million to the African Development Fund of the African Development Bank and became its largest donor. Infrastructure financing is predicted to reach more than $5 billion under African Development Fund 2008-10 and the amount available to be committed to regional projects will increase from 15 per cent. to 17.5 per cent. of total funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.8/2">In 2007, DFID also doubled its funding to the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa Secretariat hosted at the African Development Bank in 2007, including providing a secondee. DFID is also supporting other initiatives to help the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa be effective, helping leverage increased financing from others. DFID committed &pound;6 million to the Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility hosted at the African Development Bank to help get regional infrastructure in Africa ready for financing. The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa is making good progress. Its annual report for 2007, soon to be published, will show that funding by its members increased by 54 per cent. to $11.9 billion in 2007, up from $7.7 billion in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.8/3">DFID committed &pound;7 million to the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund in 2007. DFID nominated the African Development Bank to take up its position on the Project Financiers Group of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund. This will help with African ownership and improve co-ordination between EU member states and the African Development Bank.</p>

In partnership with the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC), the UK is co-funding the South Asian Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF), which in Bangladesh provides aid to the light engineering sector via small foundries and steel mills; the ready-made garments industry; and the poultry industry. These industries are highly labour intensive, offering huge potential for poverty eradication through employment generation for the poor.</p>

	<p pid="c.1174W.3/1">The main objective of the multi-agency humanitarian effort in response to Cyclone Nargis is to reach all affected populations as quickly as possible. The aid operation is scaling-up all the time. The UK is delivering its aid through United Nations, non-governmental organisation (NGO) and Red Cross partners, who have expanding coverage in the affected areas. More than &pound;10 million of UK funds have been allocated to NGOs. They are working closely with local authorities to identify the worst affected populations and to reach them with clean fresh drinking water, sanitation facilities, basic health care and emergency shelter and agricultural assistance in the Delta.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.3/2">The UK has given &pound;5 million to the United Nations for their logistics operation to ensure that the UN has adequate helicopters, boats, ships and trucks to transport aid into and around Burma, to the most hard-hit areas of the country. Additionally we have directly provided 14 flat-bottomed boats which are operating to good effect to deliver supplies to remote parts of the Delta.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.3/3">The UK is also working closely with the UN and ASEAN countries to press the Burmese Government to open better access to the Delta. Whilst access is still not good enough, increasing numbers of international staff and assistance are beginning to reach those in the worst affected areas. Progress however remains fragile and could be reversed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1183W.5/1">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's study on the relationship of social policy issues, gender equality, social inclusion and effectiveness in Sierra Leone was undertaken in Sierra Leone during November and December 2007, with the final report being presented in January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1183W.5/2">The Government of Sierra Leone have not undertaken any formal assessment of progress of the study as a whole so far. However, there have been assessments of progress in some specific areas. Of particular note are the campaigns to encourage more women to vote in the up-coming local elections, and to stand as candidates (partly funded by DFID under an umbrella programme Promoting Voice and Transparency on Elections, PIVOT). Although the figures will not be known until after the elections, the number of women candidates standing (16.5 per cent.) is nearly double that of last time (9 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="c.1183W.5/3">In the five months since the study's launch, the Government agency that has responsibility for the monitoring of the study (the Development Assistance Co-ordination Office, DACO) has been focused on finalising two strategic processes:</p>

	<p pid="c.1188W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your questions asking what percentage of the qualifying population are registered as electors in (a) each local authority in the North West and (b) Warrington. (212308).</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/4" class="indent">Table 1 gives the number of people who are registered to vote in the local/European elections as a percent of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; age 18 and over, for each local authority in the North West (and Warrington), for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/5" class="indent">These percentages provide the closest available approximation to the registration rates that you requested. However they should not be interpreted as the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote. Not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote, for example foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth are not eligible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/6" class="indent">The figures used are for the local/ European electorate because the eligibility criteria are closer to the definition of the usually resident population than those for the parliamentary electorate (EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded).</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/7" class="indent">For some areas rates exceed one hundred per cent as figures for the registered electorate may be inflated. People who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses and electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or died).</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/8" class="indent">The limitations described above affect areas in different ways. This limits comparability of these figures across local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/9" class="indent">The figures provided are for the most recent year that estimates of the usually resident population are available. Electoral statistics for December 2007 are available at:</p>
