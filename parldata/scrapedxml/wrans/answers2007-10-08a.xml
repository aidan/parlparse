In relation to grants, once an agreement has been made and payment schedules agreed to, public sector organisations should honour these in the same way as they would any commercial or contractual arrangements. Government departments are required to note as exceptional any interest payments in relation to late payments in their resource accounts.

	<p pid="a.3W.5/1">The types of training delivered by the Fire Service College and the Emergency Planning College reflect their differing but complementary missions. The Fire Service College focuses on specialist training at the operational (bronze), tactical (silver) and strategic (gold) levels, and over 90 per cent. of its students are from the fire and rescue service. As officers progress through the levels, they receive increasing exposure to multi-agency operations. In contrast, the Emergency Planning College's courses bring together all the many services and organisations involved in multi-agency working at the strategic (gold) level in large-scale emergencies, including non-blue light scenarios such as influenza. As a result, fire and rescue service students comprise less than 10 per cent. of the Emergency Planning College's intake.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.5/2">In order to maximise the UK's resilience to emergencies the Emergency Planning College and Fire Service College collaborate to ensure that their training programmes are consistent with their responsibilities, meet their respective customers' requirements and achieve synergy. The overall co-ordination is effected through periodic meetings at senior and middle management levels of the major providers of multi-agency training, including the Fire Service and Emergency Planning Colleges and the National Policing Improvement Agency.</p>

The decision on the content of the user agreement in relation to how the system dealt with ballot papers, including auto-adjudication, was the responsibility of returning officers and the e-counting provider.

	<p pid="a.8W.3/1">DFID Ministers and officials have had a productive and ongoing dialogue with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries on the issue of European Union (EU) sugar reforms.

	<p pid="a.8W.3/2">Most recent communication between DFID and the ACP countries has been about the European Commission's proposal to terminate the sugar protocol (SP).

	<p pid="a.8W.6/1">In 2003 the European Commission undertook an impact assessment of the proposed reform of the European Union (EU) internal sugar market (this was formally adopted by the Agricultural Council in February 2006). In May 2006 DEFRA undertook a comprehensive regulatory impact assessment of the reform. This assessment looked at the potential impact of the reform on all stakeholders including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries that supply sugar to the EU market under a preferential trade agreement. In addition DFID has commissioned a number of independent studies looking at the impacts of the reform on the sugar industry in developing countries, with particular emphasis on the least developed countries (LDC's).</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.6/2">The assessments and studies all suggest that the reform will present challenges for the ACP countries who will see the value of their preference decline. They also show that the reform will provide impetus for some of the ACP countries to move their economies away from large scale dependency on sugar and thereby provide long term economic benefit in the form of efficiency gains. However the assessment also suggests the ACP countries will need financial assistance to help them diversify their economies and adapt to the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.6/3">In response to these assessments DFID successfully lobbied the Commission to provide transitional assistance for the ACP countries. As a result of the lobbying the EU has earmarked around &euro;1.244 billion between 2007 and 2013. Allocation of these funds is based on a national Sugar Action Plan submitted independently by the ACP countries. DFID has provided technical and financial support to a number of ACP countries to draw up their individual plans.</p>

The SARC will build on the valuable services currently available in police child abuse and rape inquiry suites to deliver a more coordinated response to the needs of victims by providing immediate medical aftercare and individual counselling and other support services while also facilitating the preservation of forensic evidence to assist in the successful prosecution of offenders.</p>

It will also include those who consider social housing as their preferred choice, or one of a number of housing options.</p>

	<p pid="a.26W.0/2">The Gloucestershire tri-service centre will not be broken up. The centre will continue to house staff from all three emergency services and support tri-service working after the control room of the fire and rescue service is moved to the South West Regional Control Centre. The Government are committed to creating a new national network of nine resilient regional control centres which will enhance the ability of the Fire and Rescue Service to respond to major incidents and natural disasters in a co-ordinated, efficient and effective manner. We believe that the public will be better protected by this approach. The new Regional Control Centres will however build on the valuable lessons learnt on joint working from the tri-service pilots, including the recent experience of dealing with flooding in Gloucestershire.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.5/1">On a provisional estimate, 9 per cent. of all new dwellings in England in 2005 were built in flood risk areas. A more robust estimate for 2004 shows that 10 per cent. of all new dwellings in England were built in flood risk areas during that year. The following table gives a breakdown by Government office region of the percentage of new dwellings built in flood risk areas for the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.5/2">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development. Flood risk areas account for about 10 per cent. of land in England, including parts of major cities, and around 10 per cent. of the population already live in flood risk areas. The Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The Government published planning policy statement (PPS25) in December 2006 to strengthen and clarify earlier policy on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.5/3">PPS25 ensures that flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. In particular, more vulnerable development, such as housing, should not be permitted in high risk areas unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the need for the development outweighs the risk, and it will be safe, without increasing flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.5/4">The definition of high flood risk areas and floodplain used by Communities and Local Government is the high risk zone mapped by the Environment Agency as being at a probability of flooding, excluding the presence of flood defences, of at least a one in 100 each year for river flooding and at least a one in 200 for coastal flooding. This is the basis for the definition of 'high risk areas' in PPS25.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.11/1">In 2007-08 216 local authorities (LAs) in England did not have their bid for Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) funding in full. Despite substantially increasing the Government funding available for the national DFG programme, from &pound;57 million in 1997 to &pound;126 million in 2007-08, there is still considerable demand for the grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.11/2">The national budget is divided up between the regions using a formula which takes into account data from the English House Condition Survey on the number of disabled people in each region living in unsuitable housing and a regional building cost index.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.11/3">Government offices (GOs) are responsible for overseeing the allocation of DFG resources. In order to assist the GOs in this process the department supplied them with the LA bid for DFG funds and a local needs indicator, which is the number of individuals in each LA in receipt of either disability living allowance or attendance allowance. The GOs take these factors into account and balance them with any local data or information which they think is relevant in order to allocate DFG resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.2/2">Planning Policy Statement 3: 'Housing' (PPS3) published in November 2006 introduced a new and less restrictive approach to the supply of land for housing, in order to help us achieve the step change in delivery we need to provide an increase in the supply of new homes. Local authorities are required to have a rolling five-year supply of land for housing, giving priority to the release of brownfield land. The national target is that 60 per cent. of housing development should be on brownfield land.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/3">PPS 3 gives local authorities the responsibility for deciding the most suitable location for housing, taking account of their local circumstances and the availability of deliverable brownfield sites. It is no longer appropriate therefore to require them to refer larger greenfield sites to the Secretary of State as the Greenfield Land Direction did, and to keep this requirement in place would mean that it takes longer to make decisions on planning applications which could delay the delivery of necessary new housing on suitable sites.</p>

They are defined as 'essential infrastructure' as it is acknowledged that power stations and grid and primary substations may need to be located in flood risk areas. This is because power stations often need a ready supply of water and sub-stations need to be located near to the communities they supply. The PPS25 sequential test will ensure that they are located in low risk areas where possible, but where there are no alternative lower risk locations for this type of development then the exception test will ensure that they are safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.56W.0/2">Recent flood events during the summer have highlighted the importance of essential infrastructure being protected during flood events and PPS25 aims to ensure that any new electricity infrastructure that is essential in areas at risk of flooding is designed and constructed to be operational during floods.</p>

	<p pid="a.66W.2/1">The minimum age of entry into the UK armed forces is 16 years. The services provide challenging and constructive training and employment to many young people and enable them to learn valuable transferable skills. In financial year 2006-07, 30 per cent. of all new recruits were under 18 years of age.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.2/2">No young person under the age of 18 years may join the armed forces unless the application is accompanied by the formal written consent of his or her parents or guardian. Throughout the recruit selection process, the staffs at the Armed Forces Careers Offices (AFCO) provide comprehensive written and verbal guidance to all potential recruits, in particular those under 18 years of age and their parents or guardians, regarding their terms and conditions of service, the commitments that they would be undertaking, and their rights to discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.2/3">Defence policy is that service personnel under the age of 18 are not to be deployed on any operations outside of the UK that would result in them becoming engaged in, or exposed to, hostilities. In addition, in line with UN policy service personnel under 18 are not to be deployed on UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.5/1">I expect the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO) to participate fully in the further work identified in the Government response. This includes the provision of information to HM Treasury's economic study. The study, which is being conducted by Cambridge University, aims to provide cost and benefit information for possible alternative models of supply and charging for public sector information by Trading Funds. The completed study is due to be submitted to Government in mid November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.5/2">The UKHO will also, if requested by DBERR and HMT, provide input to their work on the economics of information pricing.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.5/3">The recommendations included in the market study report will be used to inform licensing policy following completion of the review of the UKHO's structure and ownership. I expect to announce the outcome of the review early in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.79W.0/1">In 2006 the Department commissioned the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to evaluate evidence submitted by the British Air Lines Pilots Association (BALPA) in relation to cabin air &quot;fume events&quot;. The COT received information from oil companies, airlines, engine manufacturers, independent scientific experts and pressure groups. The COT reported on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-20">20 September 2007</phrase>. Its report is published on its website:</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/cotnonfood/index.htm">www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/cotnonfood/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.0/3">The Committee on Toxicity considered that it wasn't possible to conclude whether cabin air exposures (either general or following incidents) cause ill-health in commercial aircraft crews. It recommended further work, in particular, and as a priority, to ascertain whether substances in the cabin environment could potentially be harmful to health. COT considered that this work should be designed to detect any potentially harmful substances, rather than focus on named substances.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.0/4">In keeping with its commitment to promoting healthy flying, the Department accepts this priority. Through the Aviation Health Working Group, it has recently made preparations for such a study by testing equipment which may be capable of capturing substances released during oil and hydraulic fluid fume incidents. Once effective equipment has been identified it is intended to sample around 1,000 flights using more than one sampling device, more than one laboratory to analyse the results, and an independent project manager from the academic world.</p>

	<p pid="a.85W.5/1">The aerodrome conducted an immediate investigation into the incident that occurred on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-08">8 August 2007</phrase> and the report was presented to the CAA. The investigation revealed that the First Choice aircraft (airbus A320) that had arrived from Reus (Spain) was unable to access the main aircraft parking area due to congestion. In agreement with Air Traffic Control (ATC) the aircraft was initially held on a taxiway until space became available. While holding on the taxiway, the main aircraft wheels sank into the taxiway surface.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.5/2">The report concluded that the aircraft should not have been held on that taxiway, as the taxiway was not designed to accept the weight of the A320 aircraft. The aerodrome operator subsequently issued an operating instruction that prevents aircraft of this size using that taxiway in the future. They have also commissioned a review of the pavement strength for the main runway and other paved surfaces. The United Kingdom Aeronautical Information Package (UKAIP) entry for the aerodrome has also been amended to reflect the pavement values for the aerodrome surfaces. They have also instigated a review of the equivalent commercial information available to pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.5/3">The aerodrome is also planning a new extension to the aircraft parking area in 2008 that will provide additional parking stands, which should reduce the need for aircraft to hold pending stand availability. This will include a new direct taxiway from the main runway.</p>

	<p pid="a.93W.0/1">The Government regulate rail fares where operators are likely to have a high degree of market power. Increases in regulated fares are limited to RPI+1 per cent. and the Secretary of State for Transport recently announced that regulated fares will be capped at this level until at least 2014. Fares that are not subject to regulation are priced at the discretion of train operators. However, the recent White Paper, &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot;, concluded that the fares structure requires simplification for the benefit of passengers and announced its intention to work with the rail industry to implement a simplified fares structure.</p>

The recent White Paper announced the Government's intention to specify an overall improvement in train reliability (in terms of the public performance measure) of 92.6 per cent. by 2014, compared to a current industry reliability figure of 88.1 per cent. Franchise agreements with train operators contain performance standards that the operators have a contractual obligation to meet and the Department for Transport has sanctions that it can take to ensure that train operators meet their performance obligations.</p>

	<p pid="a.98W.2/1">This information is not held centrally for local roads. Highway maintenance on local roads in England is the responsibility of each local highways authority. All local highway authorities have been encouraged to produce asset management plans for their roads. These will consist of inventories of stock, its existing condition, and target condition based upon desired service levels. This information will assist local highway authorities to programme their road surface repairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.98W.2/2">The Department has also endorsed &quot;Well maintained highways&quot;, the code of practice for highway maintenance produced by the UK Roads Board. The document which can be found at <a href="http://www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org">www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org</a> provides best practice guidance on the programming of highway maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.98W.2/3">The Highways Agency are responsible for highway maintenance on the strategic road network in England. Their programme is sub-divided into significant renewal schemes and small works. Both types of programme may fluctuate, depending on the overall state of network assets and in-year urgency for tackling unexpected deterioration. The condition target for the strategic road network is measured by a road surface condition index. This target has been met since it was introduced in 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="a.100W.6/1">If individuals provide a minicab service without holding the requisite licences they are committing an offence. Responsibility for enforcing the law rests with Transport for London within London and the relevant local licensing authority elsewhere in England. The police also, of course, have a role to play in enforcing the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.6/2">Last year we brought forward a change in the law which will establish a more comprehensive system for licensing minicabs (private hire vehicles&mdash;PHVs). Section 53 of the Road Safety Act 2006 repeals the exemption from PHV licensing outside London for vehicles which work on contracts lasting not less than seven days. When the repeal takes effect&mdash;in January 2008&mdash;it will be much harder for operators and drivers to evade licensing. A similar provision (section 54 of the Act) will bring operators and drivers dedicated to contract work in London within the PHV licensing regime&mdash;in March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.101W.2/1">The estimate of &pound;1 million was included in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the proposal to repeal the private hire vehicle (PHV) contract exemption; a copy of this is in the Library of the House. The RIA was based on the following assumptions: (a) 2000 drivers (b) 2000 vehicles and (c) 300 operators would have to be licensed as a direct result of the repeal of the contract exemption. Average fees for each of the licences were assumed to be &pound;250, &pound;200 and &pound;400 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.2/2">These estimates and assumptions were based on the fact that the terms of the contract exemption are narrow and apply in a relatively limited number of cases. They made no allowance for eases now coming to light where transport providers might have believed, or claimed, that they were covered by the exemption but were not in reality so covered. A number of these cases are, and will remain, outside the definition of a PHV in the legislation and therefore will still not need to be licensed. Others should have been licensed as PHVs in the past and repeal of itself will not therefore create a new requirement to meet licensing costs. The Department has sought the views of stakeholders on draft guidance for local licensing authorities on the impact of the repeal and we expect to publish the final version of this shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.111W.9/1">To help tackle abuse of the student immigration route of entry to the UK, the Home Office will only grant visas to international students who have offers of places to study at colleges on the DIUS Register of Education and Training Providers. Colleges applying to join the DIUS Register are required to supply evidence that they are providing education and training, and meeting the requirements of the Immigration Rules. The registration process is one of continual assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.9/2">Institutions failing to maintain the necessary standards are subject to review and removal from the Register if justified. The Borders and Immigration Agency advised us that Kelvin Business School was in breach of the Immigration Rules. The college was therefore removed from the DIUS Register on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July 2007</phrase>.</p>

The only other pan-sector for which a qualifications strategy is currently being considered is health and safety.

	<p pid="a.112W.5/2">In developing their pan-sector qualifications strategies, each standard-setting body is working closely with a lead Sector Skills Council which will ensure employer needs across the board are represented and that there is no duplication with other qualifications strategies. No standard-setting bodies will be responsible for approving qualifications, this is the role of the Sector Skills Councils. All cross-sector standard-setting bodies are being 'buddied' with a lead Sector Skills Council which will approve qualifications, drawing on the expertise of the standard-setting body and liaising with other Sector Skills Councils as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.115W.5/1">Tree felling in England is controlled by the Felling Regulations, which are administered by the Forestry Commission. Deforestation is also subject to the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Forestry) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999. Permission is not normally granted for deforestation unless it is for the recreation of priority open habitats, which have been lost due to planting with trees; often non-native conifers.</p>
	<p pid="a.115W.5/2">Under the Kyoto Protocol, global emissions from deforestation are already taken into account by developed countries in meeting their emissions reduction commitments. The UK and other European Union (EU) member states are negotiating on how to include emissions from deforestation from developing countries in future climate change agreements, on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.115W.5/3">This process is also supported by UK and EU action to tackle illegal logging and improve sustainable timber procurement, working with international partners including producer and consumer countries. Reducing emissions from deforestation is a key aim of the Environmental Transformation Fund announced in the 2007 Budget. The UK has already announced that &pound;50 million from this Fund will go towards reducing deforestation in the Congo Basin, by promoting sustainable forestry.</p>

	<p pid="a.118W.2/2">While it does not have a specific fuel poverty objective, the EEC does require suppliers to direct 50 per cent. of energy savings towards a priority group of low-income customers. Energy suppliers are free to find the most cost-effective ways to meet their obligations.</p>

The Environment Agency has a general supervisory duty over all matters relating to flood management and permissive powers to manage flood risk from main rivers and the sea. Local authorities are responsible for surface drainage from roads and public spaces, and the operation of highway drains; they also have permissive land drainage responsibilities for non-main rivers. Water and sewerage companies have a statutory duty to ensure the effective drainage of premises in their area, including any piped surface water arising from them. Internal drainage boards have permissive powers to undertake work to secure drainage and water level management within their districts, which cover 10 per cent. of the country's land area (mostly rural areas currently). The Highways Agency covers drainage from trunk roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.126W.5/2">The EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was set up in November 2002 as a result of the extreme flooding disaster that hit Central Europe in the summer of 2002. The purpose of the fund is to provide financial assistance to the regions of Europe in dealing with an extraordinary &quot;major&quot; or &quot;regional&quot; disaster of natural causes, including severe flooding. The fund is specifically targeted at support for emergency relief action, cleaning up and getting destroyed infrastructure back into working order. Match funding is not required under the EUSF.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.5/3">Before a member state can apply for support from the fund, the total amount of damages incurred in a major disaster must exceed a specific level. The EUSF's eligibility threshold for what are termed &quot;National Level Disasters&quot; is for all damages, insurable and uninsurable, to exceed &euro;3 billion (2002 prices) or 0.6 per cent. of the affected country's Gross National Income (GNI), whichever is the lower, in order to qualify for assistance. The UK current estimate for total damage suffered in the June and July floods is &euro;4 billion (&pound;2.9 billion).</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.5/4">An application for support from the EUSF in respect of the June and July flooding in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was lodged with the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-20">20 August</phrase> and is currently being discussed with them. The application is not a bid as it will be for the Commission to decide whether, and if so at what level, support will be offered. Applications by other member states to the EUSF have resulted in offers of support ranging between 2.5 per cent. and 5 per cent. of the total damage suffered.</p>

	<p pid="a.129W.0/1">The energy efficiency of the housing stock in England cannot be monitored directly but is modelled, using data from periodic surveys of the housing stock coupled with data on the installation of energy saving measures. Based on the delivery of measures by existing energy efficiency programmes, we expect to be on track towards the 20 per cent. target. DEFRA is currently analysing the effects of energy efficiency policies but cannot yet quantify the improvement precisely.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.0/2">However, there is one positive indication that efficiency has already started to improve substantially. Against a long-term trend of rising gas consumption, household gas usage fell by over 8 per cent. over the period 2004-06. Of this, up to half could be attributed to higher prices; weather changes had little effect. Improved energy efficiency for heating, particularly higher levels of insulation (installed via the energy Efficiency Commitment) and more efficient boilers (required by Building Regulations), is likely to have contributed to the remaining reduction of gas, the principal heating fuel. However, more detailed analysis is required to quantify this effect, and to express it in terms of improved energy efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.2/16">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), which is partly funded by DEFRA, is responsible for delivering greater material efficiency, including increasing recycling rates. Its work on packaging waste interlinks with many aspects of recycling, such as working with local authorities to advise on recycling facilities and overcome barriers to recycling. WRAP also has a behavioural change programme which targets consumer recycling and explains why this is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.2/17">WRAP is working with the retail industry to increase the recycling content of packaging and is targeting the supply chain through the voluntary 'Courtauld Commitment' agreement. Through its business growth and manufacturing programmes, WRAP is also working to ensure that the necessary facilities are in place in order to increase the capacity and capability of recycling and to increase the use of recycled materials in manufacturing.</p>

This review will cover issues such as loss of drinking water supplies. It is being led by an independent chair, Sir Michael Pitt. We are aiming to publish initial findings by the end of the year and subsequently a formal report. A call for evidence is currently lodged on the Cabinet Office and UK Resilience websites.

In parallel with this we are working closely with the credit union movement and investing &pound;1 million of the Growth Fund to test ways in which the recently announced Transaction Banking Service can be introduced to enable even greater service through credit unions for those who find it difficult to access mainstream financial services.</p>

	<p pid="a.138W.11/3">The Child Support Agency has already, through the Operational Improvement Plan made considerable improvements in client service over the last year with new scheme uncleared applications at their lowest level since January 2004 and 72 per cent. of new cases cleared within 12 weeks. These improved service levels, complemented by a thorough and tested appeals process ensure clients have access to the necessary support and advice in all their dealings with the Agency. It is therefore more appropriate to continue to improve client service, through the Operational Improvement Plan enabling the Child Support Agency to deliver more money to more children, than to place additional and unnecessary burdens on our courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.147W.5/1">New deal plus for lone parents was introduced in April 2005 in North London, South East London, Bradford, Dudley and Sandwell, and Leicestershire. It was extended to Cardiff and Vale and Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders in October 2006. The current pilots, which run until March 2008, are open to eligible lone parents in non-London areas and eligible lone and couple parents in London areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.147W.5/2">The Child Poverty Strategy 'Working for Children', published in March 2007, announced the extension and expansion of the new deal plus pilots from April 2008 to March 2011. In pilot locations outside London, key elements of new deal plus for lone parents will be extended to eligible couple parents, and the pilots will be expanded to cover all London areas and will continue to be available to eligible lone and couple parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.147W.5/3">The effectiveness of the pilots is defined in terms of increased exits from benefit and increased employment outcomes compared with similar lone parents in non pilot areas. Evaluation also examines the effectiveness of delivery and impacts on the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.147W.5/4">Early findings from the pilots were included in 'The lone parent pilots after 12 to 24 months: an impact assessment of In-Work Credit, Work Search Premium, Extended Schools Childcare, Quarterly Work Focused Interviews and New Deal Plus for Lone Parents', DWP Report 415, published in March 2007, and in 'New Deal Plus for Lone Parents qualitative evaluation' DWP Report 426, published in May 2007. Both reports are available in the Library. Qualitative findings from the Scottish and Welsh pilots, and findings from the next wave of Impact Assessments will be published next year and placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.150W.8/2"><i> </i>The computer systems used to produce state pension forecasts are being updated to reflect the new state pension rules included within the Pensions Act 2007 and therefore the Pension Service retirement pension forecasting team is temporarily unable to provide a state pension forecast to people who reach state pension age on or after <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2010</phrase>. We aim to have the system changes in place by autumn 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.8/3">People reaching state pension age after 2010 who contact the Pension Service retirement pension forecasting team will still be able to obtain personalised information including:</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.8/4" class="indent">an indication of the current number of qualifying years and how many more are needed to get a full basic state pension under the new rules; and</p>

	<p pid="a.150W.8/6">This means people can still receive the help they need to plan for their retirement, and the vast majority of customers using these transitional arrangements have been happy with the service provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.150W.8/8">Approximately half of the people who use the forecasting &quot;on request&quot; (either online or by phone) service are affected by the current suspension. Based on previous requests for state pension forecasts in 2005-06 we estimate the suspension will impact 300,000 individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.8/9">The combined pension forecasting service is also suspended until autumn 2008 and this affects approximately 4 million individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.8/10">In the meantime the Pension Service are working closely with their IT suppliers to explore ways in which the timetable for reflecting state pension changes in state pension forecasting systems could be advanced.</p>

	<p pid="a.152W.0/1">Entitlement to income-related benefits requires that a person has a right to reside and be habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland (generally known as the Common Travel Area). If a person does not have a right to reside then he or she is treated as not being habitually resident and is not entitled to those benefits.

	<p pid="a.152W.0/2">The term &quot;habitual residence&quot; is not defined in UK social security legislation but there is both domestic and EC case law on how that term should be interpreted. In order to determine whether a person is habitually resident, decision makers will, on the basis of the guidelines set out in the case law, consider a variety of factors about the person's circumstances. These include, for example, his or her attachment to and intentions in the UK; his or her reasons for coming here; and whether the person has family in the UK etc. Benefit decision-makers must be satisfied on objective grounds that a person who claims income-related benefits after arriving in the country has genuinely adopted the UK as his or her place of habitual residence.</p>
	<p pid="a.152W.0/3">Where other European Economic Area States use the term &quot;habitual residence&quot; as a condition of entitlement to benefit, the term should be used in accordance with their domestic law and EC case law.</p>
