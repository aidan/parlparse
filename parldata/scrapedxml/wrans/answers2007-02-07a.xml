	<p pid="a.915W.6/3">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development. The Government published a new Planning Policy Statement (PPS25) in December 2006 to strengthen and clarify earlier policy on this issue. Flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. Where new development is necessary in higher risk areas because no viable alternative is available, steps must be taken at site level to make it safe if it is to be permitted. In those areas close to rivers where water must be allowed to flow in times of flood&mdash;the 'functional floodplain'&mdash;only a very restricted range of development associated with essential infrastructure should be permitted.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.6/1">The health care system in Afghanistan has suffered years of neglect. According to the Central Statistics Office's (CSO) Statistical Yearbook 2003, the percentage of expenditure on health between 1997 and 2000 was only 0.5 per cent. of GDP and the number of doctors per 1,000 people a mere 0.1 per cent. against an average of 2.2 per cent. for all developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that in 2001 the total expenditure on health was 5.2 per cent. of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.6/2">Although DFID is not directly engaged in the health sector, DFID officials in Kabul have contacted the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) for this data. The ministry have confirmed that the data requested is not available back to 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.6/3">There are, though, signs that progress is being made. The World Bank, European Commission and The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are investing heavily in this sector. In the November 2006 report of the Joint Co-ordination and Monitoring Board, it was recorded that the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) has been expanded to 82 per cent. of the Afghan population. 856 standard health facilities are now functional; 82 facilities provide comprehensive emergency obstetric care, and 309 provide basic emergency obstetric care. 71 per cent. of all BPHS health facilities are now staffed with at least one female staff member. One district hospital, 22 basic Health Centres and 17 Comprehensive Health Centres have also been established.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.5/1">The UK will spend at least another &pound;100 million over the next three years on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Iraq on top of our 2003 Madrid pledge of &pound;544 million, which is now fully disbursed. This further allocation of &pound;100 million brings the total UK commitment to &pound;644 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/2">Some of this funding will be channelled through DFID's bilateral programme of assistance to Iraq. This will help the Iraqi Government to make better use of their substantial oil resources; and assist the Iraqi Government, at provincial and national level, to plan and deliver investment in basic services (electricity, hospitals, etc.), improve oil production levels, generate jobs and manage its own resources more effectively. In addition, funding will be channelled through the UK's contribution to EC funding for Iraq, and through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP).</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.8/1">Prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, DFID objectives were to ensure that there was sufficient preparation to avert a major humanitarian crisis during and immediately after the conflict and facilitate the rapid restoration of essential services such as health care, power, and water and sanitation. Much of our initial support was channelled through United Nations agencies, the International Red Cross and non-governmental organisations. These organisations moved back into Iraq quickly and set up effective humanitarian operations after the major conflict ended. They had experience of working in Iraq, well-established local networks and a capacity to deliver assistance on the ground. While several agencies withdrew expatriate personnel from Iraq for security reasons during the remainder of 2003, many of their programmes continued under the management of well-qualified local staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.8/2">There have been successes:</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.8/3" class="indent">In education, over 5,000 schools have been rehabilitated; more than 100,000 primary and 40,000 secondary schools teachers have been trained; and over 70 million new textbooks distributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.8/4" class="indent">In water and sanitation, around &pound;660 million has been spent on over 300 projects to repair essential infrastructure; but decades of neglect and an ageing infrastructure means that the overall access to drinkable water and sewage systems remains similar to pre 2003 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.8/5" class="indent">In health care, over 5 million children have received life-saving vaccinations. More than 1,000 health care facilities rehabilitated or equipped, and more than 6,000 health workers trained. Through extensive disease control programmes, the prevalence of leishmaniasis, measles, malaria and polio has declined.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.8/6" class="indent">In microfinance, two institutions are operating across Iraq, which have made US$78 million worth of loans to over 40,000 clients.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.8/7">Continued violence, including sabotage of key infrastructure facilities, and low (but growing) levels of technical capacity in Iraq's national and local governments have made progress difficult. However, Iraq is not a poor country. The Iraqi Government plans to spend over &pound;20 billion (US$40 billion) in 2007. The real challenge is to help the Government of Iraq spend this money effectively so that Iraqis see real improvements. DFID is providing expert advice to help the Government do this at national and provincial level.</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.0/17">Iraq's economy is powered by oil (oil accounts for approximately two-thirds of GDP and more than 95 per cent. of exports). Therefore, Iraq's ability to export oil has a strong impact on the strength of its economy. As a result, GDP, exports and imports have continued to grow since 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.922W.6/1">For the last three years the Department has funded the Defence Schools Presentation Teams (DSPT) which tour secondary schools giving a half day interactive presentation on defence issues to 14 to 16-year-olds. There are five such teams covering different areas of the country, and during 2006 they booked over 490 visits including Comprehensive, Grammar, Independent, single sex, and Faith Schools (Church of England, Catholic, and Muslim). These presentations are extremely well received and do allow us to get our messages over about the importance of defence. Almost all schools ask for a repeat visit the following year which has lead to a yearly increase in presentations. Civilian and military staff are seen as excellent role models and there are consequently significant benefits for future recruiting. The actual investment in the Defence Schools Presentation Teams has been about &pound;1.9 million per year. I have placed in the Library of the House a chart detailing the tasking of the five teams during 2006. Those serials which have been crossed out indicate a cancellation by the school prior to the event.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.6/2">The Department will be introducing a new schools e-learning product. Through creating an educational website called &quot;Defence Dynamics&quot;, our main focus will be to provide Secondary School teachers of 14 to 16-year-olds with pre-packaged electronic lesson plans for GCSE exams with Defence themes. It has been planned as a ten year programme. Defence Dynamics will start with the delivery in September 2007 of 40+ lesson plans with audio-visuals in Science, Maths and English based on scenarios that reflect the professional work of the MOD and the armed forces worldwide. The material will be developed to support the requirements of the school curriculum and across a range of subject areas in the longer term. MOD will be working closely with DfES and the devolved Government education Departments in the UK. Initially the Defence Dynamics programme will run for two years with the aim to develop this for the long-term. An e-learning approach has been used successfully in Australian schools since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.6/3">The intention is to disband the touring Defence Schools Presentation Teams in July 2007 (the end of this academic year) and launch the new schools e-learning product in September 2007. The Department will, through this be maintaining its engagement with schools and switching to an approach that will enable us to reach many more children than are visited by the touring Defence Presentation Schools Teams, and at a significantly lower cost (&pound;200,000 pa).</p>

This support is significantly increased during operational periods for the families of those deployed on operations. In particular extra travel allowances are available for dependants and close family members and a welfare grant is also made available to the parent unit to help fund group welfare activities and facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.931W.3/1">Within the Department, contract catering services are only used at the Department's HQ in London, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) sites in Swansea, the Government Car and Despatch Agency (GCDA) in London and at the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) HQ in Bristol.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.3/2">In the Department's headquarters in London it is the policy of our catering provider to source the majority of its products from within the UK, unless occasionally for reasons of supply and competitive pricing it is necessary to obtain products from outside the UK. Typically this means that 100 per cent. of meat and poultry is of British origin, along with the majority of dairy products, fruits and salad items and vegetables.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.3/3">For the DVLA Swansea sites 85 per cent. of the items served were of British origin, broken down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.3/4" class="indent">100 per cent. for soft drinks;</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.3/5" class="indent">70 per cent. for bakery products;</p>

	<p pid="a.934W.2/1">Analysis for the Department of Transport estimated the 'marginal' costs (in 2002-03 prices) of extending existing concessions offered by local authorities in their areas to free 'bus' travel, at all time and for all purposes, for five to 16-year-olds at around &pound;365 million per year, and around a further &pound;160 million per year for 17 and 18-year-olds. A total extra cost of approximately &pound;525 million per annum. These estimates are for England only, are restricted to concessionary bus travel within the local authority in which the concessionaire is resident, and excludes any Barnett consequentials. The Department has no cost information on concessionary travel for people aged 18 to 21 years and on other forms of public transport for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.934W.2/2">At the present time, the Department does not have an estimate of the cost of free public transport for children and young people across England. This is extremely difficult to estimate due to the uncertainties about: take-up, the extra concessionary travel generated, the switch from dedicated school transport, travel behaviour and the amount of additional capacity required. The existence of all these inter-related variables creates significant uncertainty in any estimate.</p>

	<p pid="a.937W.8/1">Park and ride schemes are playing an important part in helping to reduce congestion in many localities. During the first Local Transport Plan (LTP) period (2001-06), local transport authorities in England (outside of London) spent a total of &pound;72.5 million of LTP funding on improving 92 existing park and ride facilities and delivering 76 new park and ride schemes. In recognition of this, the Department gave credit in its assessment of delivery of the first Local Transport Plans to those authorities that delivered substantial increases in park and ride facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.8/2">In the full guidance on the second Local Transport Plans (2006-11), published in December 2004, the Department indicated that tackling congestion remained a key priority and that a range of policy tools should be considered by local authorities. It then assessed how convincingly local authorities considered the range of available tools (including park and ride) before determining the final distribution of funding support for the Local Transport Plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.946W.2/2">The key worker living programme is focused on helping key workers in London, the east and the south-east of England regions with funding coming from those regions' allocations. In 2005, the South West Regional Housing Board declined the opportunity to specifically allocate resources to key worker schemes in 2006-07 or 2007-08. The South West Regional Housing Board did however recommend that key public sector workers providing essential public services should be one of their priority groups for low cost home ownership assistance through the 2006-07 to 2007-08 national affordable housing programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.947W.2/1">A partial regulatory impact assessment has been published alongside the proposal in &quot;Building a Greener Future&quot; to move towards zero carbon homes by 2016. This assessment shows that the costs of delivering a 25 per cent. improvement in energy/carbon levels is around 2-3 per cent., or around &pound;3,000 per dwelling, on the basis of current technologies. As we move on to lower energy/carbon housing in the future, the costs are inevitably more uncertain as they will depend on the technologies delivered by the market, and cost reductions achieved through economies of scale and over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.2/2">A final regulatory impact assessment, which will set out the expected costs implications, will be published alongside the final policy statement in the summer 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.964W.2/1">Since April 2003 all grant-aided schools have been required to have measures in place to deal with bullying behaviour. The Department of Education has issued guidance to schools on how to deal with bullying behaviour and this has been supplemented by materials and advice issued through the local Anti-Bullying Forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.2/2">Inspections of pastoral care arrangements in schools include an assessment of anti-bullying measures and if improvements can be made schools are advised at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.2/3">A research report on the scale and nature of bullying in schools will be published later this year. That will allow for a comparison with a similar study published in 2002 and the identification of any change.</p>

	<p pid="a.968W.6/1">It is not possible to calculate the percentage of lamps on the House of Commons estate which are low energy, but it can be said that the majority of the lamps in use are low energy. Parliamentary estate engineers have been proactive in using low energy lamps for several years and the two of the earliest installations in the UK of the Philips QL lamps, which use less than a third of the energy of standard tungsten lamps, were inside the Clock Tower and on the Terrace. This work has continued with the palace external lanterns and Star Chamber Court, Members Staircase and the Colonnade lights all being converted to QL lamps since then. The Clock Tower external floodlighting and the Lower Secretaries offices, Upper Committee Corridors North and South and 1 Derby Gate lights were all fitted with low energy lamps during the last two years. There are several types of low energy lamps currently on trial in the Upper Committee Corridor wall light fittings and comments on them would be most welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.968W.6/2">The work of installing low energy and also long life lamps as replacements to inefficient tungsten lamps, when cost effective, is continuing as budgets and access to areas allow. It should be noted that using low energy lamps, which are usually the fluorescent type, in some light fittings in historic areas of the palace would not be appropriate, for example the chandelier in Central Lobby. Projects for installing more low energy and long life lamps and for installing lighting controls are being considered at present and suggestions for areas to investigate would be welcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.977W.2/2">Under the new system of pensions financing introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> police authorities now have a separate pensions account out of which retired officers' pensions are paid. Where the cost of pensions in payment exceeds the level of employer and officer contributions paid into the pension account in any year the account is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped. A key benefit of this change is that it takes away from police authorities the responsibility for meeting the rising cost of pensions, as the number of pensioners increases, from the operational budget. Instead, the operational budget now only has to provide for the employer's contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.2/1">The Department's aim is for all schools in England to be sustainable schools by 2020. In 2006 we consulted on a framework to help schools embed sustainability across all areas of school life including the curriculum. This academic year is a year of action to help schools become sustainable. We are working with partners to develop resources to support the teaching and learning of key issues like climate change such as a pupil 'detective kit' and teacher resource pack. A climate change package including a copy of Al Gore's film 'An Inconvenient Truth' is also being made available to all schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/2">The Department has funded the Met Office Education Service to produce a free CD-Rom to aid the teaching of climate change at GCSE and A-level. This year they will produce poster based teaching resources on climate change for schools. The Climate Challenge Fund was setup in 2006 by DEFRA to provide financial support for communications projects seeking to achieve positive changes in public attitudes about climate change. A number of the projects will create resources for schools, including an e-learning game, education packs and DVDs.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/3">All of the above resources will be available to schools and colleges through the Sustainable Schools area of Teachernet at:</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.5/2">Education about safety is included in the curriculum through the non-statutory framework of personal social and health education (PSHE). In PSHE lessons pupils are taught about rules for, and ways of, keeping safe, to recognise the risks that apply in different situations and then to decide how to behave responsibly. They should be taught to recognise and manage risk, to be aware when pressure from others threatens their personal safety and to develop assertiveness techniques when dealing with unhelpful pressure. Schools may use the issue of safe driving when addressing these learning outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.5/3">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority have been undertaking a review of the secondary national curriculum, including PSHE. The draft programmes of study will be subject to a public consultation from <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February</phrase> and views on the inclusion of safe driving can be expressed as part of this consultation.</p>

The coefficient for a particular characteristic shows the average effect of that characteristic on pupil attainment, after taking account of each pupil's prior attainment and all the other characteristics included in the model. The coefficients were derived using the package MLwiN using multi-level modelling techniques. Separate models were calculated for maintained mainstream schools, and for special schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.991W.11/1">Providing children with the basic skills that allow them to read with fluency and confidence is a crucial first step for them to develop an enthusiasm for reading. Our renewed primary literacy framework draws on the recommendations of Jim Rose's review of the teaching of early reading, and the systematic useof phonics as the prime strategy for the teaching of reading, and will help improve reading levels amongst all pupils. And the national roll-out of the &quot;Every Child a Reader&quot; initiative will help those children who experience difficulties in learning to read.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.11/2">We recognise that reading for pleasure is critical to improving children's life chances and we are taking action on several fronts to promote this. This includes providing a range of materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure that schools both provide high quality teaching and learning in reading, and promote an environment which encourages children's enthusiasm for reading. We encourage schools to develop study support activities which focus on literacy, including reading and book clubs. Our &quot;Playing for Success&quot; study support centres which open out of school hours use sport as a theme in their reading activities to encourage children to read.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.11/3">We continue to work with a number of partners to promote reading in schools and the wider community. This includes working with the National Literacy Trust to run the National Reading Campaign (NRC). Key strands are Reading Connects, which supports schools in building whole-school reading communities; and Reading Champions, which finds and celebrates positive male role models and seeks to change boys' attitudes to reading. A third strand of work, the Family Reading Campaign, launched earlier this year and is working in partnership with key organisations to promote the benefits of reading in the home and show parents and other family members how easily they can support their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.11/4">Our wider work to help to foster children's enthusiasm for reading includes funding the delivery of the Bookstart programme which encourages parents and carers to read with their children from when they are babies and offers free books to every child and advice to every parent. In addition, the 2006 pre-Budget report announced funding to provide every child making the transition to both primary and secondary school&mdash;including all children entering schools in the independent sector, special schools, or any other kind of school&mdash;with a free book, from autumn 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.5/14">Primary standards as measured by the results from the key stage 2 national curriculum tests in 2006 areat their highest ever levels. Since 1997 there has been a 16 percentage point increase in the proportion of 11-year-old pupils in England achieving the targetlevel 4 or above in English and a 14 percentage point increase in the proportion achieving the target level 4 or above in mathematics. Through the work of the Primary National Strategy we have enabled around 95,000 more 11-year-olds to master literacy and 83,000 more to master numeracy this year compared with 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/15">Although we have made significant progress, we are redoubling our efforts to help the one in five 11-year-olds who are still not reaching the standard required of their age in literacy and mathematics. That is why we are renewing our literacy strategy with phonics at the heart of the teaching of reading and renewing our numeracy strategy with more demanding standards of mental arithmetic.</p>

	<p pid="a.997W.0/1">Direct payments to head teachers are paid as School Standards Grant (SSG) and School Standards Grant (Personalisation). The grants are paid to local authorities who must pass the money straight on to schools, calculated on a formula set by the Government. The allocations of SSG and SSG (Personalisation) for each school in Hendon for 2006-07 are set out as follows. Figures for 2007-08 are not available. For England as a whole, SSG and SSG (Personalisation) will rise from &pound;1.232 billion in 2006-07 to &pound;1.557 billion in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="a.998W.11/1">This Government have placed a high priority on investing in schools. This has led to higher standards and Ofsted have recently confirmed this. There are now 604 high achieving schools&mdash;where70 per cent. or more pupils gain five good GCSEs&mdash;up seven-fold from 83 in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.998W.11/2">The New Relationship with Schools enables schools to drive their own improvement, becoming more accountable and autonomous. Schools, with appropriate challenge and support, determine their improvement priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.998W.11/3">The Primary and Secondary National Strategies support and challenge schools by developing and disseminating good practice in teaching and learning through personalisation and intervention (both at pupil and whole school level).</p>
	<p pid="a.998W.11/4">Despite a small rise in the number of schools in special measures, the total still remains below 1 per cent. of all schools, and half the number that were in special measures in 1998. The number normally increases at the end of the autumn term when there are more inspections before returning to previous levels in the summer. But we are not complacent and are turning these schools around more quickly. Overall the number of schools failing to get five good GCSEs for a quarter of their pupils has dropped from over 600 in 1997 to 47 today.</p>
	<p pid="a.998W.11/5">We have raised the bar, so that schools which previously would have avoided attention now find themselves in special measures. We make no apology for this tough stance against failing or coasting schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.998W.11/6">The Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners: Maintaining Excellent Progress sets out in more detail the Government's progress in delivering our ambitious programme of reform. A copy of this document is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

There have been many calls for an annual memorial day, and we look forward to hearing during 2007 views on what date such a day would best be marked.</p>

However, as a universal entitlement, free care-home care is neither affordable nor desirable in the context of finite resources. None of the billions of pounds needed to make care in a care-home free would increase the choice or quality of care homes or support improvements to social care provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1016W.5/1">Neither the Department (for adult services) nor the Department for Education and Skills (for children) keep data on the number of incidents of physical and verbal abuse against social workers. Social workers are employed by local councils, and by service providers in the private and voluntary sectors, and it is for those employers to manage incidence of abuse against their staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/2">The Department's task force on violence and abuse against social workers reported in 2000, and made a number of recommendations for employers, including that they should undertake a service and training needs analysis in this respect, and put into place and implement actions plans where required. The latest data collected by the Commission for Social Care Inspection from local councils for April 2005 indicates that more than 80 per cent. of councils had completed the task force recommendations mostly or in full.</p>

It is in line with HM Treasury requirements, as set out in Government Accounting, and Cabinet Office guidance. The risk register is kept under review by the departmental board and scrutinised by the audit committee. The register currently contains 20 risks.</p>

	<p pid="a.1030W.5/4" class="indent">Estimates of income tax, and national insurance payments appear in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households inthe UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030W.5/5" class="indent">The tables below show the average annual payments of these taxes for households in each income decile. These average payments reflect both the number of households paying each tax, and the size of the payments. Since the results are based on a sample survey, some of the year to year movement is due to sampling variability. However the tables do illustrate longer term trends in the distribution of tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1034W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the average tax burden was on each income decile in each year since 1979 (105733).</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of the average tax burden for household income decile groups are based on the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/6" class="indent">The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/7" class="indent">The table below shows the average tax burden for each household income decile group. They have been calculated from the numbers appearing in Table 14 of this year's article, and previous versions of the same table. Data has been provided back to 1988, the earliest year for which it is available on a reasonably consistent basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/8" class="indent">The tax burden is the proportion of gross income taken in both direct and indirect taxes. Gross income includes income from wages, occupational pensions, self-employment income, investment income, and income from state benefits, all beforetax. Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes &mdash;these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/9" class="indent">There was a change in the way the figures were compiled in 2002/03 which will affect the estimated tax burden. Up until 2001/02, charges for water, environmental and sewage services were treated as local taxes, whereas from 2002/03 onwards they were excluded. The local tax category now just includes council tax and Northern Ireland rates, and in the annual article it is labelled as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/10" class="indent">Based on figures for 2001/02, the effect of this definitional change is to reduce average household payment of local taxes/council tax from 3.0% of gross income to 2.2%. This obviously reduces the overall estimate of the average tax burden by 0.8%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/11" class="indent">There was also a change to the way that tax credits were treated from 2003/04 onwards. Up until 2002/03 tax credits were treated as cash benefits. From 2003/04, they are classified as negative income tax, but only to the extent that income tax less tax credits, remains greater than or equal to zero for each family. So for households paying relatively little or no income tax, tax credit payments were still regarded either partially or wholly, as cash benefits. Based on figures for 2003/04, the effect of this change is to reduce the estimate of the average tax burden for all households by 0.3%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/12" class="indent">The tax burden, when expressed as a proportion of gross income appears particularly high for the bottom income decile, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. The apparently high tax burden is due to payment of indirect rather than direct taxes Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. This is especially true for the bottom income decile where average measured income is significantly lower than average expenditure. For these households, when their payment of indirect taxes (which reflect expenditure) are expressed as a proportion of gross income, the result is a high calculated tax burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/13" class="indent">There are a number of plausible reasons why for some households, expenditure might exceed income. Households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower decile in particular includes some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received because of timing differences.</p>

	<p pid="a.1038W.9/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question asking what the most recent estimate is of the average per capita tax paid by each income decile group. (115448)</p>
	<p pid="a.1038W.9/4" class="indent">Estimates of the tax paid by households are provided in the ONS analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot;. The latest analysis for 2004-05 was published on the National Statistics website on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-12">12 May 2006</phrase> at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the expenditure and food survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1038W.9/5" class="indent">The results in the article are presented for households rather than on a per capita basis. However, the following table shows average tax paid per capita within each household decile group. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article (although presented as household averages, rather than per capita).</p>
	<p pid="a.1038W.9/6" class="indent">The direct taxes include income tax (after deduction of tax credits), employees' National Insurance contributions, and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, and duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes - these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. More details are available in the article.</p>

	<p pid="a.1040W.8/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what the level of unemployment was in (a) Jarrow constituency, (b) South Tyneside, (c) the North East and (d) the UK in each year since 1997. I am replying in her absence. (118227)</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.8/4" class="indent">For unitary and local authorities, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) produces estimates of total unemployment from a statistical model. For all other estimates of unemployment for local areas, ONS compiles statistics from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.8/5" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the numbers of unemployed, aged 16 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, the North East region and the United Kingdom, for the 12 months ending in February from 1997 to 2004, from the annual local area LFS and for the 12 months ending in March 2005 and 2006, from the APS and the corresponding unemployment rates which are defined as the number of unemployed expressed as a percentage of the economically active population. Corresponding model-based estimates are provided for South Tyneside except for the 12 months ending March 2005 for which estimates are currently unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.8/6" class="indent">These estimates, as with any from sample surveys, are subject to a margin of uncertainty. In particular, estimates for Jarrow are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area and thus are based on very small sample sizes. In this case, the sample sizes are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over the period. The model-based estimates are subject to random variability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.8/7" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). Table 2, attached, shows the annual average number of people, resident in the Jarrow constituency, South Tyneside metropolitan borough, the North East region and the United Kingdom, claiming JSA from 1997 to 2006. The table also includes these figures expressed as a proportion of the resident working-age population.</p>

	<p pid="a.1052W.6/3">We are broadening the appeal of pension credit by focusing our contacts with pensioners much more on their needs as a whole.

One million home visits will be carried out during 2006-07.</p>

We are widening the scope of partnership activity and expanding our current work programme with key utilities and other major companies whose customers include likely eligible non-recipients to pension credit. These activities are being supported by national press advertising to maintain the high profile of pension credit. Local marketing and media campaigns will be targeted in those regions and areas where there are relatively high numbers of eligible non-recipients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052W.6/5">In addition, we are improving our service and encouraging take-up by enabling new customers who call to claim their state pension, to also apply for pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in a single call if appropriate.</p>

We have revised the publication to reflect these changes and to make other minor clarifications as necessary. Revised versions of the Gender Impact of Pension Reform have been placed in the House Library and on the Department for Work and Pensions website. The amendments do not in any way change the overall effects of the reforms shown in the publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.0/3">The amendments cover the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.0/4" class="indent">(1) The charts in section 4.5 showing the outcomes for individuals under reform have been slightly revised to reflect the improved modelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.0/5" class="indent">(2) Related revisions to table 4.xii (page 57). The figures for the two low-earners with career breaks also now show their income in 2005 including pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1055W.0/9" class="indent">(iii) Paragraph 178: Delete &quot;less than half of the median male earner's income&quot;; Insert &quot;just over half of the median male earner's income&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.0/10"><i> (b)</i> The analysis carried out within the Gender Impact of Pension Reform was designed to examine the expected outcomes for illustrative individuals under the full package of pension reform measures including the state reforms and the implementation of personal accounts. The Department for Work and Pensions has not undertaken detailed analysis under different assumptions of private savings behaviour. It should be noted that for the illustrative individuals concerned, it is assumed that they do not contribute to a personal account during the periods when they are not in work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1057W.3/1">There have been a number of recent representations on the winter fuel payment. These include calls for an increase in the payment, forthe payment to be extended to disabled people under 60 years of age and most recently to people receiving disability living allowance who are terminally ill, and for a change in the qualifying week, which is set in legislation as the third full week in September.</p>

	<p pid="a.1057W.6/1">If the deadline to qualify for this winter's payment had been the <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>, around 60,000 more people in Great Britain would have become eligible to receive a payment at an additional cost of approximately &pound;8 million. If the deadline had been the <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>, around 150,000 more people in Great Britain would have become eligible to receivea payment at an additional cost of approximately&pound;21 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.6/2">The qualifying week for winter fuel payments is set in legislation as the third full week in September. This date is used in order to establish entitlement and make payments before Christmas. If a later date were used, the payment exercise could not be completed in time for the payments to be available by Christmas. We decided to make all automatic payments by Christmas to reassure pensioners that they will have extra money available to pay for heating their homes during the coldest part of the year. If the qualifying week were to be significantly later than it is at present, then payments would have to be made in the early part of the following year. Departmental computer systems are already working to full capacity during the early months of the year to accommodate the uprating of benefits in April. It would not be possible to issue over 11 million winter fuel payments at the same time without putting this at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.6/3">No assessment has been made of the administrative costs if the qualifying date was changed to either<phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase> or <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase> each year but they are likely to be negligible as the same processes would be used.</p>
