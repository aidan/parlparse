	<p pid=".476W.8/1">The UK is supportive of the basic aim of this regulation, which is to protect passengers who are denied boarding or are the victims of commercial cancellations. However, we also believe a balance should be struck between the rights of passengers and the additional costs to airlines, which may ultimately be passed through to the consumer. Accordingly, we have been working hard to improve the original text, to try to make it more balanced and workable. Once the regulation comes into force it will be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in member states, who will be required to designate a body responsible for its enforcement and ensure that sanctions laid down for infringements are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>

	<p pid=".478W.3/1">The Department is nearing completion of its assessment of the proposals by Blackpool borough council and Lancashire county council to upgrade the Blackpool Tramway. In common with all transport projects considered by the Department, it is being assessed using the New Approach To Appraisal (NATA) framework, which pays attention both to those impacts which can readily be monetarised (such as time savings) and to others of policy significance (such as environmental impacts) which can only be considered qualitatively.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/2">The NATA framework also requires the preparation of an Economic Impact Report on the possible regeneration impact of the scheme and a thorough quantified risk assessment, both of which the Council has provided. My right hon. Friend will take into account the findings of the appraisal in the light of all the other pressures on his programmes in deciding whether to fund the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/3">Lower-cost alternatives to the full scheme have also been appraised, taking account of the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/4">A crucial, and difficult, part of the assessment of any light rail project is the forecasting of patronage. The uncertainties are always considerable, though greater in the case of proposals for an entirely new system than for an upgrading of a long-established line. Different scenarios, including optimistic and pessimistic, are examined to help capture the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future demand.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/5">There has been no research on the relative costs and benefits of upgrading existing tram systems and of building new systems, since the circumstances and characteristics of individual schemes vary too greatly for such a comparison to be useful. For the same reason, the Department does not have any general policy as regards tram upgrades. Each proposed major local transport scheme is considered on its individual merits.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.3/6">Evaluation Studies have been completed for new light rail systems, such as Croydon Supertram and Manchester Metrolink, which suggest that around 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. of passenger journeys on these systems would otherwise have taken place by car, and that generated trips can increase demand by up to 15 per cent. in the off-peak. However, there is also evidence that investment in buses can be successful in increasing public transport use. There is as yet only very limited experience in this country of guided bus schemes, which are the nearest bus-based equivalent to tram systems, and assessments of their relative attractiveness are therefore uncertain.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.2/1">Government policy is that lower noise surfaces should now be used, except for practical reasons, when any trunk road is resurfaced and it is currently anticipated that over 60 per cent. of the strategic road network will have been surfaced with lower noise materials by 2011. The phasing of resurfacing is usually based on the need to keep the road in optimum condition without causing excessive delays to traffic. Noise mitigation measures on roads built after 1988 take into consideration the need to reduce their impact on noise sensitive facilities such as schools, as well as residential properties.</p>

At that same date, 82 firms have been granted a waiver from the requirement to hold PII and are, in effect, self-insuring. Under current market conditions, there can be a time lag of three months or more for a firm to obtain suitable cover and notify FSA of that fact.</p>
	<p pid=".487W.6/2">The FSA published a consultation paper in July 2003 with new proposals on its PII policy and revised rules for firms. The new PII policy will give firms a more flexible framework within which they can choose how to combine PII and financial resources. This will help firms remain in business and will continue to protect consumers who may have claims against firms.</p>

	<p pid=".493W.4/1">The Department's advice on fox control will remain unchanged if the Hunting Bill receives Royal Assent (assuming that it does so in its current form).</p>
	<p pid=".493W.4/2">At present, shooting is the recommended method of fox control in rural areas. Snaring, which is also an effective technique when used by experienced personnel, may have advantages over shooting in certain situations.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.4/3">Lethal control is not generally recommended in urban areas. Killing or relocating foxes usually only provides transient relief from the problems foxes cause, as vacant territories are rapidly reoccupied once the control measures cease. In addition, shooting and snaring are unlikely to be appropriate control methods for reasons of safety, and in the case of shooting, public disturbance. Advice on alternative strategies for preventing problems is given in the Department's &quot;Urban Fox&quot; leaflet (code WM08) which is available from the Defra website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates">www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates</a>).</p>

The full examination to reduce risks&mdash;which includes this comparison&mdash;is divided into a five-stage process and generally takes between six and nine months. This process is applied to chemicals which have been demonstrated to be a high risk and examples of those completed include: short chain chlorinated paraffins, octa and penta bromodiphenyl ether, bis phenol A and nonyl phenol ethoxylate.</p>

	<p pid=".494W.2/1">Pesticides are regularly withdrawn from the market as a result of regulatory reviews or commercial decisions taken by crop protection companies. However, when there are not over-riding safety concerns a 'use up' period is provided. The purpose of this period is to allow the pesticide industry and farmers to use up existing stocks of the pesticide products concerned and thus avoid significant disposal costs. We believe that this is the best environmental option as well as minimising the costs for all parties.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.2/2">The withdrawals of products under the EC review programme has been taking place progressively since 1995 although the largest batch of withdrawals is taking place this year. In all cases a use-up period has been provided. In anticipation of this years withdrawals the department undertook special publicity campaigns, both this year and last, supported by the crop protection industry and farmers organisations. These were designed to ensure that those affected used their stocks by the end of this year thus minimising the need for disposals.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.2/3">Because of this costs would only arise at the end of this year for farmers or pesticide companies if they have failed to take advantage of the use up period and we do not envisage that there will be additional costs to Government.</p>

	<p pid=".494W.5/1">The information on the Pesticide Safety Directorate's website describing the mixing of individual pesticides after sale refers to the published 'Guidelines on the Provision of Pesticide Mixing Services and Sale of Twin Packs and Kits'. These guidelines confirm the requirement that only pesticides formulated in accordance with approved formulations may be sold or supplied. However once sale has taken place a pesticide may legally be mixed with another pesticide or with other substances without the need for a further product approval. This is provided that the mixing process is carried out by the user or on behalf of the user, and that specific conditions of use set for the individually approved pesticides concerned are complied with. Many users choose to employ mixing services provided at retailer or distributor premises, or by mobile mixing services that visit farms. The mixing service guidelines stipulate that these services must be provided only after sale has taken place, that mixing must be carried out only in accordance with any restrictions placed on the individual pesticides used, and that mixed product should be used promptly.</p>

The Department does not provide specific funding to the LSC for further education colleges to meet targets set in relation to <i>(a)</i> the attainment of Level 3 qualifications, or <i>(b)</i> meeting employers' needs. The Department expects the LSC to use the funds allocated to it for learning participation and capital to allocate funds to colleges to help them meet these and other targets. Assumed learning participation funding for further education allocated to the Learning and Skills Council is &pound;4,278 million in 2003&ndash;04; &pound;4,625 million in 2004&ndash;05; and &pound;4,987 million in 2005&ndash;06. Capital funding allocated by the Department to the LSC will rise by over 60 per cent. in real terms to over &pound;400 million by 2005&ndash;06, compared with 2002&ndash;03. This will help providers to develop new, and enhance existing, vocational provision that is focused on meeting the skills needs of employers.</p>

Within the LSC's budget I have allocated &pound;218 million in each year for the LSC's administration costs and I have asked the LSC to find administrative economies so that it can manage with a flat cash administrative budget. The LSC is also undertaking a reshaping exercise which will build on its strengths, resulting in fewer staff but an enhanced capacity to improve services and deliver against targets.

Collecting reliable data is difficult, because many parents apply for places at more than one school and it may not be clear which is their first preference. Research published by the Department in June 2001 suggested that, nationally, 96 per cent. of parents receive an offer of a place at one, at least, of the schools for which they express a preference.</p>

	<p pid=".504W.8/1">The Education Act 1996 sets out the local education authorities (LEAs) responsibilities in providing free transport to school for pupils of compulsory school age. Section 509(1) requires LEAs to make arrangements for the provision of transport as they consider necessary, so that pupils can attend school. This transport must be free. Section 509(3) enables authorities to pay the whole of part of a pupil's travelling expenses.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.8/2">LEAs must provide free transport to denominational schools, where pupils live beyond the statutory walking distances, where they are the nearest suitable school that pupils can attend. Where pupils live closer to a non-denominational school, LEAs will provide free transport to a denominational school of their choice if they consider that transport is necessary, and they may otherwise provide assistance with travel costs. This is an area where LEAs exercise local discretion, taking into account the religious beliefs of parents and local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.8/3">Our recent document, &quot;Travelling to School: an Action Plan&quot;, set out our plans for boosting walking, cycling and bus use on the journey to school. We are planning to put legislation in place as soon as possible which will allow LEAs to trial new approaches to school transport.</p>

	<p pid=".508W.3/1">The sitting of the House in September has not increased the total number of sitting days. The main costs of accommodation and staff were not affected appreciably by the two week return. The building work was planned, as far as was practicable, on the basis of the revised arrangements in order to cause minimum disruption. It is impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that some &pound;90,000 of additional House of Commons works-related expenditure was incurred directly by the change to the recess period, out of a total forecast spend of around &pound;24 million. In addition, it is estimated that the income from public tours was about &pound;40,000 less as the result of moving them to later in September.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.5/1">The Government remain firmly committed to the 0.7 per cent. target. Although there is no timetable for reaching the target, the trend in the ratio of official development assistance (oda) to Gross National Income (GNI) has been upward since 1997, when it was 0.26 per cent. By 2005&ndash;06 the ratio will be 0.4 per cent. the highest since 1981.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.5/2">DFID spent over &pound;270 million on reproductive health and HIV/AIDS programmes in the financial year 2002&ndash;03. We regard reproductive health as an essential and inseparable element of good health. We believe that the best way to deliver this is for people to be given the right, freedom and support necessary to enable them to take full individual and personal control of their own fertility and reproductive health. Reproductive health continues to be a priority for DFID and we remain firmly committed to the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) target of achieving access to reproductive health for all by 2015.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.5/3">The allocation of funds under the UK international development programme is decided on the basis of country programmes, agreed following discussions with partner governments, and also depends on the existence of effective partners in the country, either government, international or civil society organisations, to ensure that the funding is well spent and achieves its objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.5/4">DFID support for reproductive health is wide ranging. It covers HIV/AIDS programmes, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and maternal and adolescent health. Reproductive health also encompasses the services for family planning, contraception and childbearing that make an important contribution to increasing women's choice and opportunity and to preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Family planning services also provide an important opportunity to improve sexual health and in particular to increase women's access to methods that help prevent HIV infection. DFID's total expenditure cannot therefore be apportioned between HIV/AIDS and Family Planning, as many reproductive health programmes and projects contribute to both objectives (for example through the provision of information on family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention or the provision of condoms).</p>

	<p pid=".512W.5/1">Estimates suggest that 350 million couples worldwide lack access to modern family planning methods, and as many as 150 million women want to prevent or delay pregnancy but are not using any method of family planning.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.5/2">The aim of family planning programmes is to enable couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.5/3">The Department for International Development (DFID) is one of the leading bilateral providers of condoms and other forms of contraceptives to developing countries. We are also supporting a number of male and female condom social marketing programmes. We are helping the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to provide the widest achievable range of safe and effective family planning and contraceptive methods, including condoms to prevent HIV/AIDS. In January 2001, we provided UNFPA with a grant of &pound;25 million to help meet immediate needs for reproductive health commodities, including condoms, in a range of countries facing immediate shortages. We have increased our core annual funding to UNFPA from &pound;15 million to &pound;18 million.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.5/4">The Government have committed &pound;16 million (over five years) to the Medical Research Council's Microbicide development programme. New technologies such as the female condom and microbicides will be an important step forward. They will give women the power to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.5/5">The Government champions reproductive health issues at a country level, including through support for UNFPA. DFID works through Sector Wide Approaches (SWAPS) and Direct Budget Support as ways of supporting countries' Poverty Reduction Strategies. Within these processes it is important to ensure that sufficient attention is given to reproductive health issues, for example the assured supply and availability of reproductive health commodities. In many circumstances DFID is also continuing to ring-fence its support for reproductive health and HIV/AIDS work, including for example social marketing programmes. DFID spent &pound;31 million in 2002&ndash;03 on activities within SWAPS that had support for reproductive health services as one of their objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.2/1">The Open Health Institute is a Russian non-governmental organisation which works to resolve the most pressing health problems facing the Russian population. It was established in January 2003 as an independent NGO and previously was part of the Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation) in Russia. It continues to have a close affiliation with the Open Society Institute, from which it currently receives core funding. DFID is providing &pound;4.2 million to OSI/OHI for three years from September 2001 for a project which aims to reduce the transmission of HIV among injecting drug users and commercial sex workers in a network of over 40 harm reduction sites in Russia. The project was most recently reviewed in September 2003 and its outcomes are expected to be largely achieved by the project's end in August 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".513W.2/2">DFID's collaboration with the Open Health Institute is a valuable part of the Department's HIV prevention programme in Russia. The purpose of the programme is to influence the Russian Government and society to make a timely and effective response to HIV/AIDS by targeting vulnerable groups. There are over 250,000 officially-registered HIV cases in Russia, but the real number may be significantly higher. This is one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world.</p>

But discussion of these issues has now begun. On <phrase class="date" code="">25 September</phrase>, the parties signed a Framework Agreement on Security Arrangements during the Interim Period.

For example, re-integration of displaced persons, refugees, and armed forces; support for improvements to governance in Sudan; and relief of Sudan's huge debt arrears.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.6/1">The digitisation of Challenger 2 will be achieved through the installation and integration of Bowman radios, Platform Battlefield Information Systems Application (P BIS A) and the Commander's Crew Station Screen with the current fire control and sighting systems within the tank. This work will be completed by the Design Authority Alvis Vickers Ltd. The approved cost for the Bowman project is &pound;2.073 billion (resource cost, VAT inclusive, for the Demonstration and Manufacture phases) and the approved cost for the Combat Infrastructure and Platform BISA (CIP) project is &pound;410 million (P BISA is an integral part of the CIP project). Both projects involve digitisation of a number of platforms over-and-above Challenger 2, it is therefore not possible to determine the elements attributable to a specific platform. The programme to digitise the Challenger 2 fleet is due to start in January 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.6/1">The official minimum age for entry into the Zimbabwean armed forces is 18 years. We are not aware of the Zimbabwean armed forces systematically recruiting below this age.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.6/2">The Zimbabwean &quot;National Youth Service&quot; was established in 2000. Nominally a voluntary training scheme for vocational skills, disaster management, patriotism and moral education, it is widely understood to operate as a youth militia for the ruling party. By the end of 2002 an estimated 9,000 young people had undergone formal training in this scheme in five main camps and up to 20,000 were trained less formally elsewhere. This allegedly included weapons training. In July 2003, the Zimbabwe Defence Minister announced plans to formally integrate weapons training in the scheme's programme. The stated catchment age for the National Youth Service is 12&ndash;30 years.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.6/3">The &quot;National Youth Service&quot; is now one of the most commonly reported violators of human rights in Zimbabwe. There are also numerous credible reports of young people in training camps being abused.</p>

Last month saw the closure of the only independent daily newspaper, and last week saw the arrest of up to 200 trade unionists for peacefully demonstrating. As this year's meagre crop runs out, half the population will depend on food aid. The Zimbabwean people continue to struggle with hyper-inflation, mass unemployment, and shortages of cash, food and fuel. The source of the problem is clear: bad governance and bad policies. We will continue to support all those working for peaceful change in Zimbabwe and a return to democracy, accountable government and respect for human rights.</p>

Such an outcome would be fully in the spirit of the proposals for a comprehensive settlement put forward by the UN Secretary General. Agreement on the basis of the Annan Plan would provide the shortest route to compensation for Greek and Turkish Cypriots who, like Ms Loizidou, have been deprived of the use of their property and other rights.</p>

	<p pid=".541W.9/2">We are not delaying implementation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on photo-dynamic therapy (PDT). Patients are already receiving PDT treatment on the national health service and will do so in increasing numbers in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.9/3">In reviewing the final appraisal determination, the NICE Guidance Executive also considered whether there were grounds for advising the Department to vary the three-month direction. They considered there were grounds to do so on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.9/4">It was the Department's assessment, informed by evidence submitted to NICE, that the NHS would be unable to implement the guidance in full within the usual three-month period. We have previously varied the direction on five occasions when it was required to implement effectively the guidance to provide the service to patients.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.9/5">The guidance issued to primary care trusts on PDT asks that PCTs should make funds available within nine months. We expect implementation to have been fully achieved within this time frame with all eligible patients having access to available treatment. PCTs may complete implementation earlier should their service planning enable them to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.9/6">Within the nine months allowed for full implementation, commissioners are expected to expand the service in a planned way to ensure there is sufficient capacity which is appropriately located to meet patient need, a fully trained workforce and access to expert diagnostic services. This will include the creation of new, and the expansion of existing, PDT centres and expert reading centres.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.5/13"><sup>(7)</sup> All years give GDS expenditure. 2001&ndash;02 also includes PDS expenditure. PDS pilots began in 1998 and a proportion of GDS expenditure was moved into a separate budget to reflect this. Spend on PDS pilots has been included in the 2001&ndash;02 figures. This includes spending on Trust-led pilots as well as PDS/GDS.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/14"><sup>(8)</sup> Gross expenditure is the total expenditure on the service before the deduction of patient charge income.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/15"><sup>(9)</sup> All years give GDS expenditure. 2001&ndash;02 also includes PDS expenditure. Expenditure on community and hospital dental services has not been included in this table; information on the total funding for these services is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/16"><sup>(10)</sup> Figures for 2001&ndash;02 are on a resource basis. This change in accounting practice had the effect of increasing the levels of expenditure attributed to that year. As a result the NHS expenditure total increased by about &pound;200 million compared with the cash system used for previous years.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/17">The amount of money drawn down through the GDS funding arrangements is determined by the amount of work dentists carry out on NHS patients. The rate of increase of spend has been moderated by an increase in the number of dentists treating patients privately. The proportionate spend on dentistry has also been affected by the major additional investment across the NHS in recent years; total NHS expenditure has increased at a faster rate than expenditure on dentistry.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/18">The gross NHS GDS expenditure shown above for 2001&ndash;02 does not include the &pound;35 million Modernisation Fund and &pound;6 million Dentistry Action Plan Payments.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/19">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill currently before the House proposes the introduction of local commissioning for NHS dental services. Funding currently held and administered centrally would then become part of primary care trusts' general allocations. Unlike the current arrangements, resources would remain with the PCT should a dental practice reduce its level of commitment to the NHS. In the longer term, allocations will need to take oral health inequalities into account.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.9/1">Approximately &pound;160 million per year would be raised by English local authorities if 100 per cent. council tax were charged and collected on all second homes. This represents an additional &pound;80 million because there is currently a 50 per cent. discount on council tax for second homes. However, because owners of second homes would have no reason to provide this information if discounts were to be entirely ended, the yield in future years would be increasingly difficult to estimate. This would, of course, affect the scope for individual local authorities to benefit directly from the reduction of discounts on second homes.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.9/2">In addition, some second homes let as self-catering holiday homes are subject to business rates because it is intended that they are let as holiday accommodation for more than 140 days in a year.

	<p pid=".547W.6/1">In 2001, the National Radiological Protection's Board independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) published a report on &quot;Possible health effects from Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)&quot;. The report concluded that it was unlikely that the specific features of TETRA handsets and repeaters could pose a risk to health.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/2">The AGNIR report also concluded that signals from TETRA masts are not pulsed and confirmed that TETRA masts are similar to other mobile phone masts in terms of health and safety. There are no plans to issue specific guidance on the siting of TETRA masts close to schools.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/3">The AGNIR experts' recommendations for further research were taken forward by the Home Office. Recent results from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory show that signals from TETRA handsets have no effect on calcium exchanges in cells&mdash;the main concern about TETRA technology.

Cases are generally reviewed in date order of receipt, with in-custody cases generally being assigned one year of priority over at-liberty cases. In-custody applicants requesting reviews of their sentences will generally be assigned priority over those applying for reviews of their convictions. Factors such as age and ill health of applicants and witnesses, and the possibility of deterioration of evidence, are also taken into account. Priority is also assigned to cases that the Commission believes to be of particular significance to the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid=".553W.5/1">The Prison Service has policies in place to try to ensure that deaf, and indeed all, disabled prisoners are able to participate fully in prison life and that their needs in terms of rehabilitation, maintaining family ties, and support generally, are met. Ensuring staff awareness of the needs of deaf prisoners remains a high priority for the Prison Service: disability and deaf awareness and communication skills for staff are included within diversity training across the Service.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.5/2">Prisons are encouraged to employ British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters where necessary, for example, in adjudication hearings and in parole interviews. Although it is recognised that not all deaf and hard of hearing people use BSL, more staff in prisons are being trained in basic BSL skills and a small number of staff are more highly qualified and experienced signers.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.5/3">Staff and managers in prisons are also becoming more aware of the need to ensure that deaf prisoners are able to access offending behaviour programmes, and are starting to explore alternative ways of delivering these programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.5/4">Great importance is placed on the maintenance of family ties for all prisoners; it is recognised that for deaf prisoners, this requires adjustments such as provision of textphones, and quiet areas and induction loops in visits halls to enhance the quality of visits. Wherever possible, prisons develop links with community groups, some of which support and visit deaf prisoners.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.6/1">The effectiveness of using UK freight searching equipment in France has been clear for some time. There has been during 2003, the capacity to search 100 per cent. of freight vehicles passing through Calais and the number of clandestines encountered by Immigration Officers in the South East District (SED) has fallen drastically as a result. Locally collated management information (which may be subject to revision and correction) indicates a fall of 72 per cent. in monthly detections by SED, from 975 in September 2002 to 270 in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.6/2">New detection technology has also now been deployed in Belgium at Zeebrugge and Ostend and will be rolled out to other ports in Northern France. The deployment of UK detection technology in continental Europe has been a key measure in reducing asylum applications from 8,770 in October 2002 to 3,610 in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.6/3">The French are continuing to operate an efficient system for dealing with asylum applications and failed asylum seekers are being removed to their countries of origin, including the Balkans. The French are currently bringing in new legislation to tighten up their immigration rules.</p>

	<p pid=".560W.2/2">Prison Governors are required to comply with the duty under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to provide adequate facilities for people with disabilities and to make 'reasonable adjustments' to existing facilities. In particular, visitors to prison must be able to access all visits facilities. All establishments are currently assessing their facilities, but there is no central record of work conducted. Over 80 prisons provide play areas for children and an increasing number also offer extended day visits. Our policy is to encourage establishments to provide such facilities wherever possible, subject to individual operational and resource considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.2/3">Individual governors initiate refurbishments to prisons costing less than &pound;50,000 and the expenditure is incurred from their local budgets. Information on where such refurbishments have taken place and the costs involved are not held centrally. All newly built and contracted-out prisons are required to have a visitors' centre, distinct from visits halls, under the terms of their contract and the costs of building these range from around &pound;25,000 to &pound;200,000.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.2/4">Prison Service policy is to provide adequate facilities and these are under constant review. However, as most improvements are not centrally resourced, there is no comprehensive record of work carried out, or of the associated costs.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.0/5" class="indent">I am placing in the House of Commons Library a table which shows the count of adults (that is persons aged 18 and over) in each Parliamentary Constituency in England and Wales, taken from the published 2001 Census Report for Parliamentary Constituencies, compared with electoral register data from February 2001. It has been sorted in descending order, according to the disparity between the two. There are a number of reasons, which I have outlined below, why these counts can vary so greatly and why some constituencies have more registered voters than the Census counted resident adults. Therefore, the data has been sorted, with the constituency showing the greatest number of adults not on the electoral register at the top, and the constituency showing the greatest number of adults registered to vote but not resident in that constituency according to the Census at the bottom.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.0/6" class="indent">The Census and electoral register data are not directly comparable for a number of reasons. These include definitional differences in the way the sources are compiled, differences in the timing of the data for each source being collected, and the delay in people being removed from the electoral register in a constituency after they move away from the area. In addition to this, it is possible for people to be on the electoral register in more than one constituency or none at all.</p>

	<p pid=".563W.2/1">This information is not collected centrally. The Representation of the People Act 1983 requires electoral registration officers (EROs), appointed by local authorities for the purpose, to compile the electoral register. Regulation 23 of the Representation of the People Regulations 2001 permits an ERO to require any person to give information required for the purposes of that officer's duties in maintaining registers of parliamentary and local government electors. It is an offence punishable upon conviction by a fine not exceeding &pound;1,000 for a person to fail to comply with a request for information from an ERO, or to give false information to an ERO. Prosecutions for non-compliance are initiated at local discretion.</p>

	<p pid=".564W.2/1">The Government are concerned at the apparent drop in electoral registration in recent years. We are aware of a number of possible contributing factors, but do not wish to prejudge the conclusions of the independent Electoral Commission which is planning to undertake and complete next year research on this subject, building on reports it has published in the past year. The Government welcome this proposal and will give due consideration to any further recommendations the Commission may make as it does to all of the Commission's recommendations concerning electoral registration arrangements.</p>
