	<p pid="a.427W.8/1">From November 2009 the amount of capital completely ignored in the calculation of pension credit was increased from &#163;6,000 to &#163;10,000. This change was made in response to the impact of falling interest rates on pensioners and means that around 88 per cent. of pension credit recipients have all of their capital ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.8/2">From April 2010 the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit is due to increase by 2 per cent. This means that, from April, no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;132.60 a week and no couple on less than &#163;202.40 a week. The above earnings increase in the pension credit guarantee underlines the Government's ongoing commitment to tackling pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.8/3">We have a good track record of reducing pensioner poverty. In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners in relative poverty than in 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs). Pensioners are less likely to be living in poverty, as measured by relative low income after housing costs, than the population as a whole.</p>

The Households Below Average Income series uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.

	<p pid="a.433W.6/1">The Commission considered it important to have the planned nursery facility operating early in the new Parliament, before new Members had made other childcare arrangements. This is a challenging timescale, given the need for listed building consent and consent for change of use, the time required to make the premises ready and the requirement to pass the Ofsted inspection and be registered with Ofsted. In view of the time constraints, the Commission decided it was not feasible to consult the Administration Committee.</p>

The programme would aim to produce Bills and amendments in an electronic format which both complies with open standards and is readily re-usable so that it can be exchanged between parliamentary systems and made available to the public for further processing by others. This output would be similar to what is being requested in the Free our Bills campaign, and also to what is referred to by the House of Lords Information Committee in its recent Report Are the Lords listening? Creating connections between people and Parliament (HL Paper 138-1, 2008-09). The work would be undertaken in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the Office of Public Sector Information (responsible for publishing Acts) and the Cabinet Office.</p>

In addition, staff are examining the possibilities of using Bill data in its existing form to publish improved information on the parliamentary website, such as by linking Bill texts to existing Acts of Parliament which the Bill would amend. Some Bill texts showing the amendments made at Committee stage are already published on the parliamentary website (for example, the Financial Services Bill).</p>

	<p pid="a.457W.2/1">While formal written health and safety advice is not issued to each new employee in the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), written policy and guidance is available to all staff on the intranet. The MoJ is committed to ensuring that all staff receive appropriate information, instruction and training on the health and safety matters relevant to their roles, and health, safety and fire awareness are an important part of the induction process for new staff. Moreover, health and safety risk assessments and safe systems of work are available at the point of use. HM Prison Service was awarded the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Training Trophy in 2007 for excellence in the delivery of work-related health and safety training.</p>

These figures were obtained by matching a dataset of offenders released on HDC with offending data taken from an extract of the police national computer (PNC). There is no unique offender ID common to the two datasets. The matching process uses each offender's surname, forename, gender and date of birth and involves both direct matching and a variety of 'sounds like' algorithms to allow for minor errors in data entry. A small proportion of cases in each quarter cannot be matched; this can result from errors in the recording of personal details in either of the data sources, from duplicate matches when it is not possible to decide between PNC records for offenders with similar details, or from records missing from the PNC. In 2007-08 one per cent. of the offenders listed on the prison data as released on HDC could not be matched to the PNC.</p>

The Prime Minister, other UK Ministers and officials have repeatedly pressed the Government of Israel to permit the import of materials for the reconstruction of homes and other buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.2/1">We have serious concerns about the Israeli restrictions on Gaza and the impact they have on the lives of Gazans. Although there is no permanent physical Israeli presence in Gaza, given the significant control that Israel has over Gaza's borders, airspace and territorial waters, Israel retains obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as an occupying power. The Fourth Geneva Convention is clear that an occupying power must co-operate in allowing the passage and distribution of relief consignments. The restrictions currently imposed on the passage of relief supplies are, as we see it, a disproportionate response to the security threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.2/2">The extent of Israeli restrictions, and the threat to Israel from militants in Gaza, varies constantly. Rather than focus on whether the restrictions at any given time, amount to collective punishment, we have consistently pressed the Israeli Government to comply with their obligations under international law and allow passage of relief supplies. Although aid is entering Gaza, according to the United Nations this is insufficient to meet the needs of the Gazan people.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.2/1">No.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.2/2">Miners with surface only exposure to dust were not covered by the 1998 High Court Respiratory Disease Judgment and not included under the Claims Handling Agreement (CHA). The Department's position has been that the levels of respirable dust (rather than visible dust) in surface jobs was not sufficient to cause lung disease. Despite the Department's position on these cases, I recognise there has been a long-standing campaign to seek compensation for surface workers. In an attempt to settle this issue, four &quot;test&quot; cases were to be brought before the court for determination in November 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.2/3">I can now report that at a pre-trial court hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-09">9 October 2009</phrase>, the solicitors acting for the four selected claimants conceded the litigation on all four cases and costs were awarded to the Department. When advising the court of the position, the claimants' counsel said:</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;in the light of the expert evidence in each case, the court was likely to make findings in relation to dust exposure that would make it difficult for any of these four claimants to establish any significant injury.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.2/5">On this basis, no case for compensation has been established in respect of surface workers with surface only exposure.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.2/6">However, due to the Department's diligence, I can report that c.650 claims previously identified as Coal Preparation Plant only claims by their solicitors were found to be able to be compensated as &quot;mixed workers&quot; under the CHA and these are now being processed. Additionally, another c.200 claims are now having their underground only employment assessed and settled.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.2/7">Under a Court Order agreed in December 2009, and not opposed by the claimant's solicitors, all remaining surface only claims are now in the &quot;strike out&quot; process for mid February 2010.</p>

If these all proceed to commissioning, they could increase our gas storage capacity, to serve a range of short-term and long-term needs, by some 400 per cent. by around 2020. The Government are helping these projects to go forward, through reforms to the onshore and offshore consents regimes under the Planning and Energy Acts 2008; and by clarifying, alongside Budget 2009, that cushion gas, required by gas storage facilities, is eligible for tax relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.481W.9/1">The Government have a continuing commitment to the protection of green belt and its crucial characteristics of openness and permanence. Among the policies set out in PPG2 (Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, 'Green Belts') to guide decision-makers is a presumption against allowing inappropriate development on green belt land. These policies are applied as vigorously in the Thames Gateway as they are everywhere else.</p>
	<p pid="a.481W.9/2">Only in exceptional circumstances may green belt boundaries be altered. Any proposal for significant change in green belt area has to be made during the preparation of regional strategy. Any essential adjustment of the boundary of a green belt is for the local planning authority to propose as part of the local plan process. The Secretary of State monitors emerging regional strategies and local plans to ensure they are consistent with national policy. Government Offices make representations to the independent examinations of draft RSSs and LDFs if the approach proposed is not consistent with PPG2. There are no plans to change the policy set out in PPG2.</p>

FCO Travel Advice is reviewed for every country every month and following any significant incident. It is revised and reissued at least every three months.

	<p pid="a.486W.5/1">The UK's foreign policy towards Cuba is in line with the EU Common Position, which we agreed in 1996 and review annually each June at the European Council. Through engagement with both the Cuban Government and Cuban civil society, this policy aims to support the principles of pluralistic democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and an improvement of the living standards of the Cuban people. Specifically we hope to see concrete improvements in human rights, such as the release of all political prisoners, improved economic freedoms for all Cuban citizens and an end to restrictions on freedom of expression and independent trade unions. We work closely with our EU partners to further develop engagement with Cuba, including through the EU-Cuba political dialogue, and continue to look for opportunities to strengthen bilateral relations. We already co-operate at a working level on a number of issues such as climate change, child protection, counter-narcotics, and through scientific and cultural links.</p>

	<p pid="a.487W.2/1">The current provisions of Article 7 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 (VCDR) allow sending states to appoint members of staff to its missions. There is a clear distinction in the way in which the VCDR treats staff appointed from the sending state and those recruited locally. This means that UK-based diplomatic agents, once appointed and accredited by the receiving state, are afforded immunities and privileges according to Article 31(1) of the VCDR, for example, immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state and from its civil and administrative jurisdiction, subject to limited exceptions. However, under the current VCDR provisions the consent of the receiving state is required in order to appoint as diplomatic agents any locally engaged staff who are nationals or residents of that state and this consent can be withdrawn at any time under Article 8 of the VCDR.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.2/2">Our locally engaged staff are either nationals or residents of the receiving state. The fact that VCDR gives the receiving state the right to withdraw any immunity afforded to locally engaged staff at will means that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not consider that offering them immunity is a viable means of affording them any substantive additional protection, particularly in those countries where relations with the host government are sometimes strained.</p>

To this end we have placed a requirement on local authorities to pay a &#163;2,000 bursary to all care leavers who pursue a recognised course of higher education. This entitlement has been publicised through the National Care Advisory Service, which provides advice and support for children and young people aged 13-25 in and from care, and the 2008/09 Aim Higher Tutor's Resource Materials for young people in years 12 and 13 produced by the then Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.495W.2/4">In addition, the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 extends the entitlement to a personal adviser for care leavers from 21 to 25 where they remain in or return to education.</p>

	<p pid="a.508W.2/1">The stamp duty land tax relief (SDLT) for zero carbon homes was introduced to help kick-start the market for new highly efficient technologies in homes, both for the fabric of the building and in the use of micro-generation, and sets a gold standard for green homes. Few currently exist, but the purpose of the relief is to act as signal. We have always made it clear that the SDLT relief for zero carbon homes would evolve and we expect to see more of these homes built in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.2/2">24 homes have qualified for the zero carbon homes relief since October 2007. Due to the small numbers involved, HMRC tax-payer confidentiality obligations do not allow the requested breakdown of relief granted by month.</p>
