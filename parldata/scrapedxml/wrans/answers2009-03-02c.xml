	<p pid="c.1212W.0/1">Members and their staff do have the rights necessary to install their own software on their parliamentary computers. Members are responsible for the licensing and maintenance of any software that they install and, as the conditions of supply provide, PICT reserves the right to remove any software that is found to interfere with the proper operation of the hardware concerned, or the parliamentary network. This applies to encryption software. However, extra caution is needed with this type of product since, by its nature, it can prevent access and therefore could severely limit PICT's ability to provide support after it has been installed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.0/2">PICT has recently completed an evaluation of encryption software and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was found to be incompatible with Parliament's current version of VPN (remote access) software. Therefore, this product is not recommended for users of that service. As part of the evaluation PICT has identified another product that can be deployed to Members' loaned machines by PICT at no cost to Members. The software can also be acquired by Members at their own cost, if they wish to have it installed on machines that they have purchased through PICT.</p>

	<p pid="c.1215W.10/2">The Common Agriculture Policy 'Health Check' decision in November 2008 abolished the set-aside mechanism from January 2009. The UK supported this action on the condition that adequate measures were put in place to mitigate adverse environmental consequences. We were successful in achieving a new legal basis which allows member states to use cross compliance for this purpose.</p>

Sir Don reported last July, since when we have been considering the details of how mitigation might be put into practice. We expect to be in a position to consult on possible mitigation measures shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.1217W.8/2">Further impacts may arise indirectly from the disposal of batteries, as they contain a range of metals that can be re-used. Disposing of such materials in landfill means that more resources have to be used to mine new metals.</p>

This includes regulations that ban chemicals such as mercury and cadmium (above trace levels) in new batteries. In addition, the UK is working to implement the directive's requirements that we collect and recycle 25 per cent. of portable batteries by 2012 and 45 per cent. by 2016, which will dramatically reduce the amount going to landfill.</p>

	<p pid="c.1220W.0/1">The rural payments agency (RPA) publish comprehensive guidance about the scheme on their website, including information for prospective applicants. DEFRA, in conjunction with the devolved administrations and with the industry itself, has drawn up a national strategy in order to provide detailed advice that producer organisations (POs) can adopt with the aim of developing their businesses and gaining funding under the scheme. One of its aims is that this advice will encourage more growers to seek recognition under the scheme, either as new POs or as new members of existing ones. More generally, it is one of DEFRA's aims to encourage greater collaboration across the food chain. We have commissioned English Farming and Food Partnerships to undertake work to promote awareness and interest in the scheme with a view to encouraging greater uptake.</p>

	<p pid="c.1221W.5/1">The Environment Agency's inspection regime for those scrap metal sites which require an environmental permit is determined by an Operator Pollution Risk Appraisal (OPRA), which assesses the environmental risks and hazards posed by and associated with an activity and how well they are being managed. Those scrap metal sites which qualify for an exemption from the need for an environmental permit are inspected on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1221W.5/2">Between April and December 2008, 97 scrap metal and end of life vehicles sites were subject to intervention by the Environment Agency including enforcement. This included shutting 78 sites down and bringing 19 sites into compliance. Sites which represent the highest environmental risk are dealt with as a matter of priority. During 2008, the Environment Agency carried out 14 prosecutions against operators treating, keeping, or storing waste illegally or breaching permit conditions involving metals and end of life vehicles only.</p>
	<p pid="c.1221W.5/3">The Environment Agency works in partnership with the major trade associations, police forces, Home Office, DVLA, DEFRA and BERR in tackling waste crime. The agency spends about &pound;15 million a year tackling illegal waste activity, which includes fly tipping and illegal wastes sites. It is not possible to say how much of this spend relates to scrap metal sites.</p>

	<p pid="c.1224W.5/2">Distribution of potable water has been arranged in three ways: by fixing infrastructure and bringing in chemicals; through drilling of local boreholes; and ultimately by trucking in daily supplies where immediate needs can only be met this way.

	<p pid="c.1225W.3/1">Information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected quarterly at local authority level. Data collected includes the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1225W.3/2">Information on the number of dependent children (and expected children) in bed-and-breakfast style temporary accommodation (i.e. bed-and-breakfast hotels and other privately managed shared facility annexes) is reported quarterly by local authorities as at the last day of each quarter. This figure includes all children under 16 years old, and dependent children aged 16 to 18. On the <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase>, there were an estimated 1,570 dependent children in bed-and-breakfast style temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1225W.3/3">We have taken action to tackle the worst aspects of temporary accommodation use&mdash;families with children who were placed in cramped bed-and-breakfast accommodation for long periods of time. The effect of the Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2003, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, is that local authorities are no longer able to discharge their homelessness duty to secure suitable accommodation by placing households that include children or a pregnant woman in bed-and-breakfast accommodation except as a last resort and then for no longer than six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1225W.3/4">Furthermore, in 2005, we announced a target of reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation under the homelessness legislation. Following 12 consecutive quarters of decreases, the figure had fallen to 72,130 by the end of September 2008, and around 40 per cent. of local authorities have already met the target to halve the number of households in temporary accommodation by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.1226W.8/1">In common with the normal practice of the Department, we do not keep a record of time spent on specific policies and projects, so it is not possible to provide an estimate of official time spent on the eco-towns project since <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July 2007</phrase>. Currently nine officials are part of the eco-towns team, but there are also a number of other officials across the Department that contribute to the project, including those working in the areas of planning and climate change.</p>

In negotiating with international organisations as they set their budgets for 2009-10, the FCO will endeavour to limit budget increases to zero real growth. The fall in the value of the Sterling will have an impact on subscriptions paid in US Dollars and Euros. The FCO shares the burden of exchange rate movements on international subscriptions with the Treasury under the arrangement whereby HM Treasury funds 60 per cent. of any increase above a baseline of &pound;102 million.

The decline in the value of the sterling created a potential funding pressure of &pound;60 million in the 2008-09 financial year (as of December 2008). At current exchange rates we expect an additional pressure of up to &pound;30 million to continue our activities at current levels in 2009-10. This does not include the pressure on international subscriptions and peacekeeping. The impact of this shortfall has been minimised through delayed activity, by making additional efficiency savings, and implementing a strategy of forward purchasing of foreign exchange.</p>

	<p pid="c.1244W.0/1">We have received several worrying reports confirming that the seven leading members of the Iranian Baha'i community have been charged with spying for Israel, &quot;insulting religious sanctities&quot; and &quot;propaganda against the Islamic Republic&quot;&mdash;charges which could carry the death penalty. We are concerned about the conditions under which they are being detained and that they have been systematically refused access to their lawyer. Reports suggest that the seven individuals are due to face trial in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1244W.0/2">We are monitoring the situation closely and have called for Iran to allow independent observation of the judicial proceedings and to reconsider the charges brought against these individuals.</p>

	<p pid="c.1253W.7/4">Payments of non-consolidated performance pay to staff below the SCS may be either &quot;end of year&quot; payments or &quot;in year&quot; payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1253W.7/5">&quot;End of year&quot; payments of non-consolidated performance pay are made as part of the annual pay award to staff who have performed at a level beyond that which would normally be expected throughout the performance year. 1,676 staff in HMCS (including Ministry of Justice HQ and the Tribunals Service) received end of year non-consolidated performance payments in the last 12 months. Payments were made in August 2008 at the time of the implementation of the 2008 pay award for performance during the 2007-08 performance year.</p>

However, during the financial year 2007-08, 5,327 staff in HMCS (including MoJ HQ and the Tribunals Service) received &quot;in year&quot; non-consolidated performance pay.</p>

This is the most up-to-date data available without incurring disproportionate cost. During 2008, 29 members of the SCS received non-consolidated performance pay. In grades below the SCS 6,587 staff received non-consolidated performance pay during this period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1253W.7/10">In the National Probation Service during the last 12 months, payments of non-consolidated performance pay were made to the chief executives of the six Probation Trusts.

There are no plans to increase the Department's budget, which was agreed in the comprehensive spending review 2007. Forecasts of demand for services have been taken into account when agreeing allocations to business groups for 2009-10, and there are no plans to provide additional resources for this year. Forecasts of demand will again be taken into account when agreeing financial allocations to departmental business groups for 2010-11, but these have not yet been agreed. The Department has set up a Performance and Efficiency programme to deliver ways of working more efficiently in order to deliver our objectives from within existing budgets. Police funding is the responsibility of the Home Office and not the Ministry of Justice.</p>

	<p pid="c.1255W.3/1">The Government have a comprehensive strategy to help victims of crime access appropriate services. We recently appointed a victims champion who will listen to the views of victims and the community and make recommendations on how to improve the system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.3/2">Since introducing a statutory code of practice for victims of crime which established minimum rights for victims, we continue to embed best practice across the CJS agencies. This includes working with local criminal justice boards to ensure they have comprehensive victim and witness strategies that make a difference on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.3/3">We recognise the importance of working with third-sector organisations to deliver direct services for victims. We recently provided additional funding for the national organisation Victim Support to introduce an improved business process, so that victims can be contacted more quickly, have their needs assessed and offered a wider range of practical services than was previously available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.3/4">The Government have invested further resources into specialist services for victims. This includes sexual assault referral centres, independent domestic violence and sexual violence advisors and national and local specialist third-sector organisations. We have also made legal changes that will impact on certain victims: for example we ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against the Trafficking in Human Beings creating minimum protection rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.3/5">The recently published Youth Crime Action Plan sets out how we will improve support for young victims of crime. The plan has been developed jointly between the OCJR, Ministry of Justice, the Department for Children Schools and Families and the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.3/6">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority's major reform programme completely overhauled the case working processes. This included the introduction of geographically based teams; a new in-house telephone support service and the development of a new case working model placing greater emphasis on applicant support and focussing resources at the front end of the case working process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1258W.0/1">It is my practice to write to the appropriate hon. Member when this service is made available in his or her constituency. Planning permission is not required and there is no formal period for representations. For the most part the houses used for this service are leased, not purchased, by the contractor. The houses are the private rented homes of those living in them and it is not appropriate to consult local residents or the wider public. People bailed by the courts or released from prison return to live in the community without hon. Members or the public having any input as to where they may reside. It would be inappropriate and inequitable to identify as defendants or offenders those living at an address rented through ClearSprings when others on bail and home detention curfew living at private addresses are not subject to such identification. The contractor does consult the police, local authority and probation about the location of properties and they are provided with the opportunity to provide comments.</p>

Members before or after houses for this service are established in a constituency. The national offender management service, regional offender managers and directors of offender management determine where the contractor is asked to source property. The requirement is defined in terms of towns and boroughs, not by constituency.</p>

	<p pid="c.1259W.2/1">The proposed information sharing clauses in the Coroners and Justice Bill would provide the power to make information sharing orders, providing certain conditions are met. The power in the Bill does not, in itself, allow personal information to be shared. Therefore, we do not plan to carry out a privacy impact assessment on the proposals in the Bill; rather such assessments will be a mandatory requirement for all orders proposed under the power in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.1259W.5/1">There are no such plans. The Government believe it is for political parties to decide how to conduct their fundraising activities within the legislative framework. One potential option to change the legislative framework would be to introduce a cap on the level of permissible donations, and an associated increase in the amount of public funding available to parties. This option was put to the major political parties following the review conducted by Sir Hayden Phillips in 2007. However, the inter-party talks that followed that review did not result in agreement to proceed with the wider package of reforms that Sir Hayden recommended to the party funding legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1259W.5/2">The Government's White Paper, &quot;Party finance and expenditure in the United Kingdom&quot; (CM7329) considered the issues of donation caps and public funding in considerable detail. The Government believe that any arrangements for increased public funding and associated cap on donations would need to be considered carefully as part of a wider public debate. There would need to be clear support from both the public and political parties before such steps could be taken. It is not clear that such a broad consensus of support currently exists. However, the Government stands ready to continue that debate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1262W.4/1">The United Kingdom's film industry is, I am glad to say, performing very well indeed, box office take was &pound;100 million in January and the three most successful releases last year were British made.</p>
	<p pid="c.1262W.4/2">In addition, British films have had unprecedented success in this year's awards season and I would like to congratulate all the British winners at the Oscars, the Baftas and the golden globes&mdash;especially Danny Boyle and all those involved with &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;; and to Kate Winslet. A mention also to Simon Chinn who got best documentary feature for &quot;Man on Wire&quot; (which received substantial funding from the UK film council).</p>
	<p pid="c.1262W.4/3">But, that said, film production fell in the UK during 2008 but we are working closely with the UK film council to ensure better results in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.1265W.3/2">The Government take data protection very seriously. Following the Cabinet Office Review of Data Handling Procedures in Government, Departments have implemented a raft of measures to improve data security.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.3/3">The Ministry of Justice is considering actively with the Information Commissioner's Office how the promise might add additional value to those measures we have already signed up to. These include the information charters, the recommendations of the data handling review and the Thomas/Walport Review and, of course, our legal obligations under the Data Protection Act and other legislation and regulations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1266W.2/1">There has been no formal assessment of this overlap. However, research to estimate digital satellite coverage was carried out by Ofcom's predecessor, the Independent Television Commission, in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.1266W.2/2">This research arrived at the 98 per cent. coverage figure which found that the main contributory factor which resulted in 2 per cent. of households being unable to receive any satellite signals was man-made obstructions in built-up areas. For terrestrial transmission, the opposite situation to satellite applies, with transmitters located so as to serve population centres. The locations not covered by these transmitters are largely in remote, sparsely populated areas. This means that the overlap between the 2 per cent. for satellite and 1.5 per cent. for terrestrial digital TV should be very small.</p>

	<p pid="c.1271W.11/1">In January 2009 the Department for Transport published &quot;Britain's Transport Infrastructure, Motorways and Major Trunk Roads&quot; which summarises the results of assessments of hard shoulder (HSR) running as an alternative to widening on a number of sections of the motorway network including the M1 between junctions 10 and 13. This document is available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1271W.11/2">This work has concluded that hard shoulder running can deliver improvements more quickly than motorway widening, provides a better value for money solution and gives benefits in terms of safety and reliability. Additional capacity can be delivered at a lower cost than a more conventional road widening scheme with fewer environmental impacts. We have successfully and safely giving us confidence that we can do the same elsewhere on the network.</p>
	<p pid="c.1271W.11/3">In the light of these findings, the January document confirmed that we plan to commence works on the implementation of hard shoulder running on the M1 between junctions 10 and 13 in the next financial year. The Highways Agency will be providing more detailed information on the scheme in spring 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.1290W.6/2">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is one of the main agencies though which the Government support medical and clinical research. The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.6/3">The MRC is currently funding one research project relating to Down's syndrome. The MRC does not, as a rule, earmark funds for particular topics: research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health.</p>

	<p pid="c.1307W.2/2"><i> </i>A cadre of skilled and capable personal advisers will be absolutely essential to effectively implement the Progression to Work model. The Department made clear in its recent discussion document &quot;Realising Potential: developing personalised conditionality and support&quot; that it will be necessary to think through the implications for the adviser role and implement a workforce development strategy within Jobcentre Plus. This is an issue we will discuss in detail with stakeholders. As such no final decisions have yet been made on the grading or number of personal advisers necessary to deliver the Progression to Work pathfinders. However all Jobcentre Plus personal advisers are currently band C grade staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1307W.2/3">The cost of the new Progression to Work pathfinders will depend on precisely what the personalised conditionality and work-related activity looks like. At this stage therefore, costs are uncertain. The impact assessment associated with the White Paper &quot;Raising Expectations and Increasing Support&mdash;reforming welfare for the future&quot; estimated that the increase in work-focused interviews and provision to support work and skills-related activity could cost up to an extra &pound;20 million a year for parents with younger children. For employment and support allowance customers we are still working through the detailed design of the policy and assessing the appropriate balance between Jobcentre Plus and providers. Additional costs will be met from within the current agreed Department spending plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.1312W.11/4" class="indent">Tables A-K show all pupil referral units which have been placed in special measures in each academic year since 1997. Special measures is an Ofsted category, defined at present in the Education Act 2005, meaning that a school is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and the persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1312W.11/5" class="indent">Please be aware that the framework for inspecting pupil referral units changed in January 2000, September 2003 and September 2005. As a result, there has been no consistent &quot;inadequate&quot; category over this period. These tables are therefore limited to those pupil referral units placed in special measures, as this category has been in place throughout the period in question.</p>

	<p pid="c.1315W.2/1">The new secondary curriculum has a range of opportunities for schools to teach about animal welfare. Citizenship helps young people to consider a wide range of political, social, ethical and moral issues. Pupils should also be taught about the way in which the environment and living things need protection. In personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE education), pupils learn that people and other living things have needs, and that they have responsibilities to meet them. Teachers have the freedom and flexibility to decide how to teach the curriculum and what activities best suits the needs of their learners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1315W.2/2">To support and inspire all schools to harness the full potential of the living world as a cross-curricular teaching and learning resource, both within and beyond the school grounds the Department funds the Growing Schools programme. It focuses on farming, as well as food and environmental issues, and on ensuring pupils are given first hand, practical experience in the outdoor classroom. Through Growing Schools the Department supports the school farms network which offers support and assistance to school farms through materials and CPD.</p>

The Treasury, using an order under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, transferred KSF's deposit book of &quot;Kaupthing Edge&quot; accounts to ING Direct. The Government also committed to paying out in full FSCS eligible depositors whose accounts were not transferred.</p>

The administrators will continue to deal with the assets in compliance with insolvency law and the provisions of the transfer order (including those provisions of the transfer order which confer certain limited functions on the Treasury in relation to the assets of KSF). Those depositors that are ineligible for FSCS compensation will be creditors of the bank in the normal way and paid out in accordance with UK insolvency procedures.</p>

Emission reporting in the UK can be broken down into individual gases, and also by 'source' and on an 'end user' basis. For 'end user' the emissions are reallocated from the production and distribution of energy to the users of that energy. The main difference between source and end user emissions comes from the treatment of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, the largest source of carbon dioxide in most countries. To derive emissions by end user, emissions from power stations and other fuel processing industries have been re-allocated to end users on an approximate basis according to their use of the fuel. Emissions by end user are subject to more uncertainty than emissions by source and should only be used to give a broad indication of emissions by sector.</p>

It is open to the competent authority (the Environment Agency in England and Wales) to apply such derogations as are mentioned in the directive as it sees fit in the light of discussion with the plant operator concerned.</p>

	<p pid="c.1330W.5/2">DEFRA carefully considered the promotion of 'thin' clients, which are centrally managed computers with most of the function of the system located in a central server room. However, evidence to date has shown that the increased electricity consumption of these server rooms (e.g. through the air conditioning needed to cool the room) renders this technology less attractive than previously thought from an energy efficiency perspective.</p>

One of their main aims is to make the energy consumption of our ICT systems carbon neutral by 2012. We also mandated a set of minimum environmental standards for commonly-purchased products, including ICT.</p>

	<p pid="c.1331W.2/1">The Department do not have a target to provide free loft insulation to pensioners over 70. However, the Government do have an ambition to help all households meet their energy efficiency potential by 2020, where practical. As a key contribution, we have set the major energy suppliers ambitious household carbon saving targets, which they meet through promoting subsidised energy efficiency measures. 40 per cent. of their targets have to be met in a priority group of vulnerable households on qualifying benefits and aged 70 and over. Currently, all six obligated suppliers offer priority group households free loft insulation and cavity wall insulation, where none exists, subject to a survey of the property. Under the supplier obligation, around 1.5 million priority group households have received loft insulation since the scheme first began in April 2002.</p>

Clearly, we will need to explore whether these companies and other employers, both large and small, across the public, private and third sectors can do more to help us provide extra places. Our national advertising campaign which started this week and the new National Apprenticeship Service will promote the value of apprenticeships to employers to ensure we deliver jobs and training for young people and adults. This will build further on the record number of apprenticeship starts and completions delivered last year; the best since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1331W.6/3">Since 1997 we have witnessed a renaissance in apprenticeships from a low point of 65,000 to a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007-08. Completion rates are also at a record high with 64 per cent. successfully completing an apprenticeship&mdash;up from 37 per cent. in 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="c.1337W.3/2">When the 'Innovation Nation' White Paper was published in March 2008, we anticipated that Departments would produce their plans in that calendar year. This has not proved practicable, and we have now asked Departments to put their plans in place by the end of the financial year. I can confirm that most major spending Departments expect to have their innovation procurement plans in place by the end of March. DIUS is working closely with the Departments and with the Office for Government Commerce to ensure that the Departments' plans achieve value for the buying Department while encouraging innovation in business, and to ensure that the effectiveness of the plans is appropriately monitored.</p>

	<p pid="c.1338W.0/1">Career development loans (CDLs) are a successful GB wide programme administered by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to help individuals invest in their future by financing vocational learning of their choice. CDLs are commercial loans provided by three high street banks, for which the Government pays the interest while people study.</p>
	<p pid="c.1338W.0/2">The LSC monitors and analyses lending trends on a continuing basis. The number of loans given so far this year is lower than forecast. The LSC believe that, in part, this reflects the banks' concerns about the economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="c.1338W.0/3">However, as set out in January in &quot;New Opportunities: Fair Chances for the Future&quot;, the Government believe that loans can play a greater part in helping people gain the skills they need. Expanded and rebranded professional and career development loans (PCDLs), which will be available for courses starting in September 2009, will offer reduced headline interest rates and allow for loans up to &pound;10,000. PCDLs will help more people seeking professional and technical qualifications get on the right track in their career, and help those who have been made redundant retrain.</p>

	<p pid="c.1341W.5/1">The Government are taking a range of steps to help businesses through the current economic downturn to boost capital and liquidity in the market. This is across all sectors of the economy. Key measures include the reduction in VAT, the introduction of a new Enterprise Finance Guarantee to support up to &pound;1.3 billion of bank lending, a separate &pound;10 billion guarantee facility to support further working capital bank lending, a &pound;75 million Capital for Enterprise Fund to convert businesses' debt into equity and &pound;25 million of regional funds.</p>

It focuses on what the sector needs for success in the long-term&mdash;including seizing the opportunities of the low carbon economy, supporting skills, realising overseas opportunities and improving the perception and understanding of manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1341W.5/5">It builds on existing areas of support such as R and D Tax Credits, the Technology Programme and the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS). MAS is monitoring the situation for small manufacturing companies and responding flexibly with suitable advice to help companies. We are also piloting increased support for MAS in the West Midlands.</p>

HMG seeks advice on export licence applications, as appropriate, from its advisors in diplomatic posts overseas, including for Israel.</p>
	<p pid="c.1344W.11/3">Licences will not be issued if any of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria would be breached by doing so. However, the Government reassess licences that are in force if circumstances change significantly in the destination country and can revoke these licences if, in the light of those changed circumstances, they assesses that the export covered by the licence would breach any of the criteria.</p>

	<p pid="c.1349W.2/1">The UK Government recognise that losing the individual's right to opt-out of the 48 hour working week as set by the working time directive, would have a detrimental effect on the hours which firefighters working the retained duty system could be available for duty, especially the substantial numbers who work full-time for their primary employer. Many other workers also use this important flexibility and so we remain firmly of the view that this right should remain. We, along with a majority of other member states will be fighting for the retention of the opt-out as this dossier progresses through the European negotiation process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1361W.2/2">In respect of the disclosure of information to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) by another public authority, there are plans for secondary legislation to share information on students in higher education (for improving population statistics), information from the Value Added Tax System (to reduce the reporting burden on business) and information from the Joint Unemployment and Vacancies Operating System (again to reduce the burden on business).</p>
	<p pid="c.1361W.2/3">In respect of disclosure by ONS to other public authorities, there are plans for secondary legislation to disclose information from the Interdepartmental Business Register to the Bank of England. There are also plans for secondary legislation to disclose information from this source to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, although this will not require legislation in the UK Parliament.</p>

Additional measures to reduce the burden on personnel include: reducing the level on non-operational tasking and ensuring all deployments are essential; regularly reviewing the scale and mix of personnel deployed; increasing recruitment and training; and providing financial and non-financial incentives including retention bonuses for certain trades or specialisations that are experiencing shortfalls and continuance of Service beyond the end of engagements.

This covers a &pound;200 million impairment charge due to the downward revaluation of land and buildings (reflecting current UK property market conditions); and also the downward revaluation of land and buildings planned for disposal by Defence Estates. The Defence Estates total holding of land and buildings is currently valued at &pound;20 billion. This increased gross AME provision request was partially offset by a &pound;30 million decrease resulting from a revised equipment impairment forecast.</p>

	<p pid="c.1369W.5/1">Since 2000 the following incidents involving submerged royal navy submarines have taken place: HMS Superb in May 2008, HMS Tireless in 2003, HMS Trafalgar in 2002 and HMS Triumph in November 2000. HMS Tireless hit an iceberg while on Arctic patrol. The remainder were all grounding incidents. All the vessels, apart from HMS Superb, which was decommissioned in October 2008, were repaired and returned to service.</p>
