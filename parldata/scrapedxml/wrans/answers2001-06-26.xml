	<p pid=".57W.2/1">We have been greatly encouraged by the response to the consultation on the future of the Defence Diversification Agency (DDA) and were particularly pleased by the many words of encouragement and support for the agency and its work. We continue to support a strong UK defence industry and recognise fully the significant role it plays in our wider industrial base. It was for these reasons we set up the DDA with three key aims: to extend technology and expertise within the defence sector to civilian use; to foster partnerships and joint development programmes, recognising that the civil sector has much of potential benefit to defence; and to inform and assist the defence industry's own diversification planning.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/2">We intend that the DDA should continue to be a highly effective technology broker and achieve its aims in support of our overall defence diversification strategy. We believe that to do this successfully, the DDA must remain part of the defence community. But it cannot remain as part of the Defence Evaluation Research Agency (DERA) as now because of the planned public-private partnership. MOD's strategy of putting an increasing proportion of its research work outside of QinetiQ (as the new company will be known) and the Defence Scientific and Technology Laboratory (Dstl; the retained part of DERA) means that DDA would, in the longer term, be poorly placed if wholly located in either. There is also the need to ensure commercial confidentiality and fairness to all defence research suppliers.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/3">We have decided to bring the DDA into the Ministry of Defence head office. Existing DDA technology development managers will be transferred in their current locations to QinetiQ and Dstl. This recognises that QinetiQ and Dstl will remain our major suppliers of defence research for some time and, importantly, this option commanded the highest level of support from the DDA staff themselves. It will also have the benefit of allowing us to retain DDA's existing regional structure and thus ensuring that the existing close links are maintained with both the defence technology base and local business communities.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/4">Once we have experience of how the DDA will operate in practice under the new structure, we will proceed with determining the appropriate composition and terms of reference for the Defence Diversification Council.</p>

	<p pid=".60W.6/2">The amendment to Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act in October 1998, which was brought in to halt the previous Administration's policy of forcing schools to sell off playing fields, has introduced powers that require all state schools to seek consent for the sale of playing fields from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. In making her decision my right hon. Friend will take into account a number of criteria including consultation with the community and user groups, whether the proceeds will be used for education or used to enhance or improve sports provision, and whether the remaining playing fields fully meet the needs for local schools and the community. My right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Education and Employment gave approval for the sale of 26.4 acres of school playing fields in England in 1998; 111.2 acres in 1999; and 60.9 acres in 2000. In many cases such approval will only involve the sale of part of a playing field (which will not affect the sporting use), or even no sale at all, as it is reused for another sporting use.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.7/1">I have today published two reports, one on the Civil Service Diversity Survey and the other a research report on &quot;Equality in performance review in the Civil Service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.7/2">The diversity survey was conducted across the service to measure staff perception and experiences of working in the civil service in order to track progress on meeting objectives on civil service modernisation, diversity and equal opportunities. The research on equality in performance review was undertaken across six Departments, following an earlier research study on differences in performance markings between groups of staff.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.7/3">The diversity survey identified the civil service as a good employer, with high ambitions as part of the civil service reform programme. The equality in performance review research suggests small but statistically significant differences in performance appraisal box markings between ethnic minority and white staff, disabled and able-bodied staff and men and women, and the research suggests underlying causes for this. These projects demonstrate the commitment of the civil service to continue to make progress to becoming truly diverse.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.7/4">I have placed copies of both reports in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

Local health improvement programmes include an assessment of the health needs of local populations, and the funding of primary care group investment plans is aligned with priorities identified by the local health improvement plan. It is the responsibility of local health providers to plan their own staffing requirements to meet local need accordingly. Primary care groups and trusts have huge potential to improve people's health and prevent illness, which includes providing appropriate health visiting services.</p>

These targets are part of a staged reduction in waiting times, with in-patient waiting times continuing to fall from 18, to 15, to 12, nine then ultimately six months by 2005. The maximum out-patient waiting time will fall to three months by 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.6/1">My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has today published the Report on the Quinquennial Review of HM Land Registry. HM Land Registry is a Government Department established in 1862 for which the Lord Chancellor is the responsible Minister. In 1990 it was launched as an executive agency and granted Trading Fund status in 1993.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/2">I would like to thank the reviewer, Andrew Edwards CB, for conducting such a thorough review and for his most comprehensive Report. The Review has found that public confidence in land and property ownership depends on HM Land Registry's ability to guarantee title and to deliver its services impartially. For these reasons the Review finds that HM Land Registry should remain in the public sector as a Government Department, an executive agency and a trading fund; while continuing the significant amount of work in partnership with the private sector that it currently undertakes. The Government accept the Review's conclusions on HM Land Registry's continued public sector status and the Lord Chancellor has now asked officials to take forward the review of HM Land Registry's Framework Document.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/3">I note that the Review makes wide-ranging proposals for the enhancement of the Land Register and for improvement in the operation of the property market in England and Wales. It also provides a timely contribution to the debate on the future of e-conveyancing and land registration services. While some of the recommendations are consistent with programmes of reform already under way, others are more radical and wide-ranging. The Lord Chancellor has therefore asked officials from his Department and HM Land Registry to examine the recommendations carefully with officials from other interested Government Departments. Together with colleagues, we will wish to assess the more wide-ranging and radical proposals, including, in particular, their implications for, and impact on, other Government initiatives, before reaching conclusions on the best way forward in this important area. The Lord Chancellor intends to publish in the autumn a plan for taking forward the wider recommendation contained in the Report once this more detailed consideration has been completed.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/4">Copies of the Report and a summary of its recommendations have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
