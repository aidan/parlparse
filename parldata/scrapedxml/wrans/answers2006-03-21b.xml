	<p pid="b.182W.6/1">The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that of the 46 million women who have an abortion each year, 19 million are estimated to be unsafe. That is, carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimum medical standards. They do so because they do not wish to go through with an un-intended or unwanted pregnancy. One important reason for this is that many millions of women still lack access to reproductive health and family planning services, and thus have no choice about when and if to have children.</p>

	<p pid="b.183W.0/1">Following the tsunami, the Government allocated &pound;75 million to meet the immediate needs of those affected. To date &pound;68 million has been disbursed through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement and non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children Fund, CAFOD and Help the Aged. The balance will be allocated for disaster risk reduction and early warning initiatives across the affected region. We are currently looking at proposals for programmes to utilise these funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.0/2">The complexity of the response and the changing situation on the ground meant that some organisations have not been able to spend funds according to their original timetable. However, where people still need help, DFID has allowed some partner organisations to extend the end date of relief programmes using DFID funds if we decide that the programmes remain appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.0/3">In circumstance where DFID judges that extending the life of a programme would be of little value to those affected by the tsunami and is not an appropriate use of UK funds we will request that the balance of the DFID grant be returned. The UK will not provide financing in advance of need as this money could be usefully spent reducing poverty and saving lives in other parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.0/4">The Disasters Emergency Committee website (<a href="http://www.tsunami.dec.org.uk">www.tsunami.dec.org.uk</a>). contains details and an evaluation of how the major UK non-governmental organisations (NGO)s utilised the funds they were given.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.0/5">DFID will allocate &pound;65 million to meet longer term reconstruction needs. From this amount, &pound;60 million has been committed to Indonesia. Of the &pound;60 million, &pound;13.5 million has already been allocated. Some of the funds have been put into a multi-donor trust fund which provides grants for a range of reconstruction activities including housing, infrastructure, and land titling projects. Additional funds have been used to support the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s livelihoods programme and to support a range of smaller technical assistance packages. Of this, &pound;13.5 million, we estimate that &pound;12.5 million has actually been spent. It is difficult to be precise about how much of the UK funds have been spent from the Multi-Donor Fund because it is a pooled funding mechanism. The Multi-Donor Fund estimates that it will have spent $102 million of the $228 million received from donors by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.0/6">We are looking to spend the remaining funds over the next 2 to 3 years. Our immediate priority is to support urgent livelihoods activities and other initiatives which will help to build a sustainable peace in Aceh. We have pledged an additional &pound;20 million to the Multi-Donor Fund, but we will look to allocate this and any remaining funds as needs are identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.0/7">The remaining &pound;5 million balance of the &pound;65 million has been allocated to India and Sri Lanka. The recovery programme in Sri Lanka is fully financed, but DFID allocated &pound;2 million to help speed up implementation of reconstruction programmes and to ensure equitable distribution of assistance. To date, &pound;1.3 million has been spent on technical assistance and expertise. The remaining funds will be spent in 2006&ndash;07 to help people affected by the tsunami re-establish their livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.0/8">In India technical assistance worth &pound;3 million has been provided to help ensure effective, transparent and equitable programming of relief.</p>

	<p pid="b.184W.2/1">The threat of avian influenza is of global significance and requires a co-ordinated global response. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January</phrase>, at the International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Pandemic Influenza in Beijing, the UK pledged &pound;20 million to help achieve this. We also expressed our willingness to consider requests from developing country Governments to reprioritise DFID country programmes to finance work on influenza. We will ensure that UK support is co-ordinated with the efforts of individual countries and other international donors.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.2/2">In Nigeria, DFID has committed &pound;800,000 to combat the spread of the disease. Of this, &pound;250,000 was used for the immediate purchase of 15,000 personal protection kits for UN Agencies to distribute through the Nigerian Ministries of Agriculture and Health to front-line workers and those involved in surveillance of the disease. The remaining &pound;550,000 has been given as a grant to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is leading the international response to avian influenza. The WHO will use the funds to support the Government of Nigeria at both federal and state level in reducing the opportunity of human infection, ensuring that the surveillance systems are in place and active, and undertaking assessment of laboratory facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.2/3">The UK has not provided direct assistance to Niger or Cameroon to tackle avian influenza. We do not have major programmes in either country, though we do support forestry reform in Cameroon and have provided significant humanitarian assistance to Niger. We are closely monitoring the situation in both countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.2/4">Through our ongoing involvement in Africa, DFID is keeping abreast of countries' own plans and the activities of international organisations and donors relating to avian flu. We are in regular discussion with African countries about possible UK support to help develop and implement their influenza strategies. For example, DFID has committed &pound;1 million to prevention and control of the disease in Ethiopia. &pound;700,000 will be used for early detection, prevention and control and &pound;300,000 will be used to establish a national focal point to address the threat posed by a human influenza pandemic.</p>

Flooding has been most intensive in the lower Zambezi and Pungue river basins. Nonetheless, the DNA is optimistic that any further large scale flooding on the Zambezi will be avoided, because the amount of water entering the lake behind the Cahora Bassa dam is falling, thus reducing the need, to increase discharges into the lower river. Based on historic patterns the likelihood of more extensive flooding will diminish from the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="b.186W.2/1">The relief effort in Guatemala in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan is coordinated by the Guatemalan Government Agency, CONRED (Co-ordinadora Nacional para la Reduccion de Desastres) and involves a wide number of Government Departments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), donors and local community groups. Rehabilitation programmes are planned for periods of six-12 months and activities have begun for many of the 1,063 affected communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.186W.2/2">DFID provided &pound;253,000 to the emergency in Guatemala and El Salvador, channelled through Plan International UK and CARE International UK. &pound;172,000 of this is benefiting Guatemala. This is in addition to &pound;690,000 provided as the UK share of European Commission assistance following the disaster. DFID has kept informed of the recovery process through the reports of Plan International and CARE International, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and through contact with the Government of Guatemala.</p>
	<p pid="b.186W.2/3">The most affected parts of the country were the south coast and the western region where 59,000 people were displaced. Since October 2005, at least 12,310 families have been given temporary familial shelters or have been reintegrated into their communities. The Guatemalan Government have undertaken extensive surveys of potential new land for these communities to minimise future risk of exposure to floods and mud-slides.</p>
	<p pid="b.186W.2/4">A key reconstruction priority was ensuring access to safe reliable water, and much of the rehabilitation effort has focused on this. Waterborne disease remains a risk for affected communities and the Ministry of Health have been supported in the provision of transportation services, basic health kits including mosquito nets, and training for communities in health and nutrition awareness. Overall progress in reconstructing sanitation units has been slow, which in many cases has only reached 10 per cent. of target so far. However, some areas have benefited from intensive NGO efforts to ensure safe water, with as many as 10,000 water filters being provided and treatment plants in three municipalities. The installation of systems has been undertaken in close conjunction with local government authorities and communities to ensure sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="b.186W.2/5">Children have been badly affected by the hurricane the most, and those who remain in shelters will continue to receive psychological and educational support from rehabilitation partners. A continuing concern is the restoration of the livelihoods of the communities affected, either through agricultural support to those who returned to their homes, or through income generation opportunities for those who remain in shelters or have been relocated. DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have been in discussions with the Guatemalan Government to assess how those worst affected by Stan can begin to rehabilitate their livelihoods.</p>

	<p pid="b.189W.0/1">Last year in its Global Report the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimated that around the world, at least 12.3 million people were victims of forced labour. The report makes clear that poverty and social exclusion are at the root of much contemporary slavery and forced labour.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.0/2">The Government supports long-term programmes to help tackle the poverty and social injustice which makes people vulnerable to exploitation. It also supports programmes that specifically target forced labour. DFID has provided over &pound;2 million to support the ILO's Special Action Programme on Forced Labour and an additional &pound;2 million for the ILO's regional programmes in West Africa and South East Asia. DFID has also committed almost &pound;14 million to ILO and non-governmental organisation programmes in South East Asia to stop the trafficking of children for forced labour.</p>

	<p pid="b.189W.3/1">There is no universal definition of a small firm. While several criteria can be used to define a small firm, including annual value of sales turnover and value of capital assets, the most common defining feature is number of workers employed. DFID regards &quot;small&quot; firms to be those with 1 to 50 employees. Firms employing over 50 employees are considered medium-sized. In international development usage, small firms with less than 10 employees are generally termed &quot;micro enterprises&quot;. Modern small firms differ from micro enterprises in several important respects, namely:</p>

	<p pid="b.189W.6/1">Street Children in Latin America are victims of deprivation and exclusion. Overwhelming poverty, unemployment and social dislocation leave many children with no option other than to leave home to find work and by-pass the education system. Street children are excluded from accessing key services such as health and education. They are powerless and lack supportive kinship and social networks. Many street children suffer and are at greater risk from organised violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and HIV/AIDs.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.6/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is assisting street children in Honduras and Guatemala through our support to the international financial institutions, the European Commission and our civil society partners. DFID is supporting the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDE) to strengthen their programmes to tackle the widespread poverty, inequality and social exclusion that forces many children on to the street. DFID assistance through the IDB has included $145,000 to build the capacity of Guatemalan non-governmental organisations and public sector officials to reintegrate street children back into society. Our contributions to the European Commission are also assisting the Commission to implement a social cohesion programme in Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.6/3">DFID contributed &pound;1 million in 2004 to support participation of both civil society and the Government of Honduras in developing their poverty reduction strategy. The Strategy includes an analysis of child poverty and the plight of street children and commits the Government to reduce child labour, improve the quality and equity of education and improve child health coverage. DFID support to the Save the Children Fund (SCF) through a global agreement has also assisted the SCF Honduras office to work on youth justice initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="b.190W.2/1">Up to now the impact of restrictions on the operation of humanitarian organisations in West Darfur has been minimal, despite the reduction in the number of international staff working in the region. This has been due to the agencies themselves anticipating the deteriorating security situation last January, and pre-positioning relief materials. This has enabled basic water, food and medical supplies to be provided through national staff and local non-governmental organisations (NGO)s.</p>
	<p pid="b.190W.2/2">However, security restrictions mean that the UN and NGOs can undertake only emergency life saving interventions in some parts of West Darfur. This, and the reduction in staff numbers, means that the international community is now less able to respond to a major challenge such as an outbreak of disease or a further large-scale displacement of the population. Reduced staff numbers mean that the UN's ability to afford protection of civilians is also more limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.190W.2/3">We remain closely engaged with NGOs and the UN and stand ready to provide additional assistance if required.</p>

The most recent information suggests that the ratio of girls to boys in primary education in the country as a whole is 99 per cent., highlighting that the number of girls in primary school is very nearly equal to the number of boys. This information is not broken down specifically for northern Uganda because of the problems that population movement and security have created for the collection of data.</p>

Information on whether ministerial approval was specifically sought in relation to individual licensing decisions is exempt from disclosure as its release would prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs.</p>

	<p pid="b.194W.0/2">It is not possible to make an assessment of the impact of these increases on households earning the minimum wage, due to the different working patterns of those individuals within this group. We do, however, have data on the proportion of household disposable income spent on energy bills by quintile and country for 2003&ndash;04 and overall by country, which is shown in the table. The proportion of income spent by the middle quintile may be thought of as a measure of average proportional spend:</p>

	<p pid="b.194W.0/14">It is not possible to work out the impact of recent energy price rises on these statistics. These price increases are likely to have increased the proportion of income spent on fuel, though. Work on the best way to tackle the impact of the price rises for those in fuel poverty in the light of rising energy prices is being taken forward in the context of the Energy Review.</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.5/2">The European Commission definition is based on headcount, turnover, balance sheet and independence criteria. A small firm is defined as having:</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.5/3" class="indent">Maximum headcount of 49 (employees and self-employed)</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.5/4" class="indent">Maximum annual turnover of &euro;10 million (euros)</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.5/9">The Companies Act 1985 only defines small firms for the purpose of certain exemptions from accounting and auditing requirements and is not applied universally. The definitions in the Companies Act 1985 are themselves set to the maximum allowed under European law. Amendments to the Companies Act 1985 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-30">30 January 2004</phrase> and state that a company is 'small' if it satisfies at least two of the following criteria:</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.5/11" class="indent">A balance sheet total of not more than &pound;2.8 million</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.5/15">In addition, there may be other occasions where an alternative definition of a small firm may be appropriate. For example, the DTI's &quot;Small Firms Loan Guarantee&quot; is open to young firms with a turnover up to &pound;5.6 million to concentrate on those most likely to experience difficulties raising debt finance and to simplify eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.5/16">The DTI definition of a small firm for official statistics publications, such as the SME Statistics for the UK, is a business having between 0 and 49 employees.

	<p pid="b.200W.2/2">In assessing the applications, the EDC team can draw upon expert advice from their colleagues in the Department's Offshore Environment and Decommissioning Directorate.

	<p pid="b.200W.2/3">The Department has established a Research Advisory Group (RAG), which brings together representatives from a number of Government Departments to co-ordinate the priorities for research work into the potential impact of offshore renewables projects. The results of this work will be available to Ministers in considering requests for consent from wind farm developers. The research is funded from a &pound;2.5 million budget held by the DTI, but this money is supplemented by contributions from other parties, for example, other Government Departments and the wind farm industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/4">DTI also facilitates a number of stakeholder groups which bring together the offshore renewable energy sector with environmental, navigation and fishing interests. These groups exist to consider how wind farms can be successfully integrated into the marine environment and provide evidence and analysis relevant to consent decisions.</p>

As reflected in my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's joint statement with President Lula, the UK remains committed to an ambitious, balanced, pro-development outcome to the round. We believe that all the main parties in the talks need to take bold steps to go beyond established negotiating positions to improve their offers on agricultural market access and domestic support, NAMA and services. Those offers must also take account of the needs of developing countries by delivering improved market access in both agricultural and non-agricultural goods that is comparably high, but in a balanced and proportionate manner, consistent with the principle of special and differential treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.214W.8/1">This Government have given an unprecedented high profile to tackling bullying and supporting those who have been bullied. Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti-bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying. Our anti-bullying work, including the anti-bullying Charter for Action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&mdash;for example prejudice&mdash;and to helping those who are bullied.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.8/2">As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on prejudice driven bullying. At the beginning of this month, we launched our new advice 'Bullying around racism, religion and culture; how to prevent it and what to do when it happens' as the first of this suite of materials. The advice is presented as a set of interactive web pages on the teachernet website and is being supported by a national programme of dissemination events. Feedback from schools and local authorities so far has been overwhelmingly positive. We will be following this with specific advice on countering homophobic bullying later in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.8/3">We have secured a very broad consensus, with all the teaching professional associations and the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) signing up to our Anti-Bullying Charter for Action. The Charter is a voluntary commitment to creating a school community where bullying is not tolerated. In 2006 we plan to share examples of where the Charter has been particularly well implemented with other schools so that they can learn from this best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.8/4">Through our work with the ABA, an organisation comprising over 65 leading anti-bullying charities and experts, we provide schools and local authorities with expert help to tackle bullying. The National Strategies' behaviour materials provide schools with support in reducing and responding to bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.8/5">We have put more adults than ever in our schools&mdash;teachers, classroom assistants, learning mentors, Connexions personal advisers, Behaviour and Education Support Teams and police officers&mdash;so that a wide range of people are available to help prevent and tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.8/6">Anti-bullying week continues to be a successful event with a large number of schools taking part in November 2005's activities through a wide variety of national and local events. There was a considerable amount of positive press coverage and this year over 325,000 anti-bullying wristbands were distributed.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.8/7">Our anti-bullying resource pack for schools &quot;Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, updated in 2000 and September 2002 will be revised and re-issued in the summer term 2006 to ensure schools have the most up-to-date information available on tackling bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.8/8">In addition the Department has recently launched the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource&mdash;an intervention to develop children's social, emotional and behavioural skills from Foundation Stage to Year 6. It is available to all primary schools and the evidence from the pilot suggests that it helps reduce bullying and promotes positive behaviour generally. It is an important arm of the Department's longer term policy to promote positive behaviour and attendance. The Department is hoping to build on the work carried out in primary schools by providing a similar whole school curriculum based resource for secondary schools (SEBS). At present the programme is in a very early pilot stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.2/1">We are aware of the importance of children drinking water during the school day and the benefits that it brings. The interactive Food in Schools Toolkit, published jointly by the Department of Health and DfES, provides a wide range of guidance, resources and interactive tools to inspire and support schools in taking a whole school approach to healthy eating and drinking, including water provision. The 'Water Provision' guidance supports schools in reviewing and improving current provision and promoting water consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/2">The Cross Departmental &quot;Healthy Living Blueprint&quot;, issued to all schools, brings together all government advice and examples of best practice about healthy eating and drinking in schools. It provides schools with advice on how to improve children's approach to food and drink and exercise, and shows how developing whole school approaches can help bring about significant improvements to the health of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/3">Healthy School Lunches guidance, published by the DfES, contains the Secretary of State's expectation that drinking water should be available to all pupils every day, free of charge. This view is mirrored in the 'Healthy Living Blueprint for Schools', which states that,</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;all pupils should have access to drinking water at all times at a number of points around the school, preferably not from taps in the toilets. Pupils should be permitted to carry water with them and consumption encouraged both in class and during break and lunch time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/5">The School Meals Review Panel (SMRP) made a reference to drinking water in recommendation 7 of their report&mdash;Turning the Tables: &quot;There should be easy access to free, fresh, chilled drinking water throughout the school day (paragraph 2.32)&quot;. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase> and the responses are being analysed.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/6">It is the responsibility of head teachers and school's governing bodies to decide how and when water should be made available. We consider that they are best placed to make these decisions in their role of having responsibility of the day to day running of the school and with their knowledge of the individual circumstances of their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="b.219W.8/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has an extensive range of support to meet the different types of learners' needs, this includes those who already hold a full level 2 qualification and would like to study at the same level. In 2006/07, unless the individual is within an exempt category, the assumed fee contribution of individuals will be 32.5 per cent. Consequently, the LSC will offer substantial financial support to repeat level 2 learners by funding 67.5 per cent. of the total cost of the tuition fees. Individuals can also benefit from access to discretionary learner support funds; this could include assistance with the costs of transport and child care. Also available is a commercial bank loan to support the costs of learning and there is access for all to information and advice through an integrated service. This includes information and advice through learndirect and through local nextstep services.</p>
	<p pid="b.219W.8/2">Those exempt from fees in further education are: 16&ndash;18-year-olds; unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance; those in receipt of income-based benefits; the unwaged dependants of those listed; and, asylum seekers in receipt of equivalent income-based benefit and their dependants.</p>

	<p pid="b.220W.2/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is responsible for identifying national and local learning and skills needs, and for setting and implementing strategies and plans for meeting those needs. Good information on labour market and skills trends is essential for the council's work in steering post-16 education and skills provision. In developing its plans the LSC takes account of a wide range of information about current and future skill needs, including the national employer skills survey, research into learner and employer views of learning, and data contained in the Working Futures 2004 to 2014 reports, commissioned by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA). The LSC is also required to consult and take account of the plans of other organisations, including local authorities and the regional development agencies, and, at the national level, sector skills councils help to identify the skills that are needed for each sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.2/2">Each year the LSC produces an annual statement of priorities. Plans are then formally reviewed throughout the year by the LSC's management group, and adjustments are made in the light of changing priorities if necessary. Changes to the LSC's internal organisation will further strengthen its research capacity, and ensure even more effective delivery against individual and employer needs at national, regional and local level.</p>

This has over 8,000 members, representing a very broad range of institutions, including the LSC national and local offices, universities, colleges, training providers, national and local government, policy organisations, local authorities, schools and research institutions. The aim of the newsletter and web pages is to provide easy access to up-to-date information on education, training and learning, including research and labour market information; and to enable the sharing of good practice in teaching and quality improvement between providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.5/4">The new LSC structure will enhance the LSC's ability to share best practice through the new partnership teams feeding into the regional structure. This will be strengthened with the development of regional quality improvement partnerships.</p>

The School Meals Review Panel report: Turning the Tables: Transforming School Food, concluded that the average cost of ingredients in primary schools was 48.5p; and in secondary schools was 59.8p. This shows that schools are already well on the way to meeting the Government's aspiration of helping schools to provide meals with ingredients costs of 50p for primary schools and 60p for secondary schools. In some cases, where they have already made significant improvements, schools are spending more than 50/60 pence.</p>

	<p pid="b.237W.5/1">Within the Liverpool, Riverside constituency the Granby ward is a designated priority ward because of its high level of unemployment and high concentration of ethnic minorities. According to the 2001 census, ethnic minorities made up 30.7 per cent. of the population (aged 16&ndash;74), and the overall rate of unemployment stood at 26.0 per cent. Across the constituency as a whole the overall rate of unemployment was 15.0 per cent. and 23.4 per cent. for ethnic minorities. The rate of inactivity was 51.7 per cent. overall and 57.2 per cent. for ethnic minorities. The latest benefit statistics (August 2005), show that there are 10,700 people receiving incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance and 10,400 income support claimants across the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.5/2">The Department looks at local information on deprivation, need and diversity to help target the services we deliver. We use this data to help us with our resources allocation across Jobcentre Plus. We give higher priority to wards with high levels of unemployment (one and a half times the national average) and high concentrations of ethnic minorities (three times the national average). Granby is one such ward.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.5/3">Tackling the problems of inner cities is central to meeting our aims of increasing prosperity and countering social exclusion. Our recently published Green Paper sets out our proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.250W.10/1">While the 2004 abortion statistics showed a slight increase in the abortion rate per 1,000 resident women aged 15&ndash;44, the under 18 and under 16 abortion rates decreased. In addition, more abortions were performed at an earlier gestation. The 2004 statistics are available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/11/75/74/04117574.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/11/75/74/04117574.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.250W.10/2">It is a key aim of the Government to reduce unintended pregnancy rates, as featured in both the sexual health and teenage pregnancy strategies, and provision of good quality contraceptive services are essential to achieve this. We are investing &pound;40 million over the next two years to improve access to contraceptive services. We have asked primary care trusts (PCTs) to complete a national questionnaire of contraceptive services. The results will inform the publication of best practice guidance by the Department and will help PCTs determine how best to meet gaps in local services. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has published guidance on long-acting methods of contraception which should raise awareness and usage of all the methods.</p>

	<p pid="b.256W.0/31">From October 2002, PCTs took over responsibility for community pharmacies from HAs. Thereforedata on the number of pharmacies in England with NHS contracts is broken down to HA level until 2001&ndash;02, and PCT level from 2002&ndash;03 onwards. The change from HAs to PCTs may have resulted in some boundary changes and this is reflected in the data.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.0/32">Information on the number of community pharmacies is collected from PCTs via the annual PHS1 data collection. The latest data available on General Pharmaceutical Services (1994&ndash;95 to 2004&ndash;05) was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.256W.0/33">The survey collects information on openings and closures of community pharmacies. Changes of address, relocations within the PCT are excluded. However, pharmacy minor relocations across PCT boundaries are included as an opening or closure as appropriate. Establishments that close under old ownership and re-open under new ownership within 10 days are regarded as staying open, even if the period between closing and opening straddles review periods.</p>

	<p pid="b.260W.2/1">The European Commission has indicated that it will bring forward discussion documents in spring 2006 to consult member states about the setting of maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The board of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has considered this issue and proposed a two-tier approach with the use of advisory labelling statements where levels exceed those based on a scientific risk assessment. The objective is for this approach to be promoted in meetings with the European Commission and member states and in discussions on future documents from the Commission for meetings with stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.260W.2/2">Letters have been written to health Ministers in all member states and relevant members of the European Parliament informing them of the approach agreed by the FSA Board. Departmental officials last discussed these issues with the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-03">3 March</phrase>. FSA officials met with officials at the Ministry for Health in the Netherlands on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. Both meetings provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on the United Kingdom's position for setting maximum safe levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>
	<p pid="b.260W.2/3">Meetings were held with the organisation, Consumers for Health Choice on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase> and with Which? on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.260W.2/4">The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will be carrying out the assessment of the dossiers submitted in accordance with the food supplements directive, and is prioritising dossiers for assessment. It is the responsibility of companies who have submitted the dossiers to provide additional information to EFSA. Until EFSA begins its assessment it is unclear as to what the impact on the market beyond 2009 will be. We are continuing to explore with the Commission what further flexibility may be available in the directive after 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.260W.2/5">Both initiatives by CODEX and the recent report from the World Health Organisation take into account the need for maximum levels to be set based on scientific risk assessment, and this approach underlies the approach proposed by the FSA. A formal assessment of the implications for setting maximum safe levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements following these publications has not been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.260W.2/6">The final outcome of this case from the World Trade Organisation has yet to be published. An assessment of the implications for the setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements following the interim report case in relation to barriers to trade in genetically modified organisms has not therefore been made.</p>

	<p pid="b.275W.3/2">The enhanced requirements for overseas doctors and dentists to obtain work permits do not have significant implications for national health service dental services. The only implications for dental services are where overseas dentists, from outside the European Union (EU), are seeking employment in the hospital or community dental services and where it will be necessary to show that there is no dentist from the United Kingdom or the wider EU dentist able to fill the post.</p>
	<p pid="b.275W.3/3">The great majority of dentists in England work as independent, self-employed contractors in primary care. In these cases, dentists from outside the EU, who have undertaken vocational training, will continue to be able to seek entry under the &quot;Person Intending to Establish Themselves in Business rules&quot; and are not affected by the enhanced requirements for work permits. A non-EU dentist who has not undertaken vocational training will require a work permit, but vocational dental practitioners are included on the Home Office's list of shortage occupations and will not be affected by the enhanced requirements announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.293W.2/2">This is summarised in a quarterly Statistical Release, the latest of which was published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March</phrase>. A supplementary table presents key information at local authority level, including outcomes of all decisions made between <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>, and numbers in temporary accommodation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.293W.2/4">The duty owed to a person accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. As an alternative to the provision of temporary accommodation some authorities arrange for households to remain in their current accommodation (homeless at home), until a settled solution becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="b.293W.2/5">Information is also collected separately by the department on the number of people who sleep rough, that is, those who are literally roofless on a single night. In April 2005 Manchester City Council carried out a count of rough sleepers and counted 7 persons sleeping rough. No information is available at constituency level and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

PPG3 set out the definition of previously-developed land for the purposes for planning for housing, derived from urban land uses based on the Land Use Change Statistics classification introduced in 1985 but not previously articulated in planning guidance. The proposed changes to PPG3 reflected in Annex A of draft PPS3 on definitions are not intended to affect the application of the definition of previously-developed land to current or former airfields.</p>

	<p pid="b.297W.0/1">The numbers of affordable homes provided (new build and acquisitions) for social rent on behalf of each English local authority since 1991&ndash;92 has been placed in the Library of the House. The table shows social rented dwellings funded by the Housing Corporation and through Local Authority Social Housing Grant. Information on local authority built social rent dwellings is shown by region only. Information for the financial year 1990&ndash;91 is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.297W.0/2">Since 1997 substantial additional resources have been made available for refurbishment to the social housing stock alongside new building. Building costs and land costs have also risen. We plan to provide 75,000 social rented properties over the three years 2004&ndash;05 to 2007&ndash;08. That is an additional 10,000 homes by 2007&ndash;08; a 50 per cent. increase on 2004&ndash;05. This extra provision will be achieved through a mix of new build and acquisition. In 2005/06 an estimated 20,000 social rented home will be provided through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme and Transitional local Authority Social Housing Grant. In addition the Government have provided significant additional resources for shared equity schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.297W.0/3">Planned annual housing requirements are developed as part of the Regional Spatial Strategies. The Government response to Kate Barker's Review outlined their ambition to increase housing delivery in England over the next decade to 200,000 net additions per year, from current delivery of around 150,000 net additions per year.</p>

	<p pid="b.308W.2/1">Drugs and alcohol-related crime are serious social problems and also contribute to the commission of other crimes. For this reason it is not always possible to determine whether a person is employed to deal with these matters specifically, as opposed to dealing with them as part of a wider issue, such as anti-social behaviour, or the support of the police. The units which are specifically tasked with addressing these issues, or which deal with directly related matters are staffed as shown in the table, but civil servants within other parts of the Home Office may also have a role to play in reducing drug and alcohol related crime and its wider effects. Additionally the criminal justice aspects of drug misuse form only one facet of the Drug Strategy and civil servants in other government departments and the government offices also play an important role in reducing the harm caused by drug and alcohol misuse. In some cases the staff within a unit can be identified as working specifically on drug or alcohol related-crime issues. Where this is possible the figure given is that of the staff so identified not the total compliment of the unit.</p>

	<p pid="b.309W.8/1">The decision by the Legal Services Commission (LSC) to withdraw specialist support funding should have a minimal impact on the workload and case management of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.8/2">Specialist support services form part of the LSC special projects budget that was reviewed in the summer 2005 against a number of criteria. The LSC concluded that as specialist support services provide advice in civil categories of law to other legal advisors and not directly to clients, this did not represent the most cost-effective approach to meet the increasing need for front-line advice. The LSC has therefore decided not to continue funding for specialist support from July 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.310W.2/1">I am not aware the Home Department have had any discussions with any of the organisations mentioned on this subject. The Legal Services Commission (LSC) advise that the impact of the withdrawal of specialist support funding is expected to be minimal. A rapid expansion of the LSC's supplier base in the immigration and asylum category justified a specialist support mechanism for advisers at the time of its introduction but since then the quality of immigration and asylum advice has increased substantially. The LSC has introduced the Immigration and Asylum Accreditation Scheme, which involves the testing and accreditation of individual advisers, and which became compulsory from August 2005. Higher quality standards have obviated the need for specialist support beyond that which will still be available through the instruction of specialist counsel in a small number of specific and complex cases.</p>

It is sufficient for a detainee to claim torture for rule 35(3) to be triggered. Such information may not always be referred to the Management of Detained Cases Unit (MODCU) given that MODCU take responsibility for detained cases after the 28th day of detention. MODCU do, however, have responsibility for managing all cases relating to the detention of families with children from the outset. Caseworkers are required to consider what action may be necessary in the light of such information. Records of the number of cases referred under rule 35(3) and details of what happened in those cases is not held centrally and could only be obtained through examination of individual files at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.312W.6/4">The Personal Identification Project (PIP) is in pilot operation at present and the estimated costs will depend on the outcome of the pilot and full roll out across the UKPS offices. The main impact of PIP is in staffing costs; these are part of the overall UKPS passport examiner costs and PIP is to be fully integrated into normal business processes. The predicted cost impacts are also built into the above 2006&ndash;07 unit cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.312W.6/5">The cost estimates for second generation biometric passports incorporating fingerprints will partly depend on the timing of their introduction. While our current assumption is that they will be issued prior to the introduction of ID cards, no final decision has been made on the timing as this depends on the ID Cards Bill, implementation timetable of the EU Passport Regulation and the Government's challenge to its scope. Publishing at this stage would put at risk the ability to secure value for money in negotiations with potential suppliers so these costs are commercial in confidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.313W.5/1">A wide range of measures are already in place to deal with visitors involved in drug trafficking and the supply of contraband. Around 25 prisons have introduced biometrics of visitors with a further 20 planned. The tracking of visitors using biometric technology will provide establishments with greater assurance as to the identity of visitors and assist in enforcing the measures imposed on those visitors found to have been smuggling drugs and contraband.</p>

	<p pid="b.313W.8/1">There is no current system for sending 'intervention teams' into prisons to improve performance. As the National Offender Management Service develops its commissioning arrangements, it will continue to look primarily to line management&mdash;whether in the public sector Prison Service or the contracted sector&mdash;to remedy under-performance, reinforcing or replacing prison managers as necessary. Under service level agreements and contracts the Regional Offender Managers may require providers to produce a specific recovery plan to address particular difficulties.</p>

The current suite of Prison Service Performance Standards provides a vital qualitative dimension to the performance management framework for prisons. Performance targets provide essential quantitative feedback.

Information prior to 2001 is not available and the contribution of CSH to staffing availability was not collated for 2001, 2002 and 2003. Therefore the stated shortfalls for these years show a higher shortfall than was the case. Data is not collated centrally on contracted prisons.</p>

	<p pid="b.324W.2/1">The Home Secretary set out the Government's priorities for the Serious Organised Crime Agency in a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-09">9 June 2005</phrase> to the Chairman-designate, a copy of which was laid before the House. The letter expresses the Government's belief that all serious organised crime should be tackled on the basis of an intelligence-led approach which prioritises those criminal networks and markets doing the most harm. It also explains that on the basis of work done so far to analyse harm, we continue to see Class A drugs and organised immigration crime, in that order, as the top strategic priorities. The Serious Organised Crime Agency will be expected to focus the bulk of its effort in these two areas but will also be expected to devote resources to the other threats detailed in the UK Threat Assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.324W.11/1">Three accredited sex offender treatment programmes were introduced in the National Probation Service in 2002&ndash;03 and are currently subject to an evaluation study. The study is based on psychometric information which measures statistically significant change in factors most closely linked to offending. Results are due later this year. However, it is too early for reconviction studies to be completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.11/2">The Prison Service offers six accredited programmes for sex offenders, which are provided in different combinations according to the risk and need of the individual offender. The Core Programme, for medium risk offenders, was evaluated in 2003 and the findings indicated that the programme significantly reduced sexual and violent recidivism rates. This was particularly true with medium risk offenders but the programme did not impact on recidivism for high risk offenders (HORF 205). Psychometric evaluations have been completed on most other Sex Offender Treatment Programmes and these routinely show that participants improve in terms of their attitudes and other psychological variables that are known to predict recidivism. The Prison Service is currently designing further outcome studies to evaluate the success of its treatment programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.325W.2/1">The three core sex offender treatment programmes provided by the national probation service, all cover attachment theory although in different ways. One programme is explicit in teaching attachment theory to group members, while the other two take a more implicit approach and address the offender's attachment styles based upon a structured assessment of the offender's risk and need.</p>
	<p pid="b.325W.2/2">An important treatment target for all three programmes is to address how sex offenders relate to others and how this may need to change in future to reduce risk. This will include specific work throughout each of the three programmes on life skills including the social and emotional management of relationships, together with self management skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.325W.2/3">In the Prison Service, treatment programmes for sex offenders, attachment theory is the basis for modules of the Rolling Sex Offender Treatment Programme (for low risk offenders) and the Extended Sex Offender Treatment Programme (for high risk offenders). In both programmes, participants are taught the basics of attachment theory, helped to identify their individual attachment styles, and develop and practice strategies for moving towards a more secure attachment style. Additionally, all the Prison Service Sex Offender Treatment Programmes involve group work, which, as with the probation service, carries the benefit of offering an opportunity for group members to learn how to interact positively with one another.</p>

The FDA, Prospect and the Public and Commercial Services Union are represented on the Departmental Whitley Council. The Immigration Service Union, the fourth recognised union is not represented on the Departmental Whitley Council. Separate collective bargaining and consultative procedures exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.2/2">In the Prison Service separate collective bargaining and consultative arrangements are in place in respect of the Prison Governors Association. As far as collective bargaining on pay is concerned, for the majority of members of the Prison Officers Association and the Prison Governors Association pay is not determined through collective bargaining, but through recommendations of the Pay Review Body to which all parties are able to provide both written and oral evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.2/3">A number of Home Office sponsored non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) such as Centrex, the body responsible for police training, the Police and Information Technology Organisation and the Youth Justice Board have retained Whitley structures. Other NDPBs have put in place separate collective bargaining and consultative arrangements. For example the collective bargaining framework of the Commission for Racial Equality is set out in their Joint Negotiating Committee Constitution. Bodies such as the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Independent Police Complaints Commission formally recognise the Public and Commercial Services Union for collective bargaining purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.2/4">The Community Development Foundation (CDF) has a procedural agreement with Amicus who have sole collective bargaining rights for CDF staff. The Security Industry Authority does not recognise any union for the purpose of collective bargaining.

	<p pid="b.327W.2/1">The Youth Justice Board developed National Standards for Youth Justice (2004) for both community and secure settings. It has also developed a full set of Key Elements of Effective Practice (KEEPs) which articulate, on the basis of research, key features of effective practice against which YOTs and Local Authority Secure Children's Homes (LASCHs) are required to assess performance, which is then subject to validation by the YJB.

The first step of this will be an initial feasibility study with the full study commencing during the latter part of 2006. The YJB, in negotiating contracts with secure providers, regularly requests that efficiency savings be made on bed prices and also seeks to control price increases.</p>

Child labour is a continuing human rights concern in Brazil, which the Government takes extremely seriously. We raise human rights issues, including the need to tackle child labour, with the Brazilian Government, bilaterally and with our European partners. In addition we fund a number of projects in the human rights field in Brazil. These include working with local partners to combat torture, improve the police and penal systems and address the use of small arms in the slum areas of Rio de Janeiro. We also support community work in Rio de Janeiro aimed at encouraging young people to find alternatives to involvement in violent and organised crime. Our work enjoys the full support of the Brazilian Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.334W.8/2">We will not issue an export licence if approval would be inconsistent with national embargoes observed by the UK. The then Foreign Secretary's (Lord Hurd) and the then Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister's (Tony Lloyd) statements of <phrase class="date" code="1993-03-01">1 March 1993</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1998-09-28">28 September 1998</phrase> respectively, set out our approach in respect of Iran. We will not issue licences for the export to Iran of goods or technology on the Military or Nuclear List, except for goods essential for the safety of civil aircraft and air traffic control systems and certain radioactive substances for medical use. No licences will be approved for any equipment where there is knowledge or reason to suspect that it will go to a military end-user or be used for military purposes. On very rare occasions and with parliamentary agreement, exceptions are made where denying an export or gift would be against the spirit of the embargo.</p>
	<p pid="b.334W.8/3">In 2005, we agreed to license a gift of 50 sets of body armour to the Iranian Anti-Narcotics Police who work with HM Revenue and Customs officers to fight the trafficking of heroin and opiates. In 2003, we agreed to license the export of 250 sets of night vision goggles for use against heroin smugglers; the export was paid for by the United Nations Drugs Control Programme. On each occasion, notice of our intention to license these exports was placed before Parliament and no objections were raised. Details were also recorded in written ministerial statements of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-15">15 March 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-03-15.13WS"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 13&ndash;14WS</phrase>, and <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-19">19 May 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-05-19.30WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 30WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.334W.8/4">We assess that around 60 per cent. of all heroin entering the UK transits Iran. Iran is actively involved in the fight against drug trafficking and seizes far more opiates than any other country in the world. We have regular constructive co-operation with Iran on counter-narcotics.</p>

	<p pid="b.339W.6/1">I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to her on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-03-17.2532W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 2532W</phrase>. We assessed that the risk of our monitors being kidnapped had increased in recent months. In December 2005, we learned of plans by militant groups to kidnap the monitors. This was consistent with the sharp rise we had seen in kidnaps elsewhere in the Occupied Territories, which have included British nationals. In late 2005, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) kidnapped two teachers, demanding the release of Ahmed Sa'adat, one of the detainees. It was also increasingly clear that the Palestinian Authority (PA) were unwilling to take any action against those involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.339W.6/2">We requested that the monitors and six detainees were moved to another area of the prison to provide additional security for our monitors. I refer my hon. Friend to a copy of the letter we have placed in the Library of the House. However, this was not implemented. With the Palestinian Legislative election in January the risks to UK and US monitors increased further. During the election campaigns, the prisoners repeatedly, and inaccurately, accused the UK and US of illegally detaining them. After Ahmed Sa'adat was elected, PFLP and Hamas called for the release of political prisoners. There was a heightened risk of the PA unilaterally releasing the prisoners. The Government of Israel had made public commitments not to allow the prisoners to go free and we were concerned the monitors could be caught up in an arrest operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.339W.6/3">This information, plus the knowledge that the current location of our monitors was unsafe, all contributed to the decision to withdraw. The failure of the PA to address our concerns despite repeated attempts left us in an untenable position. Ultimately the safety of our personnel had to take priority.</p>

As none was forthcoming, the monitors withdrew at a time judged to provide the greatest security to our monitors.</p>

	<p pid="b.345W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/2">The key step in improving the strategic financial reserves of the UN has been the establishment of the new Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), consisting of a pre-existing $50 million loan facility and a substantial new grant facility. It was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March</phrase>, with contributions to the grant facility totalling $255 million from 38 donors. The UK is the single largest donor so far, contributing &pound;40 million ($70 million). The CERF will be under the control of the UN Secretary-General, managed by the UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator with administrative support from the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It will allow UN humanitarian agencies to begin responding to a sudden crisis within a few days, rather than having to wait for donor funds to arrive, and also to respond to ongoing under-funded crises by ensuring essential humanitarian activities take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/3">DFID also provides core funding to key UN agencies which may be used to establish or strengthen strategic asset and surge capacity. For example, DFID is providing &pound;19 million core funding this year to support the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), including support to the Plan of Action for Strengthening Emergency Response Capacity. In 2005, we provided &pound;500,000 to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the establishment of the Protection Surge Capacity programme (PROCAP), which provides a roster of qualified and experienced protection officers for rapid deployment. DFID has provided nearly &pound;25 million over the past five years to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to improve emergency preparedness and response planning, supply and logistics, and staff training.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/4">DFID is currently providing a core contribution of &pound;5 million per annum to the World Food Programme , of which half will be used to enhance the WFP's effectiveness in humanitarian preparedness and response. We contribute &pound;2 million per annum to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Health Action in Crisis programme to improve the WHO's performance in preparing for, responding to and recovering from health aspects of crises around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/5">DFID holds stocks of relief items in the UK, Dubai and the USA that may be used to further enhance the United Nations emergency response. Together with existing UN global stockholdings funded in part by UK contributions, such material support can be dispatched at short notice to the immediate affected areas. In addition to relief items such as tents, plastic sheeting and blankets, DFID provides specialised equipment such as communications, IT material and vehicles. The UK is a member of the International Humanitarian Partnership consortium providing surge capacity to enable the United Nations to respond rapidly through the provision of specialist teams and material. DFID supports UN Search and Rescue capability through agreements with UK Fire Brigades and specialist UK non-governmental organisations (NGO)s.</p>

	<p pid="b.346W.2/1">The UK supports development of an effective rapid deployment capability in support of UN peacekeeping, and this was endorsed by the leaders of all UN member states at the World Summit in September 2005. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) is developing three options: the provision of a rapid deployment capability by regional organisations; the provision of a short-term capability by one or more individual countries and the cooperation arrangements between UN missions in the same region.</p>
	<p pid="b.346W.2/2">Our Mission to the UN is supporting DPKO's work on all these options through provision of bilateral UK advice and participation in a consultation group of interested member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.346W.2/3">We are closely involved in the development of regional rapid reaction capabilities. Within the EU, we have been at the forefront of the development of the EU's rapid response capabilities. In particular, the UK continues to take a leading role in the development of the EU Battlegroups initiative which should reach full operational capability in 2007. While an EU capability, Battlegroups can also be deployed at short notice and on a short term basis in response to a request from the UN.</p>
	<p pid="b.346W.2/4">In the African Union (AU), the joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence Conflict Prevention Pools are funding technical and financial assistance in setting up the AU's African Standby Force.</p>
	<p pid="b.346W.2/5">Progress has also been made in the area of cooperation arrangements between UN missions. The UK has supported recent Security Council decisions authorising the immediate redeployment of a force from the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) to respond to the deteriorating security situation in C&ocirc;te d'lvoire, and for provision to be made within UNMIL for a rapidly deployable contingency force for security of the Sierra Leone Special Court.</p>

	<p pid="b.353W.9/1">A sterling stamp duty or currency transaction taxation is a long-established idea that has re-emerged in international discussions on how to raise development financing. The Government have studied the technical implications of this proposal carefully, and after serious consideration of the proposal it has reached the view that such a tax could not be practically enforceable given the multiple avenues for avoidance, and the consequently heavy regulatory and implementation costs such a tax would require. The UK Government remain fully committed to the millennium development goals, and has set a timetable to reach the target of 0.7 per cent. Overseas Development Assistance-GNI by 2013. With the International Finance Facility, the equivalent of 0.7 per cent. ODA-GNI could be achieved as early as 2008&ndash;09.</p>

There are considerable training and development opportunities: technical training programmes are offered to develop and refresh technical knowledge, there is a Dstl Chartership Scheme accredited to eight professional institutes or societies which is open to all staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.2/2">Additionally, staff are allowed time off to undertake further study such as a MSc or PhD and relevant tuition fees are paid by Dstl. There are links with five universities for research purposes and to ensure that knowledge is current; these also encourage staff to spend time in each others' laboratories. Secondments are available to other areas of MOD, OGDs, UK Industry and international laboratories. There is an internal symposium held annually to encourage networking and debate on topical research areas. There is a Scheme for Technical Education and Professional Support to encourage networking, conferences and events for junior staff and a Fellowship Scheme which gives recognition to senior staff who are acknowledged as national or international experts in their field.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.2/3">Also in addition to the normal range of civil service terms and conditions, such as the civil service pension arrangements and a generous annual leave allowance, Dstl has extended its flexible working arrangements and encourages alternative working practices such as home working wherever possible. Dstl is continually reviewing working conditions for staff. At present a review is being undertaken of its internal career structure which may result in the definition of a more structured career path for staff in both research and managerial roles.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.2/4">It should be noted that both informal and formal staff surveys indicate that staff are attracted by the challenging research problems presented by Dstl and the availability of excellent scientific facilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.363W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence's principal advisers in the Defence Evaluation Research Agency (DERA) Public Private Partnership, and in the sale of shares to Carlyle, were the accountancy Limited Liability Partnership Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC), our legal advisers Simmons &amp; Simmons, and the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) for investment banking advice on the actual sale. A number of other advisers were also utilised to a limited extent on specific issues, such as the Government Actuaries Department on pensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.363W.8/2">A potential conflict of interest was declared by PWC when a separate part of that organisation was selected by Carlyle to advise them, but the Ministry of Defence approved the arrangement, having received all necessary assurances from PWC that appropriate firewalls were in place. PWC's involvement for the Ministry of Defence was largely confined to the pre-vesting phase of the DERA Public Private Partnership, i.e. up to summer 2001 when options were being evaluated and DERA was being re-structured and split into QinetiQ and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). From late 2001&mdash;for the actual sale of QinetiQ, and well before Carlyle appointed PWC&mdash;MOD's financial advisers were the investment banking firm UBS. PWC did provide one person, again under strict firewalls principles, to advise MOD in the final phase to prove additional transaction advice on the accounting detail of the sale to Carlyle.</p>

Officials have started work to prepare for these decisions, but this work is still at an early stage and Ministers have not yet begun to consider the position in any detail. It is therefore rather too early to speculate on the likely conclusions of this work.</p>
