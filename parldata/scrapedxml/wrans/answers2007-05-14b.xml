	<p pid="b.472W.9/2">The UK Government's climate change policies are based on limiting global mean temperature rise to 2&deg;<sup>( )</sup>C above pre-industrial levels. This mirrors the European Union's 2&deg; C stabilisation target.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.9/3">The Government agree with the European Commission that, to meet that objective, the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has to remain well below 550 parts per million volume carbon dioxide equivalent. This will require global greenhouse gas emissions to fall by between 15 and 50 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2050, with reductions in developed countries of between 60 and 80 per cent. The UK's target of a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is consistent with this approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.473W.5/1">Very limited information is available about the number of outdoor patio heaters in use in the UK. DEFRA's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) has estimated that there are approximately 630,000 in use in the domestic sector and between 26,000 and 105,000 in the hospitality sector (pubs, restaurants and hotels).</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.5/2">Making reasonable assumptions about fuel, power rating, and level of usage, the MTP estimates annual energy consumption to be approximately 670 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the domestic sector and between 280 and 1,100 GWh in the hospitality sector. The corresponding annual carbon dioxide emissions are 140,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in the domestic sector and between 60,000 and 240,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in the in the hospitality sector. Further information is available from the MTP's website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.473W.5/4">The Government are committed to raising product standards and encouraging people to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. However, as a member of the European single market, the Government cannot by itself introduce mandatory minimum standards for appliances on the basis of their energy efficiency as it would inhibit their free trade. In order to set such standards we need to persuade other member states that this is necessary across the EU. The Eco-Design for Energy Using Products (EUP) Framework Directive provides a streamlined and effective route for setting such requirements. The European Commission has currently identified a list of 20 priority products for action. At present, patio heaters are not on this list.</p>

	<p pid="b.477W.9/1">The Renewables Obligation is the Government's key mechanism for encouraging the generation of electricity from renewable sources. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is used to store the carbon emissions produced during the generation of electricity by fossil fuel generating stations. This technology is therefore not eligible under the RO as it does not involve the production of electricity from renewable sources. However, the Government are supportive of it and announced in the 2007 Budget that the UK would run a competition for full scale demonstration of CCS. We are also pressing for CCS to be recognised in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.482W.8/2">The International Atomic Energy Agency has not proposed the creation of an international nuclear fuel bank. It has, however, asked Governments and interested organisations to share ideas about how the risks of the proliferation of sensitive nuclear technologies through the international development of nuclear energy could be prevented. The UK &quot;Enrichment Bond&quot;, which has been placed in the Library of the House, is currently being considered by the IAEA, with a number of other proposals. The IAEA is due to bring out a paper in June, taking into account the various suggestions already made, which Ministers will have an opportunity to see.</p>

	<p pid="b.484W.5/1">Promoting engagement with science and enhancing the science learning experience in schools are key objectives behind the commitments set out in the Government's science strategy document &quot;The Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004 to 2014 Next Steps&quot;, and are supported by the Department and the Department for Education and Skills (DfES).</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.5/2"><i> (a)</i> The Department provided &pound;1 million, as part of a &pound;2 million joint DfES/DTI funding package, to science centres in 2004 to 2006 to help alleviate short term funding problems. Between November 2006 and March 2008, we are providing &pound;500,000 to Ecsite UK, the science centre umbrella body, to fund a &pound;750,000 project to help science centres become financially viable. Specifically, this project aims to enable the science centres to:</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.5/3" class="indent">demonstrate the impact and the added-value they deliver;</p>

	<p pid="b.484W.5/7"><i> (b)</i> OSI works closely with DfES to promote the teaching of science in schools, and drive forward the recommendations set out in the 2006 STEM programme report. OSI has also continued to fund a number of related projects and activities to develop effective public engagement in science and technology through a number of key mechanisms:</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.5/8" class="italic"> Promoting public engagement in science</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.5/9" class="indent">Over &pound;1.5 million has already been committed to the Sciencewise programme. More than 10 projects on a range of critical science challenges, including brain science, stem cells research, and nanotechnology have been supported. Sciencehorizons is the first ever mass public engagement programme designed to get the nation talking about how science and technology could affect our lives in the next 15 to 20 years. OSI is also undertaking work to develop an Expert Resource Centre for Public Dialogue on Science and Innovation (ERC), for launch in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.5/10" class="indent">&pound;280,000 in 2006-07 was given to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA) for organisation of National Science and Engineering Week (held in March this year). A grant of &pound;100,000 enabled over 300 'hard-to-reach' schools to participate, many for the first time. &pound;200,000 was also provided for the 2006 BA Festival of Science.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.5/11" class="indent">We are also actively encouraging other organisations to develop and fund their own activities in this area, and we particularly welcome the recent announcement of the four-year Beacons for Public Engagement pilot programme, funded by Research Councils UK, the higher education funding councils and the Wellcome Trust. The national academies (British Academy, The Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Society) receive part of their funding as grant-in-aid from my Department.

	<p pid="b.484W.5/13" class="indent">As part of a &pound;6.7 million programme funded by DTI, the Science, Engineering, Technology and Maths Network (SETNET) runs the science engineering ambassadors (SEAs) scheme, in which young scientists act as role models for school students. There are now more than 13,000 ambassadors representing a variety of industries stimulating scientific interest among school children which aims to have 18,000 SEAs in place by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.5/14" class="indent">Funding for the BA also goes to support their CREST award scheme, which offers young people the opportunity to take part directly in scientific research and engineering projects. In 2006-07 this funding amounted to &pound;220,000.</p>

This represents a very small proportion of prisoners who enter the prison system on an annual basis. It is likely to exclude those on remand, those committed for fine default and those sentenced for less than one year. Almost 70 per cent. of those sentenced to custody have literacy and numeracy deficits in essential and key skills. Given the link between low attainment and criminal behaviour, the priority for the Prison Service is to address first-level educational and vocational needs.

	<p pid="b.495W.2/1">The UK supports the Afghan Government's policy on opium poppy eradication as set out in its National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS). The NDCS states that eradication should be Afghan-led and targeted where there is access to legal rural livelihoods. To ensure that eradication is targeted properly, the UK has helped the Afghan authorities to map those areas where people have access to legal rural livelihoods. These target areas are determined by a set of criteria that take into account a wide range of factors. In addition to rural livelihoods projects, the criteria include: distance to markets, water availability, agricultural diversity, population density, extension of government, access to non-farm income and credit. Non-targeted eradication is less likely to achieve the NDCS's objective of achieving a sustainable reduction in cultivation.</p>

However, some nations have been unwilling to begin negotiations on such a treaty without further progress on their own priorities, even where these are issues that do not command consensus at the CD. In particular, China has previously stated that they are not willing to begin negotiations on an FMCT until their concerns over the prevention of an arms race in space are sufficiently addressed. In March this year the current six presidencies of the CD tabled a proposal designed to address the concerns of all member states and allow negotiations on an FMCT to commence without further delay.

	<p pid="b.508W.2/1">MOD has three initiatives to remove landmines and explosive remnants of war. These three projects are judged to be highly successful: the first involves 98 explosive ordnance disposal and de-mining personnel for the Kosovo Protection Corps. The second is the Bosnian project, which on completion will have destroyed over 10,000 tons of ammunition. And the third is the International Mine Action and Training Centre in Kenya, which has trained some 3,800 African and international personnel in de-mining and associated skills. Wider initiatives by the UK, funded by DFID at &pound;10 million per year are targeted at the world's poorest nations which have reduced casualties significantly.</p>

	<p pid="b.520W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/2">The Government want everyone to achieve their potential at work, and recognise that women from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups may face additional barriers to doing so, because of a combination of factors related to gender, ethnicity and in some cases, religious belief. While black and Asian women are increasingly well qualified, and there are many successful women from these communities, there is compelling evidence that many black and minority ethnic women do find it harder to get into employment, to progress at work, and to be paid fairly.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/3">Measures introduced by the Government to support parents and carers in the workplace and to eliminate discrimination benefit women from all backgrounds equally. These include improved maternity rights, better access to child care, and the right for parents of young or disabled children and carers of adults to request flexible working. In addition, the Government remain committed to ensuring that the legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment on the grounds of sex, race and religion or belief is properly enforced, and believes that the establishment of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights will assist in addressing instances of multiple discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/4">Further, black and Asian women will benefit from progress on steps taking place across Government to address the gender pay gap and its underlying causes. These are set out in &quot;Towards a Fairer Future, Implementing the Women and Work Commission&quot; recommendations, published in April this year. More details can be found in that report of a number of initiatives specifically designed to benefit women from minority ethnic communities in finding and progressing in employment, including the Cities Strategy; Partners' Outreach; Work Search Premium; the Deprived Areas Fund; work with employers on recruitment and progression arising from a report by the National Employment Panel's Business Commission; employer-led Fair Cities pilots in Birmingham, Leeds/Bradford and Brent, London; and a range of regional activities. The Ethnic Minority Employment Task Force is taking a pro-active strategic approach to addressing the particular challenges faced by minority ethnic and minority religious women, and will shortly be reporting back to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to propose a focused set of priorities around procurement and employer engagement &mdash;including tackling employer discrimination, not just in recruitment to the workplace but also in progression through it.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/5">In the public sector, the duties to promote race and gender equality and to eliminate unlawful discrimination and harassment on these grounds will ensure that black and Asian women are not disadvantaged in the workplace.</p>

	<p pid="b.525W.2/3">The Pension Service has undertaken a wide range of steps to encourage eligible pensioners to claim pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/4">We have written to everyone who we believe may have an entitlement to pension credit, encouraging them to apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/5">In addition, we are improving our service and encouraging take up by enabling new customers who call to claim their state pension to also apply for pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in a single call if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/6">The Pension Service Local Service offers face-to-face visits to the most vulnerable pensioners during which full benefit entitlement checks are carried out. One million home visits were carried out during 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/7">The Pension Service Local Service is continuing to work very closely with local partners (including local authorities and voluntary organisations such as Help the Aged and Age Concern) to maximise take up of pension credit. We are widening the scope of partnership activity and expanding our current work programme with key utilities and other major companies whose customers include likely eligible non- recipients of pension credit. These activities are being supported by national press advertising to maintain the high profile of pension credit. Local marketing and media campaigns will be targeted in those regions and areas where there are relatively high numbers of eligible non-recipients.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/8" class="italic"> Winter Fuel Payment</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/9">Winter fuel payments are made to people aged 60 or over (men and women). Over 99 per cent. of the payments are made automatically without the need to claim. Some people who are not in receipt of a benefit administered by DWP need to claim. Each year we send claim forms automatically to everyone whom we know from departmental records will be aged 60 by the end of the qualifying week and for whom we have a current address. An extensive publicity campaign begins in July and includes advertisements in both regional and national newspapers.</p>

	<p pid="b.528W.2/1">Over 99 per cent. of winter fuel payments are made automatically without the need for a claim as we hold sufficient information on our benefit systems to identify the vast majority of eligible people. Some people who are not in receipt of a benefit administered by DWP need to claim. Each year we send claim forms automatically to everyone who is not in receipt of a benefit administered by DWP, but whom we know from departmental records, will be aged 60 by the end of the qualifying week and where we have a current address. We also run an extensive publicity campaign which begins in July and includes advertisements in both regional and national newspapers. Information on winter fuel payments is also included in a number of leaflets including &quot;Are you over 50?&quot; and &quot;The Pensioner's Guide&quot;, as well as a specific winter fuel payment leaflet and on The Pension Service website at</p>

	<p pid="b.528W.2/3">Claims for the years 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 may still be made. Payments were originally made during these years to people receiving specified benefits only. Following a change in the rules in 2000, payments became available to people aged 60 or over regardless of whether they were receiving a benefit. This also applied to the earlier years and therefore no time limits were imposed for claims for these years. Time limits for claiming winter fuel payments apply from winter 2000-01 onwards and for people who need to claim, claim forms are available from July for the oncoming winter. In order to be successful, claims must be submitted by <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March</phrase> the following year. Any claims received after the cut off date will be disallowed. There is a right of appeal against any disallowance decision.</p>

	<p pid="b.531W.3/1">The Churches Conservation Trust has been classified as a non-departmental public body for the purposes of its relations with Government, on account of a number of the Trust's characteristics and the nature of its relationship with Government. In its response to Lord Sharman's Report on Audit and Accountability in Central Government (Cm 5456&mdash;March 2002), the Government agreed that all non-departmental public bodies should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This was in line with the practice that had been adopted since 1997. Since 2003, the Treasury has used its powers under section 25(6) of the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000 to give the Comptroller and Auditor General statutory audit responsibility for more than 30 NDPBs and this is the legislation it will use in the case of the Churches Conservation Trust.</p>

	<p pid="b.534W.2/2"><i> </i>According to the current legislation industrial buildings allowances (IBA) can be applied for by the person with a relevant interest who incurs expenditure on the construction of an industrial building once it is brought into use for the purposes of a qualifying trade. The main qualifying trades are manufacturing, processing, certain storage businesses and transport undertakings. However, as announced in this year's Budget this particular allowance is to be phased out by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2011</phrase>. As a result, it will not have any potential application to the construction and legacy use of the Olympic Park.</p>

	<p pid="b.544W.3/2">In 1997-98, agreement was reached to collect and publish the recorded crime data on a financial year basis. This was to reflect the movement to an increasingly performance-related culture. Police forces were already publishing financial year data in their chief constables' annual reports and the decision to move also removed the unnecessary effort by the police of providing calendar year data centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.3/3">The annual Command Paper &quot;Criminal Statistics, England and Wales&quot; which contains data on convictions, has been published on a calendar year basis for many years and there has been no decision to change this. Since the decision to publish recorded crime data on a financial year basis, there has not been a demand to align the period covered by both publications.</p>

The scheme is sponsored by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and is based on a model piloted by Sussex police. ACPO advise that since the scheme was rolled out nationally in 2006, there have been no activations and consequently no evaluation has taken place. I understand from the National Policing Improvement Agency that Child Rescue Alert will be included as part of the NPIA's bi-annual review of the National Missing Persons Guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.547W.3/1">The Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) Scheme was implemented in all police forces in England and Wales in 2004 under provisions in the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Prior to this the police did not have the option of issuing on the spot fines for minor offences, having instead to issue a caution, reprimand or final warning or refer offenders to the court system to bring them to justice. Data from the Penalty Notices for Disorder database held by the Office for Criminal Justice reform show that 210,120 PNDs were issued to offenders from January 2004 to December 2005. Provisional data for 2006 show that a further 192,583 were issued in that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.547W.3/2">Data on the number of people issued with more than one PND are not held centrally and no estimate has been made. However, police forces do keep records of PND recipients on local databases which help inform local operational decisions. Forces are also required to enter details of those PNDs issued for recordable offences on the Police National Computer; however not all PND offences are recordable.</p>

	<p pid="b.549W.5/1">Effective policing is delivered by police officers, police staff and police community support officers. Decisions on their number in each force is a matter for the Chief Officer of Police. In December 2006 I suspended the system of financial penalties attached to the Crime Fighting Fund to provide greater flexibility for forces to plan their workforce. It is too early to assess the impact of this decision, but we are monitoring officer numbers on a quarterly basis and will intervene if there are genuine performance concerns that are clearly linked to a fall in officer numbers.

	<p pid="b.567W.3/1">It is accepted parliamentary practice that proposals for changes in the law on abortion have come from Back-Bench Members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes. The Government have no plans to change the law on abortion.</p>
	<p pid="b.567W.3/2">The guideline &quot;The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion&quot; issued by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (2004) recommends that when ultrasound scanning is undertaken, it should be done in a setting and manner sensitive to the woman's situation. For most abortions, when scanning is undertaken, the screen is turned away and the vast majority of women do not request to see the image.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.9/1">The Chief Medical Officer's (CMO's) expert Advisory Group on &quot;chlamydia trachomatis&quot; was set up in November 1996 to advise on the issues associated with screening for genital chlamydial infection. Its report, published in 1998, concluded that screening and effective management of chlamydial infection would result in considerable health benefit. The annual cost of chlamydia and its consequences in the United Kingdom is estimated to be more than &pound;100 million. We are not aware of any updates on this estimate.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.9/2">As a result of the findings in this report a phased multi-faceted opportunistic strategy began in England in April 2003. Mathematical modelling has since confirmed the effectiveness of this approach. Other countries which introduced screening activities before England have seen reductions in both the prevalence of chlamydia and its complications (pelvic infection rates and ectopic pregnancies) highlighting the huge potential of the national chlamydia screening programme on the sexual health of young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.9/3">No target has been set for chlamydia screening in 2006-07. For the first time a local delivery plan target has been introduced for 2007-08. Strategic health authorities have submitted plans to screen at least 15 per cent. of their population aged 15-24 by March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.581W.0/1">There are no specific powers in the Postal Services Act (2000) or in the medicines legislation administered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an Executive agency of the Department to control direct mail advertising from the Channel Islands.

	<p pid="b.581W.0/3">When looking at referrals the medicines borderline section firstly assesses it to see if there is any risk to public safety from the products. Cases where a risk is perceived are given a high priority. If a UK company or address is identified, action is taken to ensure compliance with legislation, this can be by way of dialogue or statutory process. If no UK company is involved any suspected illegal activity is referred to the relevant authority in the Channel Islands for investigation.</p>

Guidance issued by the Agency to enforcement officers requires them to check for compliance with the requirements of Regulation 852/2004 during their periodic inspections of food businesses.

	<p pid="b.591W.2/1">There is a statistically significant relationship between starting positions in terms of meeting a number of important performance targets and age/needs. The correlation is not a perfect one (with correlation coefficients ranging from -0.28 in the case of distance to the accident and emergency-four hour wait and age/needs to -0.13 in the case of distance to the outpatient booking targets and age/needs). Some parts of the country with low age/needs did not have far to travel in meeting these targets. The reasons behind the relationship are complex.</p>
	<p pid="b.591W.2/2">Historical under-performance in low age/needs areas is likely to have existed for some time. By raising the quality of care to uniform national standards, the Government have significantly improved services provided to patients in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.591W.2/3">While distance to meeting performance targets was found to be a contributory factor in causing recent national health service deficits in certain parts of the country, as stated in the Chief Economist's report &quot;Explaining NHS deficits, 2003/04-2005/06&quot;, it is by no means considered to be the only, or even the most important, contributory factor.</p>
	<p pid="b.591W.2/4">The age and need indexes, and the interactions between them, are currently being reviewed by independent academic researchers under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation. A new age and need adjustment for weighted capitation may emerge from this research for resource allocation in 2008-09.</p>

This target was achieved in 2005-06, when uptake in those aged 65 and over reached 75.3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.597W.2/1">The NHS Confidentiality Code of Practice, published in November 2003, provides guidance on required practice for those who work within or under contract to national health service organisations about the safeguarding of confidentiality, and patients' consent to the use of their health records. The guidance includes an explanation of the main relevant legal requirements, and examples of appropriate information disclosure decisions in practice. The guidance applies equally to clinicians, managers, and all other staff in both primary and secondary care settings whose work involves access to personal information and, where appropriate, includes staff in the private and voluntary sectors.</p>

The code has been endorsed by the Information. Commissioner, the General Medical Council, and the British Medical Association.</p>
	<p pid="b.597W.2/3">Strong disincentives exist which protect against abuse of patient confidentiality. NHS organisations are responsible, as employers, for the actions taken on their behalf by their employees, and for disciplining their staff when they behave inappropriately. Accessing personal information without a legitimate reason constitutes a breach of the code. Staff who breach patient confidentiality are subject to professional disciplinary measures. Offending doctors and nurses will be reported to their professional regulatory bodies and may face additional disciplinary action, including losing their licence to practice. Separate legal penalties for individuals and organisations misusing personal health and other information are provided for under Section 60 of the Data Protection Act.</p>

However, we also recognise, from talking with stakeholders, that there are concerns about how patient consent and confidentiality will be managed in a community pharmacy setting. Information governance standards will need to be strictly adhered to, and appropriate assurance mechanisms put in place before community pharmacists will be permitted access to the national health service care records service.

	<p pid="b.601W.2/1">Although the prevalence of misuse of methylamphetamine is believed to be currently low in the United Kingdom (UK), the Association of Chief Police Officers is receiving increasing levels of intelligence about the prevalence of methylamphetamine. If methylamphetamine did secure a hold in the UK, the consequences would undoubtedly be very serious. The international experience shows that misuse can spread rapidly when certain conditions prevail and the advice of UK enforcement authorities is that most of these conditions now prevail in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.601W.2/2">The experience of comparator countries such as the United States of America (USA), Australia and New Zealand is that once a small number of illicit domestic laboratories become established, a sharper rise in prevalence in these countries has followed. A police force in America reported that if the USA had made ephedrine and pseudoephedrine based products prescription only at a much earlier stage, they would have prevented to a large extent the massive growth in small home made laboratories. The regulatory action taken by the Food and Drug Administration has contributed to a sharp decrease in domestic methylamphetamine production.</p>
	<p pid="b.601W.2/3">The Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) also considered non-statutory options to restrict the availability of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, such as rigorous supervision of pharmacy sales of single packs, and concluded that these measures alone would not be sufficient to protect public health. In order to protect public health in the UK, the CHM concluded that a consultation exercise should be conducted on changing the legal status of these medicines, together with restricting the pack size. Ministers accepted this advice and a full public consultation exercise commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March 2007</phrase> and can be accessed via the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) website at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>. The MHRA would welcome views on the merits of all the consultation proposals and is hosting a meeting with key stakeholders next month.</p>

	<p pid="b.612W.5/1">There are already controls on companies that supply medicines to the national health service. The Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994 prohibit the advertising of prescription only medicines to the public. Any promotion of a prescription only medicine to patients including lobbying activity that may lead to them seeking a prescription from their healthcare provider is likely to fall within this prohibition. Companies may provide non-promotional information, provided they do not promote a specific prescription only medicine.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/2">Products which are defined as medical devices are regulated under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. The regulations do not cover direct lobbying activities by manufacturers who place medical devices on the market.

In addition, in 2005 the National Audit Office (NAO) published &quot;The NHS Cancer Plan: A Progress Report&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The National Service Framework for children, young people and maternity services&quot; was published in September 2004. A one-year-on report was produced in 2005.

	<p pid="b.613W.3/9" class="indent">&quot;A New Ambition for Old Age: Next steps in implementing the National Service Framework for Older People&quot; is a refresh of the NSF for older people, and was published in April 2006. This publication was issued at the mid-way point of the 10-year NSF for older people. It built on the progress that had already been made, with older people receiving access to treatment and services in greater numbers than ever before. It sets out the priorities for the next phase of reform under three main themes: dignity in care, system reform for older people with complex needs, and healthy ageing.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.3/10" class="indent">The renal NSF has received positive feedback from the renal community, and the standards and quality requirements set out in it are being delivered. Renal services are managing the ever increasing demand for renal replacement therapy, the number of living kidney donations continues to increase and radical change has been delivered in the areas of early detection of kidney disease and end of life care. A progress report is expected to be published in summer 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.621W.5/1">The sale and supply of pharmacy and prescription only medicines for human use via the internet must be made in accordance with the Medicines Act 1968. There are approximately 12,684 registered retail pharmacies in Great Britain but not all will provide internet services. Registered pharmacies are not currently obliged to inform the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain if they provide internet pharmacy services, however, to date, 107 pharmacies have volunteered that information. The Society is piloting an internet pharmacy logo designed to assist members of the public in identifying bona fide registered pharmacy premises providing professional services via the internet. There are currently 20 participants involved in the pilot. After a review of the pilot it is intended to extend the logo to all registered retail pharmacies which provide internet services. The Society's inspectorate monitors and inspects all retail pharmacy premises currently on the register and that extends to internet pharmacy services. There is no available estimate of the number of unregulated internet pharmacies based in the United Kingdom. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency routinely monitor medicines being offered for sale on the internet by means of specialist information technology equipment which has been installed and configured to identify websites dealing in medicines illegally. Any suspected illegal activity is referred for investigation.</p>

	<p pid="b.622W.5/19">The imbalance between the number of prescription messages issued and the number dispensed is due to a number of factors. Most general practitioner (GP) system suppliers have achieved technical compliance with the electronic prescription service earlier than the pharmacy system suppliers, resulting in more GP practices having used the service for a longer period of time than pharmacies. In addition, the geographical distribution of bar-coded prescriptions available to pharmacies has been relatively limited. This is now changing and over 1,070 GP practices have achieved the technical capacity to issue bar-coded prescriptions within the last four weeks. As the volume of bar-coded prescriptions spreads geographically, there will be a related increase in the number of prescription dispensed using the electronic prescription service.</p>

	<p pid="b.624W.2/1">Methylphenidate (trade names Ritalin, Concerta XL and Equasym XL) is a stimulant drug licensed for children over six years of age as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Such treatment should be under the supervision of a specialist in childhood behavioural disorders. Methylphenidate's safety in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in conjunction with other European regulatory authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.2/2">Since methylphenidate was first authorised in the United Kingdom, a number of changes have been made to the product information for prescribers and patients to better reflect its emerging safety profile. The last revision, in November 2006, was to the product information for Concerta, to advise about serious cardiovascular adverse effects and to recommend that methylphenidate should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities. Steps are being taken to ensure consistency of information for all methylphenidate products.</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.2/3">The longer term safety of the use of methylphenidate is kept under careful review within Europe. The UK, on behalf of Europe, is in discussions with the pharmaceutical companies who manufacture methylphenidate products in order to develop risk management plans, which include the conduct of new research to better characterise and further investigate the safety profile of methylphenidate. As new data emerge they will be carefully evaluated by the MHRA and where necessary current prescribing advice will be updated to reflect the new evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.2/4">The marketing authorisation holder of any medicine is legally obliged to keep their product information up to date with all current developments, and respond to requests from regulatory agencies. European regulations governing medicinal products were amended in November 2005 and included provisions for improved monitoring of drug safety and quality of information for patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.625W.0/2">A number of Government Departments have undertaken specific initiatives to improve access to and the availability of recreational reading material for people with visual impairments:</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/3">The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is working with publishers, booksellers and other sector stakeholders with a view to improving the amount of book material available in accessible formats for blind and visually impaired people. The project has examined:</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/4" class="indent">the feasibility of using electronic files from publishers to reduce production costs and enable an increase in books produced;</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/5" class="indent">the feasibility of making accessible books available through mainstream booksellers;</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/6" class="indent">Braille, large print and daisy audio products;</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/7" class="indent">Business models for a sustainable growth in accessible products.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/8">It is anticipated that the project will now proceed to a market test, funded by industry and RNIB.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/9">In addition the Government are encouraging publishers to consider the needs of visually impaired people in the application of digital protection measures (DPM) to their e-book titles. Some DPM's can prevent screen readers providing a synthetic voice option to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/10">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has supported the 'Revealweb' project&mdash;an on-line resource to enable visually impaired people and their helpers to easily locate available material in alternative formats. The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) are working to link Revealweb to the public libraries' interlibrary loans system to improve access to the public library network for visually impaired people.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/11">The Government supported the Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 which removes the need for organisations and individuals to request permission before they reproduce copies in accessible formats, and enables accessible versions of published works to be made under licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/12">The Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) receives an annual grant from the Department for Education and Science (DfES) of &pound;200,000 to support the UK production of embossed literature and to make it available in the UK for the benefit of visually-impaired people.</p>

	<p pid="b.628W.0/1">In the United Kingdom, there are strict legal controls on the retail sale, supply and advertisement of medicinal products. These controls apply without distinction to medicines sold or supplied through internet transactions and mail order.</p>
	<p pid="b.628W.0/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) takes the view that internet and mail order sale and supply of medicines are acceptable provided these legal requirements are met. However, any website brought to their attention for breaching regulations will be investigated.</p>
	<p pid="b.628W.0/3">Records held by MHRA show that from <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> to date, out of 294 cases opened involving internet activity, 227 of these were found to be in breach of medicines legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.628W.0/4">MHRA will initially aim to achieve compliance with regulatory requirements, sites are contacted and given advice on UK statutory obligations. Although MHRA has no powers to force closure of websites, internet service providers are contacted concerning illegal activity and can close down offending sites. However, if compliance cannot be achieved, further action can be taken including a criminal prosecution brought through the criminal courts and civil proceedings.</p>
