	<p pid="b.1238W.5/1">Our review of the current nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) has shown that coverage needs to be increased from 55 per cent. to about 70 per cent. of England. This is necessary because nitrate pollution has increased in some areas of the country since the last round of NVZ designations in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238W.5/2">The nitrates directive requires all known areas of land to be designated as nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) if they drain to surface freshwaters or groundwaters which contain or could contain, if preventative action is not taken, nitrate concentrations greater than 50mg/l; or natural freshwater lakes, or other freshwater bodies, estuaries, coastal waters and marine waters which are eutrophic or may become so in the near future if protective action is not taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238W.5/3">The document 'G1&mdash;Summary of methodology for identifying NVZs 2006', which is available on the DEFRA website, provides a description of how water quality monitoring data, collected by the Environment Agency from a network of monitoring points and boreholes, are assessed against the above criteria to identify nitrate-polluted waters, and how areas of land draining to these waters were identified for designation as NVZs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1243W.0/1">The UK forms part of a core anti-whaling grouping within the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and supports the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling. The UK remains strongly opposed to any attempt to lift or weaken the moratorium and, in the longer term, wishes to see it strengthened. We will be meeting with the core anti-whaling group in the run up to IWC60. Posts abroad will also lobby a wide range of governments prior to the meeting to ensure support for the moratorium.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.0/2">The UK has led efforts to recruit more conservation-minded countries to the IWC through our publication 'Protecting Whales&mdash;A Global Responsibility'. This publication has recently been updated and was re-released on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-21">21 December 2007</phrase>. In the coming weeks, posts will deliver the updated version to host governments, and will continue to engage in discussion with their counterparts on whaling at every appropriate opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.0/3">This year, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will write to 18 countries encouraging them to join the IWC for the greater protection of whales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.0/4">The UK Government have consistently voiced their opposition to Japanese &quot;scientific&quot; whaling. Most recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-08">8 January</phrase>, I called in the deputy ambassador from the Japanese embassy in London to express the UK's outrage and urge Japan to end its slaughter of whales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-21">21 December 2007</phrase>, the UK along with 29 other countries took part in a demarch&eacute; to the Japanese Government calling on Japan to</p>

	<p pid="b.1246W.8/2">We recognise that operational deployments can be very stressful experiences and to that end measures are in place to increase awareness at all levels and to mitigate the development of operational stresses. Medical staff and the Chain of Command are trained to recognise signs of mental illness and stress and where practicable a period of &quot;decompression&quot; is arranged for the returning unit between the end of the operational deployment and post operational leave. Additionally pre- and post-deployment talks are given to educate personnel and their families to the possible after-affects of an operational deployment and, if required, what medical and welfare support is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.8/3">For those who require it, we provide treatment primarily through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental healthcare. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available, including medication, psychological therapies, and environmental adjustment where appropriate. The Defence Mental Health Services have extensive experience in psychological treatments for mental health problems in general, and psychological injury in particular.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.8/4">In-patient care, when necessary, is provided in psychiatric units belonging to the Priory Group of Hospitals, through a central contract with MOD. The arrangements with the Priory Group mean that the majority of patients can be treated much closer to their parent units than was the case when we maintained the last of our own psychiatric hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1257W.2/1">It is for the travel concession authorities to determine where best they can make Gershon efficiency savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257W.2/2">There are a number of ways by which travel concession authorities could make such savings. Where appropriate they could move to county-wide administration of concessionary travel schemes (if they are currently managed at the district level) or could move to joint administration with other authorities. The administration of concessionary travel could also be streamlined by, for instance, issuing passes bi- or tri-annually instead of yearly, or by adopting streamlined procedures for monitoring and calculating reimbursement payments, in co-operation with bus operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257W.2/3">The Department has been working with local authorities to find ways of improving the efficiency of concessionary fares administration. An eventual move to full smart-ticketing, subject to up-front investment, would significantly reduce the scope for passenger and operator fraud, improve the collection of data needed for calculating reimbursement, and reduce the need for separate passenger surveys. To assist this process the Government are paying a grant of &pound;31 million to ensure that bus passes for the new national concession starting April 2008 are in ITSO smartcard form.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261W.2/2">Certain types of householder development can, however, proceed without the specific approval of the local planning authority.

Our proposals provide for a generally more restrictive approach to extensions in certain designated areas, including national parks, compared to non-designated areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.2/4">Local planning authorities also have powers to remove these rights locally by using an &quot;article 4 direction&quot; to require that an application is made and their approval sought. It will then be for them to determine whether a proposal is acceptable based on relevant planning considerations, including local policies. An article 4 direction can apply to a particular type of development and/or a specific area, but could not impose restrictions based on the ownership of a particular property. The planning system regulates the use of land and the residential status of an applicant would not be material.</p>

The US is also part of the E3+3 group of countries that is leading the international community in seeking a negotiated solution to this issue and which therefore meets regularly to co-ordinate our approach. That approach is based on a generous offer to Iran should they suspend their proliferation sensitive activities and the threat of sanctions should they continue to refuse to do so. Through the E3+3, the Government and the US have played an important role in securing three United Nations Security Council Resolutions on Iran, two of which have focused on sanctions. The E3+3 are committed to a diplomatic solution to the concerns of the international community about the Iranian nuclear programme. We have not specifically discussed the impact of these policies on UK troops.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267W.8/1">Local authorities are responsible for the planning and implementation of Sure Start Children's Centres in their areas. There are currently four designated children's centres in the London borough of Barnet, two of which are located in the Hendon constituency. There are a further nine planned for designation in 2008, four of which will be located in the Hendon constituency. We have given Barnet an indicative number of a further nine centres to be delivered by 2010 to reach remaining children under five in the final phase of the roll out of children's centres. Revenue and capital allocations for Barnet children's centres for each of the next three years and last three years are given in the following tables. It is the authority's responsibility to determine allocations between individual centres. Sure Start Children's Centres do not offer a set number of places. Each centre is expected to offer services to around 800 children under five and their families in the local community although this figure may be higher in areas of high population density. Centres in the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged areas offer childcare to some children in their area. Information is not held centrally about the number of child care places in each centre.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.0/1">GCSEs are unique qualifications because they span two levels of the National Qualifications Framework: grades D-G are at &quot;level 1&quot;, while grades at C and above represent &quot;level 2&quot;. Level 2 qualifications recognise the ability to gain a good knowledge and understanding of a subject area of work or study, and to perform varied tasks with some guidance or supervision. Learning at this level involves building knowledge and/or skills in relation to an area of work or a subject area and is appropriate for many job roles.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.0/2">The learning and skills attained at level 2 are therefore appropriate for many job roles and represent the progression route to A Levels and other higher qualifications. Government targets reflect our determination to see the majority of young people reaching the standard which enables them to make such progression.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.6/1">Geronimo Communications have had a PR framework agreement with the Department since 2000, awarded as a result of three separate European tenders. The European tenders resulted in a number of framework agreements awarded to several PR suppliers to cover the anticipated PR requirements of the Department over the framework life. Framework agreements rather than contracts are used where there is a regular demand for a particular service over a period of time. Users then 'call off' from the frameworks by letting contracts that relate to a specific project.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.6/2">There is split responsibility between the corporate contract management of the framework agreements and contract management at individual job level. The Media Procurement Unit, part of the Department's Commercial Group within Corporate Service Directorate run the tender process, award and corporate contract manage the framework agreements. The duties performed by the Media Procurement Unit with a supplier include dissemination of supplier information to users, corporate communications, supplier forums and surgeries, arbitration and processing of framework variations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.6/3">Communications Directorate is the main user of the PR framework agreements, 'calling-off' from a framework agreement for a project. Those users will then 'contract manage' an individual project, selecting a supplier, setting the specification and monitoring budgets, quality and outputs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.6/4">To list each individual contract manager that has placed work with Geronimo Communications since 2000 would create disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1275W.6/1">The Children's Plan, published in December 2007, confirmed that the primary curriculum will be reviewed, including introducing languages as a compulsory subject. This takes forward the recommendation in Lord Dearing's Languages Review that languages should become a compulsory part of the primary curriculum, and builds on the existing entitlement for all Key Stage 2 pupils to learn a language in class time by 2010. Progress so far is good and already over 70 per cent. of primary schools are offering languages in class time. We are extending language teaching in primary schools through: a teacher training programme in a primary languages specialism, which has so far trained nearly 3,000 teachers, with thousands more to be trained over the next few years; increased funding for local authorities to support the delivery of primary languages; and access for teachers to sources of support for use in the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275W.6/2">At secondary level, languages are compulsory at Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14). The new secondary curriculum, which will be taught from September 2008, extends the range of languages pupils can study at this level by relaxing the requirement that schools first teach a working language of the European Union so that they can offer any major world or European language.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275W.6/3">As a result of the continued decline in take up of languages at GCSE following their removal from the compulsory Key Stage 4 curriculum (ages 14-16) in 2004, Lord Dearing's Languages Review looked at how best to increase participation in language learning. He did not recommend making languages compulsory at Key Stage 4 because he felt that a 'one size fits all' approach was not the best way to motivate learners. Instead, he recommended a package of measures to extend language learning post-14 which we are now implementing. These include: two new performance indicators in the Achievement and Attainment Tables from 2008 to measure attainment and participation in languages; a more engaging secondary curriculum; more and better support for language teachers; a major communications campaign to promote the benefits of language teaching to pupils, parents and the school workforce; and the Open School for Languages, a major web-based initiative which will offer innovative approaches to the learning of languages.</p>

	<p pid="b.1282W.2/1">In 1997, investment in school buildings was under &pound;700 million a year and schools had suffered from many years of under investment, with a large backlog of condition and suitability needs. This year, Government funding for investment in school buildings and facilities is &pound;6.4 billion and it will rise to over &pound;8 billion a year by 2010-11&mdash;a seven-fold increase in real terms under this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.2/2">Since 1997, every school in England has benefited from this growth in funding. Since 2000, every school has been given money directly to invest in its own priorities. By 2010-11, a typical secondary school, for example, will have received over &pound;900,000 to improve its buildings and facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.2/3">In the 10 years to 2007, there were 162 new secondary schools built, and a further 26 new or significantly refurbished academy buildings. Additionally, over 6,600 science laboratories were built or refurbished, and over 430 sixth form blocks built or refurbished, Many other secondary schools benefited from new general classrooms, new kitchens or dining rooms, improved sports facilities and the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation with permanent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.2/4">Ensuring that all secondary school have 21st century facilities is now driven by Building Schools for the Future, which with the academies programme aims to rebuild or renew all secondary schools in England where there is need in 15 waves of investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.2/5">There are now 72 local authorities in the first six waves of the programme, supported in developing their projects by our delivery agent, Partnerships for Schools. The first all-new school in this programme was opened in September in Bristol. Additionally, 39 authorities not yet in Building Schools for the Future are being offered One School Pathfinder funding to renew their neediest secondary school. There are a further 106 academies buildings in development outside of the BSF programme. In all, almost 1,000 schools are now in planning or procurement through Building Schools for the Future, Academies, or as One School Pathfinders. Further, we will provide &pound;8 million of funding by 2010-11, to each of 76 authorities not yet in Building Schools for the Future, to improve diploma provision for 14-19 year olds and to improve facilities for young people with special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288W.8/2">I understand that Stoke-on-Trent council have been carrying out a consultation on the possible closure of St. Joseph's, and Salford council have consulted on the possible closure of St. George's, in the context of their Building Schools for the Future projects. In the case of St. Joseph's the consultation included plans to replace the school with a new Roman Catholic (RC) High School on the site of the closing school. The local authorities are now considering the views expressed. If they publish statutory proposals to close the schools, they would be the decision maker following a six week period for comments and objections, but there would be a right of appeal to the schools adjudicator by the local diocesan authorities, the Learning and Skills Council and the governing bodies and trustees of each school.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.8/3">Proposals for the new RC school to replace St. Joseph's in Stoke-on-Trent could only be proposed by the trustees, or local RC diocese, and they would have to seek the Secretary of State's consent before publishing proposals for the new school without running a school competition.</p>

	<p pid="b.1289W.5/1">Improving standards of literacy at all key stages is one of the Government's top priorities. Following Sir Jim Rose's review of the teaching of early reading, we have provided a wealth of guidance on the systematic teaching of phonics. We have done this through the renewal of the primary framework for literacy which puts phonics at the heart of teaching literacy; through the provision of training to all primary schools as part of the Communication Language and Literacy Development (CLLD) programme; and through the publication of Letters and Sounds, a high quality phonics teaching document sent free to all primary schools and local authorities last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.5/2">Although this guidance is targeted specifically at early years settings and primary schools, secondary schools are able to access freely all the guidance we provide. For secondary schools, the Secondary National Strategy has produced a specific teaching unit on phonics as part of the literacy progress units designed to help secondary schools in helping pupils struggling with reading to catch up. However, we have concentrated the main thrust of our guidance on early years settings and primary schools where it is of prime importance that firm foundations in the teaching of early reading are laid.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.5/3">We do not gather information on the proportion of primary schools in England which use phonics to teach reading. Phonic knowledge is a part of the KS1 national curriculum, so all schools are required to teach it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.5/4">It is this Department's intention that every trainee teacher should be trained in the use of high quality, systematic phonics teaching. We have asked the Training and Development Agency to ensure that all teacher training establishments give sufficient attention to phonics teaching and we will continue to work with the national strategies to ensure that teachers and support staff receive the appropriate continuing professional development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.5/5">We do not provide funding specifically targeted at the teaching of phonics. We believe that schools are best placed to target their funding to suit local needs. All training and materials produced through the national strategies are provided free-of-charge to schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-16">16 January 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/4" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your question on what estimate has been made of the number of Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK in <i> (a)</i> 1997 and <i> (b)</i> at the most recent date for which an estimate is available; what estimate has been made of the number of commonwealth citizens registered to vote in the UK; which Commonwealth countries have reciprocal rights for voting in the UK; and what checks are carried out on the immigration status of applicants for electoral registration. I am replying in her absence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/5" class="indent">(177394)</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/6" class="indent">In 1997, there were an estimated 695,000 Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK. In 2006, the corresponding estimate was 1,112,000. These estimates are based on Labour Force Survey data and, as with any sample survey data, are subject to margins of error.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/7" class="indent">With respect to Commonwealth citizens registered to vote, data separately identifying British, Irish, or Commonwealth citizens are not collected centrally; these citizens are grouped together on local authority electoral returns. Therefore we are unable to produce data on voter registration separately for Commonwealth citizens.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/8" class="indent">With respect to which Commonwealth countries have reciprocal rights for voting in the UK, the Ministry of Justice advise that this information is not held centrally. In respect of the UK, the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides that all Commonwealth citizens who are lawfully resident here are entitled to vote in parliamentary and local elections. Decisions about the voting rights of Commonwealth, including British, citizens resident in other Commonwealth countries are for the individual countries concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/9" class="indent">With respect to checks on immigration status, the Ministry of Justice advise that all electors are required to state their nationality on the canvass form when registering to vote. Furthermore, electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may object and notify the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/10" class="indent">The Electoral Administration Act strengthened this process by:</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/11" class="indent">allowing any individual to object to another person's registration details at any time;</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/12" class="indent">allowing an ERO to initiate and conduct a review of a person's registration at any time;</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/13" class="indent">creating a new criminal offence of supplying false information or failing to supply information to the electoral registration officer at any time; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/14" class="indent">giving the police more time to carry out investigations into electoral fraud (they may apply to court to have the normal one year limit for bringing prosecutions increased to two years, so long as there has been no undue delay in the investigation).</p>

	<p pid="b.1303W.3/1">The number of recorded robberies in Northern Ireland fell by 648 (29 per cent.) between 2001-02 and 2006-07. The number of recorded burglaries fell by 5581 (32.5 per cent.) in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303W.3/2">The Policing Board and the PSNI have made reducing the number of domestic burglaries a key priority and this was included as a specific target in the 2007-10 Policing Plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303W.3/3">Tables 1 and 2 show the numbers of recorded robberies and burglaries in each district command unit since the new structure was set up in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303W.3/4">Table 3 documents the number of prosecutions and convictions for robberies while Table 4 documents the same for burglaries. The figures relate to the police district command unit in which an offender's address falls.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303W.3/5">Data are collated on the principal offence rule; so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303W.3/6">It is not possible routinely to reconcile recorded crime data from PSNI with prosecution and conviction data. Data from PSNI relate to the number of offences whereas data on prosecutions and convictions relate to the number of offenders brought before the courts. In addition, PSNI data denote each offence as it has been initially recorded and this may differ from the offence for which a suspect or suspects are subsequently proceeded against in the courts, therefore prosecution and conviction statistics should not be compared with the number recorded.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="1992-01-14">14 January 1992</phrase>, attempts at rescue having failed, the High Court ordered that BCCI be wound up and similar orders were made in the other jurisdictions at about that time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.15/2">The most recent date at which the costs of the liquidation are available is <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-15">15 January 2007</phrase>, from the annual report to the Secretary of State. The English liquidators' remuneration totalled US $337 million paid and legal fees incurred by the English liquidators totalled US $225 million. In addition to those legal fees are the amounts which have been paid to the Bank of England following the abandonment of the liquidators' action in 2006, which totalled some &pound;85 million, including VAT and interest. It is noteworthy that despite the high costs total moneys received by the UK liquidators as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-15">15 January 2007</phrase> amounted to just over US $4.1 billion and there had been five dividends to creditors who had by then received 81 per cent. of their debts. The liquidators paid a further dividend of 3 per cent. on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November 2007</phrase> and expect to make a further payment but are unable to provide detail at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.15/3">The liquidation is not yet finalized. The liquidators are making every effort to conclude the liquidation and pay final amounts to creditors as soon as possible, however, the English liquidation is one of several worldwide that are closely linked and only when they are all substantially complete will it be possible for a formal conclusion in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317W.8/1">In line with the reactor designs currently being assessed by the regulators through the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process, any new nuclear reactors built over the next 10 to 15 years will be Generation III designs. These designs are already available commercially and any research necessary for their deployment in the UK will be a matter for industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/2">Generation IV reactor designs are not expected to be built commercially until 2030 or beyond. Basic research into aspects of their development, for example on new materials that would be reliable at higher temperatures, is generally too far from potential exploitation in the market place to attract private sector funding. Basic research of this type is likely to continue to rely on public funding through the UK Research Councils and the European Union Euratom Framework programme, with the level of support dependent upon both the quality of the scientific proposals and the strategic priority given to that research area by the organisations concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/3">BERR does not fund research into Generation IV advanced reactors systems and the UK has now stood down as an active member of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). The decision to stand down reflected the need to match financial and other resources with the Department's strategic priorities. While valuable in some respects, further involvement in the forum was not considered to be as relevant to the Department's mission as other competing priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/4">Since 2005 the UK Research Councils, which are funded from the science budget through the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, have provided some &pound;1.63 million to support research relevant to Generation IV advance reactor systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/5">UK research organisations also participate in European research collaborations relevant to Generation IV advance reactor systems that are funded by the European Commission. Details of collaborations from 2002-06 (including a small number on advanced reactor systems) can be found in &quot;Euratom FP6 Research Projects and Training Activities Vols 1-3&quot;, which are available from the following website:</p>

The UK remains strongly opposed to any attempt to lift or weaken the moratorium and, in the longer term, wishes to see it strengthened.

	<p pid="b.1322W.6/1">None. The Resource Accounts and actuarial valuation use different measures of the cost to the Exchequer of providing benefits under the PCPF because they are used for different purposes and use different assumptions about investment returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.6/2">The FRS 17 is an accounting standard used in reporting the liabilities and assets of the PCPF in the House of Commons Members Resource Accounts (HC 832). The Resource Accounts use the return on corporate bonds for the valuation of accrued liabilities and current service costs. The standard is a financial reporting standard and is not the appropriate tool for setting the level of employer contribution for the PCPF.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.6/3">The assessment of the required rate of employer contribution for the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund is made by the Government Actuary's Department every three years using a standard methodology which includes an assessment of the expected rate of return of the Fund's assets. This approach is widely used in the private and public sectors. The last actuarial review in 2005 assessed the underlying rate of employer contribution at 18.1 per cent. of Members' salaries with a further 8.7 per cent. required to make good the current deficit. The next actuarial review was agreed by the Trustees at their last meeting and any revision to the current employer contribution rate will come into effect from 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1326W.2/1">There have been four apparent self-inflicted deaths at Chelmsford Prison since <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May 2007</phrase><sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326W.2/2">Since 2004 the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been conducting investigations into all deaths in prison custody. All such deaths are also subject to a coroners inquest. The investigations into the deaths at HMP Chelmsford are on-going and it is too early to say what factors may have contributed to these particular deaths.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326W.2/3">However, we do know that the prison population contains a high proportion of very vulnerable individuals, many of whom have experienced negative life events that we know increase the likelihood of them harming themselves. Issues that increase risk include drug/alcohol abuse, family background and relationship problems, social disadvantage or isolation, previous sexual or physical abuse, and mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326W.2/4">Every death in prison affects families, staff and other prisoners deeply. Ministers and the Prison Service are completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents. The updated Prison Service suicide prevention strategy was published in October 2007 with implementation due to be completed in every prison, including Chelmsford, by end-April 2008. Building on several years of learning from the experience of prisoners, staff, investigators, inspectors and others, it incorporates developments such as improved cross-agency information flows, the provision of safer cells, increasing prisoner peer support, and the introduction of ACCT (assessment, care in custody and teamwork) the care-planning system for prisoners at risk of suicide or self-harm, introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326W.2/5">HMP Chelmsford itself has developed a strong relationship with Samaritans to provide support for prisoners. Over the last year there has been a great deal of work to improve suicide prevention related training for staff. This includes training in ACCT, use of cut down tools, and resuscitation techniques.</p>

	<p pid="b.1348W.8/1">London strategic health authority (SHA) has advised that the North London Breast Screening Service, which provides services to Barnet and Hendon residents, was suspended for safety reasons in December 2006. The service resumed in May 2007, and was reintroduced gradually. As of October 2007, there were no outstanding cases and the service is running to full capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1352W.5/1">The recommended standards for sexual health services advise that primary care trusts (PCTs) should ensure information about local sexual health service provision is readily available to enable people to access appropriate services. It also states that PCTs should target specific population groups who are less well serviced by, or find it more difficult to access existing provision. Specific service provision will be based on local need but should include services for young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.5/2">In addition, sex and relationships education guidance from the Department for Children, Schools and Families recommends that young people should be given information on where they can access local contraceptive advice services. In order to achieve &quot;healthy school&quot; status arrangements must be in place to refer students to specialist services that can provide advice on contraception including community contraceptive services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1378W.2/1">The vast majority of winter fuel payments are made automatically because most people aged 60 and over are receiving a DWP benefit which allows us to check their eligibility based on information on our departmental computer systems.

	<p pid="b.1378W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/2"><i> </i>The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-16">16 January 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about the provision of flexible service support arrangements provided by Jobcentre Plus. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Ms Strathie as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. I am replying in her absence as Acting Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/5" class="indent">We wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-13">13 December</phrase> providing information regarding those factors that District Managers consider when reviewing local Service Delivery Plans. Every effort is made to ensure that all customers can access our services regardless of where they live. If there are concerns about customer access to a Jobcentre, we can arrange for flexible service provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/6" class="indent">The provision of services in our Districts, including flexible arrangements, follows an assessment of customer needs. This takes into account local knowledge, local circumstances, national priorities, and follows consultation with local stakeholders as how best to meet customer needs in the most efficient and effective manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/7" class="indent">I am sure that you will be aware of the &quot;Cornwall Works&quot; programme (that part of Cornwall's Local Area Agreement delivering on the worklessness agenda). This programme is a successful consortium of service providers, including a key input from Jobcentre Plus, and has introduced a Neighbourhood Action Team for Pengegon and Parc an Tansys. The collective effort of this group has facilitated the provision of services directly to customers in housing estates who need more support to address worklessness. This is clearly helping those who would not normally seek out services from a Jobcentre and is helping those in greatest need to find work or support in becoming ready for work. I am pleased that the concept of the Neighbourhood Action Team is likely to be expanded with the help of European Social Funding. I understand that Pengegon and Parc an Tansys as well as Redruth North, parts of Pool and Illogen are specifically earmarked.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/8" class="indent">The District has already successfully used European Social Funding to finance a series of projects, working with local organisations, to target help and support for those communities where there is greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/9" class="indent">There is also a great deal being done to meet the needs of customers in the Devon and Cornwall District in general and specifically for customers in and around your constituency. The flexible service provision includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/10" class="indent">access to a New Deal Lone Parent Adviser on an ad hoc basis in Children's Centres in Falmouth, Penryn and at a Family Centre in Falmouth;</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/11" class="indent">access to a New Deal Lone Parent Adviser and Disability Employment Adviser on a fortnightly basis at 'Link into Learning' in Falmouth;</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/12" class="indent">joint working arrangements with the Children's Centres in Redruth, Camborne and St Day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/13" class="indent">Furthermore during the consultation period on the closure of Camborne Jobcentre, Kerrier District Council offered the possibility of sharing their premises. This was subject to agreement by their Scrutiny Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/14" class="indent">I am confident that the variety of programmes and activities supports our customers in Devon and Cornwall and your constituents. I encourage this type of support activity throughout Jobcentre Plus as it helps focus on greatest need and compliments the services already provided through our network of Jobcentres, Contact Centres and Benefit Delivery Centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/15" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus does not maintain a central list of the flexible support arrangements in place or a central record of the cost associated with introducing those arrangements and this information could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Information is held at District level because the arrangements tend to change and adapt to meet local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/16" class="indent">Carolyn Webster, European Social Fund Manager for Devon and Cornwall, would be happy to help if you would like to discuss this local information in more detail, Carolyn can be contacted on 01872 355021.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.5/17" class="indent">I hope this reply is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1386W.5/1">The Department's contact centres provide a good quality of service to the majority of its customers but we do recognise that customers who need to deal with more than one part of the Department may not always find it as easy as we would like to get answers to cross-cutting queries. The Department has recently introduced a new internal directory for customer contact staff to use to help signpost customers to the right point of contact for the resolution of their inquiry. This is the first step towards the introduction of a more integrated approach. Our aim is that in the future there should be 'no wrong door' for customers who contact the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.1388W.0/1">The Electoral Commission informs me that subsidy of a regulated donee's website might constitute a donation (cash or non-cash), depending on the particular circumstances. In the Commission's view, donations in support of websites do not fall within the definition of 'sponsorship' in paragraph 3 of Schedule 7 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>
