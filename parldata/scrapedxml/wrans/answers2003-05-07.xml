The Government will support efforts to find solutions at the G8 summit and in follow-up work after the summit, notably for poor countries in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.9/2">There are a number of possibilities. The UK is already contributing to a sustainable coffee market by helping growers to diversify through its development programme; trying to expand the trade opportunities of commodity-dependent countries, cut tariffs and reduce the negative impact of the CAP. We are promoting foreign investment and good regulatory frameworks, increasing the aid budget to 0.40 per cent. of national income by 2005&ndash;06 and advocating more debt relief to highly indebted poor countries. A government-industry working group is currently looking at what more can be done to improve the livelihoods of poorer commodity producers in developing countries. The summit will consider what more can be done.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.5/1">For all its failings, ILA was successful in getting non-traditional learners back into learning, and that success was based in part on the role played by the best providers, many of them small scale, who were able to encourage learners to take the first step. This influence will be as important in the successor scheme as it was in the original programme. The scheme will promote high quality relevant learning, whether from small or large scale providers. Details of the scheme will be announced next month as part of the Skills Strategy.</p>

We are currently working with the Employers Forum on Age to progress age diversity policies by using their policy review toolkit 'One Step Ahead'. The toolkit sets out the framework to enable employers to undertake a comprehensive age equality review and to deliver age &quot;neutrality&quot; across the business. The toolkit will shortly be issued across the DWP HR community.</p>

	<p pid=".695W.2/1">The Part-time Workers Directive has not had a significant impact on staff in DWP. Existing policies already provided a range of working patterns for all our staff, both male and female. Full-time staff can work in non-traditional ways (e.g. compressed hours, informal home-working), and part-time staff can work part year, for example during school terms but not during school holidays.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.2/2">We also recognise that some part-time staff do not have children; they have simply made other life choices. Staff may take the opportunity to match their working arrangements with their personal lives and responsibilities as carers, to study, undertake voluntary work, or pursue other interests. More than 25 per cent. (see Table A) of DWP staff work part-time (source: DWP baseline map for year ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>) against a little over 15 per cent. in the Civil Service as a whole (Civil Service statistics October 2002).</p>
	<p pid=".695W.2/3">A recent survey of DWP staff indicated that 67 per cent. (see Table B) of staff were in agreement that &quot;the organisation allowed people to adopt a work pattern to accommodate a work life balance&quot; 22 per cent. did not have an opinion either way and only 11 per cent. felt that their work pattern conflicted with their home life (source: staff survey 2002).</p>
	<p pid=".695W.2/4">DWP ensures that part-time staff are not treated less favourably in their contractual terms and conditions than comparable full time staff; the 'pro rata principle' applies wherever appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".696W.2/1">The Government recognise the value of saving for retirement in providing people with security, comfort in retirement and long-term independence and security. To address the problems that may have discouraged people of all ages from saving in the past the Government are implementing a strategy designed to create the right environment for saving; provide incentives to save through favourable tax treatment; and ensure everyone has access to the financial information they need to make informed savings decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.2/2">It also recognised that there will be times in many people's lives when they cannot afford both to contribute to a pension and meet their current needs, but it is important that people save when they can afford to do so. Student loans are repaid on an income contingent basis, which means that the amount repaid is affordable and does not prevent graduates from making other investments such as contributions to a pension scheme.</p>

Responses were sought by the FRC by <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-14">14 April</phrase>. It is for the FRC to report on the responses to that consultation, and on amendments to the combined code resulting from the review and consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".702W.9/1">Agricultural market support measures under the CAP are estimated to have increased the cost of food for a notional family of four by about &pound;5 to &pound;6 per week. As food represents a higher proportion of the total expenditure for low income households, the impact will be more severe for these households. There are no estimates of the impact of market price support on the income distribution of UK farmers. However, the OECD's provisional estimates for 2001 show that market price support in the EU accounted for nearly 60 per cent. of total support to agriculture and represented 24 per cent. of the value of production at the farm gate. OECD estimates for individual commodities show that market price support represented 3 per cent. of the value of production of cereals, 37 per cent. for milk, 44 per cent. for sugar and 84 per cent. for beef and veal.</p>

	<p pid=".705W.8/1">In common with other Government Departments, Defra has a target for increasing the number of disabled civil servants to 3 per cent. by 2005. Currently, 1 per cent. of Defra's Senior Civil Servants have declared a disability. At grades below SCS the figure is 6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.8/2">Defra is taking steps to address the low number of disabled Senior Civil Servants. In addition to running the 'Two Ticks' guaranteed interview scheme for disabled applicants, the Department participates in central schemes targeted at disabled staff including the civil service bursary scheme and fast stream summer placements for disabled graduates.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.8/3">We encourage members of staff to declare their disability but this is voluntary and there may be a degree of under-reporting. The Department is considering what we can do to improve the response rate. We are also represented on the Cabinet Office's Disability Working Group which is looking at this issue for Government Department's in general.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.3/1">Action to address the issue of dolphin and porpoise by-catch needs to be taken internationally, as fishing vessels from many countries are involved. We have been pressing for such action within the EU and have commissioned a programme of research and development to reinforce our arguments. Urgent action is needed in the pair trawl fishery for bass off south west England, which involves a substantial number of vessels from other member states. Our research programme identified a by-catch problem in this fishery and is now trialling a possible gear solution. This looks promising, and I am determined to achieve a solution by this or other means. The second urgent need is to deploy EU observers to identify and assess other problem fisheries. I have followed up action in the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers, by writing to Commissioner Fischler and the French Fisheries Minister in support of effective measures. In addition, with the devolved administrations, I have issued a consultation document outlining a UK by-catch response strategy, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".707W.0/1">We highlighted the need for urgent action on the issue of cetacean by-catch at the January meeting of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers. I have also pursued this issue with Commissioner Fischler on a number of occasions, both in writing and in personal contacts.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/2">I have recently written to the Commission to press for urgent action to widen observer coverage off the south-west coast where a number of other member states' vessels fish. I was pleased that the Commission included a commitment to take action in this area in papers produced as part of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Commissioner Fischler has sent an encouraging reply sharing the UK's concern and agreeing a need to act at Community level, but I will follow up our recent approaches and continue to press for concrete proposals for positive action.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/3">I have also recently written to Herv&eacute; Gaymard, the French Fisheries Minister, stressing the need for effective action, and requesting his support for measures to widen observer coverage with a view to the reduction of cetacean by-catch. Action by France is particularly important as French pair trawlers play a substantial part in the offshore bass fishery; estimates are that some 30 to 40 French pairs are involved in this fishery.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/4">Defra has committed some &pound;140,000 for trialling the use of exclusion devices developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) to reduce the by-catch of cetaceans in the offshore bass fishery. If SMRU's trials do not identify the use of the separator grids as a viable solution, we will look at other measures. I do not rule out any approach at this stage including arguing for restrictions on fishing, the gear that can be used or seasonal closures.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/5">In the meantime, I, along with the Devolved Administrations, have issued a consultation document outlining a UK by-catch response strategy. This sets out the extent of our knowledge of by-catch in UK waters and makes proposals for action to address the by-catch problem. The document has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.5/2">If the sewerage undertaker does not classify the discharge as trade effluent, it is still an offence under section 111 of the 1991 Act, for a person to empty into a public sewer, or any drain or sewer connecting with a public sewer, any matter which is likely to injure the sewer or drain, to interfere with the free flow of its contents or to affect prejudicially the treatment and disposal of its contents. Any person who is found guilty of an offence is liable to a fine or imprisonment. I consider these statutory controls to be sufficient. We would expect sewerage undertakers to take action where a problem arose and to encourage appropriate preventative measures to stop problems arising from fat and oil entering the sewers.</p>

Part-time working is one of several ways in which the Department offers its staff flexibility in their working patterns. Figures for staff in post in the core Department <sup>1</sup> show that 11 per cent. of staff have adopted a part-time working pattern. Defra agencies and non-departmental public bodies are encouraged to take a similar approach.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/2">In 2002, the Department conducted a staff survey, one element of which was to compare the views of part-time workers with those of full-time staff on various aspects of working for Defra. The results of the survey will be discussed with the part-time staff network with a view to taking action where necessary. There will be follow up activity to enable us to monitor progress and identify any new issues.</p>

As part of this scheme we will monitor the impact on staff in a number of key employment areas.

	<p pid=".714W.8/1">Five rapid tests for the post-mortem detection of BSE have been evaluated by the EU Commission and are considered appropriate for use as screening tests for cattle. The most recent of these, one from Switzerland and one from the USA, were published by the Commission at the end of 2002. Defra is aware of these assessments and will be guided by them in BSE control programmes. I presume that the question refers to one of these methods.</p>
	<p pid=".714W.8/2">Scientists at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency are also engaged in trials of modifications of these and other methods to assess their potential to differentiate between BSE and scrapie. This is being done in collaboration with European and American scientists. In addition, the development of a BSE test for use in live animals is a longstanding Defra priority. Scientific staff monitor both national and global developments and are involved in the collaborative evaluation of a range of tests at different stages of development. Thorough evaluation of performance is required before tests can be used for statutory purposes.</p>

	<p pid=".715W.2/2">The original CAP reform proposals introduced the concept of a decoupled single income payment, designed to bring markets into better balance and take away incentives for over-production. Energy crops would be eligible for a 'carbon credit' aid of &pound;45 per hectare, capped at 1.5 million hectares across the EU. Compulsory set-aside would have been retained, but the existing derogation to allow non-food, including energy crops, to be grown on it would be removed. We consider that the combination of decoupling together with a further cereals price cut removes the need for land to be taken out of production and placed in set-aside.</p>
	<p pid=".715W.2/3">The European Commission have indicated that they may be prepared to make some changes to their original proposal on set-aside, including allowing continued access for non-food crops. Our view is that if set-aside is to continue, it must be applied in a flexible way which maximises its potential benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".716W.5/1">Since 1998, collection of data about the incidence of TB in badgers has been collected only from the randomised badger culling trial (the &quot;Krebs&quot; trial) and from the road traffic accident survey taking place in seven counties (Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Dorset). Data from both will be analysed by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG).</p>
	<p pid=".716W.5/2">It is a fundamental principle of scientific trials that data must not be released prematurely since that could compromise the subsequent integrity of the trials. The ISG expressed concern in its second report that no data should be released from the field trial and related research which could discourage farmers' willingness to participate in the trial, or encourage either illegal killing of badgers or interference with trial operations. For this reason, they recommended that a narrow band of data (including the prevalence of TB in badgers caught in the trial) should not be disclosed. The ISG has asserted and reinforced the need for total confidentiality of these data until such time as they can be safely released with a considered analysis.</p>

	<p pid=".717W.5/1">The Government have funded a number of research projects to combat the varroa mite since it was first discovered in the UK. Currently, Defra is funding a 3-year project that extends an earlier MAFF-funded investigation by Horticulture Research International (HRI) on the use of entomopathogenic fungi as a biological control of varroa. HRI is undertaking this project in collaboration with IACR Rothamsted. It is due to terminate in 2005 and is expected to cost some &pound;323,000.</p>

	<p pid=".718W.2/1">Varroa has been the most significant threat to UK beekeeping since it was first detected in Devon in 1992. Defra funds a programme of bee health measures to assist the beekeeping sector, the cost of which was around &pound;1.3 million in 2002&ndash;03. Under these measures, the National Bee Unit (NBU), part of the Central Science Laboratory, provides a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers in England as well as training and technical advice to help them become more self-reliant through improved bee husbandry. In addition, the NBU has been carrying out routine screening throughout England and Wales for varroa mites that are resistant to authorised treatments, having first detected them in August 2001. To date, resistance remains isolated to certain areas of Devon and Cornwall. However, the NBU's advice to beekeepers is to remain alert to the threat of further spread and to report any suspected cases to them.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.2/2">At EU level, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1221&ndash;97 provides for member states to assist the beekeeping sector to improve the production and marketing of honey by alleviating the burden placed on it by varroa. The EU reimburses up to 50 per cent. of Member States' expenditure on certain beekeeping measures. In the past year, the UK has received &pound;324,000 under these measures for approved actions taken to combat varroa. The main thrust of most member states' programmes is, like the UK, to support the control of varroa through technical advice, the provision of diagnostic services and R&amp;D.</p>

	<p pid=".718W.5/1">The control of certain birds, including woodpigeons, is permitted under a series of general licences issued by my Department. This system, first introduced in 1992, offers a practical and easily understood method of control of certain bird species and ensures that birds are killed or taken by certain methods only, with the minimum of distress to the birds.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.5/2">Control of birds under the general licences has generally worked well, however a recent High Court judgment has illustrated that there may be areas where review of the general licences would be useful. Officials will consult stakeholders shortly and revise the licences where changes are considered necessary.</p>

Funding provides for two years of high quality management training together with mentoring opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.3/3">A number of senior posts are filled through open competition as fixed term appointments. Advertisements for these vacancies would normally carry the caption: &quot;The Ministry of Defence is an equal opportunities employer&quot; and stress the point that applications from people with disabilities are particularly welcome. The advertisements also carry the two-ticks &quot;positive about disability&quot; symbol and the Department is committed to offering all candidates who declare a disability a guaranteed interview where they meet the minimum qualifying criteria. We are currently trialling the use of specialist recruitment consultants to help to publicise open competitions to disabled potential applicants.</p>

	<p pid=".720W.9/1">Umm Qasr is one of several routes by which aid has entered and will continue to enter Iraq (including by land from Jordan and Kuwait). We do not record the amount of aid entering Iraq by non-United Kingdom Government Agencies so we cannot calculate the respective shares of the total. Once Umm Qasr is open to shipping we expect the proportion of aid entering Iraq by sea to rise significantly, since the rail links from the port to the rest of the country make it a particularly efficient way of handling bulk supplies of aid.</p>

	<p pid=".723W.2/1">Exclusion periods enable underwriters to protect themselves from excessive risks by closing schemes to new applicants. Most insurance contracts contain arrangements for exclusion periods, which may often be applied retrospectively by up to 30 days, as is the case with the current PAX and RPAX policies.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.2/2">These arrangements protect the scheme against those seeking short-term cover at the last minute and helps keep premiums affordable for prudent long-term members. Consequently it is planned that the replacement PAX and RPAX contract, which will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>, will continue to contain such arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.2/3">We encourage service personnel to recognise the long-term nature of life insurance throughout their service and not just at times of more active duty&mdash;when they may seek cover too late, just as schemes are withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.3/1">The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has improved compared to the situation last year, and is no longer an emergency. This is due both to an increased crop yield (up 80 per cent. on the previous year) and to much better snow and rainfall over the winter in both the north and south of the country, which has eased the effects of the persistent drought. Refugees are continuing to return to the country, aided by UNHCR and the Ministry for Refugees and Repatriation, although at a slower rate than last year. Vulnerable households, such as women-headed households, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and disabled people continue to require assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/2">Insecurity in the provinces outside Kabul continues to be a concern, and is hampering the operations of NGOs and UN agencies in the southern and eastern provinces. As part of a co-ordinated response with the Afghan Transitional Administration and other international partners the UK Government are considering the deployment of a Provincial Reconstruction Team to one of the provinces outside Kabul. The Ministry of Defence will make a full parliamentary statement on any deployment in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".736W.8/1">Humanitarian Mine Action is critical for the Sri Lankan peace process. The civil war has displaced nearly one million people in the North and East of the Island. Helping these people and their families return to their former homes, and restart their livelihoods, will build confidence in the peace process and will help foster an environment in which peace can be sustained. However, many of these families are unable to benefit from the peace process. They are living in camps, prevented from returning home because of mines.</p>
	<p pid=".736W.8/2">DFID is a major supporter of mine action in Sri Lanka. We have provided over &pound;1 million through the United Nations for demining and public awareness. Further support will be provided within a &pound;6 million contribution recently approved to support UNICEF's Children Affected By Armed Conflict programme. In addition Britain also contributes to the support for mine action which the European Union finances through international and local NGOs in Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p pid=".743W.6/6">It is an offence under Section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971, as amended by Section 143 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to assist in unlawful immigration to the United Kingdom, and Section 145 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum (NIA) Act 2002 has also made it an offence to traffic in prostitution.

	<p pid=".744W.2/1">Child victims of trafficking are referred to social services to receive assistance and support based on their particular needs. They may arrive in this country as unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, or accompanied by an adult. In the latter case, if anyone who comes into contact with the child is concerned that the child is the victim of abuse or neglect, they should refer the child to the relevant local authority's social services department. Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum will also be referred to social services. Social services have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs or, where appropriate, by arranging for the provision of services from other agencies. This care will be determined by a needs assessment according to the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families. Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and&mdash;in many cases&mdash;protection under the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/2">Where there is a risk to the life of a child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, for example the police or councils with social services responsibilities, should act quickly to secure the immediate initial safety of the child. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure that the child remains in, or is removed to, a safe place. Under s.20 of the Children Act 1989, a local authority may provide accommodation for any child within their area if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child's welfare. This may involve placing the child in a foster placement or it may place the child in a children's home.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/3">There are only very limited circumstances in which it is an option to hold a young person in secure accommodation. The Children Act 1989 permits that children may only be held in secure conditions if they satisfy certain specific grounds such as a likelihood of absconding together with a likelihood that injury would be caused to the young person themselves or others. This requires the approval of the courts.</p>

Some manufacturers voluntarily introduced a 25ml gas lighter refill, but progress towards an industry-wide agreement to reduce the refills to a maximum size of 25ml was hampered by anti-competitive considerations and practical difficulties.</p>

Nor have I received any representations in favour of increasing the use of plastic bottles in bars and clubs from the police, environmental agencies or other interested parties.

Friend for Harrow West, (Mr. Thomas) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-28">28 March 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-03-28.451"><i>Official Report</i>, column 451W</phrase>. We remain concerned about the high level of injuries that occur when glasses and bottles are used as weapons in drink-related situations in and outside licensed premises and other drinking establishments, and we intend to see that this problem is effectively tackled. The Licensing Bill Guidance that has been published in draft by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will include a range of conditions that a licensing authority could impose on a premises to address violence of this form.</p>
	<p pid=".756W.5/3">My officials are working closely with the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit on their study to produce a national strategy for reducing the harm associated with alcohol misuse. The study, which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-19">19 July 2002</phrase>, is paying particular attention to the issue of alcohol-related violence, and views have been sought and obtained from a wide variety of organisations and individuals.</p>

	<p pid=".756W.11/2">Before the full PPAF is introduced, an interim assessment framework is being used to compare policing performance. The National Policing Plan 2002&ndash;06 details 13 interim performance indicators against which performance is being assessed.

	<p pid=".758W.5/1">The Home Office is providing funding for victims of serious road incidents in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.5/2">The police are able to use their general grant settlement to deploy family liaison officers for serious road incidents. The resource made available is a local operational matter. However, since this April, family liaison officers are routinely deployed at fatal incidents or those which seem likely to result in a fatality. In carrying out their duties, family liaison officers issue a copy of the Brake guide &quot;Advice for bereaved families and friends following a death on the road&quot;. In 2003&ndash;04, the Home Office is providing Brake with a grant of &pound;46,752 to ensure its production and distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.5/3">The core funding provided to Victim Support allows them to provide a Witness Service in all Crown and magistrates courts. If a road traffic incident involves a court case, the victim or their family can access this support.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.5/4">The White Paper, &quot;Justice for All&quot; included a proposal to extend specialist support for road traffic victims. Pilot projects are currently being set up to test the most effective ways of providing support.</p>

	<p pid=".760W.2/1">At present the Home Office does not directly fund rape counselling services. During the financial year 2002&ndash;03, the Department paid a grant of &pound;302,000 to the Rape Crisis Federation (RCF), an umbrella body for a network of some 40 local rape crisis centres in England and Wales. This grant enabled the Federation to provide a range of support services to its member groups, but was not intended to provide direct services to rape victims.</p>
	<p pid=".760W.2/2">The Department's main programme for providing support services to victims of crime, including victims of rape and sexual assault, is through its grant in aid to the organisation Victim Support. Total Home Office funding to Victim Support during 2002&ndash;03 was &pound;29.3 million. It is not possible to put a precise figure on how much of this funding was spent on services to victims of rape and sexual assault.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.4/1">A waiting time target of a maximum one month from diagnosis to first treatment was introduced for all cases of breast cancer in 2001. In the last quarter&mdash;October to December 2002&mdash;96.5 per cent. of women received their first treatment within a month of diagnosis with breast cancer. Separate data on waiting times for radiotherapy are not collected centrally. In order to tackle radiotherapy waiting times, we are making unprecedented investment in new radiotherapy facilities, streamlining care processes through the cancer services collaborative and working to best utilise the current workforce and to increase the number of staff in post and in training.</p>

	<p pid=".762W.5/2">The West Gloucestershire primary care trust (PCT) has made no representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health about the provision of infertility services. Along with other PCTs, it is awaiting the outcome of the review of infertility services by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).</p>
	<p pid=".762W.5/3">In NICE we have a means of bringing order to what has, until now, often been an unfair way for patients to access treatment and care. NICE guidelines will provide recommendations for good practice based on the best available evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness. The guidelines emerging from NICE will reflect the three stages of infertility services, which are primary care, where couples first contact their general practitioner, secondary care for more advanced exploration and treatments, and tertiary centres that provide the high tech treatments such as in-vitro fertilisation.</p>
	<p pid=".762W.5/4">Overall, however, we are seeking to achieve integrated guidance so that when couples have to be referred on to a further stage in the investigation and treatment of their infertility they can be offered a seamless service.</p>
	<p pid=".762W.5/5">We expect the guidance produced by NICE to be implemented consistently across the national health service and the uptake of this guidance will be monitored locally and by the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection. Clinicians have to make an independent clinical judgement taking due account of NICE's advice and the strength of evidence which lies behind it.</p>

Most of those studies demonstrating the effectiveness of methadone are of on-going maintenance treatment but the evidence generally becomes weaker as the duration of treatment shortens, with little systematic evidence to support short-term detoxification. Specific studies include Fontain &amp; Ansseau, 1995, Glass, 1993 and Gossop, M. et al., 2001. High quality medical and psychosocial services, a clear orientation towards social rehabilitation, treatment longevity and slow detoxification of well-stabilised patients have all been identified as giving the best outcomes, including reducing overdose deaths.</p>

	<p pid=".764W.8/1">Data are not collected centrally on waiting times for diagnostic scans nor has any central guidance been issued. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be scanned.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.8/2">Where a scan forms part of the diagnostic process for a patient urgently referred with suspected cancer, this will be covered by the target of a maximum two months wait from urgent referral to first treatment, which will be in place for all cancers by the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.8/3">To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners. The New Opportunities Fund has provided funding for 57 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and the NHS Cancer Plan has provided funding for a further 50 MRI and 50 computed tomography scanners through central purchasing programmes by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".771W.3/1">In May 2000 my Department set targets to increase the number of staff with disabilities in the Senior Civil Service (SCS) to 3 per cent. by <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>; and to 4.5 per cent. by <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase> 3.6 per cent. of the SCS had declared a disability taking us beyond the target for the date.</p>
	<p pid=".771W.3/2">My Department uses open competition in selection which provides a wide pool of diverse applicants, and advertisements are placed in the disability media. A comprehensive outreach pack giving practical guidance on widening our appeal as an employer is currently being finalised. An annual report incorporating employment statistics by disability is produced and published to all staff. A mandatory Diversity Awareness Training course for all staff and a staff-run Disability Network assists in creating an environment in which individuals with a disability are encouraged to declare their disability. A team of Disabled Persons' Liaison Officers works with the Disability Service Teams at Job Centre Plus to provide advice and assistance. My Department promotes actively the Bursary Scheme for civil servants with a disability and provides mentors from the SCS to support the Scheme. The Department nominates a group of delegates annually to attend the Civil Service College &quot;Personal Development for Disabled People&quot; course. To promote the European Year of Disabled People, a series of articles is being published on particular disabilities in our internal departmental journal and comprehensive guidance is being prepared for individuals with disabilities and their managers on how to obtain reasonable adjustments, in the field of employment.</p>

Some additional costs to the Department may arise if external contractors providing services such as cleaning and catering are affected by the increase in the national minimum wage, but at this stage it is not possible to assess what these costs might be.</p>
