	<p pid="a.483W.3/2">The 2010 survey indicated that 9% of the population within England and Wales (4.2 million) have been freshwater fishing within the last two years. 3.3 million anglers had been fishing within the previous year. The report suggests possible reasons for the discrepancy between this figure and the 1.3 million rod licences sold may include:</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.3/3">high evasion levels among anglers who fish infrequently;</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.3/4">interpretation of &#8216;going fishing&#8217;, for example, accompanying an angler rather than personally fishing which would not require a licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.3/5">The EA&#8217;s target for rod licence income for 2011-12 is &#163;24.4 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.8/2">No rolling stock procurement strategy has yet been determined, no procurement process commenced, and, therefore, no bids have been received. As the Department is currently consulting the public on the principle of High Speed Two (HS2) and is yet to seek powers from Parliament, it would be inappropriate to prepare a procurement strategy at this stage. However, the Department would ensure that any future procurement is undertaken in accordance with EU treaty principles which ensure fair and open competition and thereby value for money for the taxpayer. No inquiries have been received in relation to submitting bids for the design of rolling stock for HS2.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.0/2">The business case for High Speed Two (HS2) assumes that the existing fares structure would operate on both the existing lines and on HS2. Depending on the franchise or other management and operating arrangements introduced on each respective line, it would be possible that the increase in passenger capacity would apply a downward pressure on fares. The project is currently at an early stage; subject to the outcome of the current consultation, these issues would be considered in more detail as the project is developed. Failing to provide sufficient additional capacity on the west coast and other main lines would be likely to lead to an upward pressure on fares.</p>

	<p pid="a.506W.2/3">The ORN is a requirement of the host nation contract between London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is considered vital to ensure that athletes, technical officials, accredited media and others working at the Games can get to their events on time. It is being designed and implemented to seek to minimise disruption in London. For example, temporary Games Lanes for official Games vehicles, and blue-light emergency vehicles on call will only be used on the busiest parts of the ORN&#8212;less than 1% of London's roads&#8212;and where there is sufficient space for other traffic.</p>

	<p pid="a.507W.6/1">As part of the Government's measures to address climate change, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) ensures a growing proportion of UK road transport fuels are from sustainable renewable sources. The RTFO includes a certificate trading mechanism to increase the efficiency of compliance. The value of individual Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) is determined by the market and depends upon the relative cost of supplying biofuel and fossil fuels. RTFCs for the obligation period 2010-11 have sold at 15p to 24p at auction. We continue to monitor the market value of RTFCs and consider that to date the RTFO has met its objective of driving a market for renewable transport fuels in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.6/2">We are currently analysing responses to proposals to amend the RTFO to implement the Renewable Energy Directive. These proposals include providing additional support for biofuels derived from waste, such as biodiesel made from used cooking oil, and advanced biofuel, so long as it meets certain mandatory standards for sustainability. This would be achieved through awarding two RTFCs to each litre of such fuel supplied.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.6/3">Crop-based biofuels will continue to get one RTFC per litre, as long as they meet the mandatory sustainability standard. So the proposed change will give twice the financial support to biofuels derived from waste, and advanced biofuel, as conventional biofuels, and no support to biofuels that do not meet required sustainability standards.</p>

For private family law cases, such as disputes about children or finance following the breakdown of a relationship, legal aid will be available for victims of domestic violence where there is objective evidence of the need for protection.

Of these 1,225, the ADR was judged to lead directly to the admission in 80% of cases. The median bed stay was eight days, accounting for 4% of the hospital bed capacity.

	<p pid="a.527W.5/1">We have proposed that it would be a requirement for every general practitioner (GP) practice to be part of a clinical commissioning group and to contribute to its goals. However, our proposed model will mean that not all GPs have to be actively involved in every aspect of commissioning. Their predominant focus will continue to be on providing high quality primary care to their patients. It is likely to be a smaller group of GPs and clinicians who would lead a clinical commissioning group and play an active role in the clinical design of local services.</p>

	<p pid="a.535W.0/1">The Department's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Policy Research Programme (PRP) fund a range of research relating to stillbirth causes, risk factors and prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.0/2">The NIHR Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme is currently funding a &#163;6.0 million trial of an intelligent system to support decision making in the management of labour using the cardiotocogram. The study started in 2009 and is led by University College London. It will test whether an intelligent computer program can help midwives and doctors improve the care they give in response to abnormalities of the baby's heart rate and whether this will lead to fewer babies being harmed because of a lack of oxygen.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.0/3">The HTA programme is also funding a &#163;1.4 million trial of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy led by the University of Nottingham, and a &#163;1.2 million trial of physical activity as an aid to smoking cessation during pregnancy led by St. George's, University of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.0/4">Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust has been awarded a &#163;1.1 million NIHR Programme Grant for Applied Research on improving pregnancy outcome in obese women.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.0/5">The NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre has an ongoing programme of research on women's health. A major focus of this research is understanding the determinants of stillbirth risk. The researchers are building on basic science studies in oxidative stress, placental transport, genomic imprinting, maternal-fetal immune reactions and application of genomic technology in order to develop an integrated method of screening pregnant women. This will both determine their risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and identify novel genetic and molecular markers for adverse perinatal outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.537W.0/1">The National Radiotherapy Implementation Group (NRIG) report, &#8220;Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) Guidelines for Commissioners, Providers and Clinicians in England 2011&#8221;, which has been made available on the National Cancer Action Team website, made a comprehensive assessment of the technology capable of delivering SBRT. A copy of the NRIG report has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) can now use the report to identify whether there are any indications for SBRT that would be appropriate for them to evaluate further via the Medical Technologies Advisory Committee or other programmes at NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/3">The assessment undertaken in the report included consideration of whether the technology could deliver radiotherapy that takes account of the movement of tumours during treatment (intra- and inter-fraction motion management). It was not within the scope of the group tasked with producing the report to set a tariff for the treatment of lung cancer with SBRT. However, the report does recommend the development of a tariff for SBRT, and, in our new cancer strategy, we have said we will investigate the potential development of a range of tariffs to incentivise high quality, cost-effective services, including the newest radiotherapy techniques.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/4">SBRT is commissioned as a specialised service by regional Specialised Commissioning Groups and as informed by the Specialised Services National Definitions Set. Our intention, subject to parliamentary approval, is that in the future services such as SBRT for people with rare and complex cancers should be directly commissioned by the National Health Service Commissioning Board (NHS CB).</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/5">The Government's response to the Future's Forum report re-confirmed and strengthened &#8216;no decision about me without me&#8217; as a principle that will be central to how the new organisations operate. A Specialised Services Transitional Oversight Group has been formed, supported by a Specialised Services Patient and Public Engagement Steering Group, to make sure that public and patient voice informs the proposed NHS CB's plans for commissioning Specialised Services.</p>

ODA spending is divided between a number of Departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.6/1">Valuation Officers of the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) are required to follow legal precedent in determining whether each market trader has a separate occupation within a market or whether the market operator is in occupation of the whole market and it should therefore have a single assessment. The VOA has been carrying out a review of markets following concern that there was differential treatment between markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.6/2">The National Market Traders' Federation (NMTF) and the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA) have been consulted and involved from the outset. Valuation officers have written to traders in affected markets and offered and held meetings to discuss the changes where representations have been made. While there have been concerns from individual stall holders, the VOA have sought to mitigate this by consulting in advance with stallholders on their proposed rateable values and raising awareness of small business rate relief. CLG have also encouraged market owners (mostly local authorities) who will no longer have to pay rates to pass this saving on to the stallholders in reduced rents.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.6/3">In addition VOA staff have attended a number of regional NABMA meetings to discuss issues around the review with representatives of traders and market managers.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.4/1">A wide range of biomass feedstocks can be used for electricity generation. Dry agricultural residues such as straw can be combusted to generate electricity. Wet biomass residues such as food waste, sewage and manure can be processed in an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant to produce biogas. Woodfuel can be sourced from timber processing residues, such as off-cuts and sawdust, and by diverting waste wood from landfill, as well as from small round-wood and thinnings from sustainably managed forests. Perennial energy crops, such as miscanthus grass and short rotation coppice (SRC) willow which can be cultivated on farmland unsuitable for food crops, can provide a fast-growing source of biomass fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.4/2">We expect large-scale biomass electricity to be primarily fuelled by imports, and that the global supply market will respond to the growth of renewable energy in this country and worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.4/3">Whether biomass feedstocks for energy are sourced from a forest, farm or elsewhere and whether it is homegrown or imported, it is essential that they are sustainably sourced. Therefore in April, we introduced a requirement to report on sustainability criteria under the Renewables Obligation (RO). These criteria include a minimum greenhouse gas lifecycle saving of 60% compared to fossil fuel, which considers the cultivation, processing and transport of the feedstock, and general restrictions on using biomass sourced from areas important on carbon or biodiversity grounds such as primary forests.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.4/4">We intend, from April 2013, that biomass electricity plants of 1 MWe or above will be required to meet the sustainability criteria to receive financial support under the RO.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.4/5">In addition, the Government recognises that with one of the lowest levels of woodland cover in Europe, England's natural environment needs more trees and woodlands. The Forestry Commission is working with other Government Departments and many stakeholder groups through the Woodland Carbon Task Force to provide frameworks to enable the use of private finance and public engagement to expand woodland cover and to increase the benefits that can be derived from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.4/6">During 2011-12 the Forestry Commission intends to distribute a further &#163;30.6 million as part of the woodland related components of the Rural Development Programme for England of which &#163;14.9 million will support woodland expansion.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.4/7">Forestry Commission Scotland recognises that forestry can make a significant contribution to mitigating the effects of climate change and meeting the Scottish Government's targets for renewable energy. To support this, during 2011-12 Forestry Commission Scotland intends to distribute a further &#163;36 million as part of the woodland related components in the Rural Priorities schemes of the Scottish Rural Development Programme, of which &#163;30 million has been allocated to support approved proposals for woodland creation and sustainable forest management.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.2/1">The Department takes account of demand from non-energy sectors in assessing the supply of sustainable biomass available for the generation of electricity and heat, and the subsidies that should apply to bringing forward that generation. We believe this is the best way to avoid supply pressures on other users of biomass feedstocks. Assumptions and analysis of biomass availability and prices will be published alongside the RO banding review consultation due this summer. This analysis also underpins a UK bioenergy strategy which the Government will publish later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.2/2">We expect large-scale biomass electricity plants to be fuelled by imported feedstocks.

	<p pid="a.553W.5/1">Our policy is to increase the supply of sustainable biomass, including wood residues, wood and food waste, available to the UK market. This will enable the growth of all UK biomass-using industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.5/2">We expect that large-scale biomass electricity will be primarily fuelled by imports. In terms of domestic supply, around 40% of the UK's forests and woodlands, as measured by land area, are not currently under an active management plan. This is a major missed opportunity for the UK in terms of biodiversity as well as the potential wood supplies. The Forestry Commission is developing a new Woodfuel Woodland Improvement Grant (WIG) which will offer a 60% contribution to costs of forest roads, access tracks and other related harvesting infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.5/3">We are also encouraging our electricity generators to look beyond forests and woodlands when sourcing biomass feedstocks. Biomass suitable for energy generation can come from a very wide range of plant and animal based materials, many of which are unsuitable as raw materials for our wood processing industries. These include perennial energy crops such as miscanthus grass and short rotation coppice (SRC) willow, which can be grown on lower grade land unsuitable for food crops. Similarly, dry farming residues such as straw can be combusted for energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.5/4">The Renewables Obligation (RO) currently provides additional support for energy crops over other biomass feedstocks. This &#8216;uplift&#8217; of 0.5 ROC aims to stimulate interest in energy crops by the power generation sector and to help develop the fuel supply chain. Support is also provided directly to farmers through the Energy Crops Scheme (ECS) which is part of DEFRA's Rural Development Programme for England. The ECS provides grants that reimburse 50% of planting costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.5/5">The support available for electricity produced using anaerobic digestion under the Renewables Obligation or Feed-in Tariffs is encouraging the collection and use of suitable wet biomass feedstocks including food waste and manure. The joint DECC and DEFRA Anaerobic Digestion strategy and action plan, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-14">14 June</phrase>, sets out how we will enable a thriving industry to grow in England over the next few years, delivering new green jobs as well as new green energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.5/6">In addition, DEFRA recently announced that it will consult next year on introducing a landfill restriction on wood waste, and review the case for introducing landfill bans on other materials, such as metals, textiles and all biodegradable waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.5/1">Measurements have shown that acidification of the world's oceans is occurring as a direct result of increased uptake of higher levels of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and scientists estimate that a 30% increase in ocean acidity has occurred since pre-industrial times. Ocean acidification is thus not a direct result of global warming. However, additionally as ocean temperature increases in response to climate change, its capacity to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will be reduced slightly.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.5/2">DEFRA, DECC and the Natural Environment Research Council are jointly funding the five-year UK Ocean Acidification Research Programme to improve predictions of future changes in ocean chemistry and understand the impacts of ocean acidification on the marine environment and the consequences for society.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.5/3">The IPCC s Fourth Assessment Report (2007) and scientific research published since 2007 have concluded that global sea levels will likely rise by between 0.18 and 0.59 metres (relative to 1980-1999) by the end of this century as a result of global warming, but this estimate did not take account of the effect of ice melt in Greenland and Antarctica which were too uncertain.</p>

On Europe day (<phrase class="date" code="2011-05-09">9 May</phrase>), posts in EU and EU-applicant countries display the European flag.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.0/2">The British flag has precedence. In all cases where it is deployed, the European flag is displayed alongside, not instead of, the British Diplomatic, Consular or (in Commonwealth countries) Union flag.</p>

	<p pid="a.569W.9/1">The term &#8216;visual data security' is an ambiguous one. For the purposes of this response the Department assumes that it is intended to relate to visual threats to the security of data.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.9/2">The Department requires all its staff to complete a mandatory, annual refresher training module in Protecting Information. This training covers all aspects of information protection and includes specific guidance on managing visual threats (eg on-screen e-mail, documents or papers being overlooked) within the office, while travelling and when working in public spaces. On completion of this annual training module all staff are required to complete and pass an assessment test to ensure that they have absorbed and understood the material. In addition to this 'Level 1' Protecting Information training module that is completed annually by all staff there are also a further three levels of Protecting Information training which DFE staff with particular Information Assurance responsibilities complete each year. These further training modules are made available to all DFE staff but apply in particular to the Department's project/line managers, information asset owners and the senior information risk owner.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.9/3">Further guidance for all staff on the protection of information on PC, laptop, and BlackBerry screens, especially when outside departmental premises, is maintained on the information security pages on the departmental intranet.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.9/4">The mandatory annual training for all staff is supplemented by a range of further targeted (by group and/or topic) activity to promote best practice across the Department in the management of data security threats. Recent examples of activities that the Department has carried out which have included specific guidance on managing visual threats to the security of data include:</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.9/5">Production of a tailored briefing pack on security requirements and best practice for DFE Ministers;</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.9/6">A series of briefing sessions on security requirements and best practice given by specialist security practitioners to staff working in the private offices of DFE Ministers and the permanent secretary;</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.9/7">A note issued to all DFE staff making clear the Department's expectations of them in regard to avoiding the leaking of sensitive material.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.9/8">The Department also employs a number of specialist security practitioners to provide expert advice, direction, challenge and assurance in all aspects of the Department's management of security risk, including visual threats to the security of data. These specialists undergo ongoing professional training and development to ensure that they remain up-to-date with the latest HMG standards, good practice guidance and emerging threats.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.5/2">In most cases, the negotiations to finalise grants for relationship support have resulted in amendments to the proposals first submitted in the bid document. The Department will therefore supply the hon. Member with copies of the grant funding agreements with these organisations as these give a clearer picture of the services to be provided. I will write to the hon. Member with those details shortly and place copies in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/3">Grant funding has been allocated for 2011-13. Individual organisation's funding for 2012-13 will, of course, depend on delivery in the current year, as set out the grant funding agreements between the organisations and the Department. I anticipate that the Department will allocate funding for relationship support for the period 2013-15 during autumn/winter 2012. The shape of this funding will depend in part on early findings from evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/4">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have not yet been agreed between the Department and each of the funded organisations. KPIs will be tailored to each organisation to reflect the nature of the grant funded activities so will vary between organisations. I will write to the hon. Member once they are agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.578W.2/1">Criminal record and associated personal information is retained on the Police National Computer (PNC) in accordance with guidelines issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers. Such information is normally held until the subject reaches 100 years of age.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.2/2">It is essential to retain certain personal records on the PNC to assist the police and other agencies in protecting the public. There are currently no plans to legislate to change the existing position. However, the Government's Independent Advisor for Criminality Information Management, Mrs Sunita Mason, is continuing with her review of the criminal records regime and I understand she will be submitting her final report shortly. Further consideration will be given to this issue of retention in developing the Government's response to that report.</p>

	<p pid="a.584W.5/1">Article 10 of European directive 2010/63 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes requires that from dates set out in annex II to the directive, member states shall ensure that all non-human primates listed in that annex may only be used in procedures where they are the offspring of animals bred in captivity or sourced from self-sustaining colonies. Under article 10, the European Commission must carry out a feasibility study by <phrase class="date" code="2017-11-10">10 November 2017</phrase> to confirm or amend the dates in annex II. The United Kingdom contribution to the feasibility study will be considered at the appropriate time when consulted by the Commission. Directive 2010/63/EU must be implemented by member states from <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-01">1 January 2013</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.5/2">Article 10 also requires that animals of all species of non-human primates used in scientific procedures must be purpose bred unless there is justification for the use of wild caught animals. The United Kingdom has operated a similar policy since 1995 and has not authorised the first time use of wild caught primates for more than 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.584W.8/2">Data on police recorded offences of sexual assault are collected by the Home Office. Due to recording changes, the data are not comparable across the period requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.8/3">The National Crime Recording Standard was introduced in April 2002 and data are not comparable before and after this date. Additionally, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was introduced in May 2004 and this altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences. The data are shown separately for 2000-01 to 2001-02 and for 2002-03 to 2009-10 in Tables A and B respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.8/4">Data on reported sexual assaults which resulted in convictions are not available as it is not possible to track individual offences through to their outcome at court. These data are published on a calendar year basis and are counts of persons classified by their principal offence. As such, convictions data cannot be directly compared to police recorded crime data.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.8/5">Convictions data are based on the number of offenders and have been provided by the Ministry of Justice in Table C. Data are provided for the number of defendants found guilty of sexual assault in England, the north-west and Cumbria police force area for 2000 to 2010. Information on convictions is not collated below police force area centrally by the Ministry of Justice. The data are a further breakdown of those published in the Criminal Statistics, Supplementary Volumes for England and Wales for the years 2000 to 2010. Court proceedings data for 2011 will be available in the spring of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.8/6">The Court Proceedings Database holds information on defendants proceeded against, found guilty and sentenced for criminal offences in England and Wales. These data include information on the age of the defendant, their gender, the police force area and the court where the proceedings took place as well as the offence and statute for the offence.</p>

Based on the most recent SWI survey the number of new cases of &#8220;breathing and lung problems&#8221; caused or made worse by work during 2009-10 was estimated to be between 9,000 and 23,000 and a proportion of these cases are likely to be consistent with symptoms of occupational asthma.</p>
	<p pid="a.593W.6/3">2. The Health and Occupation Reporting Network General Practitioner scheme (THOR GP) scheme&#8212;in which a sample of GPs record all new cases of occupational disease they see. The estimated annual incidence of work-related respiratory disease according to THOR was approximately 10,000 new cases per year during 2007-09. Information about the disease types suggests a substantial proportion of these will relate to occupational asthma.</p>
	<p pid="a.593W.6/4">The data on respiratory disease provided by SWI and THOR GP enable the overall scale of these diseases to be estimated. It is not possible for the data to be broken down into detailed occupation or industry group because of the small number of actual cases reported by these data sources. Therefore, any estimates by industry group would be unreliable.</p>

	<p pid="a.594W.3/1">A central part of the vision set out in the Green Paper &quot;Strengthening families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child maintenance&quot; is to make it easier for parents to access the support already available to deal with the effects of separation in a way that recognises their ongoing responsibilities as parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.3/2">During the Green Paper consultation, we have been talking to experts in the voluntary and community sector (VCS) who understand families' needs, including among others the Centre for Separated Families, Relate, and Gingerbread, and they tell us that local support itself could be delivered in a more integrated fashion. We will continue to work with the sector to understand how best to facilitate more joined-up services.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.3/3">We know from our discussions with VCS organisations that when families encounter problems it is often trusted professionals that parents turn to first. VCS have cited examples such as Sure Start children's centre workers and GPs, though of course the range of professionals who parents may approach first could be wider.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.3/4">We want to make it easier for the professionals that separating parents first approach to know what support is available and direct parents to that support. We will continue to work with colleagues in the Department for Education and other Government Departments to understand how this would work in practice, recognising the need to avoid placing undue burdens on professionals who are already working hard to support families in a range of different ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.3/5">We need to get this right for the long-term, to take forward the reform of the child maintenance system begun by the previous Government, following the recommendations of Sir David Henshaw, and set the system in the context of the range of support parents may need when they separate.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.3/6">We aim to publish the Government's response to the consultation shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.598W.8/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-01">1 August 2011</phrase>, jobseeker's allowance claimants who fail to undertake education or training without good cause when required to do so will lose all of their benefit or training allowance for a fixed period of two, four or up to 26 weeks. Employment and support allowance claimants in the work-related activity group who fail to undertake education or training without good cause when required to do so will lose 50% of the work-related activity component for the first four weeks and then 100% of the component thereafter until they meet the requirements of the mandatory referral to education or training.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.8/2">The Welfare Reform Bill introduces a clearer sanctions structure which will apply across all working-age benefits. This will have different levels, including a higher level for the most serious failures. Failures to undertake mandatory education or training will not be sanctioned at the higher level. Where jobseeker's allowance or employment and support allowance claimants do not have good reason for failing to accept a mandatory referral to education or training, they will receive a lower-level sanction, of which there will be two components: an open -ended period which will end when a claimant re-engages, followed by a fixed period of one, two or four weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.598W.11/2">The information requested is in the following table. This shows the Department&#8217;s forecast of the number of people receiving contributory employment and support allowance (ESA) with durations of 365 days or less, or greater than 365 days, in any day of each financial year. This is calculated by adding the case load at the end of the financial year with the number of claimants who have ceased claiming contributory ESA during the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.11/3">For those who leave the contributory ESA as a result of the time limit, it is estimated that around 60% are expected to be fully or partially compensated by income-related ESA, so will retain entitlement to ESA.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.11/4">There will be some people leaving the benefit because their health improves; others health will deteriorate and they will move from the WRAG into the support group. Those claimants that remain in the WRAG will include claimants whose conditions fluctuate or who have developed other functional impairments.</p>

Jobcentre Plus also has specialist programmes that help disabled people move into paid work, such as Residential Training and Work Choice.

The Work Programme will simplify the complex array of existing employment programmes and deliver coherent, integrated support, more capable of dealing with complex and overlapping barriers to work, providing personalised help for people who find themselves out of work regardless of the benefit they claim. Disability employment advisers will also be able to refer claimants to Work Programme where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.601W.2/1">EU nationals who have worked and paid sufficient national insurance contributions, and meet the other conditions of entitlement, may be entitled to contributory benefits such as jobseeker's allowance. Those who have not paid sufficient contributions may claim income-related benefits providing they satisfy the habitual residence test and meet the other conditions of entitlement. EU nationals may also be entitled to child benefit and tax credits if, among the usual conditions, they are physically present in the UK, ordinarily resident in the UK, and have a right to reside in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.2/2">Robust gateway checks are already in place to prevent national insurance numbers (NINOs) being used fraudulently for the purpose of abusing the benefit system. For example, where the Department identifies that a NINO has been used for attempted benefit fraud or is aware that it may be vulnerable to fraudulent use, the relevant account is annotated accordingly on our systems and any subsequent benefit claim using that NINO would automatically be subjected to close scrutiny and, if appropriate, be referred to the Department's Fraud Investigation Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.2/3">In addition to this, robust identity verification checks are in place to prevent fraudsters acquiring NINOs. During 2010-11, Jobcentre Plus refused to allocate 50,000 NINOs as the applicants had failed to meet one or more of the checks we have in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.2/4">In 2009, following intelligence from Jobcentre Plus staff, DWP developed and introduced further checks to strengthen the NINO allocation process to counter fraud where individuals, often from countries within the EU, are trafficked into the UK by criminals for the purpose of fraudulently accessing the benefit and tax credits systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.605W.2/3">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking at which locations in Scotland Jobcentre Plus officials share office accommodation with other Government Departments and their Executive Agencies. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/4">Jobcentre Plus in Scotland currently shares many of its offices across the country with other UK Government Departments including: DWP's Pensions Disability and Carers Service; Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs; The Identity and Passport Service and many others. We also share accommodation with some agencies of the Scottish Government, for example Skills Development Scotland. I have attached a complete list</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/5">at Annex 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/6">Under the terms of the Spending Review, DWP, including Jobcentre Plus, is being asked to make significant efficiencies in its work to meet a 26 per cent reduction in real terms from its core budget. To help achieve the level of efficiencies required we will be reviewing our network of Jobcentres to see if there are further opportunities for outreach or co-location, and scope for rationalisation of Jobcentres whilst retaining a local presence. Once we have developed our proposals we will share these with local stakeholders, including MPs and MSPs, as part of our normal consultation arrangements for service delivery.</p>

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.2/4">I realise that the announcements which we made on 13th May regarding the closure of 22 benefit and contact centres will be unsettling to all staff. The line managers of staff at affected centres are available to support them, both now and throughout the next few months. Our immediate priority is to understand individual circumstances, and so we have just completed initial one-to-one discussions between the individuals and their line managers to discuss the closures and how it might affect them and to talk about their personal circumstances. We expect to have further one-to-one discussions throughout the period until closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.2/5">Managers will also be able to answer or deal with any questions or concerns that staff may have. Where the manager does not have the necessary information we have introduced an issues escalation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.2/6">In addition, staff who are union members may also want to speak to their Trade Union representative. We did arrange for a Trade Union representative to be on site on 13th May who took time to talk to members of staff. Since then, we have also allowed additional facility time for members of the PCS Group Executive Committee to attend sites to discuss the closures with staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.2/7">If staff would prefer to speak with someone from outside the Department, our Employee Assistance provider, Right Corecare, is available 24 hours a day. Our contract with Right Corecare provides unlimited confidential access to their helplines on 0800 652 3304.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.2/8">In addition, managers will have regular communications with staff and will keep them informed of any developments as they occur. We will also use the full range of our existing communications channels, including our intranet pages and events such as Your Call, which is a live audio conference event where people in Jobcentre Plus can speak directly to me and my Jobcentre Plus Board members to get answers to their questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.607W.2/4">DWP will always take all possible steps, including redeploying people into other jobs, to avoid compulsory redundancy. The Department has an excellent track record in securing alternative roles for its people and would not want to use public money for redundancy schemes unless absolutely necessary. Our plans to enlarge some sites, and our robust workforce planning and workforce management arrangements will all help us towards avoiding a situation where compulsory redundancy is necessary. However, we cannot guarantee this.</p>

Benefits can be regarded as active if entitlement does or can require the recipient to undertake labour-market or work-preparation activities as a condition of entitlement in order to improve the recipient&#8217;s chances of finding sustained work, so reducing the chances of long-term benefit dependency.</p>

	<p pid="a.611W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>

	<p pid="a.611W.0/3">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what steps his Department is taking to assist benefit claimants who are unable to read official correspondence due to (a) learning difficulties and (b) dyslexia. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.0/4">The majority of Jobcentre Plus claimants currently make their claims over the telephone. Information is recorded electronically and this removes the need for a claim form to be read and completed by the claimant.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.0/5">Other claimants can choose to apply for Jobseekers Allowance online via the &#8220;Do it online&#8221; section of the Directgov website. This provides the flexibility to access Jobcentre Plus services from their own homes, at a pace that suits, with, if appropriate, support from an advocate. Claimants can also submit an initial application for Employment Support Allowance via the internet claim service.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.0/6">Should either of these channels represent a problem, clerical forms can be issued or, where appropriate, a face to face interview at the customer's local Jobcentre Plus office can be organised. Claimants who choose a face-to-face meeting might also wish to involve their own advocate or representative in this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.0/7">Jobcentre Plus has a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments to standard services where it is considered appropriate. Claimants can request the written information that Jobcentre Plus produces in an alternative format. Where Jobcentre Plus establishes that an alternative format is required, it is recommended good practice to record this so that future contact can be made in the same manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.0/8">Jobcentre Plus staff are equipped to obtain documents in alternative formats, for example, large print or Easy Read, which uses simple language and images, making information easier to understand for people with learning difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.0/9">If people with dyslexia and / or learning difficulties need extra help to find work, the Disability Employment Adviser can also offer support. Disability Employment Advisers are specially trained to enable them to help people with more complex barriers to employment. Examples include supporting the completion of application forms as well as acting as an advocate for the customer in approaches made to potential employers.</p>

	<p pid="a.615W.9/1">There were 132,800 Fit for Work decisions for new employment and support allowance (ESA) claims made up to the end of February 2010, where the primary health condition was classed as mental and behavioural disorders. There were 50,100 appeals heard against these decisions, and of these 21,200 (42%) were cases where the decision was overturned in favour of the appellant.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.9/2">The above figures come from benefit claims data held by the Department for Work and Pensions, functional assessment data from Atos Healthcare, and appeals data from the Tribunals Service.

	<p pid="a.615W.9/3">Data on appeals heard are published for new ESA claims starting between October 2008, when ESA was introduced, and up to the end of February 2010 (the latest month where there are sufficient volumes of appeals heard). Appeals data are only included where the person claiming has been found fit for work, they have subsequently appealed against the Department's decision and the appeal has been heard by the Tribunals Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.9/4">Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted to the Tribunals Service and heard, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard. As a result these figures should continue to be treated as emerging findings and not final at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.2/1">The coalition Government agreement includes a commitment to work to reduce the use of all animals in scientific research, including non-human primates (NHPs). We believe this is an ambitious but essential and achievable goal and that scientific advances present significant opportunities to replace animal use, to reduce the number of animals used, and, where animal use is unavoidable, to refine the procedures involved so as to minimise suffering. These long-standing aims are referred to as the 3Rs.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/2">In its report on the use of NHPs in research published in 2006, an expert group chaired by Professor Sir David Weatherall made 16 recommendations; the Department is awaiting the findings of the review of publicly funded research envisaged in the fourth of these recommendations. The Department will then be in a position to develop a strategy for the use (and non-use) of NHPs.</p>

	<p pid="a.620W.2/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is an independent body which receives its grant in aid from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The MRC supports research into all aspects of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), and welcomes high-quality research applications in this area. The selection of projects for funding is determined through peer review. The MRC provided &#163;109,000 to projects researching CFS/ME in 2009-10; details of the projects supported can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.620W.2/3">The MRC recently launched a call for proposals to support high quality, innovative research to increase the current knowledge base of CFS/ME and draw in expertise and resource from related fields. Applications were required to address the mechanisms underlying chronic changes related to CFS/ME particularly focusing on one or more of the following areas: autonomic dysfunction, cognitive symptoms, fatigue, immune dysregulation, pain and sleep disorders. The application deadline was <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June</phrase> and up to &#163;1.5 million will be made available to support research proposals; the MRC expects to announce any awards towards the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.5/4">In addition, from 2012/13 eligible new part-time students will not have to pay up front tuition charges and will be able to access loans in the same way as full-time students can now which may also benefit potential students with caring responsibilities.</p>

The regulations apply across all business sectors and set out a framework for how businesses must deal with consumers so that consumers can make free and informed choices in relation to goods and services. Enforcement of the regulations is through undertakings from infringers, enforcement orders or by prosecution with offences carrying potentially an unlimited fine or up to two years imprisonment or both.</p>
