	<p pid="a.257W.7/2">Decisions about the salaries of local authority chief executives and senior officers, and any early retirement payments which either fall within the appropriate pay negotiating machinery, or the appropriate regulatory framework are matters for each local authority employer to consider in the light of local circumstances. While the specific terms and conditions of current and future employment is a matter for the relevant local authority to consider, the Secretary of State has recently called for the most senior local government officers to take a voluntary reduction in pay and also stated that no new council chief executive should be paid more than the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.7/3">The Government's view is that there needs to be greater local democratic accountability and transparency over senior remuneration arrangements and policies within local government. In order to achieve this, the Government intend to bring forward proposals to ensure that councillors are better able to be held to account for their decisions on senior pay by providing them with the power to vote on their council's remuneration policies. On senior pay transparency, the Local Government Association (LGA) recently published draft guidance to support councils publish their senior salary information online. The guidance was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase> and can be viewed and commented on at:</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-10-12a.5215.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-10-12a.262W.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097" speakername="Nick Gibb" colnum="262W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101012/text/101012w0001.htm#10101250000913">
	<p pid="a.262W.14/1">The additional funding received by new academy schools is intended to ensure that they are no better or worse off than they were as maintained schools, having regard to their additional responsibilities. It will consist of a grant to meet VAT costs, and a grant known as Local Authority Central Spend Equivalent Grant (LACSEG) which is paid in lieu of certain local authority (LA) services. The amounts payable on a national basis will depend on the number of schools converting in each area. The VAT grant is a fixed percentage of the General Annual Grant paid to academies, the current percentages being 4.13% (Inner London), 3.62% (Outer London) and 3.54% (elsewhere). The grant is calculated by using historical data on schools' expenditure to derive a typical proportion of spend that attracts VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.14/2">The table shows the amount per pupil of the grant in lieu of LA services, for each LA, expressed for the financial year 2010-11. Differences in the amounts reflect varying levels of delegation of funding. In some but not all LAs an amount for SEN services is also payable for relevant pupils and this is shown separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.14/3">New academy schools will also receive funding for insurance and rates at actual cost.</p>

The spending review is being run in an open, responsible and fair way that protects the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.

This has meant engaging and involving the whole country in the difficult decisions that will have to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.0/3">Some councils are using effective ways of engaging the community in making decisions about what to invest resources in and where to make savings. For example, a number of councils are using a. web-based consultation tool called YouChoose, developed by LB Redbridge:</p>

This coincides with three major initiatives aimed at increasing the effectiveness of criminal case management in the criminal justice system, namely the Charging Programme, the Effective Trial Management Programme and the 'No Witness, No Justice' Programme. It was the combined effect of these major initiatives that helped to deliver the improvement in conviction rates and as Minister responsible for the CPS I am delighted with its role in delivering these outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.270W.9/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has in place a robust separation of functions between the MHRA regulatory functions and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) to ensure there is no conflict of interest. The GPRD is run by its own dedicated team who have no involvement with any regulatory work of the MHRA, and none of the MHRA regulatory staff have access to the administration of the GPRD. The GPRD Group reports into a non-regulatory Division of the MHRA, the Information Management Division. The GPRD group maintains its own separate management accounts. GPRD and MHRA data are kept on separate physical servers, accessed through separate logical domains. As a result of this separation of functions the Agency is confident that no conflict of interest exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.270W.9/2">The GPRD moved from the Office of National Statistics to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the predecessor body to the MHRA in 1999. At that time the MCA took a decision to invest in the GPRD to develop it as a resource for medical and health research purposes undertaken in the public interest. This was an investment, not an 'initial funding loan' requiring repayment.</p>

This includes the use, supply, manufacture and smuggling of illegal weapons into and with UK borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.3/2">These assessments, and subsequent activity, are of a sensitive nature and often involve a range of law enforcement activities across multiple agencies and forces.

NABIS may periodically share information relating to operational activity where a particular threat has been removed; however this is done on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.282W.2/9" class="indent">Reducing the need for customers to contact HMRC by improving processes and the forms they issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.282W.2/13">For tax credits the key peak runs from April to July 31, the deadline for customers to renew their claims. Demand in August and September can also be high as HMRC deals with customers whose claim has been terminated due to their failure to renew and claimants inform HMRC of changes to their dependents' educational status as the new school year starts.</p>

	<p pid="a.284W.5/3">A consultation to inform a new skills strategy is currently under way. A key principle that will underpin the strategy is that the system should meet the needs of those who have poor work prospects or who have a high chance of spending long periods out of work. It is essential that any future skills system gives a respected, credible vocational training offer that will provide people with a route into employment and help them progress in their careers. The new strategy, to be published after the spending review, will take account of views on how we can best achieve that.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.4/2">I refer the hon.

There is broad party political acceptance that the current final-salary pension terms for Members of Parliament are not sustainable and that reform is needed. We anticipate that the current scheme for MPs will end. The Government proposes to consult IPSA on these matters and, in due course, to make a further statement in the light of the final findings of the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission.</p>
