	<p pid=".455W.0/1">Recurrent funding for schools is channelled through local education authorities and is made up of Education Standard Spending, the Standards Fund, the Schools Standards Grant and other special grants.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.0/2">Education Standard Spending is the amount the Government consider appropriate for local authorities to spend on education from their total budgets and is not ring-fenced for specific purposes or activities. In addition, the School Standards Grant is paid to schools to be used by them as they wish to raise standards.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.0/3">LEAs and schools receive Standards Fund Grant for particular specific purposes and activities such as the literacy and numeracy strategies. Other special grants are paid to schools to support payments to teachers passing the threshold and performance pay for teachers. Schools also receive funding via education action zones for particular purposes. Taken together these account for 11.7 per cent. of recurrent education funding for LEAs and schools. Of this, around half is devolved to schools from the Standards Fund for them to spend on their own priorities within the broad objectives of the Standards Fund programme.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.0/4">Capital funding for schools is provided through a combination of credit approvals, Government grant, and through the Private Finance Initiative. Around 45 per cent. of capital funding is allocated for specific purposes or activities.</p>

The Socrates Committee has met formally three times over the last 12 months, with an additional informal meeting in May 2002. The sub-committees for schools and higher education have met twice each. Two officials from the UK attend the Socrates Committee meetings, and one official usually attends the sub-committee meetings. Travel expenses were met from Commission resources.

The response to these children and young people should take place within the framework of guidance set out in &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot;, issued in December 1999 by the Department of Health, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Employment.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.5/2">The Department for Education and Skills has made available to schools on request a guidance pack entitled &quot;Bullying: don't suffer in silence&quot; which is intended to help Headteachers in fulfilling their duty to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. The pack refers to bullying which is sexual in nature and it sets out some suggested strategies to deal with such behaviour. It also mentions that a proven sexual assault is likely to lead to the exclusion from the school of the perpetrator. However, we recognise that excluded pupils often need further help in managing their behaviour from personnel such as Education Welfare Officers or Educational Psychologists.</p>

	<p pid=".467W.2/1">Only statistics on permanent exclusions from school are collected centrally. The statistical first release on exclusions published this morning shows that there were 9,210 permanent exclusions from school in England in the 2000&ndash;01 school year. Our priority now is to provide suitable full time education for permanently excluded pupils and we have a public service agreement target to ensure that all local education authorities offer this by September 2002.</p>

The primacy of military operations will not be diluted as a result of commercial activity. No formal proposals have been put forward by airline companies for the operation of scheduled services from RAF Leuchars. No Ministry of Defence Minister or official has met representatives of commercial airline companies to discuss the operation of scheduled services from RAF Leuchars, however, consultants advising the RAF have sought the views of the airline operator community.

Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> the June 2002 In-Service-Date for Eurofighter was becoming increasingly challenging to achieve. Although good progress has been made by industry, with the first three instrumented production aircraft achieving successful first flights in early April, delays in bringing the detailed design to full maturity in some areas prevented the flight test programme from starting on time. Following a thorough review of the programme involving the partner nations, the NATO agency responsible for undertaking the procurement, and industry, we have jointly concluded that acceptance of the first aircraft into service should be delayed, to take place by the end of this year, and we shall plan on that basis. We shall now be working hard with industry to recover lost time and achieve the planned Operational Employment Date in the second half of the decade, thus avoiding any gap in front-line capability or extra costs to the Ministry of Defence. The delays are disappointing but reflect the complexity of the project and the major advance in technology it represents. Initial flights of the instrumented production aircraft have been impressive and the Government remain fully committed to this contribution to the United Kingdom's military capability.</p>

	<p pid=".478W.15/2">Regulation (EEC) No. 1836/93, allowing voluntary participation by companies in the industrial sector in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), was revised by Regulation (EC) No. 761/2001, with the effect that participation in EMAS is now open to organisations in all economic sectors. The aim of the scheme is to promote the continual improvement of environmental performance in organisations through them establishing an environmental management system and publishing an environmental report, both of which have to be independently verified. Registered organisations are entitled to use the EMAS logo to advertise their participation in the scheme. A committee composed of representatives of member states and chaired by the commission has been established to assist the commission in the implementation and operation of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".478W.15/3">The Committee has met three times in the last 12 months. The UK is formally represented by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The cost of attending the committee over the last 12 months was approximately &pound;4,000. The main issues currently under consideration by the committee are the relationship of EMAS with the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation; the development of marketing and promotional initiatives to increase participation in the scheme; the use of EMAS in other Community policies and instruments; and the potential for wider use of the EMAS logo in applications like product information.</p>

	<p pid=".479W.5/2">Offset related to UK defence exports would normally take the form of investments in, or arranging exports from, the buyer's country.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.5/3">ECGD support would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, and is most likely to take the form of political risk insurance to UK companies seeking to make overseas investments in connection with offset arrangements. Limited support might also be available for goods exported from a buyer's country, but the rules are complex and it is not possible to generalise.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.9/1">The Oslo and Paris convention of 1992 (OSPAR) provides for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic. Under the convention the UK has adopted OSPAR Decision 98/3 which provides a regime for the decommissioning of oil and gas installations and effectively prohibits sea disposal. There is a presumption that installations on the UK continental shelf will be brought back to shore for reuse, recycling or final disposal on land. However, the OSPAR Decision recognises that there may be difficulty in removing the &quot;footings&quot; of large steel jackets weighing more than 10,000 tonnes and in removing concrete installations. As a result derogations may be granted in these cases if the internationally agreed assessment and consultation process shows that leaving such installations wholly or partly in place is justifiable. If a derogation is granted, the permit will specify who will be liable for the remains and require suitable monitoring and management measures to prevent or mitigate any adverse consequences to both the environment and other users of the sea.</p>
	<p pid=".480W.9/2">In the UK, to ensure the orderly decommissioning of all installations, including those subject to derogation from the OSPAR decision, the decommissioning of each installation is addressed within a decommissioning programme. The programme assesses the potential decommissioning solutions and determines the most appropriate disposal option by balancing safety, the environment, impact on other users of the sea, technical feasibility and economics. The programme must be approved by the Secretary of State under the Petroleum Act 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-17">17 January</phrase> the Government and the schemes' trustees made a joint statement agreeing a review of the arrangements for the Government's guarantee of basic retirement benefits for the members of the schemes. It was agreed that the review should explore how changes in circumstances since 1994, when British Coal was privatised, might best be reflected in revisions to the guarantee arrangements which would benefit members. In doing so, the trustees and the Government recognised that any revisions will need to be based on an equitable sharing of risk and reward between the schemes and the Exchequer, and will need to be sufficiently robust to operate satisfactorily in a wide range of conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".483W.2/1">I have today decided that consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to London Waste Ltd.'s application cannot be given. The extension would have an annual throughput of waste of around 285,000 tonnes over and above the existing station's capacity of 550,000 tonnes per annum.</p>
	<p pid=".483W.2/2">In deciding not to grant consent I have taken into account the hierarchy for the treatment of waste set out in the Government's Waste Strategy 2000. Our policy is that waste should be minimised and recycling and composting undertaken before energy from waste is considered. I have considered all the information placed before me, both for and against the extension, and have concluded that the existing station is large enough to deal with the North London Waste Authority's (NLWA) residual waste after recycling. To grant consent for the extension would result in a station with an overall capacity capable of handling all of NLWA's municipal waste and could mean that the NLWA had little incentive to do more recycling over and above the minimum required by statute. Also should the NLWA meet or better its recycling targets then this would lead to a shortfall in the waste stream for the extended station and could lead to waste being imported from other areas which would be contrary to the Proximity Principal whereby waste should be treated as near to its origin as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".483W.2/3">I have also considered the measures the applicant has undertaken to incorporate at the Edmonton site to encourage recycling, composting and using heat for local district heating schemes. While these measures are to be welcomed I am aware that previous ones of a similar type in the site have been closed or not utilised. I am of the opinion they are not sufficient to justify granting consent to the extension. Indeed should such measures prove successful then there would appear to me to be less justification for the need for the extension.</p>
	<p pid=".483W.2/4">In refusing consent I should make it clear that the Government are not against energy-from-waste stations where they are clearly required and properly sized. The requirement of our policy is that statutory recycling targets must be met and that no incineration proposal shall be permitted which will pre-empt recycling or reduce the option for recycling for the future.</p>

	<p pid=".487W.0/1">The Landfill Directive, requires significant reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995 by 2006, 50 per cent. by 2009 and 35 per cent. by 2016 (although countries such as the UK may use, if they wish, a derogation of up to four years for meeting each of these targets). To help achieve this, &quot;Waste Strategy 2000&quot; set targets for recycling and composting of household waste. In 2001 the Government set statutory performance standards for each local authority in England, which require them to double the overall recycling and composting rate by 2003&ndash;04 and treble it by 2005&ndash;06 over 1998&ndash;99 levels.</p>
	<p pid=".487W.0/2">The Government strongly support composting as a way of disposing of biodegradable waste, and believes it has an important role to play. We are actively encouraging the composting of green waste at home, at municipal civic amenity sites and when separately collected by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".487W.0/3">Potentially, all biodegradable waste can be composted, although some may be unsuitable for animal health reasons or because non-compostable wastes are present in the mix. Also, some wastes suitable for the composting process are better reused, recycled or recovered in other ways. &quot;Waste Strategy 2000&quot; (Part 2) indicates that 21 per cent. of household waste may be putrescible, while some 62 per cent. in total may be biodegradable. These proportions may vary seasonally (depending on green waste for example) and according to the amount of waste separated for recycling and home composting.</p>
	<p pid=".487W.0/4">Figures from the DEFRA Municipal Waste Management Survey show there have been substantial increases in the amount of household waste collected for composting by local authorities in England and Wales&mdash;from 461,000 tonnes in 1998&ndash;99 to 670,000 tonnes in 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".487W.0/5">Data on the percentage of waste composted are available for household waste only. Household waste amounts to approximately 90 per cent. of all municipal waste. The latest results taken from the Department's Municipal Waste Management Survey are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".488W.0/1">The Government strongly support composting as a way of treating biodegradable waste, improving soil quality and replacing non-renewable products such as peat. We are actively encouraging the composting of green waste&mdash;at home, at municipal civic amenity and community composting sites and when separately collected by local authorities. Guidance on composting, including on safety issues, is produced by the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/2">To support composting activity, the 2000 spending review allocated &pound;220 million Private Finance Initiative funding for waste management that can be used to deliver increased recycling/composting rates. It also established a new &pound;140 million household waste and recycling fund to help local authorities meet their statutory performance standards for recycling and composting.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/3">Although animal health legislation currently prohibits the land spreading of composted kitchen/catering waste which might contain meat, we have commissioned a risk assessment to assess the risks to public, animal and plant health from such compost. In the light of that assessment, we will review the legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/4">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) are currently working with the Composting Association to develop the existing industry standard for compost, to achieve British Standards Institute (BSI) accreditation. The delivery of these accredited industry standards for compost will help to create markets for organic waste derived products. The creation of these new markets will be relevant to the retail sector when considering whether composting has a part to play in its waste management strategy (bearing in mind the present legal requirements).</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/5">&quot;Waste Strategy 2000&quot; places composting high in the hierarchy of preferred waste management options, and set targets for England and Wales to recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. This national target is backed up by statutory targets for each local authority in England for 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06, and the 2000 spending review identified substantial additional resources to help deliver the statutory performance standards on recycling and composting.</p>

We are also considering what additional measures, such as regulation, economic instruments, voluntary measures and awareness-raising, may be required in the future to tackle both agricultural and urban diffuse pollution, in order to implement the water framework directive.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.8/1">Following a European study (the first Eurohazcon study) published in 1998 that reported a 33 per cent. higher rate of non-chromosomal anomalies among people living near hazardous waste sites, the Government commissioned a programme of work on health effects of landfill sites including a much more extensive national study by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU); this was published in the summer 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/2">The SAHSU study found that 80 per cent. of the population lives within 2 kilometres of a landfill site (operational or closed). The SAHSU study looked at the rates of all birth defects (chromosomal and non- chromosomal) and found only a slightly higher rate (1 per cent.) in populations living near landfill sites and a 7 per cent. higher rate near hazardous waste sites. The Government's expert advisory committee, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, noted that this excess risk was small and could be accounted for by factors other than the landfill sites. The study has not shown, nor indeed could it show, a causal link between landfill sites and birth defects.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/3">Earlier this year a second Eurohazcon study was published. The study investigated the rates of certain birth defects (chromosomal anomalies) around 23 European hazardous waste landfill sites, including 12 sites in Great Britain. It found a 41 per cent. higher rate of chromosomal anomalies close to sites (0 to 3km) compared to further away (3 to 7km).</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/4">The major difference between the two studies is the scale. The Eurohazcon study looked at populations around 23 landfills spread right across Europe, whereas the SAHSU study looked at populations within 2km of 9,565 sites (80 per cent. of the British population) of which 774 were known to take hazardous waste. The SAHSU study was therefore much more comprehensive. As such the results are less likely to be skewed by the pattern of birth defects surrounding any individual landfill site.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/5">Both the SAHSU and Eurohazcon reports have recommended further work and DEFRA, the Department of Health and the Environment Agency have a considerable amount of work planned or under way. A great deal is already known about the general make-up of gases that are emitted from landfill sites. However, better information is needed on the substances present in very low concentrations in landfill emissions and the levels of exposure experienced by people living near to landfills. To obtain this information, research is currently under way to analyse over 12 months the emissions from municipal landfills. This monitoring study will provide information on which to make a more informed assessment of the likelihood of landfill sites posing a risk to health. The work will be completed next summer and published as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/6">This Department hosted a seminar on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-15">15 May 2002</phrase> to consider where there are gaps in the research on health impacts of all waste management options and to help prioritise future research. There are no risk-free options but conducting such research will allow local authorities and others to make more informed choices about the range, type and location of facility they wish to operate.</p>

In addition to the time spent at the meetings themselves, officials spend a similar amount of time preparing for and reporting back on the meetings.</p>
	<p pid=".497W.3/3">Items due to be considered by the committee at its next meeting include proposed changes to the critical uses of halon listed in annexe VII of the regulation, a mechanism for setting import quotas of HCFCs from <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase>, and information on critical use procedures for methyl bromide.</p>

	<p pid=".514W.9/1">Hon. Members were informed on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-19">19 March</phrase> of the Commission's wish to improve the arrangements to provide high quality tours for constituents and other visitors to the Palace, and its view that there should be a single official tours organisation supporting both the permanent Summer Opening and tours at other times. The Commission felt that this was an important part of its strategic aim to increase public understanding and knowledge of the House and its work.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/2">At its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-20">20 May</phrase> the Commission considered the advice of the Administration Committee and the Board of Management on the way forward. We also took into account the views of a number of right hon. and hon. Members, their staff and staff of the House who have helpfully contributed to the process.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/3">The House of Lords has an equal interest in visitor tours. We have sought the views of the authorities of that House on the improvements we would like to see, and will be working closely with them on the details.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/4">We think it is important that Members should have the same freedom and flexibility to arrange tours for their constituents as is now the case, but we believe that there is scope for improvement. We decided that:</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/5" class="indent">for the convenience of Members and their staff, the tours office should be a &quot;one-stop shop&quot;, making bookings, issuing permits and allocating guides, and that funds should be provided for this in the current financial year. We thought that the separate, well-understood system for allocating Gallery tickets should remain unchanged, and that the separately organised Summer Opening primarily for tourists should not be affected;</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/6" class="indent">informal visits of six people or fewer accompanied by Members, Peers, or Officers of either House, or four people accompanied by other permanent passholders, should continue as at present. The ability of Members, their staff, and staff of the House to guide their own larger parties should they wish would be unaffected;</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/7" class="indent">in the interests of fairness, unguided and unaccompanied visits should be discontinued;</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/8" class="indent">guides should be drawn primarily from staff of the House, who have given excellent service over a number of years; and that staff from all House Departments should be given the opportunity to contribute. We supported the idea of a guiding qualification that would help maintain high standards and encourage House staff to take part;</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/9" class="indent">tours should emphasise the role and work of the House just as much as the history and the heritage of the building.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/10">We thought that the new arrangements should begin to operate from the beginning of the next Session of Parliament, although some aspects (for example the guiding qualification) will need to be phased in over a longer period of time. We were also conscious of the restrictions that possible changes in sitting times of this House might impose on access. In order not to reduce the total number of visitors who are able to come to the House, Saturday opening may be an option.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/11">We had well in mind the need to ensure that the costs to visitors are kept as low as possible, especially in the interests of groups such as school parties and old age pensioners. We have asked the Finance and Services Committee to look at possible cost structures and to report to us for our next meeting. We have also asked the Board of Management now to develop a detailed implementation plan.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.9/12">The views of Members, their staff and staff of the House will be a welcome contribution to the development of the new arrangements. They should be sent to the Serjeant at Arms as the member of the Board of Management responsible for this project.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.2/1">The announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-13">13 May</phrase> about the structural reform of English tourism represents a radical change and yesterday I held the first meeting of the Steering Group to start considering the detail of how to take our proposals forward. We aim to report the Group's findings this summer.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/2">No decision on the level of funding for marketing has yet been taken&mdash;an announcement about resources for tourism will be made at the appropriate time but not in advance of the spending round decisions. We have not sought, nor yet received offers of financial support, but I am sure that the industry will respond well, as it did for the Million Visitor campaign earlier in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/3">Depending on the details of transition to the new structures, we hope to be in a position to start marketing domestically in 2003&ndash;04. The precise decisions on dates will of course be for the public-private coalition to decide upon.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/4">Regional development agencies will in future play a stronger part in the strategic leadership of tourism. However, no decisions on funding have yet been taken and the level of that funding will depend on the precise allocation of new responsibilities. We will continue to encourage RDAs to take account of the huge importance of tourism to their regions, both its direct and indirect impacts, when they take decisions about allocating their single pot.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/5">Regional tourist boards are private companies limited by guarantee (one is a trust) and so are independent by nature. They are the natural partners for RDAs, with much tourism expertise, and we hope they will all forge effective working relationships with the RDAs.</p>

In April 2001 the high level meeting of the Development Assistance Committee agreed guidelines on principles of planning for sustainable development. These principles were discussed at an international forum on national sustainable development strategies, held in Ghana in November 2001. This forum was organised by the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs with support from my Department.</p>

	<p pid=".533W.5/1">Exact figures are not available as international access to many of the conflict areas is restricted or prevented by the military authorities. Recent UN estimates have indicated that up to 600,000 Burmese may be internally displaced.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.5/2">It is even more difficult to gauge the number of people who have been killed as a result of fighting with the military authorities. That human rights abuses continue in Burma is not in doubt.

	<p pid=".544W.2/1">We have a wide range of programmes that have proved successful in helping people with disabilities secure work where they are ready and able to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/2">Over 8,200 people have already been helped into work through the New Deal for Disabled People pilots. Building on that success we extended the New Deal for Disabled People and we now have a national network of job brokers from the public, private and voluntary sectors who work closely with employers, voluntary groups and health services to help people with health conditions and disabilities move into work. A further 2,304 people have been helped into work through the extension.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/3">Disability employment advisers continue to provide specialist support to disabled jobseekers, and disabled employees and their employers. The roll-out of integrated Jobcentre Plus offices will provide disabled people with work-focused meetings with a personal adviser to ensure they are aware of all the help and opportunities available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/4">A range of other Government programmes are also available to help people with health conditions and disabilities find and keep employment, including Access to Work, Workstep and Work Preparation. All the programmes are subject to evaluation, and reports are published. They are available free of charge from the Department and are also accessible on the internet.</p>

	<p pid=".546W.2/1">The Pension Service will provide a modern, efficient and customer focused service for both today's and future pensioners. It will play a crucial role in our aim to tackle pensioner poverty. We are committed to encouraging pensioners to claim their full entitlements. We have already conducted a very successful minimum income guarantee (MIG) campaign which resulted in an extra 134,000 pensioners making successful claims to MIG receiving on average an extra &pound;20 a week.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/2">We are continuing to look at more effective ways of encouraging eligible pensioners to claim the MIG. Initiatives include:</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/3" class="indent">A MIG claim line on freephone 0800 028 1111. This is available to enable our customers to apply for MIG easily and simply.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/4" class="indent">A new shortened claim form available on the internet at <a href="http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk">www.thepensionservice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/5">Since April 2002, all customers contacting the Retirement Pension Teleclaims Centre are offered information on MIG and asked if they would like someone to call them back with more information and pursue a claim. Those customers who do not wish to claim MIG via the RP telecentre are sent a MIG information leaflet with their RP claim pack.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/6">Additionally, we will:</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/7" class="indent">Issue mailshots to pensioners who claimed RP and who may also be entitled to MIG, encouraging them to claim. Around 100,000 pensioners will receive a mailshot over the April-June period.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/8" class="indent">Use &quot;trigger&quot; questions which identify customers who have a match with one or more predetermined 'key life events' that may indicate a potential entitlement to MIG, for example, when customers aged 60 and over receive a new award of one or more benefits, such as attendance allowance, industrial injuries benefit or housing benefit. A letter explaining the possible entitlement and inviting customers to claim MIG is sent to all customers identified in this way.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/9">Training material for Pension Service staff includes guidance on identifying potential entitlement to MIG. If, during the course of any inquiry, it becomes evident that the pensioner might be entitled to MIG they will be encouraged to claim.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/10">Also, the local service will work closely with local authorities, the voluntary sector and other service providers to give a proactive service and ensure that customers receive their full benefit entitlement. In time local service staff will be trained to provide a more joined-up service covering the broad range of services older people may need to access. The local service will include surgeries, a home visiting where there is a special need and joint benefit take-up campaigns.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/11">At the moment, pensioners can choose to be paid by order book or have their money paid directly into a bank or building society account. From April 2003, payments directly into accounts will become the normal method of payment. People will still be able to collect their money from the post office and will be provided with information to enable them to choose the most appropriate account.</p>

	<p pid=".547W.2/1">There has been a long-term decline in the coverage of final salary pension schemes, which has accelerated as a result of increased longevity and the recent fall in the stock markets. Many companies have had to consider the financial impact on their business of continuing to run a final salary scheme for all employees.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/2">Employers should take a long-term view of pensions, rather than basing their decisions on short-term considerations. Where employers do change their pension schemes, we believe that they have a responsibility to make it absolutely clear what the implications are for employee pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/3">The Sandler review of the long-term retail savings market and Pickering review of pension regulation will report in the summer. The Inland Revenue is also reviewing the taxation of occupational pension schemes. We will issue proposals in the autumn, aimed at making pension provision more attractive for individuals and pension providers. This will build on the reforms that have been introduced since 1998. Pension Credit will ensure that it always pays to save. State second pension will benefit 14 million low and moderate earners, and four million carers and disabled people who will get a second pension for the first time. We have introduced pension forecasts to provide individuals with the right information to make an informed decision about their retirement. And the introduction of stakeholder pensions means that everyone now has access to low-charge, flexible pension provision.</p>

The project will be subject to rigorous monitoring and evaluation during this pilot phase. Decisions on future service provision will be made in the light of evidence from the evaluation. To inform the evaluation process I have also decided to establish a consultative group, whose members will be drawn from a range of organisations and individuals with an interest in this issue.

	<p pid=".549W.2/1">Section 62 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000 provides for the electronic monitoring of prisoners released on licence. By virtue of section 62(5)(a), this includes young people during the community element of a detention and training order (DTO).</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/2">Electronic monitoring of those released from detention and training orders is already available in 84 youth offending team areas as part of the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme overseen by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/3">Section 102(4) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 empowers the Secretary of State to release an offender:</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/4" class="indent">in the case of an order of eight months or more but less than 18 months, one month before the half-way point; and</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/5" class="indent">in the case of an order of 18 months or more, one month or two months before that point.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/6">The availability of electronic monitoring enables me to consider how we can make further use of the powers in section 102(4) to provide a useful transitional phase in the reintegration of trainees from custody back into the community.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/7">I therefore propose to use electronic monitoring as a condition of the release of trainees serving a DTO of eight months or more for a period of one or two months prior to their current release at the half-way point. This form of release will be a normal feature of DTOs except in the case of trainees convicted of sex offences or serious violent offences. The possibility of release on electronic monitoring at this stage in the DTO will not be available to trainees who have exhibited violent or destructive behaviour to people or property within the secure facility; made exceptionally bad progress against the training plan as a result of consistent failure to co-operate or failure to take responsibility for their behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.11/1">The University of York Centre for Criminal Justice Economics and Psychology (Culyer A, Eaton G, Godfrey C et al, 2002) has recently completed a research report for the Home Office entitled &quot;The Economic and Social Costs of Class A Drugs Misuse in England and Wales, 2000&quot;. The report will be published as a Home Office Research Study (HORS) early to mid-summer, 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.11/2">Key findings from the research have been released (Home Office News Release, <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-12">12 February 2002</phrase>). Annual economic costs (mainly to health service, criminal justice system and state benefits) are estimated to be between &pound;3.7 billion and &pound;6.8 billion. Adding social costs (mainly victim costs of crime) increases figures to between &pound;10.9 billion and &pound;18.8 billion. Problematic drug users account for around 99 per cent. of these costs with annual economic costs at &pound;11,000 each compared with less than &pound;20 for a non-problematic user.</p>

	<p pid=".552W.8/2">There are no statistics on the number of asylum seekers who have returned to London following dispersal to another area of the country. Nor are statistics available on those accepted as refugees or granted exceptional leave to remain (ELR) who, in both cases, are free to live where ever they like. The National Asylum Support Services (NASS) cannot require asylum seekers to remain in the accommodation provided. If they choose to leave the accommodation they can seek to alter their support package from subsistence and accommodation to subsistence only. Generally speaking asylum seekers are not provided with accommodation in London. The Home Office is currently reviewing the extent of and reasons for asylum seekers leaving their dispersal accommodation. The results will be made available as soon as possible following the completion of the project.</p>

	<p pid=".553W.5/2">Negotiations are ongoing and it is expected that a decision on the implementation of the Network's proposals will be taken in June. However, the Government feel that the United Kingdom (UK) has much to offer in the exchange of best practice ideas and procedures in the area of public figure protection. One of the key issues that the Government have sought to maintain is the principle that it is the right of the host state to determine the appropriate package of support according to the specific threat to the individual visiting that country. The network will have no power to make legislative changes to UK law.</p>

	<p pid=".554W.3/2">Under the provisions of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, animals can only be used in licensed scientific procedures when there is no alternative way to achieve the objective concerned, such as testing products using computer models, cell cultures and other in vitro methods. Animals are only used where fully justified and where the benefits outweigh the costs to the animals involved.</p>
	<p pid=".554W.3/3">The Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 2000, the last year for which figures are available, records that procedures for toxicological purposes&mdash;the category where legislative testing requirements usually apply&mdash;accounted for 17 per cent. of all procedures started in 2000. This proportion compares with 20 per cent. in 1999 and 25 per cent. in 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".554W.3/4">The majority of these toxicology/safety procedures (some 84 per cent.)&mdash;amounting to just over 14 per cent. of all procedures carried out in all categories&mdash;were performed to conform to legislative requirements. The procedures of this type carried out for non-legislative purposes include studies for refinement or replacement of live animal use in safety testing, as well as ecological studies.</p>
	<p pid=".554W.3/5">It may be additionally worth noting that pharmaceutical safety/efficacy evaluation purposes accounted for 60 per cent. of all procedures for toxicology, other safety and efficacy evaluations, and that no procedures were performed in 2000 for the purpose of evaluating the safety of either cosmetic products or ingredients.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.2/2">The published annual statistics relate solely to animals used in scientific procedures regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. This meets the requirement, in section 21 of the Act, to provide related information to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.2/3">With the exception of the production of genetically modified animals&mdash;which is itself a regulated procedure&mdash;the number of animals bred but not eventually used for scientific purposes has not been considered appropriate for inclusion in these statistics. The Government have at present no plans to change that.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.2/4">The Animal Procedures Committee looked at the issue of the over-breeding of animals for use in scientific procedures as part of its 10-year review of the 1986 Act. It concluded that although some over-breeding was unavoidable, it can and should be minimised, and it recommended principles of best practice to help to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.2/5">The committee also undertook to liaise with the Laboratory Animal Science Association, which has also been considering the issue of over-breeding and how it can be minimised, to refine these principles before finalising its advice. I expect to receive the Committee's report by the summer and will carefully consider the further advice it provides.</p>

	<p pid=".556W.2/1">The legal basis for the fifth action programme (2001&ndash;05) is Article 13 of the Treaty and Council Decision 2001/51/EC of <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-20">20 December 2000</phrase>. The programme is one of the components of the overall Community strategy on gender equality (which embraces a range of Community policies and action aimed at achieving gender equality), including both mainstreaming gender into general policies and targeting specific actions towards women.</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/2">The committee which implements the programme is composed of member states' representatives. The current UK nominee is the responsible official in the Cabinet Office's Women and Equality Unit. It has met three times during the last 12 months. As per Article 6 of the Council Decision establishing the programme, the committee's agenda includes:</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/3" class="indent">the general guidelines for the implementation of the programme;</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/4" class="indent">the annual plan of work for the implementation of the programme's actions;</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/5" class="indent">the financial support to be supplied by the Community;</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/6" class="indent">the annual budget and the distribution of funding between the various actions of the programme;</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/7" class="indent">the procedures for selecting the actions to be supported by the Community and the draft list of actions to receive such support submitted by the Commission;</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/8" class="indent">the criteria for monitoring and evaluating the programme, in particular its costs-effectiveness, and the arrangements for the dissemination of results.</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/9">The funds of the fifth action programme are made available by the commission to member states and to individual contractors. The programme has a financial reference amount for the period 2001&ndash;05 of 50 million euro, and a budget line of around 10 million euro/year.</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/10">Travel costs for officials attending committee meetings are reimbursed by the European Commission; subsistence costs average less than &pound;250 per year.</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/11">The principles and conditions concerning public access to the committee's documents (Article 13 of the rules of procedure for the committee) are the same as those applying to commission documents. The European Scrutiny Committee receives Explanatory Memoranda about work undertaken under this programme.</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/12">Together with member states, the commission is currently conducting a review to bring existing legislation on the conduct of committees into line with Council Decision 1999/468/EC, to &quot;simplify the requirements for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".556W.2/13">As an obligation to this decision, the commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of committees. The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-26">26 February 2002</phrase> (Com (2001) 783 Final).</p>

	<p pid=".566W.2/4" class="indent">The monthly measure of UK unemployment used in 1979 was the count of registrants at Jobcentres. This was based on an administrative system which no longer exists.

	<p pid=".566W.2/5" class="indent">Since April 1998, monthly statistics of unemployment in the UK have been compiled and published, following the internationally standard definition, from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). This counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. The Labour Force Survey measure of unemployment has been compiled and published on the same definition&mdash;following the guidelines of the International Labour Organisation&mdash;since 1984.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/6" class="indent">The ONS also publishes monthly statistics of the numbers of people who are claiming unemployment-related benefits, known as the claimant count. Details of changes which have affected the coverage or calculation of these monthly figures between 1979 and 1997 are detailed in articles in the November 1995 and April 1998 editions of Labour Market Trends.</p>

	<p pid=".567W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/2">Council Decision 2202/177/EC, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-18">18 February 2002</phrase>, is on the 'guidelines for member states employment policies for the year 2002'. Recital 22 states that member states should strengthen their efforts to include and make visible a gender perspective across all the pillars (of the Employment Guidelines). This Recital clarifies the intention of the Council, and reflects the wishes of the European Parliament, that gender equality should be a horizontal objective for member states when they take the Guidelines into account in their national employment policies.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/3">The UK Government fully supports the principle that a concern for gender equality needs to be reflected across the full range of employment policy. The Government principally achieves that outcome through the Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment Guidelines, issued to all Departments in November 1998, and through the Gender Impact Assessment framework, which will be produced during 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/4">The website of the Women and Equality Unit of the Cabinet Office publicises this activity, which is also reported on in the UK Employment Action Plan 2002, along with a gender breakdown of performance data. The LKP will be placed in the Library shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.2/1">Like all their equipment and staff, Customs' vehicles are deployed in a flexible way based on the latest assessments of risk, rather than located exclusively in any one region. On a national basis, the total Customs' vehicle fleet has increased from 2,085 in 1999&ndash;2000 to 2,143 in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.2/2">The average age of the vehicle fleet has remained constant at around 4.5 years. The proportions of different vehicle types which make up the fleet have also remained broadly constant with approximately 78.3 per cent. designated as cars, 8 per cent. as car-derived vans, 8.5 per cent. as light commercial vehicles and 5.2 per cent. as specialist/heavy goods vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.2/3">The percentage of the vehicle fleet fitted with online computer terminals, used either for satellite navigation or covert tracking, has risen from approximately 3 per cent. in 1999&ndash;2000 to approximately 8 per cent. in 2001&ndash;02.</p>

	<p pid=".584W.2/1">The advisory committee on the training of midwives (ACTM) is one of a group of committees set up to advise the European Commission and member states on matters relating to the training of workers whose professions come under sectoral directives guaranteeing free movement and automatic recognition of qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/2">The ACTM was set up by Council Decision 80/156/EEC. Its mandate is set down in Article 2, which states that:</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/3" class="indent">1. The Task of the Committee shall be to help ensure throughout the Community a comparably high standard in the training of midwives.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/4" class="indent">2. It shall carry out this task, in particular, by the following means:</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/5" class="indent">exchange of comprehensive information as to the training methods and the content, level and structure of theoretical and practical courses provided in the member states,</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/6" class="indent">discussion and consultation with the object of developing common approaches to the standard to be attained in the training of midwives, and, as appropriate, to the structure and content of such training,</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/7" class="indent">keeping under the review the adaptation of the above-mentioned training to developments in midwifery practice, medical and social science and teaching methods.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/8" class="indent">3. The Committee shall communicate to the Commission and the Member States its opinions and recommendations including, when it considers it appropriate, suggestions for amendments to be made to the articles concerning training of midwives in Directives 80/154/EEC and 80/155/EEC.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/9" class="indent">4. The Committee shall also advise the Commission on any matter which the Commission may refer to it in relation to the training of midwives.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/10">Each advisory committee has three members per member state&mdash;one each from the practising profession, the education establishments and the competent authorities concerned. Three alternates are also appointed. Members and alternates are nominated by Ministers following consultation with the relevant professional bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/11">Advisory committee expenses fall to be paid by the Commission (or on occasion by the professions concerned). There is thus no direct charge to public funds.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/12">Member states are currently considering Commission proposals for streamlining the directives and processes relating to free movement of professionals. None of the advisory committees has met during the last 12 months; and none of them has any items under consideration.</p>

There will be further increases in the number of students entering training as a result of the NHS Plan commitment to provide 4,450 more training places each year for therapists and other health professionals by 2004. The increased investment in training, work to make the NHS a better employer and encourage return to practice, will result in a continued increase in the number of speech therapists available to work in the NHS.</p>

We are committed to working closely with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the Royal College of Pathologists to improve long-term staffing levels in this speciality. The establishment of three histopathology training schools and of international fellowships to attract experienced histopathologists to work in the NHS will both increase the pool from which paediatric pathologists can be recruited. The children's care group workforce team also plans to start work on this issue in June.</p>

	<p pid=".590W.3/1">Reliable data are not available for the number of deaths associated with food allergy. This is because deaths due to allergy are often attributed on the death certificate to asthma or some other symptom rather than to actual food allergy. The committee on toxicity reported in 2000 that of about 20 deaths annually attributed to fatal anaphylactic shock, 30 per cent. (i.e. about seven) are due to foods, the most commonly implicated food being peanut.</p>

Most allergic reactions to food are mild, although reactions can be severe, even life threatening in a small number of cases. The food most commonly associated with fatal food allergic reactions is peanuts. In the UK, a recent study published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> has shown that 1 in 200 children suffer from peanut allergy.</p>

	<p pid=".598W.2/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC)&mdash;which receives most of its income via grant-in- aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&mdash;is the main Government agency that funds research into the causes of medical conditions. Their most recent review of the epidemiology and causes of autism, published in December last year, notes that autism seems likely to result from a range of causes but that the strongest evidence to date is for a major genetic component. The report states that several genes may interact to create susceptibility to the disorder. In relation to the combined MMR vaccine, it advises that the evidence does not support the proposed causal link between MMR and autism.</p>
	<p pid=".598W.2/2">We have since announced the allocation of a further &pound;2.5 million to the MRC for autism research. This will complement and add to the MRC's current support for research in this field. The MRC welcomes high quality applications for support in any scientific area which will further our understanding of autism, and especially those areas which were highlighted in the recent MRC review of autism: causes and epidemiology; this does not preclude research involving MMR.</p>
