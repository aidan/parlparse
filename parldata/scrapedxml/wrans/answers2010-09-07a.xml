We have made no further estimate of the impact on the size of the prison population, other than the impact assessment that accompanied the Bill. The Government will shortly lay before Parliament a memorandum providing a post-legislative assessment of the Drugs Act 2005.</p>

To satisfy the test a person must first have a right to reside and secondly, be actually habitually resident in the Common Travel Area<sup>(1)</sup> (CTA).

The Department only collects case-specific data at the point the local authority makes a decision on a claim and this can be up to 12 months in the past. Broad rental market area boundaries are subject to regular review and can change resulting in new areas being created.

	<p pid="a.403W.2/2">The figures provided do not include costs where records are not available centrally or where such records no longer exist. Not all of the Department, its agencies and sponsored bodies were able to provide the requested security cost information for each year of this request. Therefore the total annual spend on security for earlier years has necessarily omitted any spend for those bodies that were unable to provide this information. This suppresses the total spending figures for earlier years when compared to more recent years where more complete information is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.2/3">In addition, central records are not to be taken as representative of total costs as there have been differences across the Department and its Agencies in approach to attributing administrative spend against security, as opposed to ICT, Estates, HR etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.2/4">In this respect it should be noted that the security costs for the central Department before 2007-08 did not include costs associated with the provision for National Security Vetting, at which time these functions were transferred from the Department's HR team to the security team.</p>

	<p pid="a.403W.5/1">In the 12 month period from July 2009 to July 2010, the Highways Agency received 4023 claims for compensation under Part 1 Land Compensation Act 1973.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.5/2">As a result of the process that claims are required to go through in order to establish eligibility and to calculate the amount of compensation payable, not all of the claims submitted over the last 12 months have been settled within that time. Therefore, I cannot estimate the proportion that will prove to be successful. On average, however, compensation is paid in 63% of claims submitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.5/3">Under Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 ('the Act'), compensation can be claimed by people who own and also occupy property that has been reduced in value by more than &#163;50 by physical factors caused by the use of a new or altered road. The physical factors are noise, vibration, smell, fumes, smoke and artificial lighting and the discharge on to the property of any solid or liquid substance.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.5/4">All Part 1 claims submitted to the Highways Agency are checked to ensure that claimants are both eligible to claim, and hold a qualifying interest in land as defined by the Act. The claims are then individually assessed by the Agency's independent valuation contractors to ensure that the correct amount of compensation is paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.5/5">The Agency aims to process and settle all claims as quickly as possible. For a small road scheme where there are a small number of claims which are straightforward, this will usually take about six months to complete. For larger road schemes where there are a large number of claims or if the claim is complex, the processing period may take longer, up to 18 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.404W.5/1">The Government have made clear that an urgent priority is to tackle the UK's record deficit in order to restore confidence in our economy and support the recovery. As a contribution to addressing the record deficit, we therefore have reduced the previous plans for local authority funding in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.5/2">Central Government's financial support grant to local authorities is provided through a variety of mechanisms, such as formula grant (including the revenue support grant), specific grants and specific capital grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.5/3">The Government are clear that local government needs increased flexibility to take decisions locally. It has therefore retained the most flexible funding (formula grant) for 2010-11 at the level approved previously by Parliament (&#163;29 billion).</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.5/4">We have also lifted restrictions on how local government spends its money by removing ring-fences. We expect local authorities to be able to make savings from efficiency measures, eliminating waste and, where necessary, reducing spending in areas that are lower priorities for their communities. The fact that certain grants have been chosen for reduction over others does not mean that the Government expect there to be a direct correlation between grant reductions and local authority budget changes. For example, road safety grant was reduced as this grant was spread evenly across all local authorities, not because this was considered an area of lower priority spending.</p>

	<p pid="a.413W.0/1">It was originally intended that the Olympic Village would be delivered by a private developer. However, as a consequence of the economic downturn, the previous Government decided that the private developer option did not offer the best value for money for the taxpayer and &#163;650 million of funding for the Olympic Village was therefore provided from the public sector funding package for the 2012 Games. Additional funding of &#163;268 million was provided by Triathlon Homes, a consortium of First Base, and East Thames and Southern registered social landlords, as part of the agreement to purchase 1,379 affordable homes, with the balance of funding due to be raised by sales of homes for occupancy after the Games. Further information on this arrangement was published in the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Quarterly Economic Report, July 2009.</p>

An example of an area where we are exploring how the Games might help to deliver Big Society aspirations is through volunteering. The Games are reliant on volunteers: from Games-time venue-based volunteers to city volunteers in London, Weymouth and other venue locations plus at ports of entry and along the Torch Relay route. We also see great potential for the Games to inspire people across the country to volunteer and engage in their local communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.415W.13/2">When a company registered under the Companies Acts is dissolved, any property and rights in England and Wales held by the company at the date of its dissolution (including any money in bank accounts) pass to the Crown as &quot;bona vacantia&quot;. The Treasury Solicitor is the Crown's nominee for dealing with bona vacantia in England (except in the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster), Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, bona vacantia falls to be dealt with by the Queen and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer. Income from bona vacantia is paid into the Consolidated Fund. Banks and other institutions holding such funds are entitled to make lawful deductions in respect of their charges before remitting the balance as bona vacantia.</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.13/3">Where a company is placed in liquidation prior to being dissolved, the liquidator will apply any assets of the company (including any money in bank accounts) to pay its debts. In these circumstances by the time the company is dissolved there will ordinarily be no assets to pass to the Crown as bona vacantia.</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.13/4">In the financial year 2009-10 the Bona Vacantia Division of the Treasury Solicitor's Department received &#163;46,873,362.65 from banks, building societies and other financial institutions and from solicitors' client accounts in respect of dissolved companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.417W.3/1">The business of selling animals as pets is regulated by the Pet Animals Act 1951 (as amended, 1983). This means that anyone who wishes to sell pet animals as a business must obtain a valid licence from their local authority. Local authorities have powers of inspection and can decide whether or not a premise should be licensed. Guidelines for local authority inspectors, which include minimum standards of welfare, are produced by. the Local Government Association with assistance from the British Veterinary Association, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, Ornamental Aquatic Trade Association and Pet Care Trust and are currently being updated.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.3/2">The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates trade in endangered animals and plants. Although not a welfare convention it aims to make sure that international trade is conducted sustainably, ensuring the long-term survival of species. CITES strictly regulates and monitors trade through a permitting system. Trade in those species at most risk of extinction from international trade is banned except in exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.3/3">CITES provisions are applied uniformly in the European Community (EC) through two EC Regulations (Council Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1808/2001). The regulations are often stricter than CITES itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.3/4">I am satisfied that the current legislation, including the Animal Welfare Act 2006, provides adequate protection for the welfare of animals being sold as pets.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.11/1">DEFRA has been one of the main funding partners in a long-running project researching the possibility of identifying a biological control agent for Japanese knotweed. A controlled release of the highly specialist psyllid-&quot;Aphalara itadori&quot;-is now under way to help control this plant. If successful, this insect should restrict its growth, slow its capacity to spread vigorously and enhance the effectiveness of management effort, although it would not eradicate it altogether.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.11/2">Other management-related research work on alien plant species supported by DEFRA includes a collaborative project with the Netherlands on four shared invasive aquatic non-native plants; scoping biological control for a further four highly damaging non-native species of plant; and developing a support protocol and methodology to enable the Overseas Territories to access invertebrate plant pest identification expertise within the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera).</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.11/3">DEFRA, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly launched a comprehensive Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain in May 2008. It has been described in a 2010 European Environment Agency report as an outstanding national response to the issue in Europe. The Strategy provides a high-level framework for a range of activities including research and is being implemented on a prioritised basis. We have now started work on developing a clearer statement of evidence needs to support its continued implementation. This will include management-related research and we will be taking this forward in collaboration with key partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.434W.5/2">Since the Department does not have a learning management system it is very difficult to collate data from 100 sub-departments. We do recognise the need to be able to centrally store, acquire and collate various types of human resources (HR) data to enable reporting-for example for parliamentary questions like one. Whilst it is possible to access data from a variety of different and diverse systems, this is not without considerable and often disproportionate effort. To that end we are working on the design and build of a new HR Management system, incorporating the capability to provide (at short notice) a variety of learning and development reports, including those relating to further and higher education. This work is scheduled to be completed by end 2010.</p>

There have been widespread variations in the size and population coverage of primary care trusts (PCTs), which are currently responsible for commissioning national health service health care services, and there is no evidence to suggest a single 'right' size. Practices will have flexibility within the new legislative framework to form consortia in ways they think will secure the best health care and health outcomes for their patients and locality.

	<p pid="a.463W.3/1">The Government's White Paper 'Equality and Excellence: Liberating the NHS', published <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July</phrase>, set out how the improvement of health care outcomes for patients should be the primary purpose of the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-19">19 July</phrase>, we launched a public consultation on proposals for developing an NHS Outcomes Framework. 'Transparency in outcomes-a framework for the NHS', seeks views on the structure, and core principles that should underpin the development of the framework as well as the more specific outcome indicators that should be included. The consultation can be accessed via the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_117583">www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_117583</a></p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/4">and a copy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/5">The consultation document puts forward proposals for a framework structured around five broad outcome goals or domains.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/6" class="indent">Domain 1: Preventing people from dying prematurely;</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/7" class="indent">Domain 2: Enhancing the quality of life for people with long-term conditions;</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/8" class="indent">Domain 3: Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury;</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/9" class="indent">Domain 4: Ensuring people have a positive experience of care; and</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/10" class="indent">Domain 5: Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/11">Within domain 5, which looks at patient safety, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been included as an example in the improvement area covering safe treatment. In Annex A (page 59, paragraph 3.63) of the consultation document, the example indicator for VTE measures the incidence of VTE through Hospital Episode Statistics data. To support the achievement of outcomes in all domains of this framework, there will be a suite of Quality Standards setting out what high quality care looks across all major pathways of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/12">During the consultation period, the Department will be analysing potential outcome indicators against a set of criteria; which will lead to the selection of 20-30 evidence-based outcome indicators that are clinically relevant and reflect what is important to patients. In the selection of the final indicators for the framework, reference will be made to Quality Standards. This process is described in chapter 3 (page 18, paragraph 3.3-3.63) of the consultation document.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.3/13">The NHS Outcomes Framework will provide a mechanism by which the Secretary of State for Health can hold the proposed NHS Commissioning Board to account for the outcomes it is securing for patients through its role in allocating resources and overseeing the commissioning process that, in future, will be led locally by general practitioner consortiums. How consortiums are held to account for delivering these outcomes will be a matter for the NHS Commissioning Board to determine, subject to legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.3/1">The following table details the number of assault incidents, by establishment, of prisoner on prisoner and prisoner on prison officer from 2002 until 2009, the last full year for which we have figures. The National Offender Management Service does not record the number of assaults, rather it records assault incidents in which one or more persons have been assaulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.3/2">Prisons have a responsibility to keep prisoners, staff and visitors safe. The management of violence and its reduction, including support for staff, is central to successful prison management.

A new key performance indicator for serious assaults was introduced in 2003-04 and as a result reporting of all assault incidents improved. Reported incidents before 2005 are therefore not directly comparable with later figures. It is now expected that all assaults, including fights, should be reported whether or not there was an injury. As this was not the case in the past care needs to be taken when interpreting changes over the years.<br/> 2. Rises or falls in numbers of assault incidents from one year to the next are not a good indicator of underlying trend. Changes to prisons will affect numbers of incidents. In addition, some prisons may have opened new wings/house blocks or closed others for refurbishment. These often explain large increases or decreases from one year to the next.<br/> 3. These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems. Care is taken when processing and analysing the returns but the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. Although the figures are shown to the last individual the figures may not be accurate to that level.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.520W.3/1">Communities and Local Government is responsible for the England and Wales Building Regulations. These set out the standards which new buildings must meet, and Part L of the Regulations (conservation of fuel and power) sets out energy efficiency standards for all new domestic and non-domestic buildings. The current Part L represents 90% improvement on 1990 standards, and in October 2010, the new standards will specify a further 25% reduction in carbon emissions from new buildings compared to the current 2006 Regulations. The Building Regulations cover all public buildings apart from the Crown Estate (buildings owned by Government Departments). There are no incentives offered for complying with the regulations, but the Government's proposed Green Deal will provide building occupiers with access to funding for energy efficiency measures, to be repaid through savings on their energy bills.</p>
