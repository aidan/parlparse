An information data set has been produced, which contains national and local performance data including the number of offenders being conditionally cautioned and the types of offences conditional cautions have been issued for. The information data set is issued by the national prosecution team on a monthly basis to all staff across areas with lead responsibility for conditional cautioning.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.5/4">Conditional cautioning is being implemented across each criminal justice area in a phased approach. To date, conditional cautioning is operational in 93 police basic command units across 41 out of the 42 criminal justice areas. Full implementation of the scheme across 230 basic command units is expected to be achieved by April 2008. There have been 2,963 conditional cautions issued nationally since the first pilot schemes were introduced in 2005. A breakdown of the number of conditional cautions in each CPS area is also available from:</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.3/3">As a matter of policy MOD leaves the decision whether to take out additional cover in the form of personal insurance to the individual as individual needs vary and personal insurance is a complex issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.3/4">In the past, service personnel have sometimes encountered difficulties in obtaining affordable life insurance that provides cover for war risks such as chemical or biological attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.3/5">One scheme currently available to all service personnel, including those deployed abroad is PAX which provides personal accident and life cover. PAX covers war risks, but has in the past imposed restrictions (such as closing the scheme or introducing war and terrorism risks) for new members.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.3/6">In addition, MOD's Service Risks Insurance Premiums Refunds scheme currently contributes towards extra life insurance premiums incurred by personnel involved in certain high risk activities such as flying. The compensation available is 90 per cent. of the extra premium up to a total sum assured, which is increased every year in line with service pay and is currently &pound;157,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.3/7">In addition, the MOD launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May</phrase> a new life insurance scheme, aimed exclusively at service personnel, Service Life Insurance (SLI). The scheme is available to all service personnel&mdash;including those deployed abroad on operations&mdash;and guarantees affordable cover, including against the risks of war and terrorism throughout their service and civilian life. Premiums are comparable to those paid by civilians, with no premium loading for personnel deployed on operations&mdash;or those involved in high risk activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.209W.0/2">The role of DLA is to help with the extra costs of disability-related needs. These needs are met free of charge by the NHS when someone is in hospital.

However, payment of DLA to children aged under 16 does not stop until after 12 weeks, regardless of their diagnosis. Carer's allowance would also normally continue to be paid to the carer for this 12 week period. The 12-week rule recognises that children may have special needs for support from their parents while they are adjusting to hospital life.</p>

	<p pid="a.212W.2/2">In addition to our work on reducing emissions from livestock through nutrition, husbandry, genetics, and nutrient management, we are also exploring the potential for the use of anaerobic digestion to reduce methane emissions. Anaerobic digestion can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing methane from the decomposition of organic materials, such as livestock manures and slurries, sewage sludge and food wastes, to produce a biogas. The biogas can be used as a renewable energy source, both for heat and power, and as a transport fuel.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.5/1">My Department does not hold this information. Water and sewerage companies are responsible for assessing the capacity of public sewers in order to ensure the effectual drainage of their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.5/2">Typically, the public sewerage system overall is designed to withstand a one in 30 year storm event and waste water treatment works are designed to deal with six times dry weather flows without discharging excess water to a watercourse.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.5/3">It has been estimated that up to 50 per cent. of the sewerage network may be in private hands (for example, householders) and information on capacity for this section of the network is not available. Earlier this year, the Government announced that existing private sewers and lateral drains that drain to public sewers would be transferred into the ownership of water and sewerage companies. This will significantly improve the integrated management of the sewerage network as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.5/4">As well as private sewers, there is also an extensive network of surface water drainage associated with highways which is the responsibility of highways authorities. This frequently discharges and interacts with the public sewerage network.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.5/5">DEFRA is also funding 15 pilot projects to test alternative approaches to the integrated management of urban drainage across the different organisations with responsibilities in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.5/6">The Office of the Water Services (Ofwat) compile figures on the numbers of properties at varying risk of flooding from overloaded public sewers. The price limits for 2005-10 allowed a programme of nearly &pound;1 billion to safeguard homes against the risk of sewer flooding. By then, the proportion of properties at risk would reduce to 0.01 per cent. of households.</p>

	<p pid="a.215W.2/1">A national survey of trees and woodland is carried out every 15-20 years by the Forestry Commission. The most recent inventory was published in 2001 and the next survey is planned to start next year. When completed this will enable an assessment of deforestation (i.e. the area of woodland lost between the two surveys) to be carried out. However, the Forestry Commission estimates that the current level of deforestation in England is running at between 500 and 1,000 hectares per year. This is almost entirely due to the removal of planted woodland to restore priority open habitats including lowland heath and upland peat bog.</p>
	<p pid="a.215W.2/2">New woodland create on has averaged almost 5,000 hectares per year over the last five years, outweighing the area lost to open habitat restoration.</p>

	<p pid="a.216W.0/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government and the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister before it has since 2000 provided a system of performance incentivisation for local authorities in England across a range of service areas. This system operated via the Local Public Service Agreements (LPSA), which have since been merged with Local Area Agreements (LAA). These agreements offered a reward grant to local authorities who could deliver outcomes over and above the level of performance Government would otherwise expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.0/2">61 local authorities chose to include in their LPSA or LAA a measure performance on adoption and/or stability of placements for looked-after children, though the targets would not refer specifically to babies under the age of six months. Reward would be payable to local authorities and their partners for achievement of these particular targets, and in a number of cases this has now been claimed. Details on each target have been made available in the Library of the House, though we do not have data on the age of the children adopted in local authority areas.</p>

This is reflected in the Government's recent response to the all-party parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism.

	<p pid="a.222W.2/1">The single issue review of its Regional Spatial Strategy, &quot;Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation in the East of England&quot; currently being carried out by the East of England Regional Assembly reflects the important role that &quot;Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Circular 1/06, Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Sites&quot; gives to Regional Spatial Strategies in addressing the shortage of authorised accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers.</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/2">The main steps in the process are:</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/3" class="indent">Local authorities assess needs through their Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessments;</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/4" class="indent">The Regional Planning Body (i.e. the Regional Assembly) defines the total level of need in the region and the level of additional pitch provision at district council level through its Regional Spatial Strategy;</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/5" class="indent">The Regional Spatial Strategy is confirmed by the Secretary of State, following an examination in public conducted by an independent panel if necessary;</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/6" class="indent">Local planning authorities define the locations for new sites through their Local Development Documents and ensure delivery through their strategic housing role.</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/7">The Regional Assembly gave a commitment to carry out such a review in early 2006 at the Examination in Public into the main review of the East of England Regional Spatial Strategy, where it admitted that its policy did not meet the requirements of the Circular.</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/8">We are grateful to the Regional Assembly for its work on the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation review, which is the first in the country to fully reflect the requirements of Circular 1/06.</p>

Where necessary, there will also be an in-home service to help with the installation and use of equipment, or the upgrading of an aerial. Those eligible for the scheme will also be able to opt for an integrated digital television or personal video recorder.

These are the only factors that the Secretary of State may take into account in making listing decisions. State of repair, cost of maintenance and unsuitability for modern needs are matters which are not relevant to the assessment of a building's qualifications for listing&mdash;but they are all things which can be taken into account by the Planning Authority in considering any application to demolish or alter a listed building.</p>

There are a number of charitable trusts that make grants towards the preservation and upkeep of historic buildings. In addition, the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) has powers to provide financial assistance towards the repair and maintenance of buildings of importance to the national heritage, through the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).

	<p pid="a.232W.11/1">There are no specific measures in place to ensure that children younger than six years are not prescribed methylphenidate drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.11/2">Methylphenidate is licensed only for children over six years of age as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) where remedial measures alone prove insufficient. Drug treatment for ADHD should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified health professional with expertise in ADHD and should be based on a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug treatment may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.11/3">A medical practitioner may, however, prescribe methylphenidate to children younger than six years (prescribing a licensed medicine for an unlicensed use, so called 'off-label prescribing'). Medical practitioners are ultimately responsible for all their prescribing decisions. They should always satisfy themselves that all drugs or other substances they consider appropriate for their patients can be safely prescribed, that patients are adequately monitored and that, where necessary, expert hospital supervision is available.</p>

Consumers can thus benefit from a more consistent interface to public transport and the ability to use one card across many different transport operators and schemes in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/2">Local transport authorities in England are able to decide whether to introduce smart card technology on buses, trams and metro systems. The second edition of the Department for Transport's guidance on local transport plans stipulates that the eGIF standards, in which ITSO is a recommended standard, shall be used for smart card procurements.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/3">The Department is currently consulting on the specifications for a national concessionary bus travel pass for older and disabled people in England. This includes an option to specify, in regulations, that the passes must be in smartcard format and be ITSO compliant.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/4">It is a requirement of all new rail franchises that a percentage of tickets sold must meet the ITSO specification.</p>

	<p pid="a.255W.2/4" class="indentitalic"> Income</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/5" class="indent">Statistics on household and personal incomes are available from both household surveys and tax records.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/6" class="indent">The ONS publishes an annual article on 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income' which is based on data collected in the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS). The EPS uses an annual sample of approximately 7,000 households in the UK, and provides a comprehensive measurement of all sources of income for private households in the UK. The results are presented for households rather than individuals, and the individuals within each household are assumed to benefit equally from the household's income. While these survey based results provide an accurate picture of the broad distribution of income, because of the relatively small sample size, it is not possible to produce reliable statistics for households at the extremes of the distribution, particularly the top (or bottom) 1 per cent and top (or bottom) 0.1 per cent of households.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/7" class="indent">Tax records do provide more reliable statistics about the top end of the income distribution. HM Revenue and Custom's Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) is based on a large sample of tax records and provides a measure of annual income for taxpayers. The survey excludes almost two fifths of adults in the UK who have no income tax liability, and measures individual rather than household income. However, it does provide very good coverage of the top end of the income distribution, since all individuals at the top of the income distribution should be taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/8" class="indent">For these reasons, estimates of income have been provided from both of these sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/9" class="indent">Results for quintile groups and for the top ten per cent have been provided from the ONS's taxes and benefits article (Table 1), while results for the top 5 per cent, top 1 per cent, and top 0.1 per cent have been provided from HMRC's Survey of Personal Incomes (Table 2).</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/10" class="indent">However it should be emphasised that the results from these two sources are not directly comparable because of important differences in concept and coverage. The ONS figures are based on household incomes, and are based on a ranking of households, so in this case the top decile, is the top 10 per cent of households, ranked by household income. The HMRC figures on the other hand, show individual incomes and are based on a ranking of individuals. Furthermore, the ONS's estimates are based on a sample of all private households in the UK, whereas the HMRC figures are only representative of taxpayers. So in this case, the top 1 per cent, is the top 1 per cent of individuals, based on a ranking of taxpayers only.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/11" class="indent">Table 1 shows the percentage share of total equivalised disposable household income for quintile groups and for the top decile. Also shown are the lower bounds (the percentile points) for these groups (in &pound; per year), and the number of households per quantile group.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/12" class="indent">The income quantile groups are determined by ranking households according to their equivalised disposable income. Equivalised incomes are standardised to take into account different sizes and compositions of households. The standard household is deemed to be a two adult household with no children, and so these equivalised incomes can be interpreted as indicating a standard of living that would be achieved by a standard household with that income. Disposable income is gross income from all sources less income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/13" class="indent">Table 2 shows the percentage share of total income for the top 5 per cent, top 1 per cent, and top 0.1 per cent of individual taxpayers. The figures are shown both before and after deduction of income tax (but without national insurance contributions or council tax deducted), although the ranking of individuals is based on income before tax. Again, percentile points and the number of individuals in each of these groups are also shown.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/14" class="indent">Both sets of estimates provided here are subject to sampling variation, although the HMRC estimates are based on a very large sample of administrative records (520,000 in 2004/05) and are therefore less subject to sampling variation. For this reason, the income shares in Table 2 are shown to an extra decimal place, while those in Table 1 are rounded to the nearest 1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/15" class="indent">Estimates have been provided for the years closest to those requested, although particularly for 1979, not all estimates are available. The earlier years which are shown in Table 1 are calendar years rather than financial years.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/16" class="indentitalic"> Wealth</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/17" class="indent">Information on the percentage of UK wealth held by those in different income ranges is not available. Although HMRC do produce wealth distribution statistics, the data which underpins these statistics includes no information on income and cannot be combined with other data sources to provide a suitable basis for analysing the relationship between wealth and income. Wealth distribution statistics are published at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/personal_wealth/menu.htm">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/personal_wealth/menu.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/18" class="indent">The ONS has recently introduced a Household Assets Survey which will measure both income and wealth for UK households. Initial results from the Household Assets Survey are due to be published at the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.0/2">The weight of a seven-year-old Rhesus Macaque would typically be between 6 and 9kg. For an animal of that weight the Home Office code of practice for the housing and care of animals used in scientific procedures specifies an enclosure with a minimum floor area of 14,000 sq cm and with a height of at least 1.5 metres, if singly housed, and per animal if housed, as is usual, in groups. These minima are often exceeded in practice, particularly if animals have to be singly housed, or if they weigh more than 9kg, for which animals the code of practice gives no specific provision. The code of practice does not specify the time for which access to additional space must be provided. However the majority of primates are kept in grouped housing or, if they have to be singly housed, are allowed access to larger exercise enclosures during the working day.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.0/3">We aim to publish a revised code of practice to take account of the guidelines set out in the revised Appendix A to the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experiment and other Scientific Purposes (ETS 123) in 2008, after the requirements for consultation and parliamentary scrutiny have been met.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.0/4">The United Kingdom Government played an active part in producing the revised Council of Europe guidelines and began the process of ensuring their adoption in the United Kingdom well before they were finally agreed in June 2006. Implementation of the guidelines is not dependent on the publication of a revised UK code of practice and is being achieved more quickly and more effectively through the day to day contact between our inspectors and the scientific community.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.0/5">All animals used in procedures licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 must be housed in accordance within the cage and pen dimensions in the Home Office code of practice for the housing of animals in designated breeding and supplying establishments. Any form of restraint applied for an experimental or other scientific purpose that may cause pain suffering distress or lasting harm may be applied only as part of a programme of work specified in a project licence issued under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. There must be adequate scientific justification for the use of restraint, it must be the least degree of restraint necessary to achieve the scientific objectives and it must be applied for the shortest period of time to achieve those objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.5/3">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which will be implemented from Autumn 2008, provides the legislative framework to help prevent unsuitable people from working with children. The Act applies where an individual is undertaking regulated activity, which includes teaching, training, supervising, caring for or offering advice, guidance or instruction to children where it is done frequently or intensively (overnight or on more than two days in a 30 day period). Operating a children's agency would also be included. An individual who is barred under the new scheme will commit an offence if they seek to engage in this activity and an employer will commit an offence if they seek to use such a person.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/4">In addition, those running agencies are required to meet the provisions of the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and associated regulations, which are designed to protect those using the work-finding services they provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/5">The regulations provide that agencies which supply individuals to work with or alongside vulnerable persons, including children, must carry out strict checks regarding those individuals which include taking up of independent references. Where agencies supply workers to work with children, these checks would include a Criminal Records Bureau check.</p>

	<p pid="a.267W.10/1">Data mashing is a term used for taking and combining data from different sources to create new and often innovative services. This is most commonly done with published structured data made available on the world wide web via application programming interfaces (APIs), using data and services from providers such as Google, Yahoo and Amazon. Data mashing is the process, the mashup is the product.</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.10/2">In the United Kingdom, all forms of processing personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998. Although the Act does not refer specifically to data mashing or mashup, its provisions will apply where a website operator in the UK takes legitimate public sources of information about individuals and then publishes a combined version of that information on the internet. In particular the first principle requiring the processing to be fair and lawful will apply.</p>

	<p pid="a.268W.0/1">For business journeys, the Ministry of Justice encourages staff to use public transport where practicable. Staff policy for travel and subsistence requires that staff restrict the use of pool cars or private motor vehicles to journeys that cannot be readily made by public transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/2">Further assistance and encouragement is provided by the offer of interest free loans for the purchase of season tickets for travel to work by public transport and for bicycles (including safety equipment) which are available to all employees that have at least two months service. These advances are repayable in equal monthly instalments within the life of the ticket or over a maximum of 12 months for the purchase of the bicycle. The Ministry also offers;</p>

	<p pid="a.268W.0/6">In addition, all prisons in England and Wales have travel plans. Each plan covers issues such as staff travel to and from work, car parking on site, car sharing, the use of fleet vehicles and official travelling by staff. While the format of the plans was standardised, the actual plans reflected the different circumstances at each site. Local authorities are now placing increasing emphasis on reducing travel impacts and ask to see copies of prisons' travel plans when considering planning applications for new houseblocks or other major work at existing prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/7">The main London headquarters buildings of the National Offender Management Service and the Prison Service also have a travel plan. This covers staff travel to work, visitors to Headquarters buildings and delivery and contractors' vehicles and aims to ensure that staff use, wherever, possible, environmentally friendly methods of travelling to work in order to minimise the impact of their travelling arrangements on the environment.</p>

The Judicial Appointments Commission, a non-departmental public body, has, since its launch in April 2006, responsibility for the selection of judges for appointment to courts and tribunals. One of its statutory duties is to encourage diversity in the range of persons available for selection for appointment.

Producer Compliance Schemes have made representations on this in relation to a situation when a producer fails to pay its membership fees and thus the scheme has the obligation but has not received the necessary payments from the producer to cover the associated costs. Producer Compliance Schemes are however required under the regulations to ensure they have sufficient resources to fully discharge the obligation of their members and if a producer does not adhere to the membership requirements, ie payment of fees etc the scheme can use existing debt recovery regulations to pursue the producer.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;While hydrocarbon resources are finite, nonetheless issues of access to reserves, prevailing investment regime and availability of upstream infrastructure and capital seem greater barriers to medium-term growth than limits to the resource base itself.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.294W.2/2">The judiciary are currently seeking views on a revised Public Law Outline, designed to reduce unnecessary delay by providing a more streamlined case management process for public law care cases. The current six case management stages, within the existing case management protocol are reduced to four. The Public Law Outline proposals take forward a key recommendation contained in the &quot;Review of the Child Care Proceedings System in England and Wales&quot;, commissioned jointly by the former Department for Constitutional Affairs and the former Department for Education and Skills and published in May 2006. The review's recommendations are intended to achieve better outcomes for children, as well as helping to ensure that resources across the family justice system are used to best effect. Reduction in unnecessary delay together with an increased emphasis on pre-proceedings preparation should contribute to a containment of costs.</p>

DCSF has also funded a carbon detective kit for pupils aged seven to 14 to help them investigate the sustainability performance of their own school <a href="http://www.carbondetectives.org.uk">www.carbondetectives.org.uk</a>. The pack and detective kit are part of the wider DCSF Sustainable Schools programme which aims to embed sustainability in the curriculum, how schools operate (e.g. reducing energy and water usage) and in their work with the local community:</p>

Most children in care live with foster carers&mdash;only 13 per cent. live in children's homes. Our proposals include: a &pound;500 educational allowance for children in care at risk of falling behind at school; putting the 'designated teacher' on a statutory footing to Improve the expertise in schools; appointing 'virtual school heads' to oversee their education; improving attendance and reducing exclusions; reducing mobility of school placements, particularly in the crucial years before GCSEs; and a bursary of a minimum of &pound;2,000 for all children in care who go on to university. These proposals build on the measures already in place: a specific duty on local authorities to promote the educational achievement of children in care and a requirement to give them the highest priority in school admission arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.299W.0/1">The Department launched a new phonics area of the standards website in March this year. The website contains published criteria to help schools and early years settings judge how well phonics teaching programmes meet the characteristics of high quality phonic work as defined in Sir Jim Rose's review of the teaching of early reading. To ensure that this process is as easy and useful as possible for schools and settings we have invited publishers of commercial programmes to evaluate their own programme against the criteria and complete a self-assessment form which is then published on the site. This is a purely voluntary process.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.0/2">The Department does not rank, endorse or promote any particular commercial phonics programme. We have committed to establishing a monitoring process to assess the accuracy of the information provided in the self-evaluation forms. This process is currently being developed and further information about how it will work will be provided on the website.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.0/3">Letters and Sounds is one of many high quality phonics teaching programmes which meet the core criteria and we are not promoting it as the preferred phonics programme. An early version of the materials was previewed in some local authorities and with practitioners and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Letters and Sounds was distributed to all primary schools and local authorities during May and June. It will therefore take some time for the full effects to become known but we are confident that Letters and Sounds will make a significant contribution to improving standards of literacy. Initial feedback from practitioners indicates a very positive response to the materials and we will use this information to further refine our support for local authorities. The Primary National Strategy is monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of Letters and Sounds and Sir Jim Rose has been asked to report back at the end of the year on the implementation of his recommendations, including on Letters and Sounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.0/4">Systematic, high quality phonics is proven to be the most effective way of teaching children to read and is an integral part of the renewed primary literacy framework and the early years foundation stage. The resources and guidance on the phonics website provide schools and early years settings with the tools they need to make informed decisions about which high quality phonics programme will best suit their needs. The Primary National Strategy's Communication Language and Literacy Development (CLLD) programme, which builds on the successful Early Reading Development Pilot, was developed to implement the recommendations of Sir Jim's review. The programme began in autumn 2006. Through the programme, every local authority now has a local CLLD lead who will work to strengthen leadership and management of early literacy and support all primary schools and early years settings in the use of an effective phonics programme.</p>

EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block.

	<p pid="a.303W.2/3">I have placed a copy in the Library of the House. We estimate that there will be one-off costs of around &pound;200 million, made up of &pound;80 million for new buildings and facilities, and &pound;120 million for the training of new staff. We estimate that there will be annual costs of around &pound;740 million on top of costs already factored into achieving our existing aspiration of 90 per cent. participation of 17-year-olds by 2015. This is made up of &pound;590 million in additional participation costs, &pound;50 million in additional funding for local authorities (to run the registration system, to provide additional support and guidance, and to enforce the duty), &pound;10 million in enforcement costs and &pound;90 million in additional costs to support those with special educational needs (SEN).</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.2/4">Initial analysis suggests that the additional economic benefit to the economy from all young people participating to 18, over and above the current 90 per cent. participation aspiration, is around &pound;1.4 billion for a single cohort of young people (discounted over their lifetime). The likely benefits of raising the participation age are much wider than this, however, as we know those who participate and attain post 16 enjoy better health, better social skills and reduced likelihood of being involved in crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.309W.2/1">Total funding per pupil in the maintained sector was &pound;4,800 in 2005-08 compared with our estimate of &pound;8,000 per pupil in the independent sector. As set out in Budget 2006, the Government aim&mdash;over time, and adjusting for inflation&mdash;to increase levels of funding to that level. The comprehensive spending review settlement for education announced in Budget 2007 allows the Government to take a significant further step towards this ambition&mdash;with total per pupil revenue and capital funding rising from under &pound;2,500 in 1997-98 to &pound;5,550 in 2007-08 and &pound;6,600 in 2010-11. Progress over future spending reviews will depend on the Government's fiscal position; demographic change; and progress by schools in continuing to deliver improvements in results and wider support for parents and pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.309W.5/1">Our policy is that all new primary and secondary schools will have fire sprinklers installed. The decision should be taken based on a risk analysis. There may be a few cases where new schools are at a low risk of fire and that sprinklers would not represent good value for money. The risk analysis and cost benefit analysis tools we have recently published to help clients decide whether or not to install sprinkler systems in schools can also be used to determine whether or not an existing school should have sprinklers fitted, as part of a major refurbishment project.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.2/1">In the 14-19 Education and Skills Implementation Plan published in December 2005, we set out our plans to create 50,000 additional 16-19 school, college and work based learning places by September 2007. We will ensure that in every area, young people have access to high quality post-16 learning opportunities in schools, colleges and work-based learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/2">We believe in encouraging successful and popular schools to develop sixth form provision. We have introduced the 'sixth form presumption' that sixth form proposals will be approved from high performing specialist schools that are awarded a vocational specialism, Over three years, we anticipate this will enable around 60 schools to add new post-16 provision. 13 schools successfully applied to open sixth form provision in 2006/07 through this route, and a further 27 are eligible to do in 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/3">Additional school sixth forms will also be created to meet local need as a result of other proposals from local authorities and schools, through the Academies programme, through local Building Schools for the Future capital investment strategies and as a result of 16-19 competitions (which are run by the Learning and Skills Council where there is a need for substantial new post-16 provision that is not met through an Academy or a 'presumption' proposal). In parallel, we have also introduced the 'FE presumption1' which encourages high performing colleges to expand to provide additional places for 16 to 19-year-olds.</p>

	<p pid="a.327W.0/1">The Department has not made an estimate of the number of rural schools which are likely to close in each year to 2015. Decisions about school closures are made by the local authority, or schools adjudicator. When considering proposals, local authorities and the schools adjudicator are required to have regard to statutory guidance which contains a presumption against closing rural primary schools. While this does not mean that no rural primary school will ever close, the case for closure must be strong and in the best interests of educational provision in the area.</p>

	<p pid="a.327W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase> setting out the Government's plans for raising standards in schools. The Education and Inspections Act 2006 put in place a new framework which will underpin these plans, including the creation of trusts to strengthen the governance of schools and enable schools to forge permanent relationships with external partners. The Act requires local authorities to promote diversity and increase choice, and gives them new powers to commission school places in response to parental demand. Local authorities also have enhanced powers to tackle poorly performing schools. The academies programme will continue to drive up standards in disadvantaged communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.327W.3/2">As my right honourable Friend made clear, the Government's focus is on standards. We are confident that the framework that we have put in place gives schools and local authorities the tools they need to deliver better outcomes for children and families.</p>

This data was produced as a result of an ad-hoc request, asking local authorities for information on preferences met on national offer date (1 March) i.e. the date on which all offers for entry to secondary school in September 2007 should be sent.  2. As the Department does not specify how this data must be measured and reported, as it is not routinely collected, there are differences in how individual local authorities may have measured preferences met, e.g. most would have measured the proportion of parents living in their area who were offered a place at their first preference of school (regardless of the location of that school); while others measure the proportion of those offered a place at a school in that area for whom it was a first preference (regardless of where the parent resides).  3. The picture in most, if not all, local authority areas would have changed. National offer date is only the beginning of a process. Following receipt of offers of school places, parents have to say if they will accept them. Some will not, e.g. because they have moved away, taken a place at an independent school etc. These places can then be reoffered to other parents, who may be made an improved offer from that sent to them on 1 March. Between offer date and the end of July, many parents also appeal against refusal of places at preferred schools. In 2005-06, 36.4 per cent. of secondary school admission appeals were successful.  <i> Source:</i><i> </i>Data provided to the DfES during March 2007 (see notes).</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.334W.2/1">The revised curriculum will be effective in providing flexibility for catch up classes in English and mathematics; effective in providing flexibility to allow pupils to extend and deepen their understanding in areas where they have particular aptitudes and interests; and effective in providing pupils with the personal attributes and practical life skills they will need for success at work and in their daily lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.2/2">The approach taken by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in developing the new curriculum builds on evidence from work carried out with schools and colleges going back a number of years. For example, the 'futures in action' programme, which has been running since 2005, has continued to demonstrate a high degree of consensus about many of the characteristics of how the curriculum should be shaped, QCA's work is also supported by the results of its international comparisons and its annual curriculum monitoring programme which includes interviews and questionnaires with head teachers, deputy heads, teachers and pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.2/3">It is not practical to collect all of this research evidence, from the UK and abroad, and to place copies of all relevant documents in the Libraries of the House. However, much of this information can be accessed via the QCA's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.337W.3/1">All teachers, as part of their initial teacher training and induction period, must demonstrate that they can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with special educational needs or disabilities, and know how to seek advice from those with specialist knowledge, such as the school's SEN Co-ordinator.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.3/2">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to discuss their own development needs in performance management reviews, and to address development priorities. This could include strengthening knowledge and understanding of SEN, including autism. Where schools have identified a need to strengthen knowledge and understanding of SEN or disabilities, as a school priority, this should be addressed through their school improvement and development plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.3/3">All schools receive a School Development Grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. This includes professional development. A wide variety of courses are available covering SEN and disabilities, ranging from awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers and their schools to determine their own particular training and development needs. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.3/4">In 2002, we published jointly with the Department of Health, 'Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD): Good Practice Guidance' which offered a series of pointers to good practice, including a number on in-service training. The guidance advised that</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.3/5" class="indent">&quot;all those who plan or provide for children with ASD should have some knowledge and understanding of autism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.3/6">In October 2007, the Department plans to formally launch its Inclusion Development Programme which will help enhance teacher confidence in key areas of SEN, The programme will focus initially on speech, language and communication needs and dyslexia, since the ability to communicate is fundamental to learning and progression for all children with SEN and disabilities. It is envisaged that it will then address the needs of learners with ASD and BESD, with other types of needs covered over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.3/7">The Department is also working with voluntary sector organisations and others to support the establishment of an Autism Trust, which will aim to improve teachers' specialist skills in working with children with ASD. We will announce further details later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.338W.2/1">Since 2000/01 the Government have taken a number of actions to address the bureaucratic burden on teachers and we continue to work to ensure that teachers' time is spent on key activities that support teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/2">The key to helping schools and teachers on the ground is the new relationship with schools. The Department has built a new relationship with schools aimed at reducing bureaucratic burdens on them while reinforcing school autonomy at the same time as sharpening school accountability. This relationship included the introduction of a new inspection framework which halves the time and effort schools expend on inspection while focusing inspection even more closely on improving teaching and learning. The new relationship is also supporting and simplifying schools' external accountability by the deployment of a nationally accredited School Improvement Partner to every school.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/3">The Government, employers and a majority of school work force unions signed 'Raising Standards and Tackling Workload: a National Agreement' in 2003. This set out a number of changes to teachers' contracts intended to bring downward pressure on working hours and these were implemented between 2003 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/4">The agreement included a provision that teachers could no longer be required routinely to undertake a range of administrative or clerical tasks.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/5">Implementation of the National Agreements' provisions have been overseen by the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group (made up of the Agreement's signatories) and the group continues to work to ensure that teachers and head teachers have conditions of service which enable them to focus on their core roles of teaching and leading and managing teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/6">In 2003 my Department also set up the implementation Review Unit (IRU) comprising representatives from among head teachers, teachers and support staff currently working in schools. Appointed through an open, public appointments process, this was the first ever panel of this type to scrutinise the work of a major Government Department. Working independently of, but in partnership with the Department and its agencies, the IRU both challenge and support the Department on examining policy design and implementation from a burdens and bureaucracy perspective.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/7">We have also rationalised data collections and set up a system to ensure that we collect only essential data from schools, scrutinised by external practitioners through a Star Chamber Board on which head teachers sit. Wherever possible data is collected by sample and data is collected once only and used many times. This has led to a significant decrease in the number of requests for new data from schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/8">The Department takes the views of schools and teachers very seriously. Discussions with head teachers and detailed research showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies. In response to this, we stopped regular paper mailings to all schools; and since December 2004, have successfully introduced an online ordering service where schools are now able to either download or order paper based copies of publications they need. A regular fortnightly e-mail is sent to schools to inform them of new publications.</p>

	<p pid="a.339W.8/1">The highly successful advertising campaigns run by the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) have contributed significantly to increases in graduate recruitment to teaching, and there is evidence that this has had a positive effect on schools' ability to attract high quality teachers. Teacher vacancy rates are, at 0.6 per cent., now considerably lower than rates for other comparable professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.339W.8/2">Over 75 per cent. of new entrants to teacher training are now graduates who take a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) or career changers on employment-based routes such as the Graduate Teacher Programme. More trainee teachers than ever have a degree at 2:1 or higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.339W.8/3">We offer a training bursary of &pound;9,000 to those taking a PGCE in shortage subjects, which currently include maths, science, English, modern foreign languages, technology, music and religious education. A golden hello of &pound;5,000 is also paid for maths and science (&pound;2,500 for the other shortage subjects) when a new teacher has completed their induction in schools. A bursary of &pound;6,000 is offered to trainees taking a primary PGCE or a PGCE in history, geography and physical education.</p>
	<p pid="a.339W.8/4">During the past five years we have been running the Student Associate Scheme which focuses on maths, physics and chemistry and places high quality undergraduates in schools for up to 15 days to provide curriculum support for teachers and to carry out project work with pupils.

	<p pid="a.340W.2/1">No funding was specifically allocated for personalised learning in 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/2">In 2006/07 &pound;500 million was allocated for personalised learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/3">In 2007/08 &pound;990 million was allocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/4">This money was included in schools base budgets, with no conditions of grant, and was not allocated to specific initiatives. Our guidance to schools indicated that our priorities for the funding were: to support intervention and catch-up provision for children who have fallen behind in English and maths; to support the education of gifted and talented learners; and to help learners from deprived backgrounds to access after school and year-round activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/5">The CSR full allocations (for the period 2008-11) for personalised learning will be announced in due course. This will include funding for two areas of work that have already been announced:</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/6" class="indent">&pound;150 million (&pound;50 million in each of the three years of the CSR period) for Assessment for Learning, a key element of personalising learning. This was announced by the Secretary of State in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/7" class="indent">Funding to support 300,000 pupils to receive one-to-one tuition in English and Maths, 30,000 children being supported by the Every Child a Reader programme; and the establishment of the Every Child Counts programme. This was announced in Budget 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/8">Extended schools are also an important part of personalising learning for all children. The Secretary of State announced a subsidy of &pound;265 million for extended schools over the CSR period on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase>. This consists of &pound;8.5 million in 2008-09, &pound;40 million in 2009-10 and &pound;217 million in 2010-11. This extra investment is to help disadvantaged children to access out-of-school activities, which can support their learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.342W.6/1">In England 100 per cent. of Learning and Skills Council funded apprentices must spend a significant period of their learning in a work-based environment in employment in order to complete a full apprenticeship. In addition, some learners participate in programme led apprenticeships (PLAs) in preparation for full apprenticeships. PLAs enable learners to take some of the required apprenticeship qualifications, such as Key Skills, in a FE college or with another provider before taking up employment as an apprentice. In 2005/06, 24,580 learners, 12.3 per cent. of the combined total of 199,480 PLA and apprenticeship starts, started a programme led apprenticeship and 174,900 or 87.7 per cent. started an apprenticeship in employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.342W.6/2">The apprenticeship programme has been extremely successful with the number of apprentices in learning rising threefold since 1997and now standing at some 250,000. Quality has also improved with the completion rate now standing at almost 60 per cent., up from just 24 per cent. five years ago. As a result, the apprenticeship programme is recognised as the principal route for acquiring nationally recognised, high quality occupational skills which contribute to the strength of our economy. We now want to build on that success by expanding the programme further so that in 2013 any suitably qualified young person will be entitled to an apprenticeship place. In addition we have accepted the recommendation of the Leitch Review of Skills for a target of 500,000 apprentices in learning in the UK by 2020.</p>

This applies to everyone in the Department. Every individual is personally responsible for their own behaviour, and every manager is responsible for enforcing the policy in accordance with the guidance and procedures set out in our Staff Handbook.</p>

	<p pid="a.344W.3/1">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocates funding directly to higher education institutions towards the costs of widening participation activities. Since 2003-04 this allocation has included an element for improving retention, which is intended to increase student success. I have arranged for a table to be placed in the House of Commons Library detailing the amounts of funding allocated to each institution for the four years from 2003-04 to 2006-07. There was no specific allocation to institutions for improving retention prior to 2003-04: institutions then, as now, were expected to support student retention activities from within their overall block grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.3/2">Student success within institutions arises from a wide range of factors including teaching quality and student support services. Supporting student success is therefore intrinsically linked with the total investment that institutions make, of which the improving retention element of the widening participation allocation is just one part.</p>
