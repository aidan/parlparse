They recommended that, in the event that a decision was taken to proceed with the project, we should adopt a comprehensive strategy to ensure that adverse impacts are avoided or, where this is not possible, reduced to the absolute minimum.

	<p pid=".792W.2/1">The possible impact of the new antenna on the health of the local Cypriot population has been considered carefully. It has been assessed that levels of electromagnetic emissions from the new system will be no greater than those from the system it will replace and will be well within EU safety limits. Following tests carried out last summer by its own experts and by experts from France, the Ministry of Communications and Works of the Republic announced that exposure of the public to electromagnetic radiation from the existing antenna on the Salt Lake is at least seventy six times smaller than the limit recommended by the European Union and that the installation of the new antenna is not expected to result in a significant increase in the level of emissions in the area. This confirms the results of our own assessments.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.2/2">As a further measure of reassurance the two governments are carrying out a study into the health of the Akrotiri villagers. It is also our intention to set up permanent monitoring equipment in the village to confirm that emissions remain at the very low levels demonstrated in last summer's tests.</p>

The SC, DSAC notes that from the available data there is no definitive or even indicative evidence that there is a higher frequency of thoracic impacts from the L21A1; thoracic impacts will occur occasionally in operational use.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.3/10">4. The SC, DSAC requests that the performance and medical consequences of use of the L21A1 remains under review and that a further review is conducted by <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-31">31 July 2003</phrase>, to consider the period <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-01">1 June 2001</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-31">31 May 2003</phrase>&mdash;the first two years of operational use of the L21A1.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.3/11">5. The SC, DSAC has noted some claims that its medical statement on the L21A1 has shown the projectile to be more dangerous. These claims appear to have arisen from taking elements of the statement out of context. It remains the view of SC, DSAC that the L21A1/L104 weapon system is a safer system than its predecessors, when operated in accordance with agreed guidelines.</p>

	<p pid=".796W.2/1">As I explained in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="">15 October</phrase> to the hon Member, the FCO Green Paper entitled XPrivate Military Companies: Options for Regulation&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-12">12 February 2002</phrase> highlighted the problem of defining a private military company. I noted that in practice, a wide spectrum of people and companies may be involved in the supply of military and security services. The Green Paper also notes that the distinction between combat and non-combat operations is not always clear. Companies may employ only a relatively small core of full-time staff and recruit personnel for individual contracts on a case-by-case basis. United Kingdom nationals could also potentially operate overseas on a freelance basis, but such activity is difficult to monitor. Given these difficulties, it is not possible to provide any meaningful estimates of the number of companies that provide forces for combat or how many United Kingdom nationals are so employed. The absence of any register of companies describing themselves as Private Military Companies further undermines any attempt to produce a meaningful estimate.</p>

In some parts of the country projects are already well advanced. We are organising Xshowcase&quot; demonstration examples to promote their wider take-up, to encourage scheme integration and help put the UK firmly in the lead in this area. My Department is working closely with the Integrated Transport Smart Card Organisation (ITSO) to create common specifications for ticketing systems to ensure smart cards introduced in one area are capable of working with ticket machines in other areas.</p>

Section 13 of the Act allows the Secretary of State to devolve to local authorities some or all of the SIA's licensing functions in respect of door supervisors. After careful consideration of the issues, including the cost implications and practicality of any such devolution, the Government have decided that all aspects of the licensing of door supervisors should be undertaken centrally by the SIA. I advised the Local Government Association of this decision on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase>. The SIA will be discussing with local authorities how best to monitor, at local level, compliance with the licensing regime.</p>

However, under the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the Security Industry Authority has been given powers to regulate all persons in England and Wales who immobilise vehicles in such places, in part because of concerns about the unscrupulous behaviour of some clamping companies. The authority is expected to begin licensing clamping operators with effect from late 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".807W.6/1">The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) does not require signatories to work towards achieving certain objectives or 'goals', nor does it give enforceable rights to individual children. Rather, it imposes obligations on the State to &quot;respect and ensure the rights set forth in the Convention to each child within their jurisdiction&quot;. Each signatory, therefore, is responsible for implementing the UNCRC in their own country.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.6/2">The UK signed the Convention on <phrase class="date" code="1990-04-19">19 April 1990</phrase> and ratified it on <phrase class="date" code="1991-12-16">16 December 1991</phrase>. It came into force in the UK on <phrase class="date" code="1992-01-15">15 January 1992</phrase>. To allow monitoring of implementation, the CRC requires State Parties to report to the UN on their progress against the Convention 2 years after ratification, and every 5 years subsequently.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.6/3">The UK's Second Report under the CRC was submitted by the Department of Health in 1999 and, due to backlogs at the UN, was only considered by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in June this year. A UK delegation comprising senior officials from across Government attended an oral examination in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-19">19 September</phrase>. UK NGOs also submitted a report, and gave oral evidence. The Committee published its concluding observations on 4th October and this document, as well as copies of the UK's Second Report and a summary of the UK NGO reports have been placed in both Libraries.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.6/4">The Government is under no formal obligation from the UN to respond to the report, but lead Departments across Whitehall, together with the Devolved Administrations, are considering how to take the Committee's comments into account. Although there are areas where we expect to take a different view from the Committee over our obligations under the Convention, we will consider its recommendations in developing our overarching strategy for children and young people, a development which the UN Committee welcomed. We will continue to involve the voluntary sector in this work.</p>

We have made clear that prosecutions are an important aspect of deterrence which we would like to see used where there is clear evidence of a serious breach of the rules. We are willing to work with local authorities to produce further guidance if this would be helpful. In addition the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is matching funding with the Food Standards Agency to provide additional training for officers from local authorities, including trading standards officers, on import requirements. One of the key aims of the training will be to raise awareness of the illegal meat trade and give officers advice on which cases should be prosecuted.</p>

These areas will include relevant Natura 2000 sites designated under the Birds and Habitats Directives. In addition, the improved management of the water environment to be delivered through the Water Framework Directive is expected to contribute to the water quality needs of SSSIs not designated under specific Community legislation.

	<p pid=".813W.6/2">River basin management plans will include maps which identify protected areas. Consideration is being given to include on such maps for information purposes all SSSI's, including SSSIs not designated under Community legislation. These maps would then provide a comprehensive summary of water quality related conservation objectives set at both Community and national level.</p>
	<p pid=".813W.6/3">The deadline for meeting the water quality objectives established by the Water Framework Directive is December 2015 at the latest. Since the Government has a target to bring 95 per cent. of SSSIs into favourable condition by 2010, implementation of the Directive will not have a direct bearing on elivering the Government's commitment on SSSIs by 2010. However, in the long term, through its emphasis on a holistic, river basin based approach to water management, using water quality criteria based on ecological parameters, implementation of the Directive will benefit SSSIs</p>

Indicative flood plain maps published by the Environment Agency show areas of known risk, including those where the risk is reduced by defences. However the Environment Agency with Defra support are working on a Flood and Coastal Defence Database for England and Wales and a risk assessment that is developing zoned maps of these floodplain areas that will show the residual levels of risk with the current flood defences. These maps should be available to the public next year. Defra and the agency are also discussing with the Association of British Insurers the provision of such information for planned defences.</p>

The usual procedure would be for an Information to be laid before Magistrates following which a summons would be served on the alleged offender. The police would normally lay an Information, following which the Crown Prosecution Service would take over the conduct of the prosecution from the police.

It must also confirm that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of disease. The meat is also subjected to post mortem veterinary inspection.

	<p pid=".819W.2/1">We set targets in a way which meant all authorities would have to improve their performance over their rate in 1998[en rule]99, no matter what their starting point. For that reason, when tracking local authorities' recycling performance, we consider how much the recycling rate has increased, rather than looking simply at the rate.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.2/2">I have written to the leaders of the local authorities listed about recycling. In these authorities, preliminary (unaudited) performance data for 2001&ndash;02, taken from 2002&ndash;03 Best Value Performance Plans, shows that the authority's recycling performance has decreased, stayed the same or only increased by 1 per cent. between 1998&ndash;99 and 2001&ndash;02. I have invited the relevant leaders to identify work that is already in hand to meet their 2003&ndash;04 Statutory Performance Standard for recycling and composting of household waste and to consider the need for further action where this is relevant.</p>

This compares with approximately 650,000 recorded movements over that period. Most of the apparent infringements are likely to have been minor, such as an incorrect address entered into the movement report. Where however, an apparent infringement is found to be a breach of the movement legislation in force, this is dealt with, in most cases, by means short of prosecution. This can include verbal or written warnings or requiring a farmer to obtain an Individual Movement Licence before moving livestock.</p>

	<p pid=".825W.2/1">The Department has two research projects in progress on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). One is XChronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME: Systematic Review&quot;, at the University of York, which started on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-05">5 January 2000</phrase> and is on-going. Information from this has informed the Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) task force on CFS/ME on evidence-based guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/2">The other is XCognitive Behavioural Therapy in Chronic Fatigue&quot;, at North Bristol NHS Trust, which began in August 2000 and is due to end in late 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/3">The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. Following the publication of the CMO's working group report on CFS/ME, the MRC was asked to develop a broad strategy for advancing biomedical and health services research on CFS/ME. The MRC has appointed an independent scientific advisory group which includes scientists with expertise in such areas as epidemiology, physiology, immunology, infections, clinical trials, paediatric neurology and psychological medicine. The advisory group will draw on the working party report and recent expert views of the field. It will also take into account the concerns of patients and carers and the interests of consumers generally. Details of the advisory group and a note of the first meeting are now available on the MRC website, at <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk">www.mrc.ac.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".827W.5/3">Since 1997 we have launched a number of publicity campaigns and initiatives encouraging people to join the national health service organ donation register (ODR), to carry a donor card, and to discuss their wishes with their relatives. Advertising on television, radio and press at time of launch was supported by public information leaflets which contain donor cards and forms to join the ODR.</p>
	<p pid=".827W.5/4">The organ donation literature line, 0845 60 60 400, and the campaign website (<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/organdonor">www.nhs.uk/organdonor</a>) complements and supports this activity as do very successful partnerships with the voluntary sector, the general practitioner surgery network, Boots, Goldfish and other banks, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, the Passport Agency and GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
	<p pid=".827W.5/5">In addition, United Kingdom Transplant's 2002 initiative with local authorities, encouraged people to join the ODR when they enrol on the electoral register.</p>
	<p pid=".827W.5/6">The Department also runs two separate campaigns specifically targeting Asians and African Caribbeans as people from these communities are more likely to suffer from conditions that lead to kidney failure, resulting in a need for a transplant.</p>

	<p pid=".833W.2/2">There is a world-wide shortage of organs for transplantation. There are a number of reasons for this not least that there is a welcome reduction in the numbers of people dying in circumstances in which organ donation would have been possible, for example, the decreasing number of fatal road accidents and improvements in neurological surgery.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.2/3">We are taking specific action to increase the number of donors available by investing in initiatives to raise public awareness and the benefits of organ transplantation, particularly in the ethnic minority populations where there may be a greater need for transplantation, implementing measures to help ensure that potential donors are identified and that we increase the use of both living and non-heartbeating donation. Nearly #4 million is being invested in the national health service through United Kingdom transplant to boost the number of life-saving organ transplants. This is funding 35 donor liaison schemes to improve procedures for identifying possible organ donors and the steps to take so that relatives are approached and given the opportunity to decide about donation. It is also supporting 25 living donation programmes, 10 additional transplant co-ordinators and six non-heartbeating donor programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".835W.6/1">The Department has received informal representations from the Royal College of Radiologists and others about the introduction of radiotherapy waiting times monitoring. The NHS Cancer Plan set out maximum waiting time targets for first cancer treatment, which will come into effect over the next few years. Arrangements to monitor these targets are currently being put in place and will cover radiotherapy where this is the first treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.6/2">Individual radiotherapy services are expected to audit their waiting times for radiotherapy as part of the national standards for cancer. This is monitored locally through the peer review appraisal process. We do not collect data centrally on these waits. Radiotherapy waiting times data will be available when clinical audit datasets are implemented.</p>

	<p pid=".836W.2/1">The competition commission appeal tribunal's (CCAT) judgment in the Bettercare case stated that the Competition Act 1998 applied in the particular circumstances that were presented. One implication of this is that potentially local councils' commissioning of care services could be subject to the Competition Act, but each case would need to be considered in the context of its facts. The judgment did not comment on whether the particular health and social care board involved in the case or other councils are presently contravening the Act. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) will now reconsider the issue of the alleged anti-competitive conduct of the board involved in the case. Beyond this, no general assessment of the implications of this ruling can be made. I understand that in deciding not to appeal the judgment the OFT had in mind that the European Court is currently considering a similar case (case T-319/99 FENIN <i>v.</i> European Commission). The outcome of this case is expected before the spring of 2003. This may assist in clarifying further whether the Act applies to the commissioning functions of public bodies.</p>

	<p pid=".838W.3/1">I made it clear when I announced the abolition of the employment concession earlier this year that this reflected the increasing timeliness of the asylum decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.3/2">The concession was established when widespread delays occurred in the asylum system, and we have always made clear that we would review its operation in light of our ongoing reforms to the asylum system. By the time I announced its abolition in July, it had become largely irrelevant and applicable to only a minority of applicants.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.3/3">The vast majority (around 80 per cent. of asylum seekers) currently receive an initial decision within six months and we are committed, with our programme of increased resources and ongoing legislative reforms, to further improving the speed of the system for new applicants.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.3/4">We also believe that while we continued to operate the concession, an incorrect perception existed that all asylum seekers had permission to work while their cases were considered. This was not the case, and this decision underlines our determination to maintain a robust asylum process which helps those fleeing persecution and not those seeking work in the UK. Those who seek to enter the UK for the purpose of work have a range of schemes open to them, and we continue to open up more routes to allow people to come here and work on a legal basis in ways which boost our economy.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.3/5">Those asylum seekers who had already obtained permission to work prior to <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-23">23 July 2002</phrase> will retain that right until such time as a final decision is made on their claim, while those who had sought permission to work but have not had a response prior to July 23 will have had their requests considered in line with the concession. We have also retained a discretion to grant permission to work in exceptional cases.</p>

	<p pid=".843W.3/1">The national firearms certificate holders register is being developed on the police national computer (PNC) by the police information technology organisation (PITO) using its own internal resources. An integral part of the project is to provide a link between the local systems used by forces and the national database on the PNC. The procurement exercise to engage contract support to develop and implement the necessary interfaces failed to provide a satisfactory solution. PITO estimate that the manpower costs associated with this part of the project totalled some #21,000. I understand that PITO have recently issued a non-binding expression of interest for a re-tender to provide a single firearms licensing management system and to build the interface to the PNC. It is unlikely that the register will now be operational before summer 2004 and work is already being developed to achieve that aim.</p>

This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year, but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries. The report did not attempt to estimate the number of people who were trafficked a second time, having previously been removed.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.6/2">Information is not collected in the form requested. Courts are required to notify court results (in conviction and other cases) to police forces within three working days of completion of the case. Under performance standards set by the Association of Chief Police Officers, police forces are required to input court results (in conviction and other cases) onto the Police National Computer within 72 hours of the receipt of information from the court about the case disposal. We are determined that such key information should be recorded on the Police National Computer in a timely fashion- We therefore commissioned Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to manage and monitor a 12-month programme of work for every force to improve the timeliness of the inputting of key data. As regards court results, the primary purpose was to clear backlog of outstanding cases. The Inspectorate's first report showed considerable progress. Its second report, on the programme overall, which indicates substantial further progress, is under consideration.</p>

	<p pid=".847W.8/2">All revenue from speeding offences is normally paid to Her Majesty's Treasury. Under a scheme currently being rolled out nationally, however, fixed penalty fine revenue from enforcement by the use of speed and red-light traffic cameras can be re-invested to meet the costs of such enforcement. Deployment of cameras so funded is subject to strict conditions, including that sites must have a history of speed related casualties and that the cameras must be clearly visible and conspicuous, in order to deter speeding. Money left over goes, as before, to Her Majesty's Treasury.</p>

	<p pid=".855W.3/1">I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Norman Baker, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-30">30 October 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".855W.3/3" class="indent">XI have been asked by David Jamieson to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question in respect of the Beddingham Level Crossing on the A27 and plans for public consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.3/4" class="indent">Because of the urgent need to improve safety for both road and rail users at the level crossing, the Highways Agency is consulting on proposals to provide a bridge over the crossing. This was announced in the recent Press Notice (HA483/02) giving details of the Government's rolling programme for dealing with congestion and safety at junctions on the trunk road. The proposals being developed take into account the recommendations from the South Coast Multi Modal Study (SOCOMMS).</p>
	<p pid=".855W.3/5" class="indent">The safety issues with the level crossing are long standing and are likely to increase in future due to possible increases in train services along the south coast line. Traffic management measures have been installed with some beneficial effect but the Agency, Railtrack and the Health and Safety Executive (HOUSE) do not see these as the solution. The HSE (Railway Inspectorate) consider that whilst the number of incidents has reduced the crossing is a high risk site and the highest in the south east. Without grade separation soon the Executive will instruct Railtrack to install full barriers at the crossing instead of the existing half barriers. Should this happen the lost time to road traffic will rise to approximately 20&ndash;24 minutes in any hour. This would have a dramatic effect on road capacity and result in a significant increase in the delays that already occur and the amount of queuing currently experienced during peak periods along the A27 in both directions. This in turn would lead to greater pressure on parallel routes as traffic sought to avoid the delays.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.3/6" class="indent">We are arranging a public exhibition for the first week in December, with a Preview exhibition for Councillors, and other elected representatives on the 5th December. A newsletter will be issued to local residents shortly, explaining our proposals and inviting them to an exhibition. We will write to you again nearer December with a formal invitation to the Preview and exhibition.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.3/7" class="indent">If you would like any further details Phil Barnett (Project Manager on 01306&ndash;878481) or Paul Arnold (Team Leader on 01306 878475) in our Dorking office would be pleased to help you.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".856W.2/3" class="indent">XI have been asked by David Jamieson to reply to your recent parliamentary question about safety on the A59 trunk road at the Pendle Road/Sabden Road staggered junction in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.2/4" class="indent">The Highways Agency has been monitoring accidents at the junction following the improvements that were undertaken in 1999. The analysis of this accident data indicates a common factor in all of the accidents, namely, collisions between vehicles emerging from the side roads and traffic travelling through the junction on the A59. A number of options have been identified to address this type of accident, and a detailed traffic count and analysis of turning movements is currently under way.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.2/5" class="indent">We are in discussion with the Lancashire Police and plan to meet with them again early next month to agree a strategy for implementing any changes. Our provisional view is that the most appropriate solution would be to make modifications to the existing junction. Our preferred options involve introducing right turn bans, to limit the risk of conflicts occurring, and measures to narrow the A59 carriageway through the junction to restrict opportunities for overtaking and to reduce speed.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.2/6" class="indent">As you may be aware, the A59 is one of a number of routes identified for transfer to local highway authorities in the 1998 White Paper, XA New Deal for Trunk Roads&quot;. Under this process, known as detrunking, we are working to a programme for transferring responsibility for the A59 to Lancashire County Council in the spring of next year. This process allows for a fair and equitable transfer of funds to local highway authorities that the Agency would have spent on these roads, including finance for possible schemes such as this.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.2/7" class="indent">Depending on the extent of the changes that are adopted to this junction, it may be possible for the Agency to undertake the work within funding allocated for this financial year. Should this not be the case, then it will be for Lancashire County Council as the new highway authority to decide on the improvements they wish to take forward from the funds that they are allocated.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.2/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information about this matter, please contact the Agency's Route Manager for the A59, Trevor Hunt, Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BE (Tel 0161 930 5691).&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".856W.5/2">In May this year, as part of the process of continuing review, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I appointed Sir John Wheeler to conduct an independent examination of airport security. The terms of reference for this work, set out in full in the report Sir John submitted to us on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-13">13 September</phrase>, included a focus on the threat from serious and organised crime at UK airports and the role of the Police Service.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.5/3">The Government are grateful to Sir John for the care with which he analysed the issues, and we have considered carefully his findings and recommendations. These, together with his introduction to the report, are today being placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The main body of the document contains information about operational security matters, and for that reason it would not be appropriate to publish the report in its entirety.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.5/4">The Report endorses the National Aviation Security Programme and the commitment of those working to deliver its objectives. It also makes some valuable recommendations around the need to strengthen strategic direction, to undertake a detailed multi-agency assessment of the potential threats from serious and organised crime, and to overhaul the arrangements by which airports may be 'designated' for policing by uniformed officers. The Government are happy to accept in principle all of Sir John's recommendations. My Department and the Home Office are working closely together on implementation, which will bring in the police and other control agencies and the airport industry.</p>

The SRA are continuing to discuss these issues with the passenger and freight operating companies and with Network Rail.

	<p pid=".861W.2/1">The proposed engineering programme set out in the SRA's West Coast Strategy has been designed to minimise the impact on all passengers and in particular to reduce the need for weekend and Bank Holiday possessions. For much of the time that works are taking place, trains will continue to operate between London and the north west without interruption. The alternative to total closure of certain sections of the route for limited periods would be considerably more weekend possessions, with an adverse effect on the leisure and tourist industry. However, if the industry has specific concerns about these proposals they should respond accordingly to the SRA's consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".861W.9/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician. I have asked him to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.9/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Mr. Gordon Prentice, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-30">30 October 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".861W.9/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking what assessment has been made of the accuracy of the 2001 Census. (77401)</p>
	<p pid=".861W.9/4" class="indent">Census 2001 results are the first to represent the entire population. This was achieved through a new strategy known as the 'One Number Census'. One of the key elements was an independent follow-up survey. The Census Coverage Survey (CCS), as it is known, involved an intensive face-to-face survey of a sample of over 16,000 postcodes containing 320,000 households covering every local authority in England and Wales. By combining the results of the Census and the CCS, it was possible in 2001 to estimate the total resident population-the 'one number'-to a high level of precision, plus or minus 0.2 per cent., and to provide information on the characteristics of those persons missed by the Census.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.9/5" class="indent">Thus in 2001, the Census results represent 100 per cent. of the population. Census response, that is the proportion of people returning a form in England and Wales, was 94 per cent. The 6% of people estimated to have been missed by the Census have been added to the counts using a statistical process that was subject to extensive consultation, and based on the results of the CCS.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.9/6" class="indent">I am confident that the approach we have taken to the 2001 Census provides the most accurate estimates of the population both nationally and for each of the 376 local authorities in England and Wales. No census ever gets responses from 100 per cent. of the population. The 2001 Census was designed from the outset to take full account of this to provide what users of statistics really want&mdash;figures representing everyone.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.9/7" class="indent">In addition, the 2001 Census has undergone rigorous testing and quality checking throughout both the fieldwork and processing. Census tests were carried out in 1997 and 1999 and a survey designed to measure the accuracy of response to each question has been completed. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of verification and validation checks were built in to the processing of the data, and data quality played a key role in all aspects of processing the forms. All information on accuracy will be contained in a Census Quality report to be published in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.9/8" class="indent">Information published so far about the accuracy of the Census is available on the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">www.statistics.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".863W.3/1">Estimates of the yield from the introduction of service company legislation to counter avoidance in the provision of personal services were published in Appendix A2 of the March 2000 Financial Statement and Budget Report.It was estimated that 90,000 companies were potentially affected at the time of the introduction of the new rules to tackle avoidance, and that around half would continue to operate subject to additional income tax and National Insurance contributions on deemed payments when required. The Inland Revenue continues to monitor the situation and to ensure that everyone pays the right tax and NICs.</p>

	<p pid=".872W.6/1">Emergency cover in Essex, as with the rest of the country, will consist of a number of elements including Green Goddess crews, breathing apparatus teams, rescue teams equipped with specialist equipment and the police. The provision of MOD emergency fire cover has been planned in consultation with the Chief Fire Officer to maximise call-out response times and the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.6/2">Personnel have been trained and equipped to provide basic emergency fire and rescue cover. The level of training is dependent on the skills already held by personnel and the role that they would perform in the event of a strike. Drivers and basic crew only require a short training package because of the simple nature of the equipment and because of the basic level of cover given. Fire Rescue Teams fulfil a more difficult role, which utilises technical equipment in dangerous situation. Some Fire Rescue Teams are already trained and experienced in the use of breathing apparatus and other specialist equipment but additional personnel have also been trained in these techniques. Other support training as well as driver training includes first aid training and specialist equipment maintenance training. Basic training lasts up to five weeks, depending on skill levels and role, plus any other necessary follow on training.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.6/3">The command and operational structure for emergency fire cover has been designed to enable maximum flexibility and use of available resources, whether from within a county or from assets deployed nearby in neighbouring counties. The fire crews will use a number of temporary stations across the country but the deployment of fire fighters will be based on the assessment of how best to respond to an emergency in the quickest time possible.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.6/4">Retained Firefighters provide a very valuable service to their communities. We anticipate that in the event of industrial action, many retained firefighters will continue to protect the communities in which they live and work.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.6/5">The MOD's emergency cover will not replicate the fire fighting capabilities of the Fire Service, but will minimise, as far as possible, the danger to human life. Service personnel will provide basic fire and rescue cover. Huw</p>

	<p pid=".873W.2/1">The Local Government Act 2000 placed a duty on local authorities to prepare community strategies for promoting the economic, social and environmental well being of their communities and contributing to sustainable development in the UK. Our guidance does not stipulate a timetable for the preparation of community strategies but we have introduced a statutory Best Value Performance Indicator to report on the progress of each authority.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/2">The Local Government White Paper <i>Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services</i> introduced a national framework for assessing the performance of authorities which shifts the focus to the delivery of outcomes. The cornerstone of this framework is the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) which will provide local people with clear and concise information about their council's performance. The Government is also committed to giving local authorities greater freedom to deliver by removing unnecessary bureaucracy. In addition to the action taken for all authorities, CPA will be used as the basis for offering extra freedoms to the best performers. We expect that such authorities will use these freedoms to deliver sustainable improvements to the quality of life of their communities. We intend to announce the details shortly.</p>
