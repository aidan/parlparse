	<p pid=".1W.6/1">CPS Casework Directorate does not record separately whether a corruption case received by it involves an overseas element. It is not therefore possible to provide accurate figures.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/2">However, in order to assist, the CPS has considered what information is available and indicates that it is likely that in the period November 1997 and February 2002, around 240 cases were referred to Casework Directorate, which involved or may have involved allegations of corruption. Similarly from February 2002 to the present, Casework Directorate has recorded a total of about 80 cases which involved, or may have involved, allegations of corruption either within England and Wales or overseas. In order to ascertain which of these cases specifically involved overseas corruption, each individual case file would need to be examined which would incur disproportionate cost and in any case may not provide a definitive answer.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/3">Casework Directorate is however able to say, having asked its staff, that they are currently advising the police in five cases, which involve allegations of overseas corruption. All the cases are still being investigated and no charges have yet been brought.</p>

	<p pid=".2W.3/2">The 6 per cent. discount rate used for the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) 2002&ndash;05 was the standard rate used by Government at that time. The rate was reduced to 3.5 per cent. in January 2003 to reflect prevailing circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.3/3">Changing only the discount rate from 6 per cent. to 3.5 per cent., the fuel standardised lifetime-discounted savings from the Energy Efficiency Commitment 2002&ndash;05 would change from 62 terawatt hours (TWh) to 81 TWh.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.3/4">However, some of the assumptions underlying average energy savings from specific energy efficiency measures have also changed, in addition to the change in the discount rate, as explained in the consultation document for the next phase of the EEC. If the illustrative mix of measures under EEC 2002&ndash;05 were subjected to the same set of assumptions which are now being applied to the second phase of EEC (2005&ndash;08) the TWh figure would fall from 81 to 66. The target level proposed for EEC 2005&ndash;08 as part of the consultation process is subject to continuing analysis and will be finalised in the relevant Statutory Order following the public consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".8W.8/1">We have no current plans to use the powers in the Licensing Act 2003 to license the showing of live broadcast sporting events on large screens in licensed premises. Under the 2003 Act, all public houses and bars showing live sporting events on television will require premises licences because they sell alcohol and, as a result, will be required to take steps to ensure the promotion of the licensing objectives in relation to the premises. These objectives are the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm. If they fail to do so, they could face a review of the licence. Furthermore, it will be an offence under the 2003 Act to allow disorderly conduct on the premises and knowingly to sell, attempt to sell, or to allow alcohol to be sold to people who are already drunk. Finally, the police have powers (in certain circumstances) under the 2003 Act to close down instantly for up to 24 hours any relevant premises where a senior officer believes there is, or is likely to be, disorder on or in the vicinity of the premises, or alternatively where a public nuisance is being caused as a result of noise emanating from the premises.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.2/1">In December 2001, the Government introduced free admission to the permanent collections of DCMS-sponsored museums and galleries in England that had previously charged for admission. This has seen a 72 per cent. increase in visits to those museums and galleries. In October 2002, DCMS announced that it would allocate &pound;70 million over four years to support local authority and other regional museums through the Renaissance in the Regions programme, which aims to improve access.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.2/2">As well as overseeing the Renaissance programme, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, funded by DCMS, is delivering initiatives aimed at improving physical and virtual access, including the museum registration scheme, which sets minimum accessibility standards; good practice guides covering social inclusion, cultural diversity and access for people with disabilities; and funding for the UK's national virtual museum, the 24 Hour Museum. DCMS and DfES have jointly funded a programme of national/regional museum partnerships across England, which supports the education of school age children. The programme also helps to strengthen communities through involving them with collections and their curators. The joint DCMS/Wolfson Foundation Fund provides capital funding to enable eligible museums and galleries to improve physical access to their collections.</p>

The Parliamentary Communications Directorate (PCD) plans to make web-based access to a Members' e-mail and on-line diary available before the Houses rises for the summer recess. With this new service, access will be possible from any computer with an Internet connection, such as computers provided in conference or hotel business centres, airport departure lounges, and Internet cafes. The software used will ensure that no trace of the Member's activity is left on the computer and that it is not possible for anyone to decipher a Member's password details.</p>

It has already delivered modern voice communications to over 50,000 police users and provided them with high quality and secure digital communications and improved capacity and coverage. Some of the functionality will only be available when the national network has been fully rolled out and software upgrades have been implemented.</p>

	<p pid=".19W.2/3">All homes, whether empty or occupied are under constant review. Generally homes which become vacant are not re-let, but sold on the open market. Consideration is being given to the reproduction and extension of a scheme under which eligible occupiers are able to buy their homes. However, due to recruitment and retention problems in London and the South East, accommodation in these areas is being retained and in some cases converted for multiple occupation. These properties are re-let on a short-term basis, which will not normally exceed multiples of six months.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.5/17">The marked increases in travel costs since 2001 can be largely attributed to changes in strategy within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate where increased staff numbers and the need to travel as a result of new policy initiatives and targets for improved IND performance. Other contributing factors have been related to providing advice to the organisers of the 2002 Football World Cup in Japan and Euro 2004 in Portugal and the creation of new units to support the police reform agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.2/1">Given the nature of the problem it is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many false passports (or other travel documents in lieu of passports) of British or foreign origin are in circulation either in the UK or globally. The fraudulent use of travel documentation (including forged or counterfeit visas) is a serious global problem. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate's National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU) has the lead role in monitoring and combating this. The NDFU is recognised both at home and abroad as a leader in this field and works closely with its counterparts in other countries to counter this type of fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.2/2">The NDFU has a comprehensive brief of conducting expert forensic level examinations of suspect documents, in delivering training programmes for the Immigration Service and other agencies in document fraud detection and in collation and dissemination of information about suspect documents and types of document abuse. Of the 7,985 abused travel documents of all nationalities detected at UK arrival controls in 2003, forged or altered documents represented 52 per cent. of the total. Completely counterfeit documents amounted to 15 per cent. whereas 27 per cent. of the total were in the hands of impostors. 724 abused documents were encountered in-country by immigration enforcement officers and a further 837 forged, counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents were submitted to the Home Office with requests for leave to remain.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.2/3">The problem of identity fraud within the United Kingdom involving documents from all countries is one which affects not just the Home Office. For example, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency referred 1,071 suspect travel documents to the NDFU during 2003 of which 74 per cent. were found to be false or to contain false endorsements. Local offices of the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) referred 1,410 documents to that department's National Identity Fraud Unit of which 541 were found to be false. DWP referred 114 documents to the National Document Fraud Unit for an expert opinion. During the year 33,551 passengers were denied boarding by airlines (often after reference to members of the UK Airline Liaison Officer network). Many of these decisions were because the passengers held suspect documentation.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.2/4">The NDFU makes a significant contribution to work being carried out internationally in the EU, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and G8 to disrupt the work of forgers by enhancement of international security safeguards and standards, including those for biometrics, for travel documents and their issuing processes. It also works closely with travel document issuing agencies in order to combat identity fraud and facilitate the operation of border controls.</p>

	<p pid=".25W.8/24">Population pressures and the increase in the number of violent offenders have an impact on the levels of violence in prison.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.8/25">Although serious assaults were adopted as a new Key Performance Indicator for 2003&ndash;04, the data was collected in previous years as additional information. The data given relating to the two previous years is thus consistent.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.8/26">Reducing violence, in all its forms, is fundamental to the Prison Service objectives and to the resettlement and rehabilitation agenda. In May 2004, the Prison Service's Violence Reduction Strategy was launched. It is now mandatory for public prisons to develop, implement (by November 2004) and maintain a local violence reduction strategy, which will aim to promote a safe and healthy prison environment and foster a culture of non-violence.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.8/27">While not applying directly to contracted prisons, the Violence Reduction Strategy is used as a basis of best practice which has enabled them to develop their own strategies to reduce serious assaults. Compliance with Health and Safety legislation is a requirement.</p>

	<p pid=".29W.5/3">Subutex (buprenorphine) is included in the treatment protocols developed in conjunction with the National Health Service at eight establishments for men. Every establishment for women has the capacity to prescribe subutex but few do so at present because methadone is considered to meet most prisoners' needs. Subutex would, however, be made available to any woman already being prescribed it when received into custody.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.2/1">The UK has some of the most developed and sophisticated anti-terrorism legislation in the world. The Terrorism Act 2000 re-enacted and made permanent powers which had developed over many years to deal with these threats and also established a framework to deal with international terrorism. Following the terrorist attacks on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act has toughened counter-terrorism legislation by giving the police more powers to support their work in the fight against terrorism, proscribed new terrorist organisations and frozen their assets. We have strengthened our immigration provisions to ensure that those who present a security risk cannot hide behind refugee protections and we have tightened port, airport and border security.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.2/2">As I outlined in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-02-25.41WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 41WS</phrase>, we have also reassessed and strengthened our contingency plans to ensure that the UK is in the best position to respond, react and recover from any single or multiple terrorist incident, including incidents involving the use of chemical, biological or radiological materials. Our new Civil Contingencies Bill will further improve the UK's ability to deal with the consequences of a major disruptive incident by setting out clear responsibilities to ensure that front line responders can deal with a range of emergencies.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.2/3">We have also substantially increased funding to the Security Service to boost their capacity to collect, analyse and act on information and intelligence. The number of Security Service staff will increase by 50 per cent. over the next few years and an additional &pound;15 million has been allocated to police special branches in order to increase their surveillance and intelligence gathering capabilities.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.5/1">As the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for International Development, I regularly receive representations about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and developing countries. Some representations, in the form of letters from the public, letters from non-government organisations or letters from Members of Parliament on behalf of constituents, discuss the role of GMOs in eliminating world hunger. GM technology will not in itself solve the problem of world hunger. But when managed responsibly, used safely and effectively, and applied to the crops important for poor people, it can be used to promote development and reduce poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/2">The UK Government supports the implementation of international legislation to rigorously assess and manage the risks involved in the use of GMOs and GM technology. The Department for International Development (DFID) has worked with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and other Government Departments to achieve a successful conclusion to negotiations to the Biosafety Protocol. This will help both developed and developing countries make informed decisions on the transboundary movement (including import and export) of GMOs. With its strong precautionary approach, the Protocol will help to ensure that developing countries are not disadvantaged by the development of GM technologies. 23 African Governments receiving UK development aid have signed the Protocol. The top three African bilateral aid recipients in 2002&ndash;03 were Uganda (&pound;55 million), Malawi (&pound;52 million) and Kenya (&pound;45 million). These countries signed the Protocol in May 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/3">DFID's approach to food aid is guided by the following principles:</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/4" class="indent">Recipient Governments should be given adequate information on the type of food they receive and its characteristics, including whether genetically modified;</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/5" class="indent">Recipient Governments should be allowed to decide on its acceptability; and</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/6" class="indent">Donors should accept the decisions of recipients and accommodate them as far as possible. For example, if milled cereals are preferred to whole grain (to avoid the risk of GM grain being used as seed), then this should be arranged for.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/7">The issue of GM technology arises regularly in discussions on food, agriculture and trade in Africa, to which DFID is party. Some Governments, such as Zambia and Angola, are opposed to GMOs. Others, such as South Africa and Uganda, have approved GM crops for planting and consumption. The New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) and Africa Union have both issued statements supporting the use of GM technology to promote agriculture and reduce hunger.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/8">In 2002, DFID's offices in Malawi and Zambia were involved in discussions with the World Food Programme and the respective Governments about the acceptance of food aid containing genetically modified material. In Malawi, the Government proposed that GM maize be milled before distribution. DFID and other donors discussed how to do this with minimum delay in distribution. In Zimbabwe DFID officials supported the World Food Programme in negotiations with the Government over the acceptance of such food aid but had no direct contact with the Government. The former Secretary of State for International Development, Clare Short, spoke and wrote to President Mwanawasa of Zambia on this issue, and DFID hosted a fact finding visit for Zambian scientists to the UK on 23 and <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-24">24 September 2002</phrase> to meet representatives from Government, the private sector and civil society. The Zambian scientists recommended to the Zambian Government that it should reject GM food aid and the planting of GM crops in Zambia.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/9">In Zambia, DFID has had representations from a number of non-government organisations operating there. They have expressed a range of views about (i) GM food aid, and (ii) the wider issue of GM crops. The main organisations were the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection (JCTR), CARE and CAFOD. JCTR published a report on (ii). The remaining representations were informal and concerned humanitarian supplies, but did not take a public position on either (i) or (ii) in Zambia. All representations upheld the key principle that Governments and their people should be supported to make informed decisions on both issues. This principle continues to inform the approach of DFID. The UK Government has received no representations on GM food aid or GM crops from the World Food Programme (WFP) nor the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/10">The World Food Programme does not conduct GM-related initiatives. The World Food Programme does, however, receive significant in-kind contributions of food aid containing GM materials. It maintains a neutral position on the matter of GM food donations, and strictly respects the decision of potential recipient Governments whether or not to receive food that may contain GM materials. It is not possible to obtain precise data on the extent to which in-kind donations to the World Food Programme are GM. In part this is because testing for GM content is not called for under any existing Codex Alimentarius or other international agreement, nor is there any agreement on the GM content below which a shipment may be classified as GM-free. UK cash contributions to the World Food Programme operations have inevitably supported the delivery of GM foods to willing recipient Governments, but it is not possible to identify to what extent.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/11">The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) uses the resources made available through its Regular Budget, which include the financial contribution from the UK and the rich technical expertise and experience of UK nationals in scientific and technical advancements and related institutional and policy issues, to promote sustainable agriculture for eliminating hunger and poverty. In relation to GMOs, its initiatives are directed at collecting, analysing and disseminating information. Examples include the ecological and human health effects of GM crops and GM food; providing a neutral forum through which its member countries can agree international standards (for example, the Codex Alimentarius Commission adopted principles of risk analysis and guidelines for food safety assessment of GM food in 2003, and the International Plant Protection Convention recently adopted guidelines for determining if a living modified organism poses a hazard to plants); and, on request, and technical capacities for GMO detection, biosafety and risk assessment. The Food and Agriculture Organisation does not provide financial assistance to countries for the development of GMOs.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.5/1">DFID has developed and is using a new objective, evidence based system for assessing and monitoring the effectiveness of multilateral institutions. The approach focuses on the organisational systems that enable multilaterals to achieve results on the ground in poor countries. This includes an assessment of whether multilateral agencies have internal systems to ensure that their own financing and allocation systems are driven by results and achieving the millennium development goals. DFID is applying the system to 26 multilateral organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.8/1">For 2002&ndash;03, the latest figures available, the revenue raised from fixed penalties resulting from safety camera enforcement amounted to &pound;5,672,200 of which &pound;5,150,286 was returned to the partnership to fund its camera activity while &pound;521,934 was passed to the Treasury. The rules of the Government Safety Camera Cost Recovery Programme provide that the resources from speeding and jumping traffic lights are ring-fenced and can be applied solely to costs associated with the operation of safety cameras. Other investment in road safety measures is funded within local authorities' and national road programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.9/1">The issue of making publications available in formats that are accessible to blind and partially sighted people has been under discussion by publishers and the RNIB for several years. The DTI is now facilitating these discussions and hosted a meeting in April between publishers, authors, RNIB and the National Library of the Blind to discuss the provision of accessible formats for the visually impaired.

Commencement of the Act was on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October 2003</phrase>. The Act effectively reduces the previous delays in organisations gaining copyright clearances to produce books and other printed matter in formats that are accessible to visually impaired people.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.9/3">DTI officials will continue to promote dialogue between trade associations, publishers, the RNIB and the National Library of the Blind to facilitate the implementation of the Act and create a forum in which issues such as opportunities for the commercial production of material in accessible formats can be discussed.</p>

ECGD has been informed through a WorleyParsons desktop study report that the percentage of unburied coated joints that experienced cracking in the field joint coating was as follows: <i>(a)</i> 2.6 per cent. in Azerbaijan, and <i>(b)</i> 26 per cent. in Georgia.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.5/2">No pipes were buried with defective joint coatings.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.5/3">I am told that ECGD first became aware of the cracking in the field joint coating in February 2004. BP/BTC had not informed ECGD before the allegations appeared in the Sunday Times article of <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-15">15 February 2004</phrase>. ECGD was not aware of the cracking in the field joint coating prior to the decision to provide support on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan project, but were aware prior to the initial disbursement of funds. The lenders, including ECGD, considered this very carefully before the first disbursement was made. ECGD awaits the results of a site visit by Worley Parsons, but has been assured by BP that the rectification costs will be considerably lower than the US$500 million alleged in the Sunday Times article.</p>

Overall 462 responses were received. Of these, 416 were from individuals and 46 from representative groups or bodies. Most respondents (86 per cent.) were opposed to the introduction of civil partnership in Northern Ireland. Most organisations (60 per cent.), however, including the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission were supportive of the proposal. Of those who opposed civil partnership, marriage issues featured as a significant reasons for objection (87 per cent.). There was an equal division in those who felt that civil partnership was in effect 'gay marriage' and those who were concerned that it would undermine marriage. A considerable proportion of those who mentioned marriage cited traditional Christian beliefs and values and referred, in particular, to the sanctity of marriage. Many of those in opposition mentioned religious issues as a basis for objection (69 per cent.), with children's issues a prime concern for others (56 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid=".56W.3/1">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure regularly stocks Loughbrickland Lake with brown and rainbow trout with the aim of sustaining the standing stock of takeable size fish at levels whereby anglers have a reasonable chance of catching a fish. There is very limited scope to improve stock levels by natural production.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.3/2">Loughbrickland Lake is similar to many still water bodies in Northern Ireland where fishing quality has suffered due to water quality degradation. Excessive weed growth is a particular problem on this lake. The Department has constructed a slipway to enable its weed cutting machine to be used on the lake and the channel has been deepened to allow its use when water levels fall.</p>

	<p pid=".56W.6/1">The Museum of Sea and Sky formed part of the first Development Plan of the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI). The proposal has since evolved into the more comprehensive museum development MAGNI @ Titanic Quarter. The MAGNI Development Plan is currently under discussion with a number of stakeholders, including the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB)'s recently published Strategic Framework for Action listed Titanic (Maritime) Belfast as one of its five signature projects and with Belfast city council (BCC) is now working jointly on this development. BCC have established a Titanic Forum comprising all the main stakeholders and the forum will take forward future research and interest for Titanic reflected tourism infrastructure. NITB and BCC have commissioned consultants to examine the potential for developing the Titanic concept including the potential for a museum development. MAGNI will consider the outcome of this alongside the potential funding implications.</p>

The Museums and Galleries for NI (MAGNI) are in discussions with the Ulster Aviation Society about the current position.</p>

For the financial year 2004&ndash;05, the Marriage and Relationship Support (MARS) grant programme provided &pound;4.9 million to a wide variety of voluntary sector organisations providing marriage and relationship support. The MARS grant funds activities aimed at helping people establish, maintain and develop successful relationships with their partners. This includes encouraging people to resolve relationship difficulties in the interests of their children.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/2">Sure Start local programmes and Children's Centres through the range of family support and counselling services they provide often also provide opportunities for couples to discuss relationship issues. Similarly, a Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) officer might be involved at court directions hearings in providing assistance to children and their families to help them reach agreement on arrangements for their children, primarily in respect of contact and residence.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.8/1">My Department has embarked on an ambitious programme of reform in the provision of children's services. We want professionals to work together to improve local delivery, while ensuring that children receive high quality of care and education.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.8/2">The Green Paper, &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; sets out our commitment to achieving more coherent and effective children's services, reducing the amount of regulation where possible. The strategy therefore aims to encourage integrated planning, commissioning and delivery of children's services, with easier access to specialist services and duplication minimised through the development of a Common Assessment Framework and the use of lead professionals to bring together packages of support from multi-disciplinary teams to meet the needs of children, young people and their families.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.8/3">As part of these wider reforms, my Department has introduced the Children Bill into the House of Lords in March of this year. Regulation is being kept to the minimum necessary to achieve a robust integrated framework of services with clear lines of accountability, inspection and intervention. But we do still intend to regulate where this is needed to sharpen arrangements to safeguard children, eg in the establishment of statutory Local Safeguarding Children Boards to replace the current non-statutory Area Child Protection Committees.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.8/4">The provisions are intended to strengthen local flexibility to meet local needs. So for example, a new power for local services to pool budgets will enable more flexible pooling of funds between local partners and make it easier for agencies to work together in the commissioning and delivery of services. The Bill also pursues the streamlining of statutory planning requirements by removing the requirement for a plan to cover services for children in need. We have committed in debate to moving towards a single plan for children's services and our intention is to lift most statutory education planning requirements at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.8/5">My Department is committed to reducing bureaucracy&mdash;and is working jointly with the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit to identify unnecessary bureaucracy to promote more efficient, streamlined processes. This work necessarily includes a consideration of the regulatory framework within which children's services are delivered and will aim to deliver a practical set of key outcomes with stakeholders to deliver the changes needed to reduce bureaucratic burdens.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.8/6">My Department is committed to evaluate any measures that are implemented, either through the Children Bill or through policy more generally and will look again at anything which proves to be unnecessarily bureaucratic in practice.</p>

	<p pid=".70W.8/1">Local authorities, maintained schools, early years settings and others have to have regard to the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, published in November 2001, which gives practical advice on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.8/2">The Code of Practice emphasises the importance of early identification, assessment and provision for any child who may have SEN, and that assessment should be seen as a continuing process and not a single event. The importance of early intervention is also a cornerstone of the Government's recently published Strategy for SEN, 'Removing Barriers to Achievement'. This sets out our long term vision for SEN, together with a programme of sustained action and review, both nationally and locally.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.8/3">We want to ensure that children with learning difficulties receive the help they need as soon as possible. As part of our strategy, we are for example looking to embed in practice nationally the principles of the Early Support Pilot Programme for very young disabled children under three and their families, and to ensure that parents of children with SEN have access to suitable child care. It is also important to identify and disseminate good practice. That is why we have commissioned MENCAP to undertake a feasibility study for establishing a National Early Intervention Centre of Excellence.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.8/4">The available information is given in the following table. It shows numbers of children for whom statements were made for the first time in 2003 together with the relevant LEA school populations. It should be noted that some children have a statement maintained by one LEA but attend a school situated in a different LEA. The school population figures are based upon location of school rather than home residence of the pupils and so cannot be used to produce reliable proportions. Information is not collected centrally on when pupils are first identified as having special educational needs.</p>

This case was not discussed specifically as it is an administrative issue that was dealt with internally at the SLC. I understand that around 40 system generated letters were issued wrongly at a total cost of &pound;10. Miss Morley's data has been corrected to ensure no further incorrect letters are issued.

	<p pid=".79W.6/1">Statutory responsibility for the training of magistrates currently rests with the 42 independent Magistrates Courts Committees (MCCs). There are no central data collected on the specific information requested. However, a survey undertaken by the Justices' Clerks' Society (JCS) last year, showed that most magistrates have had access to training on Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTO). The survey also revealed a general desire from magistrates for more information to made available to them and as a consequence a video and pamphlet was produced by DrugScope on behalf of the Criminal Justice Intervention Programme (CJIP). These materials were distributed to all magistrates courts and the Judicial Studies Board is currently preparing further guidance materials for magistrates on drugs issues. The development of material has been informed by a wide variety of external sources, including the experience of the MERIT programme.</p>

	<p pid=".80W.6/1">Attendance allowance and disability living allowance are paid as a contribution towards the extra costs of severely disabled people. Entitlement to the benefits is not based on disability itself, but depends on the extent to which disability gives rise to the need for personal care or supervision from another person and, in the case of disability living allowance, on the effect that disability has on a person's ability to walk. Decision makers dealing with claims for the benefits have access to guidance about laryngectomy from a number of sources. These include the Disability Handbook produced by the Department's Corporate Medical Group, &quot;DLAAB Update&quot; published by the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board, and doctors from the Department's Medical Services.</p>

Prior to that date, London counter-fraud operations were divided between three areas, each of which was responsible for a part of Greater London, but also counties outside of London. It is therefore not possible to provide data for fraud operations in Greater London for that period. Data since <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> is shown below and relates to the DWP London Region, which is not entirely coterminous with the Greater London Area.</p>

This adjustment uses data from the Inlands Revenue's Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) to control the number and income levels of the very rich while retaining the FRS data on the characteristics of their household.</p>

The IMD 2004 has been produced at Super Output Area Lower Layer (SOA) level to transcend problems experienced with wards. Wards are not consistent in size, covering anything from 800 to 35,000 people. They are also subject to frequent ward boundary changes. SOAs, on the other hand, cover between 1,000 and 3,000 people and are designed to last for approximately 20 years. Following a wide public consultation in 2003, it was decided that producing the IMD at SOA level would provide consistency both in terms of size of population and over time.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">pursuant to my reply, <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-10">10 May 2004</phrase>, Official Report, c. 103W</p>
	<p pid=".96W.8/2">Since 1997 allocations of capital funding to local authorities for housing purposes have risen consistently by about 15 per cent. per annum on average. This includes the Major Repairs Allowance we introduced in 2001&ndash;02 specifically for the improvement of local authority stock alongside the Decent Homes standard which sets out minimum standards to be met by 2010. West Lancashire's allocations in the period 1997&ndash;98 to 2003&ndash;04 have risen by 204 per cent. In addition to this welcome increase there has been support through the Community Housing Task Force and Government Office for the North West that has helped the local authority and its tenants to choose the best strategy for long term improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.8/3">16 local authorities in the North West have transferred all their stock, and five local authorities have transferred part of their stock. This has unlocked &pound;1,739 million in private finance, of which &pound;553 million has gone to local authorities in capital receipts, with the remaining &pound;1,186 million going directly into renovating and maintaining the transferred properties. Four local authorities have schemes on the programme that have not yet transferred, three of which have had positive ballot results. Ellesmere Port and Neston, Halton, Hyndburn, Macclesfield and West Lancashire have been granted places on the 2004 programme.</p>

To the extent that their suppliers are not liable for reprinting costs, regional and local returning officers will be able to claim re-imbursement from Government for services properly rendered, or expenses properly incurred, for or in connection with the European election. Insofar as the local elections in principal areas or parishes within the pilot regions are concerned, returning officers will be able to claim &quot;local election pilot expenditure&quot; from Government. That will include any expenditure which is apportioned to the local election, which exceeds the expenditure which would have been incurred if the region had not been one of the pilot regions.</p>

The other was opposed to the proposed allocation policy, preferring a retention of the existing policy.</p>

One was supportive of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's proposals, while another was opposed to it, preferring a retention of the existing policy. The third parish council did not register any comments on that particular aspect of the proposals. Formal representations were not received from the National Association of Local Council or any town councils.

	<p pid=".106W.2/1">All authorised insulins, whether human (synthetic) insulin or animal insulin, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in people with diabetes mellitus. As part of the licensing approval process for any medicinal product, including insulins, the applicant has to provide evidence that the product meets appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy. This will include clinical trial data in patients with diabetes. The decision to use one or other of the insulins rests with the physician in consultation with the patient.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.2/2">The Committee on Safety of Medicines and its sub-committee on pharmacovigilance (SCOP) has kept the safety of synthetic (human) insulins under close review and has considered the available data on a number of occasions. Most recently in 2002, the SCOP considered the findings of an independent review of controlled clinical trial data by the Cochrane collaboration. The conclusions of the Cochrane review were that there is no difference in the incidence of adverse events between patients on synthetic insulin compared with patients on animal insulins. The SCOP confirmed its previous advice that there is no clear evidence of safety problem specific to human insulin. However, the issue will be reviewed again should further information become available.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.2/3">Data on the number of people using these insulins is not collected. However, the table shows the number of prescription items that were dispensed in the community in England, in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.0/16">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/17">1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and primary care trust summarisation schedules which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant health authorities for 1997&ndash;98 to 2002&ndash;03, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts for 2000&ndash;01 to 2002&ndash;03. Figures are given per weighted head of population.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/18">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/19">3. The total national health service expenditure cannot be identified by health authority area because the majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/20">4. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/21">the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/22">asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/23">For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.2/1">Our major vehicle for improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework (NSF), which set specific milestones for improvement by April 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts, specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, &quot;Improvement, Expansion and Reform&quot;, which sets for the national health service a priorities and planning framework for 2003&ndash;06, makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority.</p>

	<p pid=".126W.0/1">The decline in numbers of new displacements in 2003, rather than in numbers of internally displaced people as a whole (the latter continues to rise year upon year), can be contributed in part to the success of the Government of Colombia's democratic security policy. This policy has resulted in an expansion of the state security presence throughout the country. The armed forces have had marked success in their offensives against illegal armed groups since the change of Government in 2002, which saw a stronger commitment to tackle such groups head on. Research by independent human rights observers in Colombia indicates that the illegal armed groups caused the vast majority of displacements in 2003. The problem, however, persists; more needs to be done until overall numbers of internally displaced people can actually start to drop.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.2/1">We are concerned about reports of attacks against Christian groups in Sri Lanka, including the two specific attacks referred to. We condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. We regret the closure of any place of worship due to intolerance or intimidation. Our high commission in Colombo is monitoring the situation in Sri Lanka closely. High commission staff have regular contact with the main Christian leaders in Sri Lanka, who are trying to resolve the issues behind the attacks through meetings with Buddhist and other religious leaders. The Christian leaders have advised against formal representations to the Sri Lankan authorities while these efforts continue. But we have urged the authorities to ensure that those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice and that the rights of all religious minorities in Sri Lanka are respected.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.5/1">None. Each regional group represented in the Commission on Human Rights has a certain number of seats allocated to it. Unless the group itself puts forward more candidates than seats, their nominations are passed without a vote. Sudan's membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights thus follows agreement by the African Group to put them forward as part of their pre-agreed regional nomination. Neither the UK nor any other country has any locus to influence the decisions of another regional group. That said, the Government believe membership of the Commission on Human Rights brings with it responsibilities and members should meet certain minimum standards of behaviour regarding the implementation of human rights in their own countries. We are working with others to identify ways to improve the quality of membership.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.9/1">The Al-Yamamah contracts provide for a set of accounting processes, jointly agreed between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabian Governments, which cover the endorsement and presentation for payment of claims submitted by BAE Systems. Claims are endorsed by the UK Government for payment only where they comply with the terms and prices contained in the associated contract and are supported by documentation confirming contractual performance, e.g. Certificates of Acceptance or Milestone Achievement. Where these criteria are not met, claims are held back or withdrawn until the appropriate paperwork is available or re-submitted. While records are not kept of these occurrences, these arrangements mean that very few claims are finally rejected. There is no evidence that staff of the Saudi Armed Forces Project Office have knowingly received or endorsed claims that contain improper payments of the type alleged in recent press articles.</p>

	<p pid=".140W.5/1">A key component of the Defence Change Programme is the provision of a Defence Information Infrastructure (DII).</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/2">A competition is currently under way to appoint a Delivery Partner under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract who will be responsible for the supply of the required infrastructure and services across Defence. It is intended that the programme will, in time, subsume and then replace the existing disparate IT infrastructures. It is anticipated that this contract will be in place by early 2005 with the entire programme completed by early 2009.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/3">The DII programme is not a privatisation of IT infrastructure. Under the terms of the Public Private Partnership arrangement, the Ministry of Defence will continue to own the infrastructure but the delivery of the sendee will be the responsibility of the Delivery Partner. Currently, much of the design, provision and management of our existing infrastructure is already outsourced, albeit under a number of different arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/4">The DII programme is crucial to the delivery of the Defence Change Programme and has the potential to support delivery of significant benefits across Defence. The DII programme will enable Defence to realise a greatly increased capability at reduced cost. It will provide pan-defence corporate processes that improve the way Defence conducts its business on a day-to-day basis. In addition, it will enable our battlefield systems to be more closely integrated with our support systems, leading to improved decision making and intelligence collection and analysis.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/5">The savings generated from the more efficient provision of computing facilities are being used to increase the capability of the infrastructure. This includes better resilience and provision for business continuity, the near doubling of the number of users supported by the infrastructure, the provision of a single point of contact for all services offered by the Defence Communications Services Agency (DCSA), unified records management, and much improved e-mail and collaborative working services.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/6">The provision of new tools and new ways of working means that users of the system will have more powerful capability at their fingertips to enable them to be increasingly effective in delivering their objectives. DII will therefore have a significant impact on the way all users are able to exploit the power of the infrastructure in delivering their outputs, both in the fixed and in the deployed environment.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/7">Those civilians employed in support roles for the current infrastructure will be transferred to the Delivery Partner (DP) under TUPE arrangements once the DP takes control of the management of the system that they support. It is expected that there will be some exceptions to this in order to provide support for systems that have operational or specialist constraints and require the retention of in house support staff. There will also be those who need to be retained to form the core of the Intelligent Customer Function (ICF). The MOD will be retaining Military Service Providers (MSPs) to support the infrastructure when it is deployed for military operations.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.12/3">In order to give those military forces who are designated 'prone to capture' an indication of the stresses and pressures that they may face if they are captured by an enemy, JSIO are authorised to conduct R2I training. During the course of such training, certain activities proscribed by the Geneva Conventions (GC) are employed. This is in order to give the best possible preparation to personnel likely to be deployed on operations where they will be most at risk from interrogation methods falling outside of the GC. Such activities only occur on designated exercises in a controlled and properly supervised environment by professionally trained personnel from JSIO supported by other appropriately trained staff. Those proscribed activities under the GC which 'prone to capture' British forces receive exposure to, include hooding, white noise and stress positions. It should be clearly understood that activities conducted under R2I training which are proscribed in the GC are neither taught nor reflected in UK interrogation training and practices, which are always conducted in accordance with the GC.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.5/1">The Mk 98 Fire Control System is an important part of the equipment fitted on board a Vanguard class submarine. It draws together all the information needed to calculate the flight data required by a Trident missile prior to launch. The MK98 MOD 2 Fire Control System was installed on the submarines at build. The MK98 MOD 5 programme was undertaken to update hardware to overcome obsolescence and is now complete. Initial Operating Capability was achieved in September 2002 and all SSBNs had been modified by February 2003. The update programme, for hardware only, cost $39.810 million (including the costs of fitting) and $6.987 million for initial spares. Information on the costs of the related software modifications is not held separately from that relating to other software costs in this area. The UK has no requirement for a SLBM Retargeting System on Trident submarines, and has no plans to acquire that capability.</p>
