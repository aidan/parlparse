	<p pid=".779W.3/1">I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 24 February.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/2">The Irish Presidency briefly presented its work programme for the first half of the year. Their general priorities were enlargement, simplification and enhancement of food safety.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/3">The Council agreed by a qualified majority a regulation providing for tariff quotas for the importation of certain fishery products. Italy voted against because of its view that the quota for tuna loin imports was insufficient and Spain abstained because it felt that the quotas in general were too large. I supported the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/4">The Council noted progress on technical level discussions preparatory to political discussion at the April Council on the proposals for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport. There was a discussion, and I supported the need for an early agreement and for a longer-term objective of moving trade in live animals for slaughter to a meat basis.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/5">The Council noted a presentation from the Commission on its proposals for the financial perspective.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/6">The Council noted a report from the Greek Minister about severe weather conditions in Greece affecting agriculture and the sympathetic response from the Commission. Greece and the Commission would pursue the assessment of this situation bilaterally.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/7">The Council took note of a report from the Commission on its public hearing on 22 January on organic food and farming. This is preparatory to the tabling of an action plan by the Commission to the Council later in the Irish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/8">Under any other business, the Council noted a written report on BSE and reports from Commissioner Byrne on the current situation in regard to Avian Influenza in Asia and a recent outbreak in the US. Commissioner Byrne notified the Council that acting under comitology procedures the Commission was to introduce a ban on the importation of live poultry and certain products from the US. The Council also noted a report from Spain and Portugal about the high level of feed grain prices and indications from Finland and Sweden that there remained supplies of oats which could be used.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/9">The Council also noted information from Italy and Portugal with support from other wine producing countries about recent changes which had been made to the use of traditional terms for wine imported from third countries. The Council noted that the Commission had explained that these changes were necessary to take account of recent discussions at WTO level.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/10">The Council noted information from France about the low level of milk prices. A wide range of views were expressed in subsequent discussion. I made the point that this was to be expected as a result of the changes agreed last June which was reflected in the compensation payments to be introduced shortly. The Commission undertook to produce an analysis of the situation with assistance from the member states.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.3/11">Finally the Commission amplified the terms of a letter which it had recently sent to all member states about the single farm payment to explain that it was simply making the point that member states which chose to operate on regional or hybrid models would need to justify this decision to the Commission as will be clarified in the Commission implementing regulations. This was noted by the Council.</p>

This will allow the Government to report on a full year from the launch of the White Paper in February 2003, as we are legally required to do by the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, as well as to capture some key energy statistics for the relevant period. Given the importance of energy efficiency to delivery of the Energy White Paper objectives, the Government intend to publish the Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan at the same time as the Annual Report. The Government also envisage simultaneous publication of the fuel poverty strategy implementation plan and the CHP strategy as well as the second annual progress report on the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".781W.2/1">No such guidance has been issued. From April 2004 the Environment Agency's flood defence service in England will be funded primarily through Defra grant in aid which will replace, in large part, the levies that local authorities have previously paid to the Agency. We have, however, left in place a power for the Agency to levy local authorities to fund works not covered by Defra grant. These levies need to be agreed by the relevant flood defence committee on which the local authorities have a majority.</p>

	<p pid=".782W.7/1">Liquified petroleum gas (LPG), has and will continue to receive considerable support from Government, not only in the form of a duty incentive (worth &pound;75 million in terms of duty forgone in 2002&ndash;03 alone), but also through grants for vehicle conversions (the Powershift scheme), and reduced rates of vehicle excise duty for gas-powered vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.7/2">As the pre-Budget report made clear, the relative environmental benefits of LPG vehicles have become less significant in recent years as a result of progressively tighter emission standards for new conventional petrol and diesel vehicles. As a result the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report that he will begin to gradually increase the rate for LPG over the next three years, setting duty differentials on a path towards a level commensurate with the fuel's environmental benefits. Consistent with the Government's commitment to give three-year certainty on duty differentials for alternative fuels, future differentials for the next three years will be announced at Budget 2004.</p>

Hence it is not possible to make a direct comparison between any specific fee that will be prescribed in the new Fees Order with a specific fee charged under the Insolvency Fees Order 1986 or earlier legislation.</p>

The Regional Aggregation Bodies (trading as Adits) are using their buying power to bring broadband to new and previously untenable areas and the Regional Development Agencies will be spending or committing a further &pound;235 million to broadband development by 2006. This will provide opportunities for further investment by industry using a range of appropriate technical solutions, including alternatives to ADSL and cable&mdash;for example, powerline and satellite in addition to wireless.</p>

	<p pid=".793W.0/1">The Government's Manufacturing Strategy, which we developed in partnership with industry, trade unions and other stakeholders, aims to create a high-value manufacturing sector in the UK with a highly skilled and well paid workforce, moving away from competing on the basis of low skill and low wages. We are continuing to develop a range of initiatives under the Skills Strategy such as employer training pilots, modern apprenticeships, the growing network of Sector Skills Councils and other measures to better deploy and retain skills to improve business performance.</p>
	<p pid=".793W.0/2">Where there are significant redundancies in the manufacturing sector, the Rapid Response Service works to move people quickly into new jobs, preventing them from becoming detached from the labour market. Although a trend to declining manufacturing employment has been a feature of advanced economies over the last 30 years, new jobs are still being created all the time. Around 250,000 manufacturing vacancies were reported to Jobcentre plus in the last year. Overall the UK labour market is performing well, with total employment rising by nearly 1.7 million since spring 1997, and unemployment falling in every region in Britain over the past year.</p>

	<p pid=".802W.5/1">A recent Food and Agriculture Organisation study sampled 10 per cent. of the world's tropical forests in 1980, 1990 and 2000. The key changes noted were a loss of 'closed forest' (i.e. rain forest) amounting to 70&ndash;80 million hectares per decade, and a gain in &quot;other land cover&quot;, primarily cultivation and pastures, of an almost identical area.</p>
	<p pid=".802W.5/2">It is not possible to state the proportion of forest destroyed to provide food for animals, since deforested land often has a sequence of changing uses. For example, in South America land cleared for cattle ranching is often later used for soy bean cultivation. In Africa, land cleared for small-scale landholdings is often used for both cultivation and raising livestock.</p>

The process will consist of two parts: Firstly there will be a technical open-ended meeting of an ad-hoc working group in Santiago, Chile in March. The outcome of this will be a report of key lessons and challenges in relation to further implementation of ICPD. Secondly there will be a high-level regular meeting of ECLAC in Puerto Rico in June, which will consider the outcome of Santiago.</p>
	<p pid=".802W.8/2">The UK Government will be represented at both these meetings as members of ECLAC. We are keen to emphasise the importance of the ICPD commitments and to support countries that do not wish to weaken the consensus of ICPD. DFID is particularly concerned with maintaining wording on reproductive health, rights and sexual health and avoiding unproductive arguments about issues that have already been agreed. The emphasis of the two ECLAC meetings should be on monitoring of progress of the ICPD commitments in the region and discussion around enhancing progress for the next 10 years.</p>

	<p pid=".804W.5/1">We have not received any representations from non-governmental organisations on over-estimates of HIV/AIDS rates in sub-Saharan Africa. This Department does not plan to commission research into the differences between data based on population-based surveys and on ante-natal clinic-based surveys in giving reliable estimates of the level of HIV/AIDS infection in sub-Saharan Africa. UNAIDS has the mandate to provide information on the status of the epidemic.</p>
	<p pid=".804W.5/2">UNAIDS included information about methodological issues relating to differences between data taken from these two different sources in the Global Epidemic update, which was released last World AIDS day. They concluded that population based surveys are likely to underestimate true HIV prevalence in most cases, because some respondents are absent from the household at the time of a survey and some refuse to participate. UNAIDS also recognise that most antenatal clinic-based surveillance systems have limited geographical coverage, which can lead to wide variations in the quality of the national estimate of HIV prevalence.</p>
	<p pid=".804W.5/3">UNAIDS is now doing some analysis linking behavioural data to the surveys, to see whether and how that has affected the result of the population-based surveys. They will convene a meeting in May to analyse different results across a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa from the two sources of data. They aim to report findings at the World AIDS Conference in Bangkok in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".804W.5/4">We have not made any specific representations to UNAIDS about changes to future exercises estimating HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in SA, to include population based surveys as opposed to surveys which indicate trends in HIV prevalence. DFID is in dialogue with them on issues around data sources for HIV estimates. UNAIDS contend that conducting ante-natal clinic-based surveys and population surveys at three to five year intervals can serve as valuable components of surveillance systems and can help improve estimates of the levels and trends in HIV prevalence. This Department supports UNAIDS in their efforts to analyse the different results from different sources, rather than relying on one source alone. All HIV estimates need to be assessed critically. Using different sources for data and interrogating the results will always provide more robust analysis than relying on one source.</p>

There is a high level steering group which helps to facilitate UK French co-operation and, in addition, there have been regular meetings on the subject both between project officials from the UK's Defence Procurement Agency and their equivalents in the DGA and on a navy-to-navy basis. These meetings have identified several areas for potential co-operation.</p>

The number of claims is expected to build up gradually over an extended period but to remain lower than the current level of claims against the War Pensions Scheme. This is because the latter covers periods of conscription, of worldwide conflict and of much larger than at present armed forces.</p>

The ammunition was manufactured to NATO standards by the Belgian contractor FN Herstal. A thorough and immediate investigation by the contractor could not replicate the reported problem. However, it was identified that a minor increase in the loaded propellant charge, still within NATO specifications, would increase the performance of the ammunition in the weapon. This change was immediately implemented by FN Herstal, at no cost to the MOD, and the new ammunition was available within four weeks.</p>

	<p pid=".810W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of Operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs that the Department would have incurred regardless of the operation taking place, such as wages and salaries, are not included. Savings on activities that have not occurred because of the operation&mdash;training exercises for example&mdash;are taken into account in arriving at the net figures.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.3/2">Costs are not incurred on a regular daily basis and force levels have fluctuated considerably during 2003&ndash;04. As a result, to attempt to provide daily average costs would be misleading.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.3/3">However, you may wish to know that outturn information for 2002&ndash;03 on the cost of operations in Iraq has been published as part of the MOD's Annual Report and Accounts. Operating Costs for 2002&ndash;03 for operations in Iraq total &pound;629.531 million. Expenditure on Capital equipment amounts to &pound;217.680 million. The grand total is, therefore, &pound;847.211 million.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.3/4">For 2003&ndash;04, funding voted at Winter Supplementary Estimates amounted to &pound;1.2 billion and covered the cost of peacekeeping and associated Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs). The MOD has sought a further &pound;300 million at Spring Supplementary Estimates to cover primarily the cost of the recuperation of the Department's operational capability. Thus, the total sought in 2003&ndash;04 will be &pound;1.5 billion.</p>

	<p pid=".814W.2/1">The Royal Fleet Auxiliary operates four classes of oilers (Wave, Leaf, Rover, and Fort Victoria). The two Wave class oilers (Wave Ruler and Wave Knight) entered service in 2003 and will remain operational until after 2025.</p>
	<p pid=".814W.2/2">The Leaf and Rover classes are due to reach their expected out of service dates by 2011. They are single-hulled and so will be non-compliant with revised Marpol (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) regulations on the introduction of double-hulled vessels. The newer Fort Victoria ships are also single-hulled but we are currently considering ways of maintaining compliance with international legislation beyond 2010. While Marpol does not apply to vessels owned or operated by a state and used only on Government non-commercial service, as is the case with the RFA oilers, it remains MOD policy to comply with Shipping Acts and associated regulations where practicable. Consequently, MOD has a programme to phase out all non-compliant RFA vessels with a target date of 2010 based on the earliest practicable point for compliance.</p>
	<p pid=".814W.2/3">As explained in my answer of 11 February 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/.1459W"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 1459&ndash;60W</phrase>, the Department's programme, known as the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) programme, seeks progressively to replace most of the current RFA fleet, including Leaf, Rover, and Fort Victoria class oiler vessels. As part of this, these ships will be replaced by more flexible and capable vessels fully compliant with Marpol. This will significantly enhance the RFA's ability to provide the Royal Navy with its afloat support requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".825W.6/1">The security situation in Afghanistan remains fragile. The two lethal bomb attacks on Canadian and UK IS AF personnel in January in Kabul followed the killing of four German ISAF personnel in a similar attack in June 2003. Other attacks, such as the murder of a UN employee in November 2003 and the attack near Kandahar on 22 February in which an Australian pilot was killed and a British aid worker wounded, have targeted the international community and NGO operations outside the capital. Security in the south continues to cause concern, especially near the border with Pakistan, where extremist groups are operating. There have been fewer problems in the north, but long-standing tensions persist and these can flare up into violence.</p>

	<p pid=".828W.8/1">Saddam Hussein is being held as a prisoner of war by the US in Iraq. It is coalition policy not to disclose the precise location of detainees for security reasons. It is for the Iraqis to decide what legal procedures should be taken against him. In December, the Iraqi Governing Council established a Special Tribunal to try senior members of the former regime. Iraqis are currently discussing the rules and procedures for this tribunal.</p>

This consolidates the breakthrough announced by President Musharraf and Prime Minister Vajpayee in January, and shows the willingness of both countries to address each other's concerns through peaceful engagement. We appreciate that there will be no quick or easy solutions, but wish both governments well and hope that the talks will be sustained and, in due course, lead to the resolution of all their outstanding differences, including over Kashmir.</p>

	<p pid=".831W.5/1">After Accession on 1 May, nationals from the ten new EU member states will be able to travel freely throughout the EU. However, except for nationals of Malta and Cyprus, they will not automatically be allowed to work in the existing member states. Those existing member states may, however, open their labour markets to nationals from the new member states if they so choose.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/2"><i></i><i>(a)</i> Ireland will open their labour markets to nationals from the new member states.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/3"><i></i><i>(b)</i> Denmark will open its labour market from 1 May, but has decided to impose a new administrative set-up with work and residence permits for new EU citizens. Citizens from the new member states will be able to stay in Denmark for a six month job-seeking period during which they will not be entitled to social benefit. This rule also applies to other EU citizens. A Work and Residence Permit will be granted for one year (as opposed to five year residence certificate for present EU member states' citizens) only if the person concerned has found a job and will be employed on the same pay and working conditions as those applying on the Danish labour market.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/4"><i></i><i>(c)</i> Sweden will open its labour market from 1 May, but the Swedish Government has signalled its intention to introduce transitional arrangements for workers from the new member states. It has yet to bring forward formal proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/5"><i></i><i>(d)</i> Finland will impose a two-year transition period and existing controls on workers from eight of the ten new member states will apply. No restrictions will apply to citizens of Malta and Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/6"><i></i><i>(e)</i> Germany will apply a transition period for two years, which may be extended to seven. Existing controls on workers from the relevant eight new member states will apply.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/7"><i></i><i>(f)</i> Austria will apply a transition period of at least two years. After that, it has indicated that it will follow Germany's lead.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/8"><i></i><i>(g)</i> The Netherlands is not imposing a transition period. The Dutch Cabinet agreed on 23 January to introduce a system of work permits for workers from new member states from 1 May. But this proposal was rejected by the Dutch Parliament on 9 February that asked for tougher measures. On 13 February the Dutch Government came forward with new proposals which will only allow workers from new member states to work in sectors where there is a shortage of available suitably qualified Dutch or EU nationals. The Centres for Work and Income (Job Centre Plus equivalent) will decide which sectors have such a shortfall. These regulations will be effective from 1 May 2004 to 1 May 2006. An evaluation of the system will take place before 1 May 2005 to see if these restrictions can be relaxed earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/9"><i></i><i>(h)</i> Belgium will impose a transition period of at least two years.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/10"><i></i><i>(i)</i> Luxembourg will impose a transition period of at least two years.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/11"><i>(j)</i> France will impose a transition period of at least two years.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/12"><i></i><i>(k)</i> Spain will apply a transition period for two years. Depending on developments in the labour market, they may allow new member states citizens full rights to work before the end of the transition period. Spain has a bilateral agreement with Poland to allow a limited number of Poles to work in Spain.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/13"><i></i><i>(l)</i> Portugal has yet to decide whether it will open up its labour market to workers from the eight new member states.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary made clear UK Government policy in this House on 23 February 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/.23"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 23&ndash;25</phrase>. The UK has decided to allow free movement of workers to those who genuinely want to come and work here. Genuine workers from the eight new member states will be allowed access to the UK labour market via a workers registration system. This will benefit the UK economy, expanding the range of skills and supply of workers available across the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".834W.15/1">In his contacts with Iranian leaders, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has made clear our support for Iran's efforts to reform. The flawed parliamentary elections held on 20 February were a setback for Iran's democratic development. On 23 February, EU Foreign Ministers expressed their deep regret and disappointment that large numbers of candidates, including many sitting deputies, had been prevented from standing, thus making a genuine democratic choice by the Iranian people impossible. For elections in any country to be regarded as free and fair, electors must have a chance to vote for candidates with a range of views.</p>

	<p pid=".837W.15/1">South Korea's average income per capita in 2002 (latest year for which actual figures are available) was US$9,979. This year, the figure is expected to reach around US$12,000, owing to economic growth and appreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar.</p>
	<p pid=".837W.15/2">The North Korean government does not publish economic statistics. Reliable figures for per capita incomes are therefore unavailable.

The figure is unlikely to have changed significantly since then.</p>

BRE published their research last month and a summary document of the work can be found on the Building Regulations section of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website&mdash;<a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".840W.9/2">The findings of the research indicate that residential sprinklers would appear to be generally effective in controlling fires. However, the work did show that in the case of some slow burning and shielded fires people could still eventually be overcome by smoke inhalation. The research also found that it would not be cost effective to require the universal installation of sprinklers in all residential premises. However, the research concluded that in some types of premises, typically those where the occupants are considered to be the most vulnerable to fire, further consideration is warranted. These premises include residential care homes, high-rise houses and flats and higher risk houses in multiple occupation.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.9/3">As part of our current review of the fire safety aspects of the building regulations we will be considering the findings of the BRE research to see if there is a case for introducing amendments that enable us to target the provision of sprinklers in those new and altered premises where the people are considered to be most vulnerable.</p>

	<p pid=".842W.7/1">The responsibility for attaching conditions to liquor licences under current law rests with the licensing justices.Under the Licensing Act 2003, which received Royal Assent on 10 July 2003, this responsibility will be transferred to licensing authorities which, in the main, are local authorities. There are two mandatory conditions in the 2003 Act, which will be attached in all cases where a premises licence authorises the supply of alcohol. The first is that no supply of alcohol may be made at a time when there is no designated premises supervisor in respect of the premises or at a time when the premises supervisor does not hold a personal licence or it is suspended. The second is that every supply of alcohol under the premises licence must be made or authorised by a person who holds a personal licence.</p>
	<p pid=".842W.7/2">The 2003 Act provides further mechanisms to promote the prevention of nuisance and crime and disorder. The Act introduces the review of licences. Interested parties and responsible authorities will be able to request that a review of a premises licence occurs on a ground which is relevant to one or more of the licensing objectives (the prevention of crime and disorder, the prevention of public nuisance, the protection of children from harm and public safety). The review may lead to modifications of the conditions on the licence, the exclusion of certain licensable activities from the licence, the removal of the premises supervisor, or the suspension or revocation of the licence.</p>
	<p pid=".842W.7/3">In addition, the 2003 Act provides powers for a magistrates court in a particular area to make an order requiring premises at or near a place of disorder, or expected disorder, to be closed for a period not exceeding 24 hours.</p>
	<p pid=".842W.7/4">In addition a particular premises may be closed if a senior police officer reasonably believes there is, or is likely imminently to be, disorder on, or in the vicinity, of the premises and the closure is necessary for public safety, or alternatively if a public nuisance is being caused by noise coming from the premises and closure is necessary to prevent the nuisance. These closure orders can be for up to 24 hours and may be extended in certain situations. These powers will also be applicable to temporary events held under temporary event notices.</p>
	<p pid=".842W.7/5">In addition to these provisions, the 2003 Act contains offences such as the sale of alcohol to a person who is drunk or obtaining alcohol for a person who is drunk. Before the licensing Bill was introduced, during its passage through Parliament and since Royal Assent, we have engaged in extensive and detailed consultation with the Local Government Association, the Association of London Government and the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services about the provisions of the new legislation and its implementation.</p>

	<p pid=".844W.11/2">There are four ways consumers can receive digital television today:</p>
	<p pid=".844W.11/3" class="italic">(a) Terrestrially</p>
	<p pid=".844W.11/4">Consumers need to buy either a digital adapter (set top box) or an integrated digital television. While many people will be able to use their existing aerials, some may need to have new aerials or cabling installed to receive all services. Digital terrestrial television is now receivable in around 75 per cent. of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".844W.11/5" class="italic">(b) Through Satellite</p>
	<p pid=".844W.11/6">Consumers need to get either a digital satellite adaptor and connect it to their existing analogue TV set or a digital TV set designed to receive digital satellite signals. They will also need a dish installed outside their home. Digital satellite signals reach the vast majority of UK homes, but in a few cases reception may not be possible, because the line of sight to the satellite is obstructed, or because planning or property regulations do not permit householders to put up a dish.</p>
	<p pid=".844W.11/7" class="italic">(c) Through Cable</p>
	<p pid=".844W.11/8">Consumers need a set top box provided and installed by the operator of the cable network which serves their home, if they live in a cabled area. <i>(d) Through Broadband DSL</i></p>
	<p pid=".844W.11/9">A fourth digital platform is emerging through use of digital subscriber line technologies based on telephony network cabling. Today, this service is only available in Kingston upon Hull, and London.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.2/2">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is working with stakeholders, within the Digital Television Action Plan, to ensure that everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form (BBC 1 and 2, ITV, Channel 4/S4C and Channel 5) will be able to receive them on digital systems. However, this might not be possible before switchover for a small minority of consumers. Though Digital satellite signals reach the vast majority of UK homes, in a few cases reception or installation of the necessary dish may not be possible, either for topographic or legal reasons. We are reviewing these legal constraints to ensure they are minimal and proportionate. Any further extension of the digital cable networks is a commercial matter for the operators. As for terrestrial reception, it is not possible to extend it before switchover, as signals currently have to be transmitted at low power to prevent interferences with UK and foreign analogue signals. Only switchover will allow digital terrestrial television to reach the same level of coverage as analogue.</p>

	<p pid=".852W.2/1">We are taking significant steps to protect members of defined benefit schemes. We are introducing the Pension Protection Fund, which will protect scheme members by paying compensation if their employer becomes insolvent and the pension scheme is under funded. We are also introducing a new Pensions Regulator that has the flexibility and powers to take a targeted and proportionate approach to protecting the funds held in pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.2/2">Additionally, on 23 February, we laid Regulations that strengthen members' protection when a defined benefit occupational pension scheme starts to wind up while its sponsoring employer is solvent. On 24 February, we announced changes to the priority order which applies on wind up. This will help ensure that assets of the pension scheme are shared as fairly as possible between non-pensioner and pensioner scheme members.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.2/3">In the event of employer insolvency assistance is available to pension scheme members under the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Pensions Scheme Act 1993. Under these Acts, the Redundancy Payments Directorate makes insolvency payments from the National Insurance Fund (NIF) to qualifying former employees. Claims for unpaid employees' contributions are limited to the actual amount deducted from wages during the 12 months prior to the date of insolvency. Unpaid employers' contributions for the 12 month period prior to the insolvency date are also payable, but are subject to monetary limits depending on the type of pension scheme.</p>

Extensive negotiations over several months did not result in an agreed pay deal for the 11 Departments of the Northern Ireland Administration this year. Management Side presented an offer worth 3.67 per cent. on 5 November. As this could not be agreed, and Trade Union Side declined to negotiate within the 3.67 per cent. envelope, we took the decision to proceed to pay the award and communicated this to staff and Trade Union Side on 27 November. I have made clear to Trade Union Side that the 3.67 per cent. deal is the maximum that can be paid. We are however open to exploring other reasonable means of resolving the dispute. The latest meeting of the Central Whitley Council between Trade Union and Management Sides took place on Thursday, 19 February, and we have agreed to hold further negotiations as a matter of urgency.</p>

	<p pid=".861W.2/1">A great deal of work is being taken forward by the Department of Education in a range of areas to improve the levels of provision for children with learning difficulties, and in particular autism and dyslexia. While this represents a broad strategic approach, the Department is not engaged in a formal exercise to draw up a Strategy for People with Learning Disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/2">In 2002, two Northern Ireland Education Task Groups published reports, with recommendations, on the future development of educational provision for children with autism and dyslexia. Following DE-led conferences on these areas in autumn 2002, Education and Library Boards (ELBs) have prioritised the reports' recommendations and consequently the Department has made &pound;270,000 available in 2003&ndash;04 and up to &pound;540,000 in 2004&ndash;05 to the ELBs to develop training needs and support measures in the field of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). An Inter Board ASD Group has been established, which will promote consistency of approach in relation to children with ASD across the five ELBs. A further &pound;500,000 was allocated in 2003&ndash;04 to provide support and training for parents and staff in pre-school settings working with children with ASD.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/3">DE led the collaborative North/South production of complementary parent and teacher videos/CD-ROMs and guidance material on autism. These were distributed widely across Northern Ireland in 2003. A dyslexia video/DVD ROM is also nearing completion by a joint North/South group and it is hoped to distribute this in the near future. The Education and Training Inspectorate is working to produce a &quot;Dyslexia Friendly Schools&quot; guide during 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/4">A Steering Group, comprising health and education authorities from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, are taking forward the development of the Centre of Excellence for children and young people with ASD at Middletown, Co. Armagh.</p>

The policy paper published in April last year included the Regulatory Impact Assessment, New TSN and Equality Impact Assessments. All this evidence was summarised, analysed and considered objectively and the various options were discussed openly with representatives of the business community before a final decision was made.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.6/1">The decision to rate vacant non-domestic property was informed by an analysis of the potential impact on deprived areas. It concluded that the impact is likely to be positive because such property tends to be concentrated in deprived areas and the effect of the measure will be to encourage owners to bring them back into use and occupation. This New TSN analysis was published with the policy paper in April 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.6/2">In line with the outcomes of the consultation exercise in 2002, the exemptions to the vacant rate will largely mirror those in the rest of the UK. They will cover the situation where the occupation or use of the property is restricted or prohibited in some way, or where the person would be liable only as a proxy for someone else. Property with a net annual value of less than &pound;2,000, property vacant for less than three months, and other properties such as listed buildings will also be exempt. It is also intended to exempt industrial property, that is factories, mines and quarries, from the vacant rate. However, standalone warehouses will not be exempt because, unlike industrial property, they can be readily converted and put on the market for sale or letting to a range of buyers or tenants.</p>

	<p pid=".871W.2/1">In the Crown court close management of ineffective trials by courts and other Criminal Justice System agencies has resulted in a reduction to 17.8 per cent. in January 2004 from the baseline of 23 per cent. set last year. Progress in the magistrates court has been slower, but is still 1.5 per cent. better than the baseline, at 29.4 per cent. in January.</p>

In addition, on 4 February the Government announced a &pound;27 million award for the &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot; Project. This project will ensure victims and witnesses needs are taken into account so that they are more likely to attend on the date of trial.</p>

	<p pid=".885W.8/1">A new sun awareness initiative, the SunSmart campaign, was launched in March 2003, funded by United Kingdom Health Departments and run by Cancer Research UK.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/2">The campaign is based on the successful SunSmart campaign in Australia. The campaign has received interim funding of &pound;50,000 this year from the UK Health Departments. Decisions on further funding for SunSmart will be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/3">The campaign's aim is to increase the profile of the issue of skin cancer and methods of effective sun protection. The key objectives are to increase knowledge of the causes of skin cancer, to increase awareness of actions that can be taken to prevent skin cancer and to influence positively attitudes to sun protection.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/4">Wide dissemination of SunSmart messages will be achieved through the media and by supporting education and health professionals locally. The campaign is working with the Department for Education and Skills and teachers to develop guidelines to encourage schools to adopt their own SunSmart policies and curricular activities.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/5">Tanning shops and the potential dangers involved in the use of sunbeds will be the subject of a meeting of experts and industry hosted by SunSmart on 29 March. The campaign will review the latest scientific evidence and to develop practical recommendations for better self-regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/6">SunSmart achieved mass media coverage for skin cancer issues in 2003, reaching 76 per cent. of UK adults, and will use similar techniques this spring/summer to keep skin cancer high profile with the public.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/7">In addition to the SunSmart campaign, we continue to fund the Meteorological Office to provide the Ultra-Violet index in the media (television, radio, Meteorological Office website).</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/8">The Department also provides core funding to the National Radiological Protection Board, which has expertise on ultra-violet radiation issues relevant to the public health aspects of the prevention of skin cancer.</p>

	<p pid=".886W.6/1">The Skills Strategy (published in July 2003) set out our plans for identifying skill needs across the economy.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/2">In relation to the particular areas highlighted:</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/3" class="italic">The construction industry and plumbing</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/4">Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) are being established to identify and define the skills that employers need to raise productivity in all major sectors of the economy. Construction is one of four sectors pioneering new Sector Skills Agreements to deliver on this agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/5">Construction was highlighted as a priority curriculum area in &quot;Success for All: Our Vision for the Future&quot; the Government's strategy for reforming further education and training published in November 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/6">The 2003 National Employers Skills Survey shows the construction sector as having a relatively high number of skill shortage vacancies per employee in comparison to other sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/7">Forecast future requirements in the construction sector are of an annual net requirement between 2003 and 2007 of 54,000 construction workers and 6,000 plumbers. This is to replace both an ageing workforce and to meet an expansion of the sector.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/8">Supply is expected to meet this increased future demand. In 2001/02 there were 49,000 vocational awards for construction and 11,000 for plumbing while the number of first-year construction trainees increased for the fifth year running in 2002/03.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/9" class="italic">The NHS</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/10">The NHS Plan acknowledged that shortages in human resources were the biggest constraint facing the NHS and set ambitious targets for increasing the NHS workforce. By March 2004 there will be 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals employed in the NHS than in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/11">Furthermore, &quot;Delivering the NHS Plan&quot; included expected increases in the NHS work force. Between 2001 and 2008, we expect there to be increases of 35,000 nurses and midwives, 15,000 consultants and GPs and 30,000 therapists and scientists.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/12" class="italic">The education system</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/13">The Secretary of State for Education and Skills is responsible for ensuring an adequate supply of school teachers. Since 1997 there has been an increase of nearly 25,000 regular teachers in maintained schools in England. Recent improvements in recruitment to initial teacher training and innovative ways of remodelling the work force&mdash;with support staff helping teachers to use their professional skills to greatest effect&mdash;mean that supply is expected to continue to be sufficient. Alongside rising teacher numbers, there is also evidence of improving teacher quality.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/14">The DfES liaises regularly with the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to ensure that the supply of teaching and learning is not adversely affected by labour shortage.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.6/15">In addition, the DfES has responsibility&mdash;following the publication of the Green Paper, &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;&mdash;for children's services more broadly, including social care, and is currently developing its evidence base on the wider children's work force.</p>

	<p pid=".888W.5/2">The non-statutory framework for Personal, Social and Health Education, provides for personal finance education to be taught in both primary and secondary schools, allowing teachers to cover the wide range of topics as set out in the Department's &quot;Financial Capability through Personal Financial Education&quot; guidance for schools. This helps to provide children with the skills they need to move into adulthood, confident in their ability to deal effectively with a range of financial decisions.

These are cases where they have commenced care proceedings in relation to a child and where the court has not yet made a final care order. In these cases councils should consider with their lawyers the implications, for those proceedings, of the Court of Appeal's judgment in the Cannings case.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.2/4">Thirdly, within the next 12 weeks social services should, together with their lawyers, identify those cases where a final care order was made in the past, which involved harm to the child or a sibling, and where the making of the care order depended, exclusively or almost exclusively, on a serious disagreement between medical experts about the cause of the harm. In such cases, councils should again consider, with their lawyers, whether there are now doubts about the reliability of the expert medical evidence. If that is so and, in the light of the child's current circumstances and current best interests, they should then consider whether to apply to the court for the care order to be discharged, or whether to support any application that may be made by the parents or the child. Councils, when reviewing cases, will also need to take into account any fresh case law judgments from the appeal court that may be relevant.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.2/5">Where applications to the court are made, whether by the local authority, the parents or the child it will be for the court to decide, in all cases, if the care order should be discharged.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.2/6">My statement set out a route forward for the period ahead within the limits of my ability to act. With this review and with the current and forthcoming judgments in both care proceedings and appeal cases in the courts we will ensure that we are acting in the best way possible to protect the interests of children both today and in the future.</p>

Friends in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, been working carefully to consider how the family justice system and related children's services can better meet the needs of all children and their parents following relationship breakdown. We want to ensure that better outcomes are achieved for children by, where possible, helping parents agree contact arrangements without the intervention of the courts. We have also consulted widely with stakeholders and drawn on their expertise. I expect to publish the Government's response in March.</p>

Following discussions with the Children's Fund advisory forum of key stakeholders in the programme, we have agreed revised allocations to partnerships for 2004&ndash;05, together with a package of flexibilities that will ensure that the programme lives within its financial limits while honouring its commitments. We will be having a comprehensive dialogue about 2005&ndash;06 with partnerships and key partners in the programme over the next few weeks, with final decisions to be taken in autumn 2004 informed by that dialogue and the outcome of the Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid=".895W.3/2">My Department's guidance to employers in the education service about pre-appointment checks on teachers and other workers in schools advises that, if a person who they intend to appoint to work in a school has never lived in the UK, no purpose will be served by asking them to apply for a disclosure when they come to this country.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/3">The Criminal Records Bureau is not able to obtain details of a person's criminal record from overseas. A limited number of overseas convictions are recorded on the Police national computer, but the data is not comprehensive.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/4">The Bureau's Overseas Information Service provides advice to employers on the availability of criminal record information from overseas. The service currently covers 17 countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Irish Republic, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Poland, Canada, Jamaica, South Africa, Malaysia, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Italy (excluding Vatican City) and Finland). The CRB is in discussions with the 10 accession countries to the European Union and aims to provide information through the Overseas Information Service about the criminal record information available from these countries within the next few months.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/5">Where criminal record information is not available, we recommend that employers take extra care in taking up references and carrying out other checks on a person's background.</p>

We are continuing to develop a range of initiatives under the Skills Strategy such as employer training pilots, modern apprenticeships, the growing network of Sector Skills Councils and other measures to better deploy and retain skills to improve business performance.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.5/3">Where there are significant redundancies in the manufacturing sector, the Rapid Response Service works to move people quickly into new jobs, preventing them from becoming detached from the labour market. Although a trend to declining manufacturing employment has been a feature of advanced economies over the last 30 years, new jobs are still being created all the time. Around 250,000 manufacturing vacancies were reported to Jobcentre plus in the last year. Overall the UK labour market is performing well, with total employment rising by nearly 1.7 million since Spring 1997, and unemployment falling in every region in Britain over the past year.</p>

The strategy promotes the extended use of school sports facilities, for example the Sport Partnerships programme is delivering increased out of school hours sports opportunities. Schools benefiting from the &pound;686 million investment in the New Opportunities for PE and Sport and the Space for Sport and the Arts capital programmes are required to demonstrate how the new school sports facilities can be shared with other schools and opened up for community use.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.5/3">The total estimated cost of providing special needs education in 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;3,464,836,204. Of this, it is estimated that &pound;1,717,253,601 will be spent on pupils in mainstream schools, in addition to their normal place funding. An estimated &pound;1,511,349,567 will be spent on pupils in special schools. This includes pupils in maintained special schools and fees for pupils in independent and non-maintained special schools. In addition, an estimated &pound;236,233,036 will be spent in this financial year on centrally funded SEN activities. These include the costs of educational psychology services, assessment and statementing, parent partnership services and the provision of information.</p>

	<p pid=".906W.3/1">I should clarify the situation regarding the Home Childcarers Scheme to which this question refers. The scheme was launched in April 2003 to extend eligibility to tax credits to families using childcare in their own homes. It does not impose a new accreditation requirement on home based carers&mdash;seeking approval is entirely voluntary. Prior to the introduction of this scheme if a family needed to use childcare in their own home it was not possible to have this approved, or to access the childcare element of the Working Families Tax Credit.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.3/2">Currently there are 124 Home Childcarers who have been approved, by Ofsted, to care for children in the children's home. Home Childcarers can be employed by more than one family so the number of families using a Home Childcarer is unknown.</p>

	<p pid=".909W.3/1">In its report, published in July 2002, the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures recommended that the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate should be subject to periodic review, by a body other than the Inspectorate itself. The Committee went on to describe the Inspectorate as a &quot;trustworthy, professional body&quot; and also acknowledged the valuable role that it has played in creating a culture of care in establishments licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.3/2">In the Government's response, published in January 2003, we welcomed the Select Committee's endorsement of the integrity of the Inspectorate and of the important contribution that it has made to the welfare of animals in designated establishments. However, we recognise that public awareness of the valuable job done by the Inspectorate is poor and agree that this needs to be remedied. We have, therefore, concluded that there would be value in the Inspectorate publishing an annual report on its work. The Inspectorate's first annual report will be published in the autumn of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.3/3">As to the periodic review of the Inspectorate, under Section 18 of the 1986 Act, Inspectors are responsible directly to the Secretary of State who is, in turn accountable to Parliament for their work. Inspectors are all medical or veterinary practitioners, as well as being civil servants, and are bound by medical or veterinary codes of professional conduct. In addition, in common with other Home Office staff, the Chief Inspector and members of the Inspectorate are subject to the civil service code and annual performance reviews as part of routine personnel management arrangements. In the light of these comprehensive arrangements, we do not believe that any further form of performance review is necessary. Members of the Inspectorate are highly professional and dedicated and have the complete confidence of Government Ministers.</p>

	<p pid=".909W.6/1">In its report, published in July 2002, the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures recommended that the Government and the scientific community should engage in a systematic and visible search for methods involving the 3Rs&mdash;the replacement of animal use, reduction of the number of animals used and the refinement of the procedures involved to minimise suffering&mdash;in toxicology and that the Government should nominate one department to take the lead on this.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.6/2">In the Government's response to the Select committee's report, published in January 2003, we agreed that a systematic and visible effort is required. As a first step, the Home Office is currently leading a review of the scope for improving the application of the 3Rs and promoting research into alternatives through the Inter-Departmental Group on the 3Rs. Membership of the Inter-Departmental Group is drawn from the Home Office, the Department of Health, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Office of Science and Technology, the Health and Safety Executive and other agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.6/3">The work of the group includes exploration of the case for a United Kingdom centre for research into the 3Rs, which was also recommended by the House of Lords Select Committee, a review of the implementation of the Inter-Departmental Data-Sharing Concordat, announced in August 2000, and the review and revision of the Guidelines on Regulatory Toxicology and Safety Evaluation Studies, published in February 2001, and the statement of principles concerning animal welfare endorsed by the Home Office and other regulatory authorities in 1999&mdash;Annex 1 to the Regulatory Toxicology Guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.6/4">I am currently considering the Inter-Departmental Group's further advice on the proposed United Kingdom centre for research into the 3Rs. I expect to receive the findings of the Inter-Departmental Group on the other two issues shortly and will then consider what further steps are required.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.6/5">Minutes of the meetings of the Inter-Departmental Group are published on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs2/interdept3rs.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs2/interdept3rs.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".910W.2/2">In our response, published in January 2003, the Government noted the Select Committee's view and agreed that replacement should be the ultimate goal. We also explained that we do not believe that it should be made a priority at the expense of reduction or refinement, as these are where progress can be made more quickly. We are instead fully committed to the furtherance of all of the 3Rs&mdash;the replacement of animal use, reduction of the number of animals used and the refinement of the procedures involved to minimise suffering.</p>
	<p pid=".910W.2/3">United Kingdom Government Departments and agencies are involved in a number of specific initiatives in the European Union to develop, validate and incorporate more advanced test methods into regulatory practice. The Government also continue to support the work of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and the head of the Home Office Animals Scientific Procedures Division is now the United Kingdom representative on the ECVAM Scientific Advisory Committee and is contributing to discussions about the future direction of ECVAM's work. The Government also warmly welcome the liaison between ECVAM and its United States counterpart, the Interagency Co-ordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), as a means of achieving greater progress, more quickly and ensuring commitment from more than one economic region. Quick gains cannot necessarily be expected, but we shall continue our efforts to persuade other member states of the importance of progress on the 3Rs.</p>

	<p pid=".911W.2/1">The aim of the stakeholder forum, which was held on 9 January 2004, was to hold informed debate on the recommendations contained in the Animal Procedures Committee's (APC) report entitled &quot;The use of primates under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986&mdash;analysis of current trends with particular reference to regulatory toxicology&quot;. This in turn was to assist preparation of a ministerial response to the issues which the APC has raised.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/2">The Home Office and the APC agreed that, in order to hold a focused debate, attendance at the forum should be limited to organisations with practical experience in the use of primates in scientific procedures, or with other particular expertise relevant to the report's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/3">Consequently, invitees included holders of related project licences issued under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, from both the commercial and academic sectors, as well as individuals from funding and regulatory organisations and other Government Departments. Groups with expertise in alternatives to animal experiments were also invited to send representatives.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/4">It was decided that representatives from animal protection organisations such as Animal Aid and Europeans For Medical Advancement should not be invited to comment through this forum. Places at the forum were limited and the Home Office and the APC primarily wanted to test the technical basis and the practicalities of the recommendations with those experts in the use of primates best placed to contribute to such an exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/5">A report on the forum will be placed on the Home Office and APC websites in the near future, and I would be pleased to receive informed comments from any other source before I further consider all the issues raised.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.5/1">There are 47 countries from which more than 1,000 applications have been made in the United Kingdom between 1999 and 2003. The countries and their numbers are contained in the list below. Of these countries, the United Kingdom has negotiated formal bilateral readmission agreements with Albania and Romania, which are currently being ratified. In addition, negotiations have commenced with Poland and will start shortly with Serbia and Montenegro. The European Commission has been mandated to negotiate Community readmission agreements on behalf of member states with Sri Lanka (negotiations have been concluded and the agreement is being ratified), China, Turkey, Pakistan, Algeria, Albania, Russia and Ukraine. Bilateral and Community readmission agreements set out the process and evidence required for the re-documentation of returning nationals.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.5/2">In addition, where it is our experience that a lack of documentation presents a barrier to removal to particular countries, the United Kingdom is working with the authorities of those countries to facilitate the process of identification and re-documentation of persons. These countries include Sri Lanka, India, Turkey, Somaliland, the Democratic Republic of Congo and China. Since October 2003 the United Kingdom has had a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding in operation governing returns to Afghanistan and very recently agreed with the Coalition Provisional Authority to effect returns to Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.2/1">Section 37 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 gives the police the power to arrest someone carrying an air weapon (whether loaded or not) or an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. There is no requirement for them to obtain a firearms certificate.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/2">Section 39 brings into force a specific ban on the sale, purchase, transfer, acquisition and manufacture of air guns using a self-contained gas-cartridge system. Existing owners will be able to retain possession provided they obtain a firearms certificate for the gun, and have until 30 April 2004 to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/3">We have publicised these measures through &quot;A Guide to the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003&quot;, which was included in the &quot;TOGETHER Campaign Pack&quot; issued on 20 February 2004. Guidance to the police was also issued in Home Office Circular 01/2004, which was sent out on 14 January 2004. Both of these documents and other relevant information are available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/4">In addition, the Home Office has produced a number of posters and leaflets which explain what people must do if they want to keep any guns they already have which use the self-contained gas cartridge system. These have been sent to all police forces for display and further distribution as they see fit. After discussion with the relevant trade organisations they have also been sent to dealers together with a special sticker to put on tins of air gun pellets as a reminder to their customers.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/5">We are continuing to work with the police and other interested parties with a view to securing further local publicity.</p>

	<p pid=".919W.2/1">Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) provide for anyone to be refused entry clearance or leave to enter to the United Kingdom who seeks entry for a purpose not covered by the Rules. The Rules provide for entry for the purpose of private medical treatment but not for NHS treatment. They further provide for an Immigration Office to take account of a Medical Inspector's assessment of the likely course of treatment in deciding whether a person seeking entry for private medical treatment has sufficient means at his disposal.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.2/2">Immigrants who seek NHS treatment after entry to the United Kingdom may be liable to charges for such treatment in accordance with the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989 (S.I. 1989 No.306) as amended. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Health has recently announced proposals to amend these Regulations to remove certain loopholes that have been exploited by health tourists. In particular anyone who has no legal basis to remain in the United Kingdom will be liable to be charged for NHS treatment, except for emergencies or conditions for which they were already receiving treatment before the final determination of their status.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.2/3">The Government have been undertaking a comprehensive interdepartmental review of the issues surrounding immigration and healthcare. The review is ongoing and final decisions remain to be taken.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.2/4">As announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, <i>Official Report</i>, 23 February 2004, columns 23&ndash;25), from 1 May the Government will be requiring workers from the European Union (EU) accession countries (except Malta and Cyprus) to register with the Home Office. In accordance with EU Regulations, any resident of an EU member state will be entitled to receive free of charge treatment for which the need arises during a visit to the United Kingdom&mdash;the cost is met by their home country. But to be fully exempt from charges for routine hospital treatment for a pre-existing condition, patients from elsewhere in the EU will need to prove&mdash;just as for any other overseas visitor&mdash;that they meet one of the exemption criteria in the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations, for example the exemption for those employed in the United Kingdom. This will apply to registered workers from the accession states. The Government will continue to take every step to ensure that our benefit and healthcare system is not open to abuse.</p>

	<p pid=".920W.2/2">The audit of Kent county council's claims relating to asylum support costs is the responsibility of the District Auditor. Audit work on the claim for 2002&ndash;03 was delayed initially by work required to finalise the lists of asylum seekers eligible for support during the year. The due date for the completion of the 2002&ndash;03 audit has been set at 31 March 2004. At present the council are also investigating the exact amount of the outstanding balance for 2002&ndash;03 and this may also delay the completion of the audit.</p>
	<p pid=".920W.2/3">The instructions for 2003&ndash;04 relating to Adults and Families were published in June 2003. The instructions for Unaccompanied Asylum Seeker Children (UASC) were published in January 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".920W.2/4">The Home Office reimburses local councils for asylum support costs via a series of interim payments during the year. Kent county council submitted four interim claims in 2002&ndash;03 and three for the year to date in 2003&ndash;04. These have all been paid. The outstanding balance for 2002&ndash;03 is subject to investigation as mentioned above. If it is agreed that a significant amount has not been covered by the interim claims in 2002&ndash;03 then the Home Office is prepared to make a further payment against the final audited claim.</p>
