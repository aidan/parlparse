	<p pid="a.452W.7/35">The ODA salary bands reflect the need to recruit and retain the expertise needed to deliver this unique, complex, and time limited challenge. The challenge of the ODA is without precedent and is one of the biggest jobs in the construction industry. Given the fixed deadline and the need for specialist skills in engineering, design, planning, construction, project management and other specialist areas, the ODA has had to recruit expertise most often found in the commercial sector. Rates of pay are therefore reflective of this and comparable with industry levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.460W.4/20">Total creative industries exports include exports of services in the following sectors: 'advertising', 'architecture', 'art and antiques', 'design', 'video, film and photography', 'music and the visual and performing arts', 'publishing', 'software, computer games and electronic publishing' and 'radio and TV'. Exports for the 'crafts' and 'designer fashion' sectors are excluded as consistent data is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.4/21">The 'software, computer games and electronic publishing' sector comprises all firms classified in official business data under 'publishing of software', 'other software consultancy and supply' or 'reproduction of computer media' (only 25 per cent. of this class is included). Games development firms likely represent only a small proportion of this sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.465W.2/2">District councils have been responsible for the statutory concessionary travel scheme since its introduction in 2000. This is consistent with their historic role in licensing bus services prior to deregulation, and their work in other areas such as taxi licensing.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/3">The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 contains powers allowing Ministers, subject to future consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, to make secondary legislation which would transfer concessionary travel responsibilities from lower tier (district councils) to higher tier authorities (county councils). It would not have been prudent to make such a radical change less than a year before the introduction of the new England-wide statutory minimum concession from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>, particularly when those with existing responsibility for concessionary travel were in the process of issuing over six million new passes to a tight timetable.</p>

This has a number of programmes including new routes to around 500 schools, building on the successful Links to Schools programme. In addition, &pound;18.4 million of Government funding since 2005 has provided 295 Links to Schools which link over 600 schools and forms part of the National Cycle Network (NCN).</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.8/2">&pound;47 million has also been allocated on extending the Cycling Demonstration Towns (CDT) programme to up to 17 towns including a large city. The outcome of the bidding process for new CDTs is due to be announced later this year.

	<p pid="a.466W.8/3">Local authorities provide on and off road cycle facilities such as cycle tracks and cycle lanes, using their Local Transport Plan (LTP) Integrated Transport Block grant from the DfT (which covers schemes costing less than &pound;5 million and includes such cycle schemes) plus their own funding, the DfT Integrated Transport Block grant to local authorities is &pound;372 million for 2008-09. The Department has encouraged local authorities to develop a cycling strategy as part of the LTP process from 2006 to 2011. It is for local authorities to determine the development of the local cycle networks as part of that strategy. Sustrans, who have developed the NGN, then work with local authorities to link the local networks to it. The Department is also providing &pound;2.5 billion in 2008-09 to the Mayor of London through a Total Transport grant. The Mayor is responsible for determining how much is spent on cycling and the development of cycle networks in London.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.9/1">The Department uses a framework called the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) to undertake cost-benefit analysis of schemes relating to all transport modes including light rail. The Department aims to consider all impacts of transport schemes, including those listed, when undertaking cost-benefit analysis. No definitive set of weights are applied within this framework, with the contribution of each of these factors varying according to the specific circumstances of the scheme. For example, the significance of congestion relief to the assessment of schemes in areas experiencing high delays will tend to be greater than schemes in areas experiencing few delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.9/2">To ensure consistency across schemes, where possible, impacts are converted into monetary equivalents using a common set of values. This allows a variety of impacts to be aggregated and compared. In practise, the weight attached will depend on the size of impact that a scheme will have on each factor and the value attached to these impacts. Where available, standard values are used to value impacts, e.g. carbon emissions are valued at the standard cost of carbon issued by DEFRA.</p>

	<p pid="a.487W.3/24">Under European Community law, bluetongue vaccination can only be carried out in a protection zone. Once vaccination is progressing broadly across the protection zone, the intention is to extend or modify the zone in order to permit further vaccination, allowing a phased approach as vaccine comes on-stream. However, when vaccine first becomes available from May, it could initially be necessary to limit vaccine availability within the protection zone in accordance with the supply of vaccine and the epidemiological situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.3/25">Although we have made no formal estimate of likely take-up of vaccine, the advice of industry stakeholders is that take-up will be high in a voluntary scheme, especially if an active approach is taken to promoting vaccination. As individual keepers will be responsible for the costs of vaccination, our aim, in close collaboration with a core group of industry stakeholders, has been to develop a vaccination programme which will reduce the cost of vaccination to a minimum by using existing delivery chains and reducing regulatory burdens in order to encourage maximum participation.</p>

	<p pid="a.489W.2/1">Any proposal for amendments to the time limit given in paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the Caravan Sites and Control Development Act 1960 would require new primary legislation. DEFRA has no plans for any such legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/2">DEFRA and Natural England, who now deal with the issue of exemption certificates under the 1960 Act, are updating, and consolidating into a single document, the existing guidance on applications for exemption certificates for both caravans and camping. We have consulted the devolved administrations and the major camping and caravanning organisations, including the Association of Caravan and Camping Exempted Organisations, about the new document.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/3">The document reiterates previous guidance on the time limit for paragraph 6 exemptions&mdash;consisting of a maximum of five periods of 24 hours commencing when the first caravan is stationed on the rally site.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/4">Exempted organisations which, prior to any exempted rally, wish to have a single caravan on the rally site to assist with the setting up of an event may rely on the additional exemption under paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 of the 1960 Act. This provides that a site licence is not required for the use of land by a person travelling with a caravan for not more than two nights. The exemption is subject to the condition that only one caravan is allowed and the total number of days in any twelve month period on which a caravan was stationed anywhere on the site, or any adjoining land in the same ownership, cannot exceed 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/5">DEFRA and Natural England are considering representations from the major camping and caravan organisations. We expect to finalise the single guidance document by the summer of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/6">There are over 300 organisations who hold exemption certificates under paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 of the 1960 Act, so it is not practical to list them. A list of the organisations is publicly available on the Natural England website.</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.2/1">DEFRA is monitoring annual changes in household energy consumption, by fuel, and hence the corresponding CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.2/2">Against a long-term trend of rising gas consumption, over the period 2004-06, consumption of gas by household consumers fell by over 8 per cent. Of this, possibly up to half could be attributed to higher prices; weather changes had little effect. Improved energy efficiency for heating, particularly higher levels of insulation (installed via the Energy Efficiency Commitment) and more efficient boilers (required by Building Regulations), is likely to have contributed to the remaining reduction of gas, the principal heating fuel. However, more detailed analysis is required to quantify this effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.8/2">The Environment Agency authorises waste types that are appropriate for landfilling but does not normally authorise individual and specific waste sources. The Environment Agency is therefore not able to state categorically which of 1,500-plus operational and closed landfill sites in England and Wales have received chemical waste from Monsanto.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.8/3">Consignment notes held by waste management facilities would record the source of the waste. Prior to 2005, the Environment Agency was sent copies of these consignment notes, but the cost of extracting the required information from these records would be disproportionate. The Environment Agency retains these records for four years so would not be able to provide a full account of wastes deposited by Monsanto even if data were readily available.</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.0/1">The amount of municipal waste per person sent to landfill by local authorities with a waste disposal duty in England are shown in the following table. These data are reported annually to DEFRA by local authorities through WasteDataFlow (for 2004-5 onwards) and through the Municipal Waste Management Survey for earlier years. 2004-5 was a pilot year for WasteDataFlow and therefore complete data are not available. Data for 1997-8 are not available at individual local authority level.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.0/2">Most municipal waste (an average of around 87 per cent. in England) is from household sources. However, some waste sent to landfills is from non-municipal sources such as the commercial, industrial and construction sectors, and this is not included in these figures. The estimates for each local authority represent the amount which is collected in their area and then sent for disposal in landfill regardless of the landfill site's location.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.0/3">Population estimates for each local authority for each year are those published by the Office for National Statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.510W.15/2">Armed forces personnel can receive a wide range of medical treatment, from life-saving care on the battlefield and in field hospitals, through in-patient treatment in NHS hospitals in the UK, to out-patient care at numerous military primary care facilities across the UK and overseas, including regional rehabilitation and mental health facilities. It follows from this that complaints about medical treatment can be made at a number of levels. For patients treated in a NHS hospital the complaint will be made to, and dealt with by, the operating NHS trust. As military patients can be treated in any NHS hospital, details of all complaints could be obtained only by contacting each NHS trust in the UK individually, and this could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Otherwise, providing there are no former owner considerations under the &quot;Crichel Down&quot; rules, it is usual MOD policy to sell surplus land and property on the open market, in accordance with Treasury guidelines, using competition to achieve the best price. In order to maximise value, we will consult with the local planning authority and other stakeholders to achieve the optimum planning position for the site particularly where there is redevelopment potential, such as for housing or commercial use.</p>

Other surplus SFA in the UK is disposed of in accordance with Treasury guidelines at market value. Where the opportunity exists for a bulk sale of SFA at market value, the MOD will discuss the way forward with the appropriate local authorities, registered social landlords and, in Scotland, the Scottish Executive.</p>

	<p pid="a.526W.0/2">All British projects in Colombia, as elsewhere, undergo rigorous evaluation before funding is agreed, in areas such as value for money and effectiveness of implementing partners; and carefully monitored whilst projects are under way in terms of proper use of funds, achievement of objectives and outputs. UK staff continually and scrupulously supervise the use of British resources in Colombia to ensure that the highest operational, ethical and human rights standards are maintained in our human rights and counter narcotics work.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/3">We evaluate that UK assistance is having a positive effect on the issues of most concern in Colombia. The UK has played a key role in working to institutionalise respect for human rights in the Colombian armed forces, so that they operate by the same high standards we demand of our own armed forces. Our counter-narcotics work is tightly focused on helping the Colombians tackle drugs production, trafficking organisations and networks. Our training in humanitarian demining has improved the Colombian Government's ability to remove the landmines that illegal armed groups place to harm innocent civilians.</p>

	<p pid="a.535W.3/1">Since 2003, the Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated &pound;7.75 million to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which leads the international response to the Iraqi refugee situation. Of this, &pound; 3 million has been committed for 2008. DFID has not earmarked contributions to UNHCR for specific countries, but has supported UNHCR's annual Iraq situation appeals. These appeals focus primarily on Jordan, Syria and Iraq, but also cover operations in Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Our support helps UNHCR provide assistance to Iraqi refugees (including food, cash assistance, legal aid and school materials) and support to health and education systems in countries that have taken in large numbers of people displaced from Iraq. DFID's contributions to UNHCR form part of our overall humanitarian assistance allocation for Iraq, totalling &pound;147 million since 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.3/2">The UK, as a major contributor to the European Commission (EC), has also supported the EC's programmes in Jordan and Syria. Last year, the EC allocated &euro;50 million in support of Iraqi refugees in the middle east region. This included an additional &euro;9 million to their ongoing health sector modernisation project in Syria. This money will strengthen health services in areas with large Iraqi populations. In Jordan, the EC has allocated &euro;26.7 million in budget support, which will build capacity in the Jordanian education sector to accommodate Iraqi refugee children.</p>

	<p pid="a.548W.8/1">Jobseeker's allowance is designed to ensure that all jobseekers take every necessary step to get into work, it is not payable to anyone who has, without good cause, failed to take up a reasonable opportunity of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.548W.8/2">Travelling time is taken into account in deciding whether there is good cause. After the first 13 weeks of entitlement to jobseeker's allowance, reasonable travelling time is normally one and a half hours or less each way. However, a person's health or caring responsibilities will be taken into account in determining whether the time it would take to travel to work is unreasonable. This applies to all jobseekers, including those who are lone parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.549W.2/1">In May 2006, the Government announced a rolling deregulatory review with the aim of making the private pensions regulatory framework simpler and less burdensome. The current Pensions Bill includes, for example, measures to reduce the statutory cap which applies to the revaluation of deferred pension rights from 5 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. for all defined benefit rights which build up after the change is introduced. That change could potentially provide significant savings for all defined benefit pension schemes. We are taking forward other changes to ease the burden on all defined benefit schemes in secondary legislation and/or guidance, and would welcome further specific proposals for change.</p>

We work in partnership with other public sector organisations, particularly in the family justice system as well as with third sector and private companies who we either commission services from or work together with on specific projects and programmes. We regularly attend national and local Family Justice Councils, and all Local Safeguarding Children Boards in England. We have many active partnerships with organisations to develop joint policies or service agreements. Cafcass has an active Young Peoples Board, with membership drawn from children and young people who are either current or past service users. We are intending to extend this level of participation in the next financial year to focus on adult participation, building on the outcomes of focus groups we have held this year. Cafcass is proud of the high level of partnership working carried out throughout the organisation, and we aim to continue this policy. This includes a widely advertised open Board meeting every year, held in a different English city on each occasion.</p>

This includes &pound;30 million for acute wards, particularly for women service users. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-05">5 February</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a renewed commitment in the House to eradicate mixed-sex accommodation in mental health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.5/3">The environment plays one part in ensuring safety; equally important are policies, procedures and training. We will be publishing guidance for mental health trusts on sexual safety later this year, as part of the revised management of violence guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.5/4">We are also improving advocacy services to make sure that service users can more easily bring up issues relating to their personal safety.</p>
