Indeed they simply draw on already existing statistics, such as the Scottish Government's GERS result that Scotland had a fiscal deficit of &#163;11.1 billion in 2007-08. Such analysis clearly underlines how Scotland's economic prosperity is best safeguarded as being at the heart of the UK.</p>

While local authorities monitor cleanliness through the National Indicator 195 (improved street and environmental cleanliness), DEFRA does not ask authorities to specifically report on the cleanliness of their beaches. This makes it difficult to assess whether or not beaches in general are achieving higher levels of cleanliness. Through the Blue Flag Beach Award scheme, administered by DEFRA's delivery partner Keep Britain Tidy, beaches are assessed for litter, amongst other indicators.

	<p pid="d.609W.6/1">Designations of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), by necessity, must be based on science to identify the case for conserving habitats, flora and fauna in accordance with the provisions set out in the Marine and Coastal Access Act. The Government have established an independent Science Advisory Panel who will advise both the regional projects and Government on the science. In our statement of <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-11">11 March</phrase> to Parliament, the Government set out the seven principles of ecological coherence it will apply. The development of the ecological guidance to be issued by the SNCBs is being informed by research that has been subject to peer review.</p>
	<p pid="d.609W.6/2">It will be the responsibility of the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies, working with four regional stakeholder projects, to set out the rationale in its advice to Government on where to create MCZs and the conservation objectives to be achieved. A key part of this will involve assembling evidence, including scientific and socio-economic data. We consider that the concept of Good Environmental Status-which will be defined through implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive-should guide the minimum level acceptable for MCZ objectives, as far as that is an appropriate measure for a site-based conservation tool. Government expect that scientific uncertainty will be explicitly recognised in that advice. For example, our understanding of the connectivity principle is still evolving and while not unimportant it will be a secondary consideration.</p>
	<p pid="d.609W.6/3">There will be choices to be made, for example between replicate features, or site management measures, or how to support both development and conservation policies. We expect socio-economic considerations to be taken into account at all stages to inform these choices. These considerations will include opportunity costs. The criteria to be applied will be ones that provide confidence that decisions will result in an ecologically coherent network that is well supported, understood and can be managed to contribute to our vision for clean, healthy, safe, productive, and biologically diverse oceans and seas.</p>

This sets out the principles of a good recycling service, one of which is that local authorities should collect as many materials for recycling as possible and then explain clearly what happens to them.</p>
	<p pid="d.611W.2/4">WRAP is working with the Regional Development Agency, Advantage West Midlands, to deliver a &#163;5.4 million programme to increase collections of waste material, develop recycling infrastructure and increase the use of recycled materials. The support will be a mixture of capital funding and business development support.</p>

However, this reduction in receipts in 1 Parliament street is expected to be offset to a significant extent by an expected increase in receipts in other venues, such as Moncrieff's and the private dining rooms in the Palace. On the basis of historical figures, Bellamy's bar would be expected to make an operating loss in the region of &#163;10,000 in 2010-11, while the Astor Suite would be expected to contribute an operating surplus of some &#163;80,000.

	<p pid="d.644W.0/5">A copy of the PQQ and the Special Notices and Instructions will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.644W.0/6">The PQQ sought details on such matters as technical capability, financial standing, ownership and company structures. Technical, financial and security matters were considered before a company was invited to tender for the requirement. This assessment was informed by reference to company specific reports procured from a reputable private sector business information supplier. Companies invited to tender for the contract were taken from a list of &quot;Approved Defence Contractors&quot; and, where necessary, were afforded provisional List-X Status by the Defence Procurement Agency for the purposes of complying with the Security Aspects of the tender bidding process.</p>
	<p pid="d.644W.0/7">The tender assessment was conducted by appropriate Royal Navy, Royal Fleet Auxiliary and civilian subject matter experts. The results of these assessments were collated and considered by a Tender Assessment Panel chaired by a senior commercial officer which recommended the award decision based on the evidence of the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.644W.0/8">After the tendering process was complete, an agreement on the detailed handling of sensitive material was reached with the successful bidder, implementing the more general security requirements set out in the contract documents. This agreement recognised that some sensitive information would need to be disclosed to suppliers of services in sufficient time to enable those services to be provided in a timely manner.</p>

	<p pid="d.645W.2/1">I refer the hon. Member to the written ministerial statement I made on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-25">25 March 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-03-25.54"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 54-55WS</phrase>. Of the seven planned Astute class submarines, the first four boats have been ordered. Boat one (Astute) is currently undergoing an extensive programme of sea trials while boats two to four (Ambush, Artful, and Audacious) are in various stages of construction. We have decided to proceed with the initial build work on boat five and to order the long lead items for boat six. The delivery timetable for the class is currently being re-baselined.</p>
	<p pid="d.645W.2/2">We are continuing to target an in-service date for the first Trident successor submarine of 2024, as set out in the White Paper 'The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent' (Cm6994). The precise delivery schedule will be determined at Main Gate, currently scheduled for 2014.</p>
	<p pid="d.645W.2/3">The Ministry of Defence and industry are evaluating the lessons from the first boats in the Astute programme and will ensure that there is appropriate sequencing between the Astute and successor programmes to ensure that continuous at sea deterrence can be maintained. We do not expect delays in the Astute programme to affect the timetable for the delivery of the Trident successor submarines.</p>

	<p pid="d.650W.5/1">For 2008-09, for prison establishments managed by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), the average cost per prisoner in an &quot;adult&quot; prison (for this purpose adult is over 21 years) was &#163;39,600 and in a young offender institution was &#163;53,400.</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.5/2">The above average costs comprise the expenditure on public and private prisons (as recorded in the NOMS agency annual report and accounts), increased by an apportionment of relevant costs borne centrally and in the regions by NOMS. This involves some estimation. In addition, expenditure met centrally by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) is included. The figures do not include the cost of prisoners held in police or court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. Health and Education). The prisoner escort service costs are included. Where the costs of young people are recharged by NOMS to the YJB, expenditure is shown gross and not reduced by income from the YJB. Where a site includes adults and prisoners under 21, costs are allocated to the major use.</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.5/3">Secure training centres and secure children's homes, the responsibility of the YJB, also fall into the under 21 years category.

Where a claim for costs in relation to any aspect of the conduct of the poll does not satisfy this statutory test then it would not be met. Information about whether this happened in respect of the costs of the count process specifically in relation to any of the 569 claims from returning officers in England and Wales in 2005 could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

	<p pid="d.657W.2/1">The available information is provided in the following table. The figures shown in the table relate solely to cases recorded on the Ministry of Justice courts proceedings database where an offence of Human trafficking or Drug trafficking was the principal offence for which the offender was sentenced and where the confiscation order was made at the point of sentence. It is possible that a confiscation order will be made in a separate court appearance following sentence. These cases are not included in this answer so it is possible the true number of confiscation orders is higher than presented here.</p>

	<p pid="d.662W.2/1">The tables show the numbers of prisoners, by month and by index offence, who have absconded from, or failed to return to Ford prison between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December 2009</phrase>. No prisoner has been classified as escaping from Ford over this time period.</p>
	<p pid="d.662W.2/2">Prisoners who escape or fail to return from temporary release are usually re-captured quickly and returned to a closed prison. Currently 96 per cent. of all prisoners who abscond are returned to custody. Both types of unlawful absence from the prison are criminal offences and prisons, police and the Crown Prosecution Service work together to pursue such crimes through the courts where this is appropriate. Alternatively, the prisoner may be dealt with by way of internal adjudication and may receive additional days in prison as a result of this. Details of the sanctions imposed are not held centrally and could only be obtained by identifying and contacting each closed prison where a former prisoner from Ford had been returned; this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.662W.2/3">While details of the terms of custodial sentence are held centrally this could only be provided by accessing each record manually which would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.662W.2/4">Absconds and temporary release failures have been very successfully reduced year on year. Last year, to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, was the lowest level of absconds since central records began. The current year, to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>, is forecast to produce an even lower level of absconding, both nationally across England and Wales, and at Ford.</p>
	<p pid="d.662W.2/5">The following table shows the number of absconds from HMP Ford over the last 12 years. With one month remaining in the year, the position at Ford reflects the national picture and shows that this year is set to be the lowest level of absconds at the prison on record.</p>

	<p pid="d.667W.0/100">The definition of a reoffence differs between adults and juveniles. For adults, any offence within a year of release from custody or commencement of a court order, which is proven by court conviction within 18 months of release, is counted as a reoffence. For juveniles released from custody or commencing a non-custodial court disposal or given an out-of-court disposal, an offence proven by court conviction or a caution within the same time period is counted as a reoffence. For this reasons the adult and juvenile reoffending rates are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="d.670W.2/2">The counselling, assessment, referral, advice and throughcare service (CARATs) is the key non-clinical gateway drug treatment service in prisons for prisoners aged over 18. Young people's substance misuse services (YPSMS) provides a similar service for all young people (aged 15-18) in custody.</p>
	<p pid="d.670W.2/3">The following tables shows the number of initial assessments carried out by CARATs and YPSMS in each young offender institution (YOI) for the full financial years since 2002-03 (YPSMS data are only available from 2005-06). This gives an indication of the number of adults and young people engaged with drug treatment services in YOIs, although the level of engagement will vary according to individuals' needs. It is not possible to break down these figures by age.</p>
	<p pid="d.670W.2/4">Figures have been drawn from National Offender Management Service administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. The data are not subject to audit.</p>

	<p pid="d.674W.3/1">In March 2010, as part of the Safe and Confident Neighbourhoods Strategy, the Government announced their intention to work with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities to develop the '101' number as a national non-emergency number for contacting the police. This will enable the public to report non-emergency crime and antisocial behaviour concerns and contact their local police force, using the same three-digit telephone number, wherever they live in England and Wales. We intend a national police non-emergency number to be in place by March 2012, subject to further work on the procurement of a suitable infrastructure which provides value for money for the police service, Government and the public.</p>
	<p pid="d.674W.3/2">The Home Office is currently committed to funding the existing contract for the '101' number until March 2011. In 2010-11, this will be approximately &#163;950,000. Any future funding will be subject to the next comprehensive spending review.</p>

	<p pid="d.676W.5/2">The Government take the prevention of access to such images very seriously. We believe that Government should take all effective measures, such as the use of criteria in contracts, to ensure that Departments only buy internet services from suppliers that take the Internet Watch Foundation list. The changes to the OGC conditions to ensure that suppliers do this, as set out in their recent Procurement Policy Note, should be used by Departments to help them select their suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="d.677W.3/4">Those detainees said to be on hunger strike at Yarl's Wood were refusing meals from the centre's canteen, but they were buying food from the centre's shop and vending machines and having food delivered by visitors. They were all also drinking.</p>
	<p pid="d.677W.3/5">There is a well-publicised procedure in every immigration removal centre to enable detainees to complain about any aspect of their detention or care within the centre. There were no records of complaints received from any of the women involved at the start of the protest. Concerns which have since been raised are being addressed.</p>
	<p pid="d.677W.3/6">We only record information on detainees who have missed four consecutive meals, excluding breakfast. Such detainees miss meals for a number of reasons, including fasting due to their religious faith. We do not record the number who state they are refusing food in protest at a particular issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.677W.3/7">All those who miss meals are monitored closely by the centre, including healthcare, where they will receive advice on diet and welfare issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.677W.3/8">The UK Border Agency and the centre management engage closely with such detainees to understand the reason for them missing meals and to seek to resolve any underlying problems.</p>

	<p pid="d.678W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-08">8 March 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/2">Manchester Central comes within the Manchester Community Safety Partnership (CSP). Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March 2010</phrase>, CSPs were referred to as Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRP). The available statistical information therefore relates to the Manchester CSP.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/3">In terms of police recorded crime in the Manchester CSP, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 18 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/4" class="indent">Violence against the person-down 2 per cent. (down 5 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/5" class="indent">Sexual offences-down 10 per cent. (down 10 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/6" class="indent">Robbery-down 43 per cent. (down 16 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/7" class="indent">Burglary-down 29 per cent. (up 5 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/8" class="indent">Offences against vehicles-down 35 per cent. (down 18 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/9" class="indent">Other theft offences-down 12 per cent. (up 2 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/10" class="indent">Criminal damage-down 20 per cent. (down 11 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/11" class="indent">Drug offences-up 151 per cent. (up 3 per cent. in last year) (there has been increased recording of drug offences which is mainly attributable to the increased use of police powers to issue cannabis warnings).</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/12">Data prior to 2002-03 is not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at CSP level is available prior to 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/13">Manchester CSP is covered by Metropolitan, North Manchester, South Manchester and Trafford basic command units, which had a total of 2,167 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has decreased by 74 since 2003. Comparisons with 1997 at BCU level are not available. There were 218 police community support officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase> while there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/14">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). These are now referred to as Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs).</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/15">The Manchester CSP has brought new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/16">Neighbourhood Police Teams are in place and the Manchester Central constituency is served by a number of such teams from the Greater Manchester police's North Manchester and Metropolitan Divisions. Neighbourhood policing is a crucial partnership with the public and is helping to reduce crime and enhance community confidence in the police. The visible policing presence is augmented by information on neighbourhood policing in each area which is available on the internet. None of this was in place in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/17">All CSPs, including Manchester, are putting in place minimum standards to tackle antisocial behaviour (ASB). By tackling ASB and providing support for victims, these will help to reduce local perceptions of ASB and improve public confidence. This was not in place in 1997. In addition, before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour whereas there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and Designated Public Places Orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Manchester is in the top 50 national priority areas for alcohol-related harm.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/18">The effects of the Department's policies on crime, antisocial behaviour, policing, and night time economy management have been consistently positive and instrumental in supporting the city centre's development as a safer, more popular and vibrant place to visit.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/19">Detailed and comprehensive analysis is being used by Manchester, along with specific action plans to ensure reductions in serious violent crime. The Manchester Violent Gang Board has recently been commended for their approach to the issues within Manchester and have been given a Green Flag by the Audit commission for their work in relation to Guns and Gangs. Gun crime is down significantly-Greater Manchester Police's Xcalibre Operations have had notable success in targeting the gang culture and securing convictions against gang leaders and members. Firearms discharges have reduced in Manchester over the last three years. This is helping to improve safety in Manchester Central.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/20">Since 1997 a key element of Home Office policy in addressing domestic violence has been driven through the Home Office-led Cross-Government National Domestic Violence Delivery Plan. This includes the Specialist Domestic Violence Court programme (Manchester gained accreditation in 2008). It also includes Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs), the Government's approach to identified high risk victims of domestic violence. Manchester is developing three MARACs covering all three Police Divisions. Victims of domestic violence are supported by Independent Domestic Violence Advisers (IDVAs)-trained specialists who provide a service to victims who are at high risk of harm which have been shown to decrease victimisation. Manchester now has 10 IDVAs.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/21">Since 1997 a key element of Home Office policy in addressing sexual violence has been driven through the delivery of the Home Office-led Cross-Government Action Plan on Sexual Violence and Abuse which aims to increase access to health and support services for victims; improve the response of the criminal justice system for victims, and to prevent sexual violence in the first place. This has led to expanded services such as Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) and Independent Sexual Violence Advisers (ISVAs) to improve victim care. Home Office has supported the continued development of St. Mary's SARC in Manchester and the development of an ISVA service at the centre.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/22">Manchester is a recipient of Youth Crime Action Plan funding and has rolled out a programme of initiatives designed to tackle Youth Crime. Manchester also receives funding from the Tackling Knives Action Programme and has engaged in a number of enforcement and educational activities to tackle and deter young people from involvement in all forms of serious youth violence. These include Safer Schools Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/23">The drug treatment system in Manchester has developed by means of joint planning and commissioning of services over many years. The introduction of national drug strategy and the establishment of pooled treatment budget arrangements in 2001-02 have done much to formalise and enhance partnership working. This has resulted in the development of an integrated treatment system. Manchester has an effective Drugs Intervention Programme (DIP).</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/24">Manchester is achieving significant reductions in acquisitive crime, but recognises that there are still challenges, particularly in tackling issues such as domestic burglary and robbery. Robust plans are in place to tackle these. There is a real focus on student safety and Manchester has developed a Student Safety Business Model. Manchester is a Vigilance area and Safer Homes Fund area which are Home Office programmes aimed at tackling acquisitive crime, particularly burglary and robbery. Greater Manchester Police's Operation Storm has had real success in recent reductions in domestic burglary in particular.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.8/25">From <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>, CSPs are required to formulate and implement a strategy &quot;to reduce re-offending&quot;. One of Manchester's priorities includes reducing the offending of prolific and priority offenders and the Partnership is currently exceeding the targets set in the Local Area Agreement. Manchester will shortly introduce Integrated Offender Management (IOM) based on the Greater Manchester Spotlight model and will have three co-located IOM Teams covering the City. This will manage the most serious offenders including those responsible for acquisitive crime, and violent and domestic violence offences.</p>

	<p pid="d.681W.2/1">Great Grimsby comes within the North East Lincolnshire community safety partnership (CSP). Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March 2010</phrase>, CSPs were referred to as crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRP). The following statistical information therefore relates to the North East Lincolnshire CSP area.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/2">In terms of police recorded crime in the North East Lincolnshire CSP, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 26 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/3" class="indent">Violence against the person-up 16 per cent. (down 1 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/4" class="indent">Sexual offences-down 30 per cent. (up 8 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/5" class="indent">Robbery-down 33 per cent. (down 17 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/6" class="indent">Burglary-down 38 per cent. (down 5 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/7" class="indent">Offences against vehicles-down 62 per cent. (down 41 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/8" class="indent">Other theft offences-down 12 per cent. (up 3 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/9" class="indent">Criminal damage-down 17 per cent. (down 18 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/10" class="indent">Drug offences-up 16 per cent. (down 26 per cent. in last year) (there has been increased recording of drug offences which is mainly attributable to the increased use of police powers to issue cannabis warnings).</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/11">Data prior to 2002-03 are not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at CSP level are available prior to 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/12">North East Lincolnshire basic command unit had 263 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has decreased by 115 since 2003. Comparisons with 1997 for North East Lincolnshire BCU are not available. There were 49 police community support officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase> while there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/13">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP)-now commonly known as a CSP (community safety partnership). The CSP (Safer Communities North East Lincolnshire) has brought new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/14">The CSP paved the way for a number of community safety initiatives which have benefited Great Grimsby. North East Lincolnshire has received funding under the Home Office Crime Reduction programme and successor initiatives including the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund and the Basic Command Unit Fund. It has also benefited from other targeted Home Office funding streams which support work on drugs and alcohol harm reduction, domestic abuse, neighbourhood crime and justice, and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/15">The Home Office Partnership Support programme helped review CSP delivery structures and the future strategic development of the district's CCTV system. North East Lincolnshire is currently in receipt of funding from the Vigilance programme which is helping to accelerate the development and implementation of integrated offender management (IOM). This is seen as the next step in achieving further sustainable reductions in crime across the district. A multi-agency event on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-17">17 March 2010</phrase> marked the formal launch of IOM in North East Lincolnshire.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/16">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and designated public places orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/17">North East Lincolnshire's CSP and wider partnership approach has been recognised nationally as effective practice. For example, the delivery of its Family Intervention programme, which joins-up the resources of several government departments, and its work on reducing antisocial behaviour and providing visible neighbourhood justice. In 2009, Safer and Stronger Communities North East Lincolnshire won the prestigious Home Office Tilley Award for its Sport Lincs initiative.</p>

	<p pid="d.682W.2/12">Hackney basic command unit had 757 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>.

	<p pid="d.682W.2/13" class="italic"> Funding</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/14">The borough is funded well through central streams and has acquired a large block of funding (&#163;600,000) from the area-based grant beyond the element usually provided via HO crime allocations.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/15">Hackney is in the top 50 national Alcohol Strategy Delivery Programmes and has received &#163;25,000 for targeted enforcement; multi-agency NTE work; enforcement training; guidance on the use of tools.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/16">In 2009-10, Hackney is in receipt of &#163;54,000 from CLG to tackle ASB plus a further &#163;12,000 to train ASB Resident Champions and undertake a resident-led ASB project. The borough also gets &#163;70,000 from Home Office as one of the country's Neighbourhood Crime and Justice Pioneer areas, substantial monies as part of DCSF's Youth Crime Action Plan (YCAP) areas and further small pots of funding from Home Office for ASB victims and witness support, and for local ASB surveys.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/17" class="italic"> Hackney Safer Greener Partnership</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/18">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a crime and disorder reduction partnership-CDRP (now called CSPs). The partnership has brought new ways of working in a cross-cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/19">Priority issues for the borough are:</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/20" class="indent">Serious violence</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/21" class="indent">Youth violence</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/22" class="indent">Community engagement and perceptions</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/23">The Area Assessment published in October 2009 found local partners' approach to tackling crime in Hackney is strong and is delivering good results. Hackney is effectively sustaining the significant longer term reductions already achieved.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/24">Incidents of knife and gun-related crime, as well as antisocial behaviour, have also decreased. It found local partners are using a number of ways to tackle crime. Public services in Hackney have used safer neighbourhood offices to collocate staff who focus on enforcement activity and to tackle drug-related crime, a dedicated drugs squad has been set up. Drug misuse has fallen at a faster rate than other areas of London. Antisocial behaviour and associated youth crime are being effectively tackled. Youth crime has decreased across the borough and concerns about antisocial behaviour have also decreased. Overall, children and young people's safety is promoted well in Hackney.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/25">The assessment also found Hackney tackles weapon and gang crime through a variety of approaches that aim to divert and motivate young people away from crime through community payback schemes; sport and education, Friday and Saturday evening youth provision, parenting programmes and finding alternatives to school exclusions.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/26" class="italic"> Drug- related offending</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/27">To tackle drug-related crime a dedicated drugs squad has been set up. This has resulted in significant reductions in drug-related crime. Other initiatives include the Diamond project aimed at reducing reoffending and a dedicated police officer working with Mind, a mental health charity, to work with and support those who have mental health issues and commit crime. As a result of these projects, drug misuse has fallen at a faster rate than other areas of London.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/28">Hackney is funded by the HO as an 'intensive' Drug Intervention Programme (DIP) area enabling it to tackle drug-related offending through a range of 'intensive' DIP applications including drug-testing on arrest and restriction on bail provisions allowing more offenders to be targeted, steered into treatment and out of a life of crime. Hackney's DIP budget for 2009-10 is &#163;1,536,227and for 2010-11 is &#163;1,471,088 (4 per cent. reduction). The operation of DIP in Hackney in 2008-09 saw over 2,800 arrestees tested (final figures for 2009-10 are not yet available). 178 were referred into and started structured treatment from DIP-work is being done to improve this referral route into treatment.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/29" class="italic"> Violent crime</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/30">Hackney saw a 20 per cent. reduction in grievous bodily harm incidents, 50 per cent. reduction in the number of murders and an overall reduction of 3.4 per cent. in rape allegations during 2006-07 in comparison with 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/31" class="italic"> Antisocial behaviour and neighbourhood policing</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/32">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and designated public places orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/33">37.6 per cent. of residents perceive ASB to be a problem (30th out of the 33 London local authorities). The borough is particularly worse than average for 'noisy neighbours/loud parties', 'rubbish and litter lying around' and 'people using or dealing drugs'.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/34">25.3 per cent. of residents agree that the police and local services are successfully dealing with crime and ASB in their area. This is below the London average (28.2 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/35">Hackney prioritised NI 17 (perceptions of ASB) (and NI 195-street cleanliness) in its local area agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/36">Hackney has made ASB a priority within the borough and has regular meetings of a forum linked to the LSP. It is recognised to be improving on local responses to ASB. <i> Youth crime</i></p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/37" class="indent">Total funding received from the YJB for 2009-10: &#163;934,876.86</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/38" class="indent">Total budget for 2009-10: &#163;4,168,422</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/39">Hackney is a pioneering borough and committed to cracking down on youth crime. There are many schemes aimed at young people including after school activities; street-based youth workers and schemes such as Operation Staysafe aimed at identifying children at risk in the late hours.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/40">The rate of reoffending by young people in Hackney is comparable with similar areas. There are priorities within the Children and Young People's Plan 2008-11 to reduce offending and reoffending among young people and to offer them more and better activities. Two thirds of young people participate in positive activities outside of the school day. The youth offending team works well and there has been increased investment in Hackney's youth services. The proportion of young people sentenced to custody increased in 2008-09 and is higher than the national average, but in line with similar areas. There is an over-representation of black young people in the youth justice system but this is showing a downward trend. Hackney's new youth crime reduction strategy has been informed by a range of evaluations, studies and data including a gap analysis of provision for young black people. More young offenders are in education, employment and training than before and the proportion living in suitable accommodation has also improved.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.2/41">Data from Hackney (Hackney Youth Crime Strategy 2009) shows that just over 200 Hackney residents under 19 years have been victims of serious violence. Hackney partners are seeking new ways of encouraging and supporting young victims and witnesses to enable them to feel safe in reporting crime and giving court evidence. They are part of the London Integrated Offender Management Programme and have adopted the principles of intense monitoring of offenders balanced with support to rehabilitate for serious youth violence.</p>

	<p pid="d.686W.5/1">The role of the independent Identity Commissioner, as set out in the Identity Cards Act 2006, is to oversee the areas of the National Identity Service (NIS) set out in the Act, helping ensure the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) meets its statutory commitments. The key areas of focus are:</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.5/2" class="indent">the arrangements for securing the confidentiality and integrity of the information recorded on the National Identity Register;</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.5/3" class="indent">the way IPS deals with complaints under the NIS;</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.5/4" class="indent">the way identity cards are used.</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.5/5">The Identity Commissioner and his office are open to receiving queries and are keen to hear comments from the public which will feed into the commissioner's report. The commissioner will also ensure that his recommendations and concerns influence IPS's future policy and processes. It is not part of the commissioner's role to respond to individual queries or complaints as there is already an established IPS complaints process.</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.5/6">The Act does not give the Identity Commissioner the power to impose sanctions. If the Identity Commissioner finds a material breach of the Data Protection Act he will report it to the Information Commissioner, as well as the Home Office. The Information Commissioner's Office does have the power to issue sanctions. Section 23 of the Act does, however, provide for the Identity Commissioner to report annually to the Home Secretary about the carrying out of his functions. In addition, the Identity Commissioner can make a report at any other time, to the Secretary of State, on matters relating to the carrying out of his functions as he sees fit. The Home Secretary lays the reports he receives, from the Identity Commissioner under this section of the Act, before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.5/7">The Identity Commissioner's First Annual Report was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-25">25 February 2010</phrase>. This report covers the Identity Commissioner's findings from his first three months in office and his future plans for 2010.</p>

	<p pid="d.690W.8/1">Stroud comes within the Stroud Community Safety Partnership (CSP). Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March 2010</phrase>, CSPs were referred to as Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRP). The available statistical information therefore relates to the Stroud CSP.</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/2">In terms of police recorded crime in the Stroud CSP, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 14 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/3" class="indent">Violence against the person-up 16 per cent. (down 7 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/4" class="indent">Sexual offences-up 29 per cent. (up 19 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/5" class="indent">Robbery-down 23 per cent. (up 8 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/6" class="indent">Burglary-down 28 per cent. (down 3 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/7" class="indent">Offences against vehicles-down 31 per cent. (up 7 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/8" class="indent">Other theft offences-down 30 per cent. (down 3 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/9" class="indent">Criminal damage-up 5 per cent. (down 12 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/10" class="indent">Drug offences-up 32 per cent. (up 50 per cent. in last year) (there has been increased recording of drug offences which is mainly attributable to the increased use of police powers to issue cannabis warnings).</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/11">Data prior to 2002-03 is not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at CSP level is available prior to 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/12">Cotswold and Stroud Basic Command Unit had 258 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has increased by one since 2003. Comparisons with 1997 for Cotswold and Stroud BCU are not available. There were 43 Police Community Support Officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>, whilst there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/13">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). From March 2010, CDRPs are referred to as Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs). The CSP has brought new ways of working in a cross-cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/14">Stroud's Safer Community Team is one of five Inspector Neighbourhood Areas in the Cotswolds and Stroud Police Division. There are three police divisions within Gloucestershire Constabulary.</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/15">Stroud's Community Safety Partnership, the statutory multi-agency partnership with responsibility for community safety, is currently looking to move to one partnership with Cotswolds District Partnership. Geographical coverage of the new partnership will therefore coincide with the police division of Cotswolds and Stroud. Information on crime and antisocial behaviour in Cotswolds and Stroud is available on the Crimemapper website at:</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/16" class="indent"><a href="http://maps.police.uk/">http://maps.police.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/17">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and designated public places orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="d.690W.8/18">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-02">2 December 2009</phrase>, the Home Secretary and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> announced additional funding to develop neighbourhood partnership work to improve public confidence in dealing with issues that matter most in neighbourhoods. This Accelerated Neighbourhood Partnership Fund was targeted at those areas with significantly lower confidence than most similar areas. Stroud was given &#163;41,700 from this fund.</p>

	<p pid="d.700W.2/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) remains committed to providing access to face to face advice services for those customers who need this form of support, at or close by where they are provided now. However the way in which the Department does so needs to change to reflect the fact that taxpayers are increasingly turning to online and telephony services.</p>
	<p pid="d.700W.2/2">This year, for example, HMRC's Inquiry Centres will have 40 per cent. fewer customers nationally than they did four years ago. Of the remaining customers, 85 per cent. are able to resolve their query either by self service using the internet or by contacting one of the Department's helplines.</p>
	<p pid="d.700W.2/3">However, there are customers who would benefit from face to face support who, for whatever reason, do not currently access it from HMRC. The Department is keen to extend its reach to these customers by developing, testing and taking forward new approaches to face-to-face service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="d.700W.2/4">In 2008, HMRC tested alternative opening patterns in 10 Inquiry Centres across the UK. This six-month pilot showed no adverse impact on those customers who needed face to face advice from HMRC.</p>
	<p pid="d.700W.2/5">Following this, the Department has moved to new opening patterns in a further 58 of our Inquiry Centres with low numbers of customer visits.</p>
	<p pid="d.700W.2/6">These changes were based on a variety of factors, including the number and pattern of customer visits and appointments, proximity to other Inquiry Centres and other local circumstances. HMRC has also considered demographic data (for example, concentrations of the elderly and lone parents) and consulted with representative customer groups such as Citizens Advice Bureau, Tax help for Older People, and Gingerbread with knowledge of particular customer needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.700W.2/7">HMRC makes various provision to assist the elderly and people with disabilities to access face to face advice in its Inquiry Centre network, including wheelchair access, induction loops and (by appointment) signing support for customers with hearing disabilities, lighted magnifiers for customers with sight disabilities. These services are based on individual needs, and will not change as a result of HMRC's move to alternative opening patterns for its Inquiry Centres.</p>
	<p pid="d.700W.2/8">The Department has published an Equality Impact Assessment of the changes to opening patterns across its Inquiry Centre network which considers the impact of changes to opening hours on particular customer groups, and to ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to comment. This is available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.700W.2/10">No such estimate has been made, as at present HMRC does not hold equality data on its Inquiry Centre customers. To address this, HMRC will introduce new processes from April 2010 to collect such data.</p>

	<p pid="d.706W.5/5" class="indent">The problems encountered by the Child Support Agency following the launch of the Reforms in 2003 resulted in a decision to defer the bulk transfer of cases from the old (launched in 1993) scheme, to the current (launched in 2003) child support scheme in the meantime, cases were only migrated from the old computer system to the new computer system where they had a link with a case on the new system that made this necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.706W.5/6" class="indent">This decision was kept under review and in February 2006 the Government asked Sir David Henshaw to review the entire system of child maintenance.

	<p pid="d.708W.3/1">Renaming council tax benefit will have significant impact on the administration of the benefit, with major delivery implications for local authorities. The main impact will be on IT systems, including where these link to Department for Work and Pensions systems. There will also be necessary changes to forms, leaflets and billing arrangements in order to give accurate information to existing customers, and maximise the impact of the change in improving take-up.</p>
	<p pid="d.708W.3/2">Officials are engaging with local authorities in a number of ways. There have been preliminary formal discussions with the local authority associations and with practitioners from local authorities. This will be followed by more detailed survey of the requirements of individual authorities. Proposals have been outlined to the local authority software suppliers to enable them to start to prepare requirements and costs for the changes and enhancements to IT systems.</p>

	<p pid="d.713W.2/1">The Government have significantly improved working conditions for disabled people by providing additional rights under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 for disabled people not to be discriminated against on the ground of their disability, and to have reasonable adjustments made to ensure that they do not experience substantial disadvantage, compared to non-disabled people, in the employment field. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>, the employment provisions of the Act have been extended to all forms of employment and occupation, except service in the armed forces, and to employers of all sizes. Through the Equality Bill we are making further improvements, including restrictions on the use by employers of pre-employment enquiries about a person's disability or health.</p>
	<p pid="d.713W.2/2">The Health and Safety Executive promotes the message that health and safety issues should not be used as an excuse to exclude a disabled person from work opportunities. The Executive worked with the former Disability Rights Commission to produce its disability web pages and guidance leaflet for disabled employees and their employers. The information on the web pages and within the guidance promotes good practice in disability equality at work and health and safety risk assessment. The web pages also contain much valuable information for employers and employees on reasonable adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="d.713W.2/3">Disabled people, including those in Preston, who are in work or about to start a job may also benefit from Access to Work, a specialist disability programme delivered by Jobcentre Plus, which provides practical advice and financial support to disabled people and their employers to help them overcome work related obstacles resulting from disability. An Access to Work adviser works with the customer to develop a detailed assessment of the customer's needs, leading to grants towards the cost of providing support. In December 2008 we committed to doubling the budget to &#163;138 million by 2013-14, enabling many more disabled people in Preston and elsewhere to benefit.</p>

Within any given month our benefit processing systems calculate the total number of claims we have cleared against the total number of days each of these cases have taken - this results in production of the AACT. The AACT target does not mean that all claims for that benefit should be processed within that time. This is because the target is based on an average which recognises that each individual customer's circumstances differ and by that very nature some cases will be easier/quicker to process than those that are more complex and naturally take longer to process.</p>

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.715W.0/4" class="indent">All jobseekers claiming Jobseeker's Allowance have an interview with an adviser to discuss and agree realistic and achievable job goals and those steps that, if taken regularly, will offer the best chance of finding work.</p>
	<p pid="d.715W.0/5" class="indent">During this process, the adviser provides access to a wide range of help and support aimed at improving job prospects and overcoming barriers that might be making it harder to find work. This includes providing information, advice and guidance on how to identify and apply for jobs, and how to make best use of appropriate vacancy sources such as the Jobcentre Plus telephony-based vacancy matching system (Jobseeker Direct) and the government's Internet Job Bank on Directgov, which is accessible through the internet and in all jobcentres via our Jobpoints. Every time customers are asked to attend their local Jobcentre, they are encouraged to use a Jobpoint to identify and apply for jobs. If required, customers are shown how to use a Jobpoint by a member of the Customer Service Team.</p>
	<p pid="d.715W.0/6" class="indent">We recognise the importance of having access to a computer to enable customers to search and apply for jobs online, as this is rapidly becoming the recruitment channel of choice for employers. In recognition of this, we are developing close working relationships with local providers such as UK Online Centres in England and the equivalent in Scotland and Wales and signposting customers to the support that these provide. Personal Advisers tell customers how they can find their nearest UK Online Centre, and equivalent in Scotland and Wales, using a free phone number, to enable them to gain access to this help. We are also raising awareness of schemes that will help customers get their own home computer, such as the Department for Children, Schools and Families Home Internet Access programme. Furthermore, later this year, we will be Mailing customer access to PCs in some of our Jobcentres and offering supported access to those who have no or low digital skills.</p>
	<p pid="d.715W.0/7" class="indent">You may also wish to know that Jobcentre Plus launched its Smartphone Application on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-10">10 March</phrase>, which is an alternative means for our customers to access our Internet Job Bank. The application allows those with compatible smartphones to perform jobsearches and browse job vacancies directly from their handset, whenever they are connected to the internet. This application provides another means of accessing the digital labour market and promoting self-service for our customers.</p>

	<p pid="d.717W.2/2">Jobholders who already receive workplace pension provision equal to or better than that required under the reforms are unlikely to see any change to their net pay.</p>
	<p pid="d.717W.2/3">The impact of automatic enrolment on net salaries for other jobholders will depend on the level of pension contributions payable into the workplace pension scheme used by the employer.</p>
	<p pid="d.717W.2/4">Once the workplace pension reforms have been fully introduced, overall contributions to qualifying defined contribution schemes must total at least 8 per cent. on a band of earnings. The 8 per cent. total will be made up from a minimum 3 per cent. from the employer, along with the jobholder's own contribution and around 1 per cent. in tax relief. However, employers can choose to pay a greater proportion of the 8 per cent. total-resulting in a lesser impact on net pay.</p>
	<p pid="d.717W.2/5">The contribution rates for jobholders are being phased in over time. This will help jobholders to adjust gradually to the impact of the changes on their net pay. Jobholder contributions will be 1 per cent. from October 2012 to September 2016; 3 per cent. from October 2016 to September 2017 and 5 per cent. from 2017 onwards.

	<p pid="d.722W.2/2">The Government strongly believe that the best way to tackle adult poverty is through work. Those in work in the long term are better off than on benefits as training, promotion and career opportunities can enable many workers to attain a better standard of living for themselves and their families. We are therefore placing an increased priority on helping all groups of people, including disabled people and those with health conditions, lone parents and long term unemployed people get into rewarding and sustainable jobs.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/3">Relative working age poverty (BHC) has increased over the last decade. However the risk of poverty for working age adults is still below that for children or pensioners (15 per cent. as compared with 23 per cent. for both children and pensioners) and the risk of persistent poverty for this group is also lower than average at 7 per cent. For this reason the Government have targeted additional financial support on families with children and pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/4">However, the Government remain committed to ensuring employment and opportunity for all and believe that work, for those who can, remains the best and most sustainable route out of poverty. Over the last decade we have improved the gains to work with the introduction of the national minimum wage and the extension of tax credits and we have invested in employment support to ensure people are not written off. The Government are also supporting people through the difficult economic climate, setting aside &#163;5 billion to help people back into work.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/5">The Government's declared aim is to eradicate child poverty by 2020. Our determination to do so is as firm as ever and this is demonstrated by introducing the Child Poverty Bill. The Child Poverty Bill will bring new impetus to eradicating child poverty by 2020. It will provide a definition of success and sets a framework to guarantee that Government and their partners at national and local levels make a clear and vital contribution towards ending child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/6">Between 1998-99 and 2007-08 some 500,000 children were lifted out of relative poverty. Measures announced in and since Budget 2007 are expected to lift around a further 550,000 children out of poverty. Absolute poverty has been halved.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/7">Addressing pensioner poverty has been a priority for this Government. We have targeted help on the poorest pensioners, those who need it most, while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/8">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Targeted support, such as pension credit and additional funding for all pensioners has contributed to 900,000 fewer pensioners in relative poverty (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs) in 2007-08 than in 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/9">The available information is given in the table.</p>
	<p pid="d.722W.2/10">The latest available information covers 2007-08. Figures covering the UK are most commonly used. However, for 1996-97, only information for Great Britain is available. This means the changes in the numbers of various groups below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income between 1996-97 and 2007-08 can only be calculated for Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="d.736W.5/1">None of the &#163;50 million will go to oil palm companies. DFID hopes to build on work the UK has begun with the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to agree credible environmental production standards and to secure their use by both producers and buyers. This could involve funding the RSPO itself, academic institutions supporting it and associated NGO networks. DFID expects that most of the funding will support programmes managed by organisations such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, Oxfam, Transparency International and local non-government organisations who have rigorous auditing and accounting procedures and employ anti-corruption safeguards.</p>

	<p pid="d.741W.3/1">Academies are required by the independent school standards regulations to have a complaints procedure which must be available on request to parents. The procedure must provide for complaints to be managed within clear time scales. If initial informal consideration does not resolve the complaint, then the procedure must also include steps to escalate a complaint through both a formal written stage and, if necessary, a hearing before a panel that includes at least one member who is independent of the academy.</p>
	<p pid="d.741W.3/2">If the complaint cannot be resolved at school level from the <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>, the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) will be the next route of redress. The YPLA will review the evidence provided by the complainant and the academy to determine if the academy has followed its own complaints procedure or is in breach of a contractual or statutory obligation. If the academy has not followed its procedures or obligations it will be asked to do so to rectify any failings.</p>
	<p pid="d.741W.3/3">Ultimately a complaint can be referred to the Secretary of State on the grounds that a governing body is acting or proposing to act unreasonably or on the grounds that either has failed to discharge its duties. The same procedure as stated above also applies to staff who want to complain about academies.</p>

In addition some academies will receive National Challenge funding in the same way that maintained schools do. These budgets will be held with the Department for Children, Schools and Families until the function for educational support and challenge of open academies transfers to the Young People's Learning Agency in September 2010.</p>

	<p pid="d.745W.5/1">Keeping children safe from all forms of abuse is a top priority for the Government. The Government recognise the strong links between safeguarding concerns and domestic violence. All professionals working with or who come into contact with children and their families, including those working in health or education, have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. If they have reason to believe that a child is at risk from harm as a result of domestic violence, they should follow the same steps to raise this concern as they would for any other child at risk of abuse. 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' (2010) and 'What To Do If You're Worried a Child Is Being Abused' (2006) provide guidance for professionals on the impact of domestic violence on children and stress the need for awareness of those links.</p>
	<p pid="d.745W.5/2">The National Safeguarding Delivery Unit and the National MARAC Steering Group chaired by the Home Office will be working with key partners over the next few months to develop guidance for local MARAC partnerships to ensure that the cases of children which are most at risk of harm in families affected by domestic violence are indentified and prioritised.</p>

Lord Laming published his report in March 2009 and the Government accepted all his recommendations. We announced a new &#163;58 million Social Work Transformation Fund to provide an immediate boost for social work training, support, recruitment and retention. This is in addition to the &#163;73 million for the children and families' social work workforce already allocated from 2008 to 2011 and the &#163;100 million each year to fund social worker initial training, bursaries and practice placements.</p>
	<p pid="d.746W.2/3">Following consultation, we will shortly be publishing revised statutory guidance &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; to reflect Lord Laming's recommendations, recognise changes in the policy landscape, and help clarify roles and responsibilities between organisations and agencies. Local areas should already be delivering effective arrangements to safeguard and protect the welfare of children, and the revisions to the guidance will re-emphasise the need for the consistent application of effective practice.</p>

	<p pid="d.748W.2/2">The Department seeks to answer all parliamentary questions that do not incur disproportionate cost. The methodology used to determine whether answers to these questions could be provided without incurring disproportionate cost was the Department's guidance on the &quot;Calculation of the Disproportionate Cost threshold for answering PQs&quot; which is based on the guidance published on the Cabinet Office's website at:</p>
	<p pid="d.748W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/parliamentary-clerk-guide/chapter7.asp">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/parliamentary-clerk-guide/chapter7.asp</a>x</p>
	<p pid="d.748W.2/4">Officials in the Department have concluded that answering these questions in full would exceed the current disproportionate cost threshold of &#163;800 as announced in Parliament by the Treasury on the <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-20">20 January 2010</phrase>. These questions are very broad in scope covering all of the Department's policies over a number of years. To identify the effects of all policies on an individual constituency, collate all of the data and carry out the necessary quality assurance would require a considerable amount of resource, far in excess of the threshold. The round robin guidance issued by the Treasury for these questions advised directing questioners to the Neighbourhood Statistics Service website, however, while the Department has placed considerable amounts of data on this website, it is not at constituency level. My officials, in line with Cabinet Office guidance, decided to answer the questions by providing the requested information which was readily available and provided readily available attainment data at constituency level and a link to the Department's &quot;In Your Area&quot; website where the Department publishes further local level data including data at parliamentary constituency level. It would only be possible for the Department to provide additional information by exceeding the disproportionate cost threshold.</p>

The Government have accepted this recommendation, and the Department's statutory guidance to local authorities on registration and monitoring will set out the steps they should take to work with schools and FE colleges to identify suitable examination and assessment centres for home-educated children. A draft of this guidance will be issued for consultation later this year.</p>

QCDA recently published a leaflet, &quot;Accepting Private Candidates&quot;, to provide examination centres with practical advice, and to alleviate any unjustified concerns they might have.</p>

	<p pid="d.751W.5/2">The standards fund music grant to local authorities has, since 2006-07, included a formula-based allocation for children to be given the opportunity to learn a musical instrument and/or receive specialist vocal tuition at key stage 2. The allocation of an extra &#163;23 million a year since 2007-08, along with our strong guidance to local authorities to focus efforts on reaching 100 per cent. of the key stage 2 population, has had a significant impact on widening access to instrumental and vocal tuition. In addition, Sing Up, the national singing programme has received &#163;10 million a year from 2007 to provide resources and professional development for teachers to lead singing in primary schools. While support has focused on widening access to instrumental and vocal tuition for primary school pupils, &quot;Tune In-Year of Music&quot; was launched last September and this initiative is promoting musical activities across the country for 0 to 19-year-olds.</p>

	<p pid="d.752W.2/2">Following the commitments made in the Children's Plan in 2007 and the national Play Strategy in 2008, every top-tier local authority in England has been receiving funding through the play capital investment programme since April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.752W.2/3">Of the 152 top-tier local authorities, 30 are play pathfinder authorities and the remaining 122 local authorities are all play builder authorities. On average every play pathfinder authority receives around &#163;2 million capital funding and &#163;500,000 revenue funding over the current spending period 2008-09 to 2010-11. They will use this funding to deliver a minimum of 28 play areas plus a staffed adventure playground. The play builder authorities receive around &#163;1 million capital and &#163;45,000 revenue funding over the same spending period and will deliver a minimum of 22 play areas. The play areas that are delivered can be either completely new areas or existing areas which are significantly refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="d.752W.2/4">Decisions on where the allocated capital funding is spent within local authority boundaries are taken locally, based on grant requirements which state that: improved play spaces must be provided where they are most needed, and as a result of a robust consultation process involving local children and young people, families and wider communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.752W.2/5">The number of outdoor public play areas delivered by local authorities since the programme began in April 2008 is 1,152 and plans are well under way to ensure that the target of 3,500 play areas completed by the end of March 2011 is achieved. Of the 30 staffed adventure playgrounds, 20 are due to be delivered by the end of March 2010 with local authorities managing the impact of the recent extreme weather. The remaining 10 adventure playgrounds will be delivered by the end of March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.753W.0/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="d.753W.0/4" class="indent">Prior to September 2005 inspections were carried out under the school inspection frameworks commonly known as Section 10. Since September 2005, inspections have been carried out under the school inspection frameworks commonly known as Section 5.</p>
	<p pid="d.753W.0/5" class="indent">Under the current and previous inspection frameworks, Ofsted inspections do not use the term 'failing'. Instead, if inspectors judge that a school's overall effectiveness is inadequate or very poor, the school will be placed into a category of concern. Under Section 10 these categories were called 'serious weaknesses' and 'special measures'. Under Section 5 the categories are called 'notice to improve' and 'special measures'. This response takes into account any school in the parliamentary constituency of Preston which has been placed into any category of concern since September 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.753W.0/6" class="indent">Of all the inspections carried out by Ofsted in maintained schools in Preston between September 1997 and August 2009, sixteen have resulted in the school being placed in a category of concern. One school has been placed into a category of concern on two separate occasions and so appears twice in the figures. Three of the fifteen schools affected closed before being removed from the category of concern. The remaining twelve have all been removed from any category following a reinspection. As at the end of August 2009, no school in Preston was in a category of concern. Table A below provides a list of the individual schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.753W.0/7" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Vernon Coaker MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="d.757W.2/1">The administration of the concessionary travel scheme in Birmingham is carried out by Centro, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive. The Government provide funding for concessionary travel in Birmingham through two channels: formula grant to Birmingham city council and special grant to West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority (WMITA).</p>
	<p pid="d.757W.2/2">Before <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, funding for the statutory minimum bus concession was provided exclusively through the formula grant system. Formula grant is an unhypothecated block grant and as such it is not possible to identify how much formula grant has been allocated to local authorities for any particular service, such as concessionary travel for older and disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="d.757W.2/3">From April 2008, the Department for Transport has provided additional special grant funding to local authorities to cover the extra costs of providing England-wide travel, of which WMITA received &#163;12,352,518 in 2008-09 and &#163;12,643,851 in 2009-10. The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) continues to provide the bulk of concessionary travel funding to local authorities through formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="d.757W.2/4">The Department for Transport also provided WMITA with &#163;2,185,500 in 2007-08 for the cost of producing and issuing the new England-wide bus passes to all those eligible.</p>

	<p pid="d.758W.0/1">The Department for Transport provided &#163;1 million funding to Southend borough council in January 2008 for highway repairs to prevent damage occurring to rail and road links from a cliff slippage. The Department for Transport met with officials from the authority and their consultant prior to the submission of a business case by the authority seeking this funding. No record was made of the meeting which took place in Southend.</p>
	<p pid="d.758W.0/2">The funding for this highway maintenance scheme will be provided under Section 31 of Local Government Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.758W.0/3">The Department for Transport has not conducted any specific research on cliff slippages that threaten rail and road links. The Highways Agency continues to monitor and provides support on research conducted on chalk cliff stability. Current research is of a localised nature e.g. cliff monitoring initiatives being carried out in the Brighton and Hove District. The Highways Agency have identified that there may be future collaboration opportunities for research in this field available through the INTERREG programme (interested parties include Brighton and Hove City Council, Brighton University, Leeds University and Chalk Rock Ltd).</p>
	<p pid="d.758W.0/4">Government resilience policy for events which result from incidents of instability are a matter for the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG). Southend borough council have not discussed cliff stabilisation issues with CLG recently.</p>

	<p pid="d.767W.2/1">HS2 Ltd estimate that the capital cost of construction of the recommended high speed rail line from London to West Midlands is between &#163;15.8 billion and &#163;17.4 billion. The estimated capital cost of construction for new lines from the West Midlands to the North West, and to Yorkshire via the East Midlands, is &#163;5.4-5.8 billion (depending on routeing at Manchester) and &#163;5.8 billion, respectively. All figures are in 2009 prices, include risk and optimum bias, and exclude rolling stock costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.767W.2/2">Unlike the London to the West Midlands cost estimate, those for the legs north of the West Midlands are not based on engineered routes. HS2 Ltd has been asked to carry out similar detailed planning work on route options from the West Midlands to Manchester and Leeds, to be completed in summer 2011, with a view to consulting the public early in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="d.767W.2/3">Estimates of revenue expenditure during construction would be developed at a later stage were the Government to decide to proceed following public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="d.767W.5/1">The Government will not take a decision on the route of any high speed line from London to the West Midlands until public consultation has taken place. The route recommended by HS2 Ltd., which follows the A413 corridor and which the Government agree should form the basis of consultation, was considered to be the preferred route option because it offers cost and journey time advantages and because its local and environmental impacts are on balance lower than those of the two other routes short-listed by HS2 Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="d.767W.5/2">In particular, its environmental impacts are reduced by following existing transport corridors for more than half the distance travelled at surface level through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

	<p pid="d.770W.2/1">The Department does not collect information on average response times to emergency calls by national health service ambulance trusts.</p>
	<p pid="d.770W.2/2">The data that the Department does collect on ambulance response times is published on an annual basis in the statistical bulletin, &quot;Ambulance services, England&quot;.

	<p pid="d.770W.2/4">All ambulance trusts are required to meet the same national response time standards. Category A calls (those presenting conditions that may be immediately life threatening) should be responded to within eight minutes in 75 per cent. of cases and Category B calls (those conditions that are serious but not immediately life threatening) should be responded to within 19 minutes in 95 per cent. of cases.</p>
	<p pid="d.770W.2/5">The Department only collects national data at ambulance trust level, with strategic health authorities as the local headquarters of the NHS, and primary care trusts as commissioners, having the responsibility for ensuring that national response time standards are delivered and maintained by trusts. This may mean that trusts locally will look at performance data below ambulance trust level, but whether and how the NHS does this is for each region to decide and manage locally.</p>

The PACT system covers prescriptions prescribed by general practitioners (GPs), nurses, pharmacists and others in England and dispensed in the community in the United Kingdom. For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals, dental prescribing and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary (BNF) sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4, &quot;Central Nervous System&quot; has a fair proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community-these prescriptions are not included in PACT data.  2. Data are held for 60 months and so at the moment the only complete years available are 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Complete data for 2009 cannot be released until after the publication of the associated National Statistic in April 2010 and so only data for January to September is presented here.  3. Prescriptions are written on a prescription form known as a FP10. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.  4. The term &quot;asthma-related conditions&quot; has been taken to mean asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease since they are treated with the same medications, namely those classified under sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the BNF.  <i> Source:</i>  Prescribing Analysis and CosT (PACT) system.</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="d.772W.2/81"> <td colspan="11"><i> Notes:</i>  1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.  2. Episode duration/bed days: episode duration is calculated as the difference in days between the episode start date and the episode end date, where both are given. Episode duration is based on FCEs and applies only to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated).  3. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.  4. PCT Changes: In July 2006, the NHS reorganised strategic health authorities (SHA) and PCTs in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result, data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. In particular, it is noted that there was a change in the number of PCTs that constituted the London boroughs around 2003-04: Walthamstow, Leyton and Leytonstone PCT became Waltham Forest PCT; Chingford, Wanstead and Woodford PCT and Redbridge PCT became Redbridge PCT; and Bexley PCT became Bexley Care Trust.  5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  6. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.776W.5/4">The Mental Capacity Act places a duty on health professionals to consult other people close to a person who lacks capacity on decisions affecting the person. Under section 4(7) of the MCA, health professionals have a duty to take into account the views of anyone involved in caring for the person and anyone interested in their welfare (for example family carers, other close relatives.) as part of a &quot;Best Interests&quot; decision. Therefore, the family should be consulted where the treatment is being made under a &quot;Best Interests&quot; decision because the person lacks capacity.</p>

	<p pid="d.776W.8/2">Our initial estimate of &#163;3-3.5 billion was based on an understanding that individual payments made in Ireland to infected patients ranged between &#163;500,000 and &#163;1,000,000, and was derived by multiplying the average of those figures by the estimated number of infected claimants in the UK. It did not take account of payments to dependents of those infected.</p>
	<p pid="d.776W.8/3">It is not possible to calculate an accurate figure for the cost of implementing Lord Archer's report because the Irish scheme uses a series of eligibility criteria which means that different claimants have received different amounts of compensation, depending on their circumstances. Therefore, unless each UK claimant is assessed individually against the same criteria, it would be impossible to give an accurate figure. It is also not possible to estimate with any certainty how many people in the UK might be eligible to apply.</p>

	<p pid="d.781W.6/3">Support for carers must be tailored to meet the individual's needs; enabling carers to maintain a balance between their caring responsibilities and a life outside caring, while enabling the person they support to be a full and equal citizen.

	<p pid="d.784W.2/1">We have invested a record &#163;2 billion in dentistry and set up a national access programme to help the national health service deliver its commitment to provide access for all who seek it by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.784W.2/2">Access to NHS dentistry is growing. The latest data shows that 1,230,000 more patients accessed NHS services in the 24 months ending December 2009 than compared to the 24 months ending June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.784W.2/3">We have also accepted the recommendations made by the independent review of NHS dentistry, to further improve access and quality in the long term, and will pilot these recommendations thoroughly.</p>
	<p pid="d.784W.2/4">Leeds Primary Care Trust (PCT) will receive a funding allocation of &#163;32,428,000 in 2010-11 for primary dental care services. This is net of income from dental charges paid by patients, which is retained locally to supplement the resources available for dentistry. It will be for individual PCTs to judge whether additional investment is required. As a result of lower NHS service tariff prices following the incorporation of an additional 0.5 per cent. efficiency requirement, PCTs have headroom in their general NHS 2010-11 budgets to fund additional growth in dentistry and other services according to local development priorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.784W.2/5">Funding allocations to PCTs for 2011-12 and 2012-13 will be finalised as part of the next Spending Review. Funding for dentistry will be included within PCT unified funding allocations from 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="d.784W.2/6">Information on how many people are registered with an NHS dentist is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.784W.2/7">Under the new dental contractual arrangements, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, patients do not have to be registered with an NHS dentist to receive NHS care. The closest equivalent measure to 'registration' is the number of patients receiving NHS dental services ('patients seen') over a 24 month period.

	<p pid="d.788W.5/2">To support GPs in the referral of patients with suspected cancer, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence produced referral guidelines for suspected cancer in 2005. These guidelines are intended for use by health care professionals in primary care and can also be used in the education and training of health professionals. These guidelines are used together with local protocols for referral as agreed by the local provider and the primary care trust, and in line with national commitments for cancer waiting time standards.</p>

			<tr pid="d.796W.5/84"> <td colspan="9"><i> Notes:</i><br/>  1. <i> Finished consultant episode (FCE)</i><br/>  FCE is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. It should be noted that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/>  2. <i> Episode duration/Bed Days</i><br/>  Episode duration is calculated as the difference in days between the episode start date and the episode end date, where both are given. Episode duration is based on finished consultant episodes and only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated).<br/>  3. <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/>  The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/>  4. <i> ICD10 codes for Malnutrition</i><br/>  The ICD-10 codes for Malnutrition are:<br/>  E40.X Kwashiorkor<br/>  E41.X Nutritional marasmus<br/>  E42.X Marasmic kwashiorkor<br/>  E43.X Unspecified severe protein-energy malnutrition<br/>  E44.X Protein energy malnutrition of moderate and mild degree<br/>  E45.X Retarded development following protein-energy malnutrition<br/>  E46.X Unspecified protein-energy malnutrition<br/>  025.X Malnutrition in pregnancy<br/>  5. <i> PCT Changes</i><br/>  In July 2006, the national health service reorganised strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. Please note the following changes in PCTs in 2003-04: Walthamstow, Leyton and Leytonstone PCT became Waltham Forest PCT; Chingford, Wanstead and Woodford PCT and Redbridge PCT became Redbridge PCT; and Bexley PCT became Bexley Care Trust.<br/>  6. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/>  HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/>  7. <i> Data quality</i><br/>  HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/>  8. <i> Small numbers</i><br/>  To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.802W.2/65">The Department demands a very high level of compliance from its suppliers and contractor event of default notices reflect operational matters identified during the normal course of contract delivery that need to be addressed. The majority of the matters identified have been addressed using the existing contractual remedies. Publication of contractor event of default notices would or would be likely to cause prejudice to the commercial interests of the providers concerned. It would also potentially compromise the Department's position in any possible future formal contractual disputes, which in turn would or would be likely to cause prejudice to the commercial interests of the Department.</p>

	<p pid="d.809W.2/1">Apprenticeships are open to those aged 16 and over, regardless of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religious belief. Participation in apprenticeships has increased threefold over the last decade. A great deal of work is being, done to improve access further and increase gender equality in participation at all levels.</p>

	<p pid="d.809W.2/6" class="indent">NAS work with employers to help them understand and be more responsive to the needs of learners in non-traditional occupations, and promote Apprenticeships to people from these groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.2/7" class="indent">NAS are working to develop resources on apprenticeships for careers education in schools and with information advice and guidance providers to encourage young people to think about apprenticeships in a non-stereotypical way.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.2/8" class="indent">Extending apprenticeships to over 25's has seen a greater number of women taking up an apprenticeship. 63 per cent. of people aged 25 and over starting an apprenticeship in 2008/09 were female.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.2/9" class="indent">We have invested &#163;7 million to create Group Training Associations and Apprenticeship Training Agencies, with a specific remit to encourage atypical learners to take up apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.2/10" class="indent">We have also invested &#163;2.3 million to create diversity pilots in targeted areas for gender, BME and disabled learners, those in non-traditional occupations and their employers.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.2/11" class="indent">NAS have set up an online mentoring platform through horse's mouth-open to all apprentices. 54 mentors registered so far.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.2/12" class="indent">The minimum wage for apprentices increased from &#163;80 to &#163;95 a week last year. It is young women-apprentices like those in hairdressing and care-who have benefitted most from this increase. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-25">25 March 2010</phrase> the Government announced their acceptance of the Low Pay Commission's recommendations concerning apprenticeship pay. This will mean that from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase> the present exemption from the NMW for apprentices will be ended and all apprentices in the United Kingdom must be paid at least &#163;2.50 an hour.</p>

	<p pid="d.810W.3/1">The Working Capital Scheme (WCS) has provided guarantees to two banks on portfolios of short-term loans with good credit risk in order to release regulatory capital to enable those banks to increase lending to businesses. The two banks with WCS guarantees, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, have made lending commitments of &#163;39 billion.</p>
	<p pid="d.810W.3/2">Public Borrowing Review 2009 announced that as the broader asset protection scheme now provides banks with considerably greater capital release, so new portfolios will not be guaranteed under the WCS although existing portfolio guarantees will remain until March 2011. Because the WCS was only available to banks, companies were not eligible to apply.</p>

	<p pid="d.819W.5/1">Government are concerned at the impact of high cost credit products on the most vulnerable people in society. A diverse and innovative credit market benefits consumers, but there is a fine line between promoting choice and some of the recent innovations in the payday loan market, such as loans offered via the internet or mobile phone, that appear to make it too easy to access credit anywhere and at any time without thinking through the implications.</p>
	<p pid="d.819W.5/2">We will shortly be implementing the new Consumer Credit Directive into UK law. The directive will give consumers new protections such as a 14-day right to cancel any credit agreement without penalty and require lenders, including payday lenders, to provide clear information to consumers on new loans, and check borrowers' creditworthiness before lending.</p>
	<p pid="d.819W.5/3">The Office of Fair Trading will soon be publishing its new Irresponsible Lending Guidance covering the marketing and selling of credit products. The guidance will ensure that that lenders do not irresponsibly promote credit and will make clear the standards expected of them at all stages of the lending process. Government are determined to tackle irresponsible lenders, and those who are unable or unwilling to follow the guidance face being stripped of their credit licences.</p>
	<p pid="d.819W.5/4">The Office of Fair Trading is also reviewing the high cost credit area, including analysis on the impact of interest rate caps, and they are due to publish their findings and recommendations shortly. We will not hesitate to act if the review finds that further action is necessary to protect consumers.</p>

	<p pid="d.824W.2/2">In early 2009, the SLC contacted 54 EU borrowers in order to start the legal process. Experience suggests that the majority of cases are resolved satisfactorily when the SLC advise borrowers that legal action will be taken, and where appropriate student debt has been recovered before court action has been raised. However, there remain a small number of cases which may be subject to court action under Regulation EU 44/2001 where action is ongoing. Student loan debt has so far been recovered from two students where court action was raised in their country of domicile, where the relevant local law is applicable.</p>

	<p pid="d.845W.3/2">Government have assessed the potential burden of the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme on local authorities, and has determined that it will not constitute a new burden for the sector. Its overall impact is not therefore expected to increase council tax, but will result in net savings for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.3/3">Analysis indicates that the potential savings from reduced energy bills are far higher than the costs incurred. The financial impact of the CRC will be determined by the organisation's relative performance as compared to other participants. The maximum penalty will be an extremely small fraction of local authorities operating costs, and this would be offset by even very modest improvements in energy efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="d.846W.2/1">The Audit Commission, on behalf of the joint inspectorates responsible for the Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA), commissioned two independent evaluation reports of the implementation and costs of the first year of the CAA. The reports were published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-17">17 March 2010</phrase> by Shared Intelligence and the Office for Public Management (OPM) respectively. The Shared Intelligence report demonstrates widespread support for the CAA and the move to a more risk-based approach to assessment and inspection. The OPM report indicates that the costs to councils of CAA are lower than they were for CPA by at least 15 per cent.- approximately &#163;4 million. However, the report explains that this is a conservative estimate and the actual reduction is likely to be greater, up to &#163;19 million. There is great variation in the costs which reflect the choices councils make about how much to spend preparing for and responding to inspection. A further 10 per cent. savings reduction is expected from one-off costs of preparation by councils in the first year of the CAA.</p>
	<p pid="d.846W.2/2">As part of this Department's regulatory impact assessment (RIA) of the Local Government White Paper published in 2006, we estimated costs and savings to be made from the introduction of the new CAA regime of approximately &#163;7 million and &#163;23 million respectively, a net reduction of &#163;16 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.846W.2/3">As announced in the Smarter Government Budget progress update, Government are committed to a measurable reduction in the costs of compliance with assessment and inspection for public services. We will also continue to look at how to make assessment and inspection more effective and streamlined.</p>

	<p pid="d.848W.5/1">The Department's report 'Small Business Rate Relief-improving evidence on eligibility and take-up' was published on December 9 2009. It estimates that, of the approximately 1.2 million non-domestic properties in England which fall below the current rateable value (RV) thresholds for SBRR, around 575,000 are occupied by eligible small businesses. This report has been validated by an independent peer review and is available at:</p>
	<p pid="d.848W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="d.848W.5/3">The methodology used in the report only applies to England as a whole. There fore, it is not possible to estimate the proportion of eligible firms claiming SBRR in each local authority.</p>
	<p pid="d.848W.5/4">However, new experimental statistics on the number of hereditaments in England claiming SBRR published on the Communities and Local Government website on <phrase class="date" code="">252 February 2010</phrase>, show that 462,000 of them were benefiting from SBRR on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.848W.5/5">By applying that figure to the eligibility estimates made for the 2005 rating list it is estimated that around 80 per cent. of eligible hereditaments in England were claiming SBRR in 2008-09-see table 1.</p>
	<p pid="d.848W.5/6">Relief granted to small businesses has been increasing since SBRR was introduced-from &#163;202 million in 2005-06 to &#163;298 million in 2008-09. This represents a real terms increase of 34 per cent. Furthermore in 2008-09, 92 per cent. of the total relief that would be paid if all those estimated to be eligible were to claim, was actually being paid-see table 2.</p>

Where there is a difference between the day a Rating List is altered and the effective date of the alteration, a backdated liability will accrue. The Government do not currently have any plans to amend these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="d.850W.5/2">The review of ports by the Valuation Office Agency was carried out to ensure that all individual business properties within and outside ports were rated fairly to ensure that the burden of contributions to funding local government is shared equitably between businesses around the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.850W.5/3">The Government has listened to the concerns of businesses with significant and unexpected backdated bills, including some within the ports. It has legislated to enable such bills to be repaid over an unprecedented eight years rather than in a single instalment, helping affected businesses to manage the impact on their cash flow during the downturn by reducing the amount they are required to pay now by 87.5 per cent.</p>
