	<p pid="a.118W.10/1">The Government are working with voluntary and community sector organisations, including the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens, Allotment Regeneration Initiative and the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners to promote the importance of allotments and to encourage local authorities to make allotment land available. The Federation of City Farms have been investigating the potential for a community land advisory service to assist in the transfer of ownership and/or control of land from public or private landowners to community groups through purchase/sale or leasing. A business case is under development.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.10/2">In addition, there are a number of other measures that we are taking forward, including measures in the Localism Bill, that will enable local people who are interested in food growing and cultivation to play a bigger role in planning, designing, managing and maintaining community green spaces for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.10/3">&#8216;The Community Right to Reclaim Land&#8217; will help communities to find space for food growing by making information about land owned by public bodies more easily available and help to ensure that under-used or unused land owned by public bodies and some other organisations is brought back into beneficial use.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.10/4">Under proposals for the &#8216;National Planning Policy Framework&#8217; local communities can protect the environmental and cultural landscapes they value. They will be able, through their local and neighbourhood plans, to identify, for special protection, green areas of particular significance to them. This local significance could be because of the green area&#8217;s beauty, historic importance, recreational value (including land used for allotments where it is not already protected by allotment legislation), tranquillity or richness of its wildlife. By designating land as local green space, local communities will be able to rule out new development other than in very special circumstances. Full public consultation on the draft framework was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-25">25 July</phrase> and closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-17">17 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.10/5">We are also looking at whether meanwhile leases for land could be used to provide community groups with a temporary space to grow. Locality, formerly the Development Trusts Associations, has developed model leases at:</p>

	<p pid="a.118W.10/7">that can be used by landowners and communities to make use of land on a temporary basis (e.g. land set aside for a specific purpose but where the land is not currently being utilised to that effect).</p>

	<p pid="a.119W.2/1">Records of allotment provision or the average time someone has to spend on a waiting list are not held at a national level. This is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/2">Research produced by the university of Derby in 2006, based on a partial survey of local authorities, reported that in the period 1996 to 2006, the number of allotment plots fell by 50,630. The report, commissioned but unpublished by the previous Government, was posted up on the DCLG website on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-06">6 May</phrase> at:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/3"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/1897047.pdf">http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/1897047.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/4">Recent indications are however that the tide is turning. The number of allotment disposal cases has reduced significantly from 57 in 2005 to 15 last year. In addition, the National Society of Allotment and Leisure report that in certain areas of the country significant progress has been made in providing more land to meet demand for allotments, for instance, 52 new allotments sites have been created in the south west within the last year alone. Increasingly, councils are providing extra plots through bringing into use extra plots on existing sites, by extending existing sites or splitting plots in half as they become vacant to help meet demand. These practices are very much in keeping with the recommendations set out in the DCLG/Local Government Association guidance to local authorities in &#8220;A Place to Grow&#8221;, which can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/5"><a href="http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/publications/publication-display">www.lga.gov.uk/lga/publications/publication-display</a>.do?id=9027596</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/6">Surveys undertaken by West Kirby Transition Town in conjunction with the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners show waiting lists for allotments have grown considerably. The latest survey results published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-06">6 May 2011</phrase> estimated that around 87,000 people are on waiting lists for just over 152,000 statutory plots managed by principal local authorities (not including those run by parish or town councils or allotment associations). This equates to 57 people waiting for every 100 plots. In 1996 there was an average of four people waiting for every 100 plots.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.2/7">New neighbourhood planning provisions being introduced in the Localism Bill will provide communities with a means to boost the number of sites with powers to protect existing allotments and identify new plots.

	<p pid="a.123W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-05">5 October 2011</phrase>, my Department outlined plans to release formerly-used land and property with enough capacity to build up to 100,000 new homes by 2015. To get development moving, we will be looking to extend the use of build now, pay later models&#8212;meaning developers do not have to find the money upfront for the land but can pay as the development gets underway, or homes are sold. This will help tackle cash flow problems which can act as a barrier to house building.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.5/2">In September 2011, we announced &#163;100 million of funding to bring empty homes that blight neighbourhoods back into use. This complements the new homes bonus which also rewards the reuse of long-term empty homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.5/3">In May 2011, we announced a &#163;30 million contribution towards locally-led schemes to improve the former housing market renewal pathfinder areas. In many locations, the Whitehall programme created blighted areas and abandoned streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.5/4">In February 2011, we outlined plans for a new community right to reclaim land which will help communities to improve their local area by making information about land owned by public bodies more easily available. It will also help to ensure that underused or unused land owned by public bodies and some other organisations is brought back into beneficial use.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.5/5">In June 2010, we amended Whitehall planning guidance to take residential gardens out of the definition of brownfield land. This allows councils to focus development on genuine brownfield land and protect the character of residential neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.5/6">In July 2011 j we published a draft new National Planning Policy Framework. The draft asks local authorities to prioritise land of least environmental or amenity value for development. The term &#8220;of least environmental or amenity value&#8221; rather than &#8220;brownfield&#8221; was used because in some cases, previously developed land can be rich in wildlife and much valued by local communities. The consultation has closed and we are carefully considering all of the submissions that have been made and will then publish the revised text.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.5/7">My department is also supporting the Olympic legacy, driving renewal and regeneration in East London, replacing over 740 acres of polluted, low-grade industrial land and premises with new sports and community facilities, parks, homes, shops and transport infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.124W.2/1">DCLG officials are working closely with those local enterprise partnerships that have asked for support in driving forward local growth following an unsuccessful bid for an enterprise zone.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.2/2">There are many mechanisms that local enterprise partnerships can draw upon to promote economic development. For example, local authorities can already simplify the approach to planning through local development orders and put in place super fast broadband, working with Broadband Delivery UK. Subject to the passage of the Localism Bill, authorities will be able to grant local business rate discounts from April 2012. And the Government are currently consulting on the local retention of business rates, as well as proposals for tax increment finance, both of which have the potential to provide funding to develop infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.2/3">The coalition Government have a number of policies and schemes in place to help promote local economic growth and regeneration, including the Growing Places Fund, the Regional Growth Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the Work programme and the Olympics legacy. A more detailed list is outlined in &#8216;The Plan for Growth&#8217; (March 2011).</p>

It aims to issue 80% of Written Representations decisions within 16 weeks of receipt and 80% of Hearing decisions within 22 weeks. In this case the time taken to reach the site visit stage was longer than anticipated as there was no appropriately qualified inspector with immediate availability to start the case.</p>

Cases take longer than target times for reasons that include the complexity of the issues involved, where important circumstances relevant to the appeal change during the time the appeal is with the Inspectorate and the need to ensure that the case is dealt with by an inspector at an appropriate level of qualification and cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.126W.6/1">Over the last year, the issue of taxpayer-funded trade union officials has attracted significant parliamentary and public scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/2">The TUC have estimated that there are 200,000 union representatives in workplaces across the United Kingdom. Information on the amounts spent on paid time off or the provision of facilities for trade union officials in the public sector is not widely recorded or transparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/3">Notwithstanding, I note the Taxpayers' Alliance published a survey of public authorities' employment of trade union officials in September 2010;</p>

	<p pid="a.126W.6/5">and the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> published its own survey in October 2011:</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/6"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8815280/Taxpayers-pick-up-68m-bill-for-thousands-of-union-reps.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8815280/Taxpayers-pick-up-68m-bill-for-thousands-of-union-reps.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/7">Estimates have suggested that so-called &#8220;facility time&#8221; is more prevalent in the civil service than the rest of the public sector and the private sector, with civil service departments spending, on average, 0.2% of annual pay bill on facility time, compared to 0.14% in the wider public sector and 0.04% in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/8">Statute does not specify how much time employees should be granted to work on trade union duties beyond &#8216;that which is reasonable&#8217;. It is clear that the public sector gives more than the level considered reasonable by other employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/9">Such facility time agreements are not legally enforceable, and can be amended or terminated on notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/10">Employment decisions are a matter for local determination by councils. Yet at a time when all local authorities need to make sensible savings to protect front line services, councillors should review the merits of union officials funded by the taxpayer and the provision of the office facilities to trade unions. We would actively encourage local authorities to reduce the amount of facility time to the norm of private sector levels. A number of councils are already undertaking such reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.6/11">In due course, the Cabinet Office will be producing a policy paper on how facility time can be reformed and reduced in the civil service. Further to this, the Department for Communities and Local Government will provide assistance and guidance to local councils to help inform their own reviews.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.3/1">The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) is investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-18">18 July 2011</phrase> involving a tamper train on the Northampton Loop being hit by loose metal panels from containers from a freight train. The details of the incident were as described as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.3/2">At 17:55 hrs, the driver of a tamper travelling on the Down Northampton line, reported that his cab had been struck by an object from freight train 4L68, the 12:15 hrs container service from Birch Coppice (near Tamworth) to Felixstowe, as it passed on the adjacent line. The tamper driver had observed a metal panel flapping from the side of the approaching container train. He released the safety device in his cab as he moved to protect himself and the tamper came to a stand. The side window of the cab had been smashed but he escaped injury. He then called the signaller to request that all trains be stopped on the adjacent line. When he re-continued his journey, the tamper driver reported finding another similar panel beside the track closer to Rugby.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.3/3">The two metal panels were later recovered from the trackside and were found to be from two containers that were on 4L68. The containers were fitted with power generation equipment. The panels, approximately 2.5m high x 1m wide, had been screwed to the container sides; each had covered a louvred-aperture. The RAIB has examined the containers and found evidence of loose and missing screws on other panels that had been fitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.3/4">The RAIB has examined the panels that became detached and the containers to which they were originally attached. Through interviews, industry records, CCTV images and analysis the RAIB has determined the sequence of events leading up to the incident. It has identified that the panels became detached due to failure of their fastening arrangements to the container.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.3/5">The RAIB has identified the controls that are in place to manage and approve design and modifications to freight containers. The RAIB is currently considering their effectiveness and the industry's compliance with them. Similarly, it is investigating the railway specific arrangements that are in place to prevent unsafe containers entering railway service.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.3/6">Upon conclusion of the investigation, the RAIB will, if appropriate, make recommendations to limit the likelihood and/or reduce the consequence of future similar incidents on the railway.</p>

These would be used to gather evidence. This targeting maximises the opportunity for utility companies to reduce or avoid their exposure to charges by working in less disruptive ways. In addition, approval for a scheme would only be granted by the Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40490" name="Justine Greening">the hon.

	<p pid="a.141W.8/1">Broad rental market areas are an essential feature in calculating rates of housing benefit for tenants in the private rented sector. All English broad rental market areas were reviewed by the Valuation Office Agency rent officers over a two-year period ending in March 2011 and there are no further plans to assess the effect or efficacy of the boundaries.</p>

He met with the Minister for Welfare Reform, my noble Friend Lord Freud, in October last year to discuss them and further met with my officials in May this year. My Department understands the issues with the Cambridge broad rental market area but on the whole we are satisfied that these current arrangements are working well and have no plans to review broad rental market area boundaries in the near future.</p>

The majority of these are required for estate consolidation or to improve the capacity and facilities on the immigration detention estate. Consolidating the Home Office estate will move staff into fewer buildings, releasing savings of over &#163;12 million per annum. The detention estate changes support the UK Border Agency's strategic objectives of securing the border and controlling migration and also help meet the coalition agreement to end the detention of children. Providing details of all building and maintenance works costing less than &#163;250,000 would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.8/1">Meetings for prisoners who are former armed service personnel take place in prisons where an identified need exists, usually as part of the Veterans in Custody Scheme which operates in approximately 120 prison establishments. The delivery or frequency of these meetings is not centrally mandated by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS).</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/2">The Veterans in Custody Scheme offers support to prisoners who are former armed service personnel and liaises with relevant service-based charities to ensure that this group of prisoners has access to the full range of services that are available. Certain Probation Trusts are implementing similar schemes, so that support and links to service-based charities are also available to offenders in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/3">NOMS has not provided additional funding to deliver this area of work as it is part of offender management which is already centrally funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/4">Data on the number of former armed services personnel who are resident in Approved Premises in England and Wales is not centrally collated and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by analysing information held on offender files or on local data systems, validating it, and then collating it in a common format in order to provide a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/5">The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Justice announced in a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-06">6 January 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-01-06.7"><i>Official Report,</i> column 7WS</phrase>, the findings of an initial study by the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) which estimated that, by analysing a database of prisoners aged 18 years and over on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-06">6 November 2009</phrase>, 3% of the prison population in England and Wales (2,207 prisoners) are ex-Regular service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/6">In September 2010, DASA revised the estimate of ex-Regular service personnel to 3.5% of the prison population in England and Wales (2,280 prisoners) to take into account the incompleteness of their service leavers database, which did not previously include reliable data for those who had left the services prior to 1979 (Navy), 1973 (Army) and 1969 (RAF).</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/7">The initial report and the updated estimate are available via the following links:</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.8/10">In a third report, published in March 2011, DASA estimated, by analysing a database of offenders aged 18 years and over who were supervised by probation trusts on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase>, that there were 5,860 former members of the armed forces on probation in England and Wales. This equates to 3.4% of the probation caseload and is roughly in line with the percentage in prison&#8212;3.5%.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/11">This report is available via the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.8/13">The estimate of 5,860 includes an upward adjustment of 499 former service personnel to take into account the incompleteness of DASA's service leavers database which did not capture reliable data for all those who left the services prior to 1979 (Naval Service), 1973 (Army) and 1969 (RAF). Therefore, only a total of 5,361 (or 3.1%) were actually matched to a supervision record.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/14">Of the 5,361 veterans matched to a supervision records, 1,038 (19%) had a post-release licence and 4,331 (81%) had either a community order or a suspended sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.8/15" class="italic">Note:</p>

	<p pid="a.156W.0/2">First-time offenders are an extremely disparate group: they may have been convicted of a wide range of offences, have a range of sentence types and lengths and could present anything from a low to a high risk of harm to others. There is a firmly evidenced principle that the allocation of resources is most effectively and efficiently based on the assessed risk and need of the offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.0/3">NOMS is committed to evidence-based commissioning and the approach that will therefore be applied to the rehabilitation of all offenders, including those who have committed their first offence, will be underpinned by the principle that the allocation of resources should be based on the assessed risk and need that the offender presents.</p>

	<p pid="a.158W.0/1">Girls and women are at the heart of the coalition Government's development agenda. In education, there is evidence that increasing the number of teachers who are female has a positive impact on the retention of girls in school. The recruitment and retention of female teachers is particularly an issue in rural areas. All DFID bilateral education programmes have a specific focus on girls' education as part of a wider programme of support for the education sector, including supporting female teachers in rural areas where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.158W.0/2">In addition, DFID has recently announced a new Girls' Education Challenge, which will support programmes that help to get up to 1 million of the world's poorest girls into school. Funding will be allocated through a competitive process to support those projects best able to demonstrate how they will get more girls into education, which could include supporting programmes that recruit, train, and support female teachers in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.158W.6/1">Teachers are an integral part of ensuring the quality of education, but in many parts of the developing world it is difficult to recruit, train, and retain sufficient numbers of qualified teachers. More than 3 million more teachers are needed in sub-Saharan Africa alone. This can lead to the use of unqualified teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.158W.6/2">DFID is monitoring the emerging evidence on the issue, which offers mixed results. In some cases, unqualified teachers have been shown to be effective in the classroom.

	<p pid="a.159W.0/1">The UK plans for dealing with the negative effects on developing countries of the importation or dumping of electronic waste, is to deal with the problem at the source and to prevent the exportation of hazardous e-waste from the UK so that it does not reach developing countries. Working electrical equipment can be exported for use overseas. However, under the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive, it is always illegal to export hazardous e-waste from the UK for disposal to developing countries. The UK has a national intelligence team and a national environmental crime team. As part of their remit, these teams are tasked with preventing the illegal export of e-waste. They use an intelligence-led approach to target the most prolific, serious and organised illegal waste exporters. This has led to a 98% success rate of finding electrical waste when stopping targeted shipping containers.</p>

	<p pid="a.160W.9/1">Clearer origin labelling is a key commitment in the Government's Programme. We want to ensure that consumers have confidence in the origin claims that are being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.160W.9/2">The new EU Regulation on the Provision of Food Information to the consumer has recently been agreed and will improve origin labelling throughout the EU. Under the new rules we successfully negotiated mandatory origin information be required for fresh and frozen meat. Where claims are made concerning the origin of a food, further information on the origin of the main ingredients will have to be given if these are different to the claim. Information is also required where failure to provide origin information could materially mislead the consumer. This is a significant step forward in the provision of better labelling for consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.160W.9/3">As part of the package of measures there will be consideration of whether compulsory origin information is needed for other foods (including milk and dairy products) through a report by the Commission within three years. Also the feasibility for mandatory rules on origin labelling of meat used as an ingredient (such as in bacon and sausages), will be considered by the Commission within two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.160W.9/4">There are sector specific mandatory origin labelling rules for fresh or frozen beef, veal, fish, shellfish, wine, honey, olive oil, eggs, certain fresh fruit and vegetables and poultry imported from outside the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.160W.9/5">We continue to work with industry on ways to improve further transparency in the food chain and, in particular, we are working with the food service sector to improve origin information on food served in catering establishments.</p>

	<p pid="a.165W.6/1">The Government do not collect these statistics. The matter is primarily one for Digital UK, the independent not-for-profit company leading the implementation of switchover. Digital UK's Tracker survey to September 2011 indicates 93% of UK households are now watching a digital TV service on their main television set. In the London TV region, the figure is 89%. Digital UK does not hold the information requested on the number of businesses prepared for digital switchover, but evidence to date suggests they are usually well prepared. Digital UK provides digital TV switchover information to chambers of commerce and other business organisations as part of its information campaign.</p>

There is no statutory duty on local authorities to provide careers guidance but many do so as a means of supporting young people to participate.

It is for local authorities to decide how they should meet these responsibilities, taking into account the needs of their local communities. We know that in some areas they are already working with schools to establish sensible transition plans, while in others they are choosing to maintain a full careers service for longer. The Secretary of State for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40593" name="Michael Gove">the right hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, has powers to intervene if a local authority is failing to meet its statutory duties.

	<p pid="a.169W.5/3">Young people receive advice on their futures from many different sources but some will benefit from face-to-face support that raises their aspirations and guides them onto a successful career path. We will issue statutory guidance to highlight the need for schools to consider this and other essential issues in pursuance of the new duty.</p>

	<p pid="a.170W.4/4">We take our responsibility for all those we employ very seriously and have put in place measures to reduce the risks that they face, and we continually keep our policy under review. Where staff face a serious threat our options include providing protected accommodation, giving safety advice to them and their families, granting extended leave or transferring staff to different jobs. In serious cases we may help staff relocate, either within Afghanistan, to a third country or, in exceptional cases, to the UK.

Under the Grant for Business Investment scheme, information on grant offers for sums greater than &#163;75,000 is normally published following the payment of the first instalment of the grant, including the name and location of the recipient of the grant and the size of the grant offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.6/3">The scheme is not open to port-only applications. Our objective for this funding is to support the development of offshore wind manufacturing capacity, which will need to be at coastal locations. We therefore expect all applications to involve large scale manufacturing proposals and to be led either by a manufacturer, or to be jointly led by a port/landowner and a manufacturer.</p>

	<p pid="a.200W.5/1">The real terms increase in the national health service budget has a precise meaning. Real terms is measured against the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator. The GDP deflator is the general measure of price increases across the whole economy. It reflects the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in the economy. Real terms is the cash increase above the GDP deflator.</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.5/2">Funding growth over the spending review period, using latest inflation forecasts, is about 1% real; a cash increase over the spending review period of &#163;12.6 billion, as shown in the following table.</p>

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) does not hold data relating to costs and only holds obesity data for in-patient care in hospitals. Obesity-related care in a primary care setting is not included in these figures. 2. A count of finished consultant episodes is not the same as the number of patients; a person may have more than one episode of care in a given period. 3. Activity includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector. 4. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. 5. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis: the number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03), primary and secondary diagnosis fields in an HES record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code used to identify obesity is E66. 6. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.206W.4/1">The Political and Constitutional Reform (PCR) Committee is scrutinising draft Government legislation which would extend the timetable for UK parliamentary elections from 17 to 25 working days. In the context of this proposal, I wrote to the Committee suggesting that it would be helpful to welcome views as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process on whether the existing deadline for postal vote applications (which is currently 11 days before polling day) should be moved further in advance of the date of the poll. The Government will consider any recommendations made by the PCR Committee carefully, although we would be reluctant to erode the flexibility for electors which the current deadline offers.</p>

	<p pid="a.213W.0/2">BIS has formal and informal programmes which foster links with industry. For example staff working on Enterprise spend a week in a small business each year. In addition BIS has recently launched an outreach programme where staff spend at least one to two days with other organisations to learn about how they operate and the challenges they face.

However, these qualifications may not necessarily be the ones on which successful admission to the institution was based; a student whose highest qualification on entry is not vocational may additionally hold a vocational qualification at a lower level, and vice versa.

	<p pid="a.219W.6/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC) does not hold details of expenditure on research directly relating to pancreatic cancer. It would not be possible to undertake the necessary analysis in the time available.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.6/2">In 2010 the MRC spent &#163;107.9 million on cancer and research relevant to cancer. This includes a broad portfolio of both site-specific and general cancer research, some of which will be relevant to pancreatic cancer. It is often the case that research which has been classified as being undertaken in one site may also have implications in another such as pancreatic cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.6/3">Current MRC investments in the area include funding for the Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology and Biology, a joint strategic investment between MRC, Cancer Research UK and Oxford university aimed at yielding new advances in radiation treatment of patients with cancer, including studies specifically on pancreatic cancer. The MRC's Cancer Cell Unit is also carrying out work in the area of pancreatic cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.6/4">The MRC provides funding for research through a range of grants and personal awards to scientists in universities, medical schools and other research institutes and welcomes investigator-initiated research proposals in all areas of research. The MRC's primary considerations in funding decisions are research excellence and importance to health; however, high quality proposals in areas of particular strategic importance may be given priority in competition for funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.6/5">Further details on research programmes that have received funding from the MRC can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.6/6"><a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/ResearchPortfolio/index.htm">http://www.mrc.ac.uk/ResearchPortfolio/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.219W.6/7">The Department of Health spent &#163;91 million on cancer research in 2009-10. Total expenditure on pancreatic cancer research cannot be disaggregated from this figure. The Department's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) welcomes high quality funding applications for research into any aspect of human health, including pancreatic cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.6/8">In August 2011, the Government announced &#163;800 million investment over five years in a series of NIHR biomedical research centres and units, including &#163;61.5 million funding for the Royal Marsden/Institute of Cancer Research Biomedical Research Centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.220W.5/1">Public engagement with science and engineering is vital if the UK is to realise the full potential of its significant investments in science and research. We must inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. We must also ensure that members of the public have confidence in research being carried out and that researchers are able to listen and respond to the aspirations and concerns the public have. BIS and the Royal Academy of Engineering jointly commissioned the Business motivations for engaging the public in science and engineering report. As the report makes clear, businesses are already an important contributor to the spectrum of science and engineering engagement activities, particularly when it comes to inspiring the next generation. Together with businesses themselves, BIS will consider over the coming months where businesses could add value through involvement in other activities.</p>

These programmes include STEMNET and its 27,000 strong cohort of STEM ambassadors, the Big Bang Fair, the National Science and Engineering Competition and National Science and Engineering Week.
