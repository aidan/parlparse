	<p pid="a.485W.3/1">Part 4 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) regulates the giving of donations to registered political parties and their members. Section 54 of PPERA sets out clearly that only 'permissible donors' may make donations to political parties and what constitutes a 'permissable donor'.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.3/2">The Act does not set out specifically whether different types .of public sector body may be classed as permissible donors, although it does make provision in section 55 for payments to parties from public funds to be treated as permissible donations. There may also be some public bodies which fall into the various categories of permissible donor in section 54. In those cases it would be the responsibility of the political party to decide whether a public sector body that wished to make a donation is indeed a permissible donor. Any such donation would be subject to the regime laid out in PPERA governing the reporting of all donations to political parties and penalties for accepting a donation from a body that was not a permissible donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.3/3">In addition to the political party ensuring that the public sector body, in question is a permissible donor, anyone acting for such a body would need to consider whether it had sufficient legal authority to make a donation to a political party under the legislation (or other instrument) by which is was constituted.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-06-06a.137694.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-06-06a.485W.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="485W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070606/text/70606w0001.htm#07060684002280">
	<p pid="a.485W.7/1">The consultation draft of the Highway Code issued in February 2006 included the following wording for the rule on use of cycle facilities:</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/2" class="indent">&quot;Use cycle routes when practicable and cycle facilities such as advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings where they are provided, as they can make your journey safer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/3">Many responses to the consultation objected to the use of the words &quot;where they are provided&quot; and so these words were removed from the version of rule 61 laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March 2007</phrase>, which read:</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/4" class="indent">&quot;Use cycle routes and cycle facilities such as advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings whenever possible, as they can make your journey safer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/5">As well as removing &quot;where they are provided&quot;, the qualification on the use of facilities was moved towards the end of the sentence to make clear that it applies to all the types of facility mentioned in the rule and not just cycle routes. This was intended to avoid any false misapprehension that there is any degree of compulsion in the use of such facilities. As the introduction to the Highway Code makes clear, only rules that include the words &quot;Must&quot; or &quot;Must Not&quot; are mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/6">The wording of that qualification was been changed from &quot;when practicable&quot; to &quot;wherever possible&quot; in the interests of clarity and the use of plain English. This change does not in any way affect the substance or status of the advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/7">Rule 63 of the version of the proposed revised Highway Code laid before Parliament also included the words &quot;wherever possible&quot;. This rule was unchanged from rule 49 of the current version of the Highway Code first published in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/8">However, cyclists remained concerned by the new wording. Following discussions with CTC, the cyclists' organisation, we have now proposed further changes to both rules 61 and 63, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/9" class="indent">61 Cycle Facilities. Use cycle routes, advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings unless at the time it is unsafe to do so. Use of these facilities is not compulsory and will depend on your experience and skills, but they can make your journey safer.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/10" class="indent">63 Cycle Lanes. These are marked by a white line (which may be broken) along the carriageway (see Rule 140). When using a cycle lane, keep within the lane when practicable. When leaving a cycle lane check before pulling out that it is safe to do so and signal your intention clearly to other road users. Use of these facilities is not compulsory and will depend on your experience and skills, but they can make your journey safer.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.7/11">We are currently seeking views from road safety, cycling and walking representative groups on these proposals. Subject to considering their views, we intend to include these revised versions of rules 61 and 63 in the new edition of the Highway Code, which we now expect to issue in September.</p>

	<p pid="a.486W.2/1">The information about the UK's contribution to the programme is not available in the form requested. The total UK contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA) element of the programme since 1997 is &euro;142 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/2">The European Union (EU) and the member states of ESA jointly fund the design and development programme for Galileo on a 50/50 basis. DTI and DfT co-fund the UK element of the ESA subscription.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/3">UK subscriptions already paid and future commitments to the ESA element of the programme total &euro;142 million, of which DfT is contributing&pound;22.45 million (approximately &euro;31 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/4">Programme subscriptions to ESA are subject to inflationary increases and can vary from predicted profiles. UK contributions to the different phases of the programme are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/5" class="indent">&euro;15.3 million&mdash;subscription to the definition phase (1998 prices);</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/6" class="indent">&euro;95.7 million&mdash;original subscription to the development phase (2001 prices);</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/7" class="indent">&euro;31.0 million&mdash;additional contribution for the development phase (2001 prices).</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.2/8">The EU's contribution to the design and development programme is made from the EC budget and is estimated by the Commission to be &euro;790 million. The United Kingdom makes its contributions to the EC Budget as a whole and not to individual spending programmes within it. There is not therefore a specific United Kingdom contribution to the design and development programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.0/1">The Leicester city council's building schools for the future (BSF) project is part of the first wave of projects to be procured and as such has led the way in dealing with issues that will assist and inform the approach of BSF projects in later waves. It has become necessary to take time to get right the design of two of the schools, to ensure that this investment delivers value for money and transforms the education of pupils there. In addition, the withdrawal from the supply chain of the preferred bidder's ICT partner, and the subsequent process of appointing a replacement, has required careful management to ensure the authority's ICT specification would still be met by the new provider on the same or better commercial terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.0/2">Following a delay in signing the contract beyond the date up to which the original bid price was fixed, the preferred bidder requested approximately &pound;700,000 to cover their estimated additional inflation costs. Following negotiations between the council and the preferred bidder, the majority of this will be borne by the preferred bidder.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.0/3">Work on the three schools named is expected to start in July 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.0/4">While there have been delays on the project, as it is now making good progress, I currently have no plans to have discussions with Leicester city's officials on BSF. My officials and Partnerships for Schools will continue to lead communications with the authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.0/5">The decision by Centerprise to withdraw from the preferred bidder's supply chain was entirely an issue for those parties, although Partnerships for Schools, on behalf of the Department, has been closely involvedin discussions with regard to this development. Partnerships for Schools continue to assist the council to ensure the best outcome for the authority, its pupils, teaching staff, parents and others.</p>

	<p pid="a.496W.8/2">Since their introduction in 2000, all foundation degrees have incorporated &quot;progression agreements&quot; as a core element of the qualification. Progression agreements are designed to ensure that all foundation degree students can identify appropriate opportunities for progression on to more advanced study, should they so wish. Further study will typically be the final year of an honours degree programme, but progression could also be to a relevant professional or higher vocational qualification. Progression routes are negotiated by institutions at the time of establishing new Foundation Degree programmes. The 'Foundation Degree Qualification Benchmark' statement, produced by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, sets out detailed guidance for institutions on how progression routes should be established and maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.8/3">Progression agreements will continue to be an essential aspect of all foundation degree programmes, regardless of the awarding institution. The proposals in the Further Education and Training Bill to allow further education institutions in England to apply for the power to award foundation degrees only will not change this core characteristic of the foundation degree. I intend to table a Government amendment that seeks to address the issue of progression on the face of the Bill.</p>

We do not collect information about the numbers of children whose parents provide education at home, and it would be impractical to do so given the transient nature of some of this type of provision. A recent study on the prevalence of home education in England, conducted by York Consulting estimated that there were around 16,000 children being educated at home that were known to the local authority. We have not made any estimate of the number of home educated children that are not known to their local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.508W.5/1">Reading mentors are an invaluable resource for many schools in supporting children to read well. The Department is currently providing funding to Volunteer Reading Help (VRH); a charitable organisation which recruits, trains and places volunteers to give one-to-one help twice a week to children aged 6-11 years who find reading a challenge. Currently VRH has around 2000 volunteer readers working with around 5,000 children.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.5/2">For a minority of young children with significant literacy difficulties an intensive intervention delivered by specialist teachers is needed if they are to be able to read and access the wider curriculum. Every Child A Reader does this by placing highly skilled Reading Recovery teachers into schools to provide intensive one-to-one or small group support to children most in need. Every Child A Reader will be rolled out nationally, benefiting over 30,000 children a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.5/3">Estimates from a nationally representative sample survey in 2004 (The Deployment and Impact of Support Staff in Schools) indicated that there were 4,539 full-time equivalent learning mentors in schools in England and 24 in Wales. These are paid support staff who worked in the school (including in the provision of extended services for pupils) whether employed by the school, local authority or other body, but not unpaid volunteers or other unpaid helpers. A further survey was conducted in the spring term 2005-06 and updated figures will be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.508W.8/1">The Department had a schools private finance unit from approximately 1996 to 2004. As a result of its work, there are now 107 PFI contracts with a value of &pound;3.97 billion which are delivering buildings, ICT and other services to over 840 schools. The Department cannot work out the cost of the establishment or running of the unit over that period without incurring disproportionate cost. The unit began in 1996 with one full-time member of staff and, at its largest, had around 17 staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.8/2">The Department currently has one PFI strategy adviser, at grade 7, and the average cost of employing a grade 7 is &pound;65,000. The adviser's function is to work with the private sector, central and local government and schools to promote excellent service to schools through PFI. Other staff in the Department's Schools Capital Division also contribute to PFI work, and the Department works closely with Partnerships UK and the 4ps to ensure that local authorities and schools have the support they need. For example, Partnerships UK runs an operational taskforce which schools and local authorities can ring for help with PFI issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.8/3">The Department previously assessed its performance on PFI in terms of contracts signed. Now that all 107 PFI contracts have been signed, we are considering what performance indicators might be appropriate for their build and operational phases.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.8/4">All schools PFI is now within Building Schools for the Future, which is run by Partnerships for Schools, one of the Department's non-departmental public bodies.</p>

	<p pid="a.509W.2/1">We would not expect the through-life costs of schools built under different programmes to be significantly different. Those procuring schools should have regard to the recommended building and design standards in our range of Building Bulletins and other publications, including &quot;Finding the Right Solution&mdash;a Guide to Options Appraisal&quot;.

	<p pid="a.509W.2/2">Partnerships for Schools, our delivery partner in Building Schools for the Future, challenges local authorities to achieve best through-life, value for money solutions no matter which procurement approach is used. Where finance is through Private Finance Initiative credits, through-life costs are fixed for the public sector when the contract is signed. We encourage local authorities to use Building Schools for the Future Local Educational Partnerships or acceptable alternative arrangement for all their schools' building procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.509W.2/3">Partnerships for Schools is currently collecting life-cycle costs and other information on schools in Building Schools for the Future as part of a benchmarking database to enable comparisons to be made in the future. Further, we have commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to evaluate the Building Schools for the Future programme. This will include comparisons of cost data with schools where investment is through other programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.510W.5/14">These costs are rounded to the nearest &pound;1 million and cover property damage and the costs of the fire and rescue services attending the fires. They do not include the consequential costs of, for instance, providing alternative accommodation when need, or disruption to education. However, these costs are taken account of in the fire risk assessment tool which I launched on<phrase class="date" code="2007-02-26">26 February</phrase>. This provides clear guidance on when sprinklers should be installed, and our presumption is that all new schools will have them fitted.</p>

Provision for children with SEN and disabilities, including support for those with a visual impairment is made by schools and local authorities through the SEN and disability frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.511W.2/2">In particular, part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires schools and local authorities to plan to improve access to the curriculum and written materials for disabled pupils over time. In addition,the new disability equality duty introduced by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 requires all public bodies including schools and local authorities to promote disability equality more widely. We also continue to invest significant resources to support the education of children with SEN and disabilities; some &pound;4.5 billion in 2006/07.</p>

	<p pid="a.512W.3/2">Although the Government have no plans to limit the amount of remuneration that administrators may draw, The Insolvency Service is undertaking a project to modernise the insolvency rules. One of the changes being considered is a requirement for all insolvency office-holders to provide details of remuneration charged on a regular basis and to provide creditors with clear rights to seek better particulars and to enable them to challenge those amounts where they consider them to be excessive. This should ensure greater transparency and accountability for creditors of amounts of remuneration drawn by administrators and other office-holders.</p>

	<p pid="a.513W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.0/2">The question is framed in terms of emissions, whereas public exposure is the real point of interest. I am informed by the Health Protection Agency's Radiation Protection Division (HPA-RPD) that it is neither straightforward nor meaningful to perform the calculation requested because of the different beam patterns formed by different types of base station antennas and mobile phones, and the consequent different spatial distributions of absorbed energy in the body. Moreover, any region around a high-powered base station site, e.g. with 32 dbW output, where localised exposure of the head could be comparable to that from using a mobile phone would not normally be accessible to the general public.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.0/3">The HPA-RPD, has advised that the electromagnetic field exposure guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) should be adopted in the United Kingdom. The ICNIRP guidelines are set to avoid adverse effects of exposure on health. Mobile phone base station installations in the UK are designed to comply with the ICNIRP exposure guidelines, as are mobile phones.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.0/4">Techniques for measuring specific absorption rate (SAR) in the head when a phone is held to the ear have been standardised and the information for individual handsets can be found on the website of the Mobile Manufacturer's Forum at <a href="http://www.mmfai.org.uk">www.mmfai.org.uk</a>. Typically the SAR values quoted for mobile phones are in the range of 20-70 per cent. of the ICNIRP guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.0/5">Ofcom (and formerly the Radiocommunications Agency) has been performing an audit involving measurements of exposure to base station signals at many different sites in the UK since 2001. The maximum exposures measured are well below the ICNIRP reference level. Information about the audit is available at</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.0/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.sitefinder.ofcom.org.uk">www.sitefinder.ofcom.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.0/7">In summary, it is difficult to readily compare base station exposures and mobile phone exposures because the pattern of absorption of radio energy in the body is different. In both cases, public exposure is expected to be within the ICNIRP guidelines, and by a considerable margin for base stations.</p>

	<p pid="a.517W.9/12">The figures relate to cases dealt with at court only. They do not include cases in which decisions not to prosecute were taken, cases dealt with by diversion, cases withdrawn before trial or cases where cautions were given. The DPP/PPS figures include cases prosecuted on behalf of various agencies, such as the Driver and Vehicle Agency, as well as those submitted by the police. The figures for 2006 are provisional.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.9/13">Only composite figures for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Public Prosecution Service are available. Although the PPS came into existence as a statutory body on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June 2005</phrase>, the process of taking on police prosecutions commenced before that date through a number of pilot schemes. Further, the process of rolling out the PPS across Northern Ireland means that the transfer of responsibility for prosecuting cases is staged. By <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2007</phrase> the PPS will have responsibility for all cases investigated by the police, save a decreasing number of cases already before the courts at that date.</p>

	<p pid="a.521W.2/2"><i> </i>East Lothian has benefited from a number of programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing employment levels and improving employment opportunities for local people. These have included national programmes like the new deal which, since 1998, has helped 1,970 people in East Lothian into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/3">In October 2006 the new deal plus for lone parents pilot was extended to Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders, meaning eligible lone parents in those areas, including people in East Lothian, can access the extra help and support offered through the initiative. The pilot focuses on a package combining access to good affordable childcare and strong financial work incentives. We recently announced that new deal plus for lone parents will be extended to March 2011 in pilot areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/4">Eligible lone parents in East Lothian leaving benefits for full-time employment can also claim an in-work credit of &pound;40 a week, payable for the first 12 months in work and between October 2004 and January 2007 180 lone parents in the East Lothian constituency received the in-work credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/5">In December, our Pathways to Work programme will also be rolled out in Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders, including East Lothian. This will provide an integrated package of employment advice and health and financial support to help people on incapacity benefits move into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/6">The welfare to work measures we have introduced have, since1997, helped to: increase the employment level in East Lothian by 3.3 percentage points; reduce the number of jobseeker's allowance claimants by63 per cent. reduce long term claimant unemployment by 88 per cent. reduce youth claimant unemployment by 47 per cent. and reduce long term youth claimant unemployment by 83 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.532W.5/1">Kate Barker's Review of Housing Supply recommended that a step-change in housing supply was necessary to address worsening affordability due to a long term undersupply of housing. Government's response, published in 2005, set out an ambition to increase housing supply to 200,000 per annum by 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.5/2">Good progress has been made, with supply increasing from a low of around 130,000 new homes in 2001-02, to over 180,000 in 2005-06. We recognise however, that we still need to go further to address demand, and are determined to maintain momentum.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.5/3">Since publishing the Barker Response, we have been working to implement the measures it announced. Among other achievements, we have published a new Planning Policy Statement 3, announced a series of new Growth Points, announced proposals that all new homes should be built to zero carbon standards by 2016, and set up a National Housing and Planning Advice Unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.5/4">In addition our HomeBuy scheme will help people on modest incomes to get a step on the housing ladder. The Government's HomeBuy scheme will expand the opportunity for home ownership to over a 120,000 households between 2005 and 2010. In 2006-08 we are investing &pound;970 million through the National Affordable Housing programme to deliver 35,000 new low cost home ownership properties.</p>

	<p pid="a.537W.0/1">Estimating the precise impact of buy-to-let on the housing market is difficult and there is little evidence available. The buy-to-let market has expanded rapidly in the last 10 years since the creation of dedicated buy-to-let mortgages in 1996, rising from 6 per cent. of the private rented stock in 2000 to almost 35 per cent. in 2006. Despite this increase in buy-to-let, the overall size of the private rented sector has remained relatively stable and has only experienced a slight increase as a proportion of total stock from about 10 per cent. to 12 per cent. There has been an increase in the proportion of private rented sector properties that are buy-to-let.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/2">Evidence from the English House Conditions Survey shows that between 1996 and 2004 the percentage of 'decent' homes in the PRS has increased by nearly35 per cent. compared to only 18 per cent. in the owner-occupied sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/3">In recent years, due to the increase in supply of private rented properties, rents have not been rising as fast as house prices. This suggests that buy-to-letis unlikely to have had a significant impact on homelessness, which is currently at its lowest level since the early 1980s.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.2/1">If I may refer to the answer provided in June 2006, PQ 4875 05/06. The updated figures are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/2" class="italic"> Accenture</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/3" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Original estimated cost&mdash;&pound;34.10 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/4" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Recently estimated costs&mdash;&pound;68.05 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/5" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> Outturn costs&mdash;&pound;68.05 million (plus enhancement work to the value of &pound;928,000 in 2005-06 and &pound;2.7 million in 2006-07.)</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/6">Support and maintenance costs are included in the original contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/7" class="italic"> IBM</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/8" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Original estimated cost&mdash; &pound;85 million per year;</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/9" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Recently estimated costs&mdash;&pound;97.9 million per year;</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/10" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> Outturn costs: 2004-05&mdash;&pound;28.26 million; 2005-06&mdash;&pound;111.12 million; 2006-07&mdash;&pound;147.56 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/11">The estimated costs are based on initial predicted demand for IBM services; the higher outturn costs represent the increased demand for IBM services by projects in delivering DEFRA's strategic objectives. The contract with IBM incorporates sufficient flexibility to allow significant variation in demand, with costs varying directly in proportion.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/12" class="italic"> LogicaCMG</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/13" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Original estimated cost&mdash;&pound;16.10 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/14" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Recently estimated costs&mdash;&pound;18.42 million (total life time cost);</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/15" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> Outturn costs&mdash;cost of supply was &pound;6.7 million in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/16">The balance is for support and maintenance to be paid over the remainder of the contract, which endsin 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/17">As with the previous answer, smaller local IT contracts will also have been agreed; however, information on these is neither managed nor maintained centrally, and therefore it would incur disproportionate costs to collate. Only by reference to such information would it be possible to determine which are the fourth and fifth largest IT contracts, agreed with outside suppliers, in the Department.</p>

In particular, the UK Government are key contributors to the work of the IUCN (World Conservation Union) African Elephant Specialist Group. Attention often focuses on the ivory trade issue, which CITES is responsible for monitoring. However, there are broader issues that also need to be taken forward at a continent-wide level to address the range of threats to elephants; including habitat fragmentation and human/elephant conflict in Africa and Asia. The UK continues to take an interest in how the range states tackle these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.557W.2/1">The UK was instrumental in tabling the proposal for a CITES workshop on the internet trade in endangered species. This and other work programme proposals will be considered at the June Conference of Parties, along with funding issues. A costed work programme has been tabled by the CITES Secretariat that will establish how individual projects should be funded. Until the outcome of those discussions are known, parties, including the UK, are not in a position to say which elements of any programme they will support and how. Nevertheless, the UK, having put forward the proposal for the internet workshop, will do what it can to ensure that this takes place.</p>

	<p pid="a.558W.0/1">Investigations into the origins ofthe populations of &quot;diabrotica virgifera&quot; found in the south-east of England are very difficult because the means by which &quot;D. virgifera&quot; was introduced are unclear. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that &quot;D. virgifera&quot; is spread by aircraft. However, to date no studies have been carried out on the presence of potentially invasive insects on aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.0/2">A study is currently being conducted to investigate whether the populations of &quot;D. virgifera&quot; found in south east England are related to populations of &quot;D. virgifera&quot; in eastern Europe and the USA. The results are due to be published later this year. However, these types of studies cannot specifically pinpoint the origin of an introduced species, and at best the results will demonstrate whether the populations of &quot;D. virgifera&quot; in south east England are more likely to be related to those from eastern Europe, the USA or both.</p>

	<p pid="a.559W.0/1">An emergency medical technician (EMT) will have a sound knowledge of the basic concepts of patient care, having completed a training programme, worked under supervision for a probationary year, and achieved the national EMT award.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.0/2">EMTs are able to make a provisional diagnosis, use their knowledge and skills to identify and differentiate between life-threatening and non-life threatening conditions, and be able to interpret and record baseline observations and gain a basic individual, familial and social history of a patient during an assessment of the patient's needs. From this they can determine the extent of patients' illness or injury and initiate treatment, based on the principles of the current national clinical guidelines, in an attempt to stabilise the condition. This will include the use of, amongst other things, airway adjuncts, defibrillation, basic analgesic and oxygen therapies, and administration of a number of medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.0/3">The precise difference in care that can be provided by a paramedic compared to an EMT will vary between national health service ambulance trusts as it will depend on the patient group directives in use by each trust for paramedics, and any additional training that the employer may have given their paramedics or EMTs over and above the national qualifications. However the core differences between the two roles are that:</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.0/4" class="indent">paramedics are registered health professionals and are therefore required to maintain a portfolio of continual professional development;</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.0/5" class="indent">paramedics can conduct a more thorough and detailed physical examination of the patient;</p>

	<p pid="a.559W.0/7" class="indent">paramedics are able to practice in accordance with current legislation governing the use of prescription-only medicines and controlled drugs by paramedics.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.0/8">Paramedic skills, over and above those also possessed by EMTs, are only used in a minority of cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.562W.8/1">All dentists with national health service primary care contracts are required to provide services in accordance with relevant guidance issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), including NICE'S clinical guideline on recall intervals between routine dental examinations. NICE recommends that this recall interval should be determined specifically for each individual patient and should be tailored to meet his or her needs, on the basis of an assessment of disease levels and risk of, or from, dental disease. The shortest recommended interval for a routine dental recall for patients is three months. The longest recommended interval is 12 months for patients under 18 years of age and 24 months for adult patients. The clinical guideline indicates that dentists should discuss the recommended recall interval with the patient and review it at the next oral health review.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.8/2">The Department's advice to patients, reflected on the Department's website and in the patient information leaflet &quot;NHS dentistry in England: information for patients&quot;, is that they should follow their dentist's advice on when to go back for regular check ups. The advice indicates that, if a patient's dental health is good, they may only have to go for a check up every two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.8/2">Prior to April 2006, most primary dental services were provided under former general dental service (GDS) arrangements. These were demand-led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much national health service work they chose to undertake. PCTs were not given fixed GDS funding allocations. In a number of areas, personal dental service (PDS) pilots were also established, where some former GDS dental practices and some directly managed dental services converted to locally commissioned arrangements to test new ways of working and new forms of contract remuneration. PDS pilots were funded by PCTs from supplementary allocations issued by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.8/3">The following table shows the available data on expenditure on the former GDS and PDS services for the constituencies of Shrewsbury and Atcham and Telford for 2004-05 and 2005-06. The difference between gross and net expenditure is the contribution to costs from dental charges collected directly from patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.569W.2/3">In the five years to the end of March 2007, we have invested over &pound;400 million of additional money into the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provided by the national health service and local authorities. These funds have assisted in meeting and then maintaining the Department's public service agreement standard of a comprehensive CAMHS, including services for young people with an eating disorder. Further funds totalling over &pound;100 million have been made available to the NHS and local authorities in 2007-08 to help maintain this progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.2/4">As primary care trusts (PCTs) consider local health needs and commissioned services, they will need to assess whether the right balance exists between in-patient care and home-based care, particularly at a highly specialised levels, to help individuals with eating disorders. This means that PCTs will need to consider their commissioning role, where they work with local organisations and opportunities exist to commission services jointly, for example, where voluntary organisations can provide services more effectively than statutory services.</p>
	<p pid="a.569W.2/5">Between 2004 and 2009, the Department is also funding a five-year initiative, Shift, to tackle the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health issues in England.

	<p pid="a.572W.14/2"><i> </i>Action to tackle age discrimination in access to health and social care has been a central aspect of the national service framework (NSF) for older people. The NSF for older people recognised that age discrimination in access to health and social care exists. It made the clear statement that age discrimination would not be tolerated and set out the developing actions to address this.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.14/3">The Healthcare Commission report, &quot;Living Well in Later Life&quot;, published in March 2006, found that explicit age discrimination had declined since the NSF was published, as a result of national health service trusts auditing policies on access to services and social services departments reviewing their eligibility criteria for social care services. In the first phase of the NSF for older people, there was a significant improvement in access to services, including over 100 per cent. rise in breast screening of the over-65s, increased hip replacements and cataract operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.14/4">In April 2006 the National Director for Older People, Professor Ian Philp, published the second phase of the NSF, &quot;A New Ambition for Old Age&quot;, encouraging the involvement of older people in service planning and also focusing on improving the integration of services and the promotion of healthy ageing. The report recognised that huge strides have been made in improving the health of older people. Death rates for heart disease, stroke and cancer among older people are down. Discrimination in treatment is now less likely. For example, heart surgery in the over 75s has risen from 2 per cent. to 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.14/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-27">27 January 2007</phrase>, Ian Philp launched &quot;A Recipe for Care&mdash;Not a Single Ingredient&quot;. This report sets out the challenge ahead in looking after older people and why services need to change to ensure older people get the best possible care.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.14/6">Departmental policy and guidance requires the assessment and provision of services to be undertaken based on need. We expect services to promote independence, choice, control as well as safety. We make it clear that all staff should treat older people with dignity and respect, whether it is in a hospital, care home or their own home.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.14/7">The Government are currently developing the Discrimination Law Review Green Paper, which will seek to address age discrimination in all public services.</p>

	<p pid="a.578W.5/1">Each provider of the bedside telephone and television service set their own charges subject to the limited concession requirements set by the Department. The Department is not in a position to dictate ongoing price policies of private companies who take sole financial liability for their operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/2">Following the conclusion of an Office of Communications (Ofcom) investigation, in January 2006, the Department set up a review group to explore how the bedside services could be provided without charging as high a price for the incoming calls. The review group concluded that there was no easy quick fix solution to this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/3">The fixed price of the outgoing call cost up to April 2007 was 10p per minute (minimum 20p).</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/4">The incoming call charges have remained constant for two of the service providers at 39p per minute off peak and 49p per minute peak. Charges per minute for the third service provider were; 14p in 2002, 17p in 2003, 20p in 2004 and it currently charges 35p.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/5">The average charge for use of the television since 2001 is &pound;3.50 for two of the service providers and &pound;3.00 for the third, for a 24-hour period. Some of the service providers offer a reduced rate television service for long stay patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/6">The largest provider of the systems recently reconfigured its charging structure, which resulted in increasing its outgoing call charge to 26 per minute (minimum 40p) and reducing its television package to &pound;2.90 for a 24-hour period.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/7">It is for individual national health service bodies to set the level of charges for car parking provided on their premises, taking into account local circumstances. The Department of Health has issued guidance which recommends considering concessions for certain types of patient, but final decisions lie with the NHS body.</p>

	<p pid="a.579W.8/3">NICE is currently carrying out an appraisal of Lucentis and Macugen, which are now both licensed for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, and final guidance is due to be published in September 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.584W.5/1">Support from midwives, health visitors and other health professionals is provided to families through the Child Health Promotion Programme, the universal child health service aimed at preventing ill health and promoting health and well being. The core service is set out in standard one of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services. However, all families are different and some need more support than others do. Health visitors and their teams who deliver the child health promotion programme will make sure that the most at risk children have more support.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.5/2">We are also testing an intensive nurse-led home visiting programme for the most at risk families. The Nurse Family Partnership Programme has been developed over 30 years in the United States where it has achieved impressive reductions in accidental and non-accidental injuries. We are testing this approach in 10 sites across England where specially trained health visitors and midwives are delivering the programme to first time young parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.586W.0/22">Until the call-in of CNST claims by NHSLA in April 2002, member organisations paid part of the cost of claims made under CNST. Excesses are still payable on the non-clinical schemes (LTPS and PES). The cost of these excesses, being carried by individual NHS organisations, is not included in the NHSLA's figures. As part of the call-in process it reimbursed the above-excess costs already incurred by member trusts on these claims. Thus the apparent bulges in these years do not reflect an increase in overall claims expenditure, but rather one-off reimbursements of expenditure already incurred (and accounted for) by member trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.587W.5/4">While some representations have been made by organisations, including those representing patient groups, on the operation of board of director meetings in foundation trusts, the National Health Service Act 2006 only allows for a foundation trusts to open meetings of the board of governors to the public. There is no equivalent provision for meetings of the board of directors. This would be a matter for each trust. Monitor (the statutory name of which is the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts) has however issued a code of governance for foundation trusts which advises directors to follow a policy of openness and transparency in its proceedings and decision making unless this conflicts with a need to protect the wider interests of the public or the foundation trusts, including commercial-in-confidence matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.601W.0/1">The Government believe that mediation can offer considerable advantages over going to court in the settling of family disputes, especially where children are involved. To support this, the Family Mediation Helpline (0845 60 26 627) began operating in January 2006. The helpline provides information about family mediation, advice as to the likely suitability of specific cases for mediation and details of and referrals to local mediation services. To date, the helpline has received 2,900 calls, made over 1,100 referrals to mediation services and there have been around 10,000 visitsmade to the supporting website at <a href="http://www.FamilyMediationHelpline.co.uk">www.FamilyMediationHelpline.co.uk</a>. In order to ensure the Helpline becomes better known, publicity materials, including a family mediation DVD produced in conjunction with National Family Mediation to provide information about family mediation to members of the public, have been widely distributed to all family courts, Citizens' Advice bureaux and family solicitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.0/2">There are 10 in-court referral to mediation schemes, where family mediators work together with the courts and often with CAFCASS to refer appropriate cases. We are undertaking judicial awareness seminars across England and Wales aimed at raising awareness among judges and magistrates.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.0/3">Finally, the Legal Services Commission's proposals to revise the family fee structure will remove the financial disincentives for solicitors to make referrals to mediation, which has historically been alleged by the mediation profession to be an obstacle to increasing mediation referrals. Under the proposals it would be in the interests of the solicitor to make a referral to mediation and also at an earlier stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.0/4">Publicly funded family mediation is available to eligible clients who have what is defined as a family dispute. If publicly funded clients are in receipt of private law family legal advice, then they are obliged to consider the use of family mediation before they proceed to a court hearing. The Legal Services Commission is actively seeking to increase the use of mediation and encourage appropriate referrals.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.0/5">At this stage, there are no plans to fund an expansion of family mediation services many of which are private businesses and run for profit.</p>

	<p pid="a.601W.3/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) has researched the impact upon mediation services of its proposals for a revised mediation remuneration structure, which aligns the for profit (FP) and not for profit (NfP) sectors onto the same fee scheme. The partial regulatory impact assessment concluded that 70 per cent. of the 200 mediation service providers will gain financially under the proposals. In common with other mediation providers, Hampshire Family Mediation (HFM) will no longer receive the fixed annual payment in addition to fees for work done, provided for the last three years, under the transitional NfP contracting arrangements. Under the new arrangements, HFM will be paid through new increased fixed fees, which will apply equally to both FP and NfP providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.3/2">The LSC's proposals to revise the family fee structure will remove the financial disincentives for solicitors to make referrals to mediation, which has historically been alleged by the mediation profession to be an obstacle to increasing mediation referrals. The new family fee schemes for solicitors should encourage more and earlier referrals to mediation providers.</p>
