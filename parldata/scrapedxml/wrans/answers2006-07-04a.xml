	<p pid="a.897W.4/2">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not directly undertake work in this area, but closely monitors research commissioned by the European Union, Research Councils and other Government Departments to identify, characterise, and assess the impact of aircraft emissions on global climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.4/3">A major scientific report assessing the contribution of aircraft to climate change, 'Aviation and the Global Atmosphere', was published in 1999 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). More recently, research carried out under the EU 5th Framework Project, TRADEOFF, has improved modelling techniques and reduced estimates of contrail radiative forcing by two fold compared with the previous estimate from the IPCC. Research carried out under the TRADEOFF project also supported the conclusion that aviation potentially enhances cirrus cloud coverage.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.4/4">Aircraft-induced cirrus clouds reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth, and so mitigate global warming. However, significant uncertainty surrounding this area of study makes it difficult to assess whether increased cloudiness would reduce or increase global warming trends.</p>

	<p pid="a.898W.0/2">Defra has assessed research on the value and uses of the gamma interferon (gIFN) blood test in other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Europe. The test is now a standard tool in the cattle testing armoury of European countries with endemic TB problems, like the Republic of Ireland, Italy, Spain, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.898W.0/3">The gIFN test can detect some infected animals that are negative in the SICCT test (skin test) and may detect animals at an earlier stage of infection. However, the gIFN test is slightly less specific than the SICCT test, which means that it is also more likely to incorrectly identify negative animals as being infected.</p>
	<p pid="a.898W.0/4">In addition to evidence from overseas research, and in order to further improve bTB diagnostics, the Government have conducted a field trial to assess the potential benefits of using of the gIFN blood test in GB. This helped to establish that the use of this test, in parallel with the skin test, has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle where TB has been confirmed, and so hasten the elimination of infected cattle. Preparations are now being made for wider use of the gIFN test in prescribed circumstances. The results of the field trial on gIFN usage will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.898W.6/1">The rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 1997 and 2004 was caused by higher than anticipated levels of economic growth and the recent rise in global energy prices which has altered the relative prices of coal and gas. However, CO2 emissions were still about 5.6 per cent. below 1990 levels and we expect CO2 emissions to fall again in the future given longer term expectations on fuel prices and as a result of policies introduced under the new Climate Change Programme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-04a.81120.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-04a.901W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" colnum="901W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060704/text/60704w1409.htm#06070447000994">
	<p pid="a.901W.5/1">The cause of the green bloom in the waters of the Hampshire Avon below Amesbury is likely to be a combination of environmental factors, including high temperatures, low water flow and consequential increases in the concentration of nutrients. There have been no significant pollution incidents at this location in the river. Rainfall and river flows have been significantly depressed over the last 20 months and, in combination with other environmental factors, this may create opportunities for algal growth. However, the May 2006 period was characterised by periods of very high rainfall. Urban and agricultural runoff may lead to direct discolouration and also contribute to nutrient enrichment in the river.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.5/2">There is, and has been, significant investment and action to improve the quality for the Hampshire Avon in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.5/3">For example, four Wessex Water sewage treatment works discharging into the River Avon have had phosphate stripping installed in their treatment process as part of the previous environmental programme periodic review. Wessex Water's current water quality environment programme for 2005-10 includes schemes to further reduce nutrient loads from sewage effluent discharges. By the end of the 2010 period, two additional sewage treatment works discharging into the River Avon are expected to receive phosphate stripping and the phosphate limits set for the four original works are expected to be reduced to half of their currently permitted limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.5/4">In addition, as part of the requirement introduced by the habitats directive, the Environment Agency have asked Wessex Water to review their abstractions on the Hampshire Avon and assess their effect on the ecology of the river. The findings from this project, which will conclude by March 2008, will contribute to the Habitats Directive Review of Consents and may result in a requirement to reduce the amount of water abstracted by the water company, or for other improvements to be made in the companies' water management operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.5/5">Most recently, the Hampshire Avon catchment has been identified as a priority catchment under the England Catchment-Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative (ECSFDI). The key objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of agricultural pollution and encourage farmers to take action to mitigate the impact of agriculture on the water environment, including the reduction of nutrient inputs.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.5/6">The water framework directive (WFD) is a key driver of future action on water quality. The directive came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-22">22 December 2000</phrase> and requires member states to establish a range of measures to manage water quality by 2009 and to make them operational by 2012. A central objective of the directive is that water bodies should aim to reach good ecological and chemical status by 2015. We are working with stakeholders to develop mechanisms to tackle pressures, including both point and diffuse sources, for inclusion in River Basin Management Plans, and aim to consult on potential options for tackling non-agricultural, agricultural and hydromorphological pressures in the later part of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.905W.5/2">Progress has been good. In addition to the earlier successes of the eradication of polio and the elimination of neonatal tetanus and the increasing distribution of bed nets and their re-treatment (up from 7 per cent. in 2002 to 71 per cent. in 2004-05), the health service has taken on a rapid increase in antiretroviral treatment for HIV and AIDS. 50 sites have treated 46,000 people up from 3,000 two years ago. This is making a real difference: both saving lives and improving the quality of life of those living with HIV and AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.5/3">Critical to this success has been the additional resources made available at hospital and clinic level as a result of the increased aid channelled through the health SWAp. The Emergency Human Resources Programme has in its first year recruited an extra 580 Malawian health professionals. There are 60 volunteer specialists and nurse tutors from overseas filling key vacant posts. The intake of Malawian trainee nurses and doctors has been increased in anticipation of the improvements in infrastructure at training schools that are now under way. New, internationally recruited senior managers have taken over the central medical stores management and are charged with bringing to an end the perennial stock outs that have frustrated the health services. A new maternal mortality road map offers a way forward to address the unacceptably high level of maternal deaths in Malawi. The Ministry of Health is entering service level agreements with private sector providers, particularly the Christian Hospital Association of Malawi, that will also provide the basic essential health package free-of-charge at point of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.5/4">We are encouraging the Government of Malawi to plan for universal access for HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment and to address the further human resources and management requirements that will create. We stand ready to help.</p>

	<p pid="a.907W.6/19">The UK's Regular Budget and Technical Cooperation Fund payments are fixed by reference to slightly modified standardised UN contribution rates. The modification arises because the state membership of the IAEA is not identical to that of the UN, and developing countries were initially &quot;shielded&quot; from paying the full costs of the safeguards component of the Regular Budget. The UK accordingly, this year, paid 6.137 per cent. of the total Regular Budget.

Additional non-financial &quot;in-kind&quot; support to help the Agency deliver its safeguards and other activities is provided through the UK nuclear industry, however the financial value of this could be calculated only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.908W.2/2">As clause 399 subsection (2) of the Company Law Reform Bill sets out, the purpose of the Business Review is to inform members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 158, which requires a director, in performing his duty to promote the success of the company, to have regard (among other matters) to: (a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, (b) the interests of the company's employees, (c) the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, (d) the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment, (e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and (f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company. Subsection (4) of clause 399 requires that the Review is a balanced and comprehensive analysis of (a) the development and performance of the company's business during the financial year, and (b) the position of the company's business at the end of that year, consistent with the size and complexity of the business. The statutory provisions therefore set out the framework of the Business Review, but it is for directors of each company to determine its content according to the circumstances of the particular company. As subsection (6) requires, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance and position of the company's business, the review must include analysis using key performance indicators. Such indicators will make it easier for members to assess the development, performance and position of the company from year to year.</p>

	<p pid="a.922W.8/1">Two formulae influence different parts of local authorities' transport capital allocations from the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.8/2">Firstly a formula is used to distribute the vast majority of the funding support provided for capital highways maintenance. The factors currently considered in this formula relate to roads and bridges. For roads, they are the lengths and conditions of an authority's principal, classified non-principal and unclassified roads. For bridges, they are the size of the bridge stock and the numbers of bridges requiring strengthening or major maintenance. A minimum amount for bridges per authority of &pound;100,000 is applied. The combined roads and bridges allocations are adjusted to ensure an authority's total allocation does not vary by more than 25 per cent. from the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.8/3">Secondly, a formula is being introduced to influence the distribution of the integrated transport block (which is for improvements to local roads and public transport, each of which generally costs less than &pound;5 million). The factors considered in this formula are related directly or indirectly to the transport shared priorities, as agreed between Government and the Local Government Association in 2002. The priorities and variables are shown in the following table. In addition, the formulaic distribution of funding takes into account previous ministerial commitments, European Union objective one designations and South East growth areas.</p>

			<tr pid="a.922W.8/6"> <td><i> Transport shared priority</i></td> <td><i> Formula variable (More = more funding)</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.932W.2/1">As my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) set out in his written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 44-46W, the new constitution provides for a modern and mature relationship between the UK and Gibraltar. I do not think that this description would apply to any relationship based on colonialism. The constitution confirms the right of self-determination of the Gibraltarian people. The realisation of that right must be promoted and respected in conformity with the provisions of the UN Charter and any other applicable international treaties. Gibraltar's right of self-determination is not constrained by the Treaty of Utrecht except insofar as Article X gives Spain the right of refusal should Britain ever renounce Sovereignty. Thus independence would only be an option with Spanish consent. Her Majesty's Government recognise that the act of deciding on their acceptance of the new constitution in the forthcoming referendum will be an exercise of the right of self-determination by the Gibraltarian people in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.2/2">The new constitution does not in any way diminish British sovereignty and gives Gibraltar much greater control over its internal affairs and that degree of self-government compatible with British sovereignty and the UK's continuing international responsibilities. If the new constitution is agreed the UK will retain its full international responsibility for Gibraltar, including for Gibraltar's external relations and defence, and as the member state responsible for Gibraltar in the EU. The UK's long standing commitment that the UK will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their wishes will be unchanged. This is also set out clearly in the Despatch which will be published at the same time as the Gibraltar Constitution Order and the draft of which I will place in the Library of the House. I will also send a copy to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.2/3">It has also been the UK's long standing view that none of its remaining overseas territories, including Gibraltar, should remain on the UN list of non self-governing territories, despite the different circumstances affecting Gibraltar, namely the application of the Treaty of Utrecht as noted earlier. However, the criteria used by the UN are outdated and fail to take account of the way that relationships between the UK and its overseas territories have been modernised. The UK does not, therefore, engage formally to seek the removal of any of the overseas territories from the UN list.</p>

	<p pid="a.943W.8/1">All allocations by the Housing Executive and registered housing associations are made on the basis of need as determined by the points awarded under the Common Selection Scheme&mdash;a scheme that was equality proofed and subject to detailed and widespread consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.8/2">The Housing Executive is recognised by all sections of the community as being extremely fair in its allocations, policies. However, applicants for social housing have a choice of where they wish to live and as a result less than 10 per cent. of social housing is integrated, the majority of people preferring to live in areas where they felt comfortable. The choice of where to live therefore impacts significantly on the number of allocations that can be made in specific areas, as this depends on the availability of social housing, whether through new building or re-letting of existing stock. In some areas demand is greater than supply, while in others, the opposite is true and allocations cannot therefore be made at the same ratio for all areas. This does mean that some people will have to consider other areas in order to be re-housed or have to wait longer before they are re-housed. To make allocations on the basis of religious belief would be illegal under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.8/3">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive formulates plans and programmes for additional new social housing taking account of demography, current and anticipated supply as well as current and projected demand. This effectively targets additional supply on areas with the greatest demand ensuring that assessed need is met.</p>

	<p pid="a.946W.8/1">Our approach to tackling knife crime has been different to that in other parts of the UK. We have participated in the national knife amnesty, but this has been accompanied by a year-long public information campaign aimed at addressing the culture of knife carrying among young people, which is unique to Northern Ireland. In addition to this, an education package will begin in schools in September and other measures will be introduced, including the raising of the minimum age at which a knife can be legally purchased to 18-years-old. It is our intention to hold a further knife amnesty during 2006, which again is unique to Northern Ireland and this will help us to gauge how effective these initiatives have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.8/2">During the amnesty almost 900 items were handed in. In addition, the incidence of knife crime during the period of the amnesty fell by 30 per cent. This is clearly a good start and evidence that the amnesty has had an impact. However we intend to continue to address the problem of knife crime and I hope to make further announcements in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.951W.5/5" class="indent">The Eastern Seaboard Corridor runs from Larne and crosses the border south of Newry. The route is essentially comprised of the A8 Larne to Belfast road, the M2 Motorway, the A12 Westlink, the Ml Motorway, and the Al route to the Border.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.5/6" class="indent">On the A8 Larne to Belfast road there is 14 kilometres of single carriageway between Coleman's Corner, near Ballyclare and Kilwaughter.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.5/7" class="indent">As you may be aware, Roads Service has recently completed a package of measures on the A8 route costing &pound;13.3m. Consultants identified these improvements as justifiable in terms of cost and effectiveness, resulting from a wide-ranging study that covered all realistic options for the route.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.5/8" class="indent">Included in the package were a number of schemes aimed at improving passing opportunities along the remaining stretch of single carriageway. Following the completion of these works, no further major improvements to the A8 are planned at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.5/9" class="indent">As regards the Al route, there is currently 21 Km of the route between Loughbrickland and the Border which is still single carriageway.</p>

	<p pid="a.952W.2/1">The Acting Chief Executive of Roads Service, Mr. Geoff Allister, has written to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mr. Geoff Allister, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding which junctions of the Eastern Transport Corridor between Larne and Newry do not have a right hand turning lane; and what plans he has to upgrade these junctions.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Acting Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/5" class="indent">The Eastern Seaboard Corridor is essentially comprised of the A8 Larne to Belfast road, the M2 Motorway, the A12 Westlink, the Ml Motorway and the Al to the Border, south of Newry. I can advise that on the A8 Larne to Belfast road the junctions which do not have a right hand turning lane are those at Ballygowan Road/Deerpark Road and Ballygowan Road South. However, a right turn facility at the Ballygowan/Deerpark Road junction will be constructed later this financial year, and a similar facility will be constructed at the Ballygowan Road South junction during the 2007/2008 financial year. The only other section of the A8 with no dedicated facilities for right turning movements is the section of single carriageway between Coleman's Corner and Ballynure.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/6" class="indent">You will possibly be aware that the Belfast Metropolitan Transportation Plan supports dualling this section, including the completion of the Ballynure Bypass. Subsequently, the Department has sought, through the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan, to protect the land required for this scheme. It is currently expected that the implementation of this scheme will be outside the 2015 Plan period. On completion of the dual carriageway, the priority junctions will be reduced to left-in left-out, without the need to perform right turns, other than at the main roundabouts.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/7" class="indent">On the Al Belfast to Newry road, there are currently two junctions which do not have a right turn facility. These are Ashgrove Road, which is just north of the Damolly Roundabout on the approach to Newry and to the west side of the Al, and Cloughanramer Road which is just north of the Damolly Roundabout and to the east of the A1. However, this section of the Al will be superseded by the planned Beech Hill to Cloghogue dual carriageway upgrade, which is included in Package 2 of Roads Service's Public Private Partnership Project.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/8" class="indent">Right turn movements at all other junctions along the Eastern Seaboard Corridor are accommodated within the approach lanes to roundabouts, central reserve deceleration lanes, or grade separated junctions with slip roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/9" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.961W.15/2">The information requested is not available. The information that is available is in the table. Carer's allowance is payable to carers of state pension age who meet the conditions of entitlement to the allowance and do not receive a state pension, or where the weekly rate of state pension paid is lower than the weekly rate of carer's allowance. In those cases a reduced rate of carer's allowance is paid to bring the total amount of state pension and carer's allowance paid up to the carer's allowance weekly rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.15/3">Carer's allowance and state pension cannot be paid at the same time because both of them are non-income-related benefits designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or forgone income.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.15/4">In cases where these arrangements preclude the payment of carer's allowance, the carer's entitlement to the allowance gives them access to the carer premium, currently &pound;26.35 a week, in the income-related benefits such as income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit and to the equivalent additional amount for carers in pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.979W.8/2">District nurses and their teams will play a key role in the future especially to meet the needs of an ageing population, to support people with long-term conditions and care for people who choose to die at home. There will be a need for nurses with specialist skills and knowledge to lead and provide care for patients in the community. Their role will develop in response to the transfer of care to the community, new technologies, new roles such as community matrons, and patient choice. These changes will require nurses in the community to develop new skills, work in new ways and be part of integrated teams across hospital and community, general practice and social care.</p>

It was agreed that this should be discussed further after the EC has published its discussion documents on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.0/4">FSA officials have considered the papers provided by the German Government on the safety of boron. FSA officials have discussed with the EC the fact that the issue under consideration is the addition of substances to the annexes in the food supplements directive and not at this stage, to agree maximum levels for individual vitamins and minerals. The FSA is considering this and the EC is awaiting its advice before there is a further discussion at the EC standing committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.0/5">The FSA has received a copy of the report published by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany, which outlines recommended levels for certain vitamins and minerals. A response to the report is not planned. No proposals on setting levels have been published by the EC to date, and member states have yet to indicate their negotiating positions.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.0/6">The outcome of preliminary discussions by the FSA board on setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements, in the absence of EC proposals, has formed the basis of discussions with member states on this issue. The UK strategy has been to encourage discussion with other key member states and to engage in discussions on this subject at this early stage, prior to papers being published by the EC. This strategy has been developed to implement the objectives of Health Ministers. A number of meetings have been held with member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.0/7">Right hon. and hon. Members will be updated on the food supplements directive via ministerial correspondence and replies to parliamentary questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.0/8">No meetings have been held with Ministers from other European Union member states on the food supplements directive. A letter has been sent to all Ministers advising them of the preliminary discussions by the FSA board in September 2005 on setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>

Figures for deaths in males and females aged 14 to 40 years for land transport accidents, suicide or injury/poisoning of undetermined intent, alcohol-related causes, and assault are shown in the attached tables for each year from 1988 to 2005. I am placing copies of these tables in the House of Commons Library. Data for 1986 and 1987 are not available for area boundaries that are consistent with subsequent years and have not therefore been provided. Figures for drug misuse are only available from a special database containing deaths occurring from 1993-2004.</p>

Estimates of the size of UK remittance market can be found in the report of the UK Remittances Working Group<sup>(1)</sup>, established in 2004 by the Department for International Development (DFID). This shows that DFID believes the most reliable estimate for total remittances from the UK to developing countries to be &pound;2.3 billion in 2005 and that&mdash;based on the size of diaspora communities&mdash;the primary developing country recipients of UK remittances are India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Caribbean, Kenya, Nigeria and China.</p>
