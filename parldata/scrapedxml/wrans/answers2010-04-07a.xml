	<p pid="a.1361W.3/1">The Department for Transport does not routinely hold transport statistics on a parliamentary constituency basis. However, the Department provides Transport for London (TfL) with a block grant to fund transport delivery in London. This grant has more than doubled in the last nine years, rising to some &#163;3.3 billion in 2010-11. Drawing on these and other resources, the Mayor is responsible for publishing and, through TfL, implementing a Transport Strategy for London, while the boroughs are required to publish local implementation plans which set out how they will contribute to the Mayor's strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.3/2">Bus services in London have improved. 2,247 million passenger journeys were made in 2008-09 and patronage grew by grew by 40 per cent. between 2000-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.3/3">Concessionary travel continues to benefit elderly and disabled Londoners, and more than a million older people currently hold a Freedom Pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.3/4">South London rail routes serving Croydon have also improved. Southern have delivered a new fleet of trains, some of which operate on South London services, and the remaining rolling stock has been refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.3/5">TfL took over operational control of Croydon Tramlink in June 2008. Approximately 27.2 million passenger journeys were made on Croydon Tramlink in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.3/6">On the roads, national targets to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent. and reduce the number of &quot;slight&quot; casualties by 10 per cent. (compared to the period 1994-98) by 2010 were largely exceeded by TfL by 2004, leading to TfL setting themselves new targets of 50 per cent and 25 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361W.3/7">Various improvements in relation to cycling have also been realised across London. TfL report that cycling now accounts for 2 per cent. of trips in London compared to 1.2 per cent in 2000, and London is the only major city in the world to have achieved a modal shift away from the car. From 2000-2009 the mode share of private motorised transport has fallen by around 6 per cent, levels of cycling have almost doubled and public transport use has risen dramatically. On an average weekday over one million people enter Central London on public transport during the morning peak.</p>

	<p pid="a.1370W.3/1">Manpower substitutes are only engaged to fill funded posts until permanent recruitment can be completed or where the posts cannot be filled by other means. They are particularly important where units are closing or merging to enable permanent staff to be redeployed to secure posts while maintaining the role of the unit until closure, to ensure that services to the front line or other critical areas do not suffer gaps while permanent recruitment takes place or to temporarily fill specialist posts where the gap is caused by the individual being forward deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.3/2">While a great deal of work is being undertaken to increase the information available on the amount of money spent across the Ministry of Defence on manpower substitutes, this work is still ongoing and will improve further as the People Pay and Pensions Agency assumes more responsibility for delivering manpower substitution services for more categories of temporary staff. Consequently, the information requested is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Having risen through the first half of last year, the claimant count has remained broadly flat since the middle of 2009, with more than 700 people moving off of the claimant count each month on average over the period. Youth unemployment has also started to decline and now stands more than 10 per cent. below the highs seen in the third quarter of 2009.</p>

However, where there is a business or other justification, first class travel is available to staff at all levels but the reason must be included when seeking reimbursement. Information on the class of tickets purchased and the grade of the user is not held, because HM Treasury's accounting system records the costs of travel but not the number, type of tickets bought or traveller's grade.

Tickets bought but subsequently refunded are excluded and some tickets are bought directly by the traveller, so this information is not a complete record of all tickets bought.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.8/3">Since 1999, the Government have published, on an annual basis, a list of all overseas visits by Cabinet Ministers costing in excess of &#163;500, as well as the total cost of all ministerial travel overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. All travel is undertaken in accordance with the &quot;Civil Service Management Code&quot; and the &quot;Ministerial Code&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1380W.6/1">The national insurance contribution changes have been designed so that the impact is balanced fairly between individuals and employers, and between businesses of different sizes. The increase in national insurance contributions in 2011 represents only a small proportion of total business costs. Therefore, in the climate of stronger economic growth forecast by the Treasury and independent commentators in 2011 and beyond, the Government expect the rise in national insurance contributions to be an affordable contribution to fiscal consolidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.6/2">This rise should also be seen in the context of the significant support available for businesses, including small businesses. Budget 2010 announced further measures, including an increase in the annual investment allowance, an extension of entrepreneurs' relief and a temporary increase in the level of small business rate relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.1404W.2/1">The principles concerning separate rateability where there is 'exclusive occupation' and 'paramount control' are long established and predate the ports review as well as the end of prescribed rating. The lead case on this subject is a House of Lords decision which dates back to 1936-Westminster Council <i> v.</i> Southern Railway Company and W.H. Smith and Son. There was, therefore no 'implementation' of a new separate ratings policy either after or before 1999. In other words, any property, other than a statutory port authority, that met the separate assessment criteria, even before 1999, should have been rated separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/2">The Valuation Office Agency have advised us that since May 2006, it has inspected over 800 properties (hereditaments) within 55 ports in England and Wales as part of the ports review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/3">Information was collected from the statutory port operators, ratepayers and through physical inspection of the property. In cases where the information supported separate assessment, the ratepayer was served a notice informing them of the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/4">The agency does not maintain records of the number of properties within ports inspected and notified in each year since 1999. This information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

This estimated reduced travel for staff members to (up to) four meetings per day, is equivalent to savings of &#163;440,000 per annum when the facilities are fully utilised.

	<p pid="a.1408W.0/1">The Government regret that, despite the support provided through the HMRC Time To Pay scheme, Jarvis Plc was unable to continue to trade. There are two principal parts of the business, the rail businesses and the Facilities Management services for PFI contracts. With regard to the rail businesses BIS are offering all available support through Jobcentre Plus and the Regional Development Agencies. This support is to help those made redundant back into the workforce, including facilitating contacts with other employers in the Rail Industry, to ensure that, where possible, their valuable skills are retained. For the Facilities Management business we and colleagues in HMT and Partnerships UK are liaising with the Administrators to work towards a smooth transition of the business and staff to new ownership.</p>

	<p pid="a.1416W.5/2">Origin labelling is required on certain foods and in cases where not to inform the consumer of origin may mislead them. In cases where voluntary origin information is provided this must be accurate and the Food Standards Agency has had best practice guidance in place since 2002 recommending labelling formats that are meaningful to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1416W.5/3">The Government have been encouraging even greater clarity, an example of which is the new voluntary industry Code of Practice on the labelling of pork and pork products which resulted from the Government's Pig Meat Supply Chain Task Force - a supply chain wide group, facilitated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1416W.5/4">In addition, origin labelling rules are being discussed in the European Union as part of a proposal for a new Food Information Regulation. The Government are pressing in these discussions for greater clarity of information when origin claims are made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1417W.0/1">There have been discussions at official level between England, Scotland and Northern Ireland about the Moroccan rejection of consignments of seed potatoes from the UK. The problems have arisen because of a change in interpretation and inspection practices in Morocco regarding potato skin problems of traded seed potatoes. Although in making these changes the Moroccan authorities have acted within their sovereign rights, it is disappointing that there was no prior notification.</p>
	<p pid="a.1417W.0/2">Officials have visited Morocco to discuss the problem and the British embassy and EU missions to Morocco have been involved. The European Commission and officials from member states have discussed the issue with Morocco in the margins of an international meeting and have agreed to establish a working group to discuss and agree consistent application of inspection methods in future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1417W.0/3">I am not aware of any current trade dispute between EU and Morocco in respect of the import of tomatoes. This trade is carefully monitored by the European Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1421W.9/2">Over its lifespan, the number of staff in the inquiry peaked at 38 during hearings in April 2003.

	<p pid="a.1425W.7/1">DWP lead the Government's response to some of the biggest issues facing the country-welfare and pension reform-and are a key player in tackling child poverty<sup>(1)</sup>. As the biggest delivery Department in the UK, DWP makes a difference to millions of people every day, helping them to lead safer, fairer and more rewarding lives that are free from poverty. We want to give people more choice and control over their lives and are committed to providing greater choice and personalised support to everyone who needs it so they have the opportunity to get into and remain in work. We believe that work works. Even in economically challenging times we know that work works for the most vulnerable and the disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/2" class="italic"> Support to find work</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since February 2005, the number of people unemployed in Croydon, Central has increased by 66 per cent. to 3,365 and the number unemployed for more than one year has increased by 70 per cent. to 375. From August 2005 to August 2009 the number of lone parents claiming income support in Croydon, Central has fallen by 15 per cent. to 2,720.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/4">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Since their inception over 2.2 million people in Great Britain have found work with the support of the new deal, and 2,330 have been helped in Croydon, Central.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/5" class="italic"> Support for children</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/6">We introduced a target to halve child poverty by 2010-11 on the way to eradicating it by 2020. Poverty is measured using a headline indicator of the proportion of children in households with an income below 60 per cent. of contemporary household median income before housing costs. This is in line with international best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/7">Statistics on the numbers of children living in poverty are not available at the constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/8" class="italic"> Support for older people</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/9">Since 1997 our strategy has been to target help on the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/10">This year we will be spending over &#163;13 billion more on pensioners than if we had continued with the policies that were in place in 1997. Around half of that money will go to the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/11">In 1997 the poorest pensioners, who received income support, lived on &#163;69 a week (&#163;98 in today's prices). Today pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, means no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;130 a week, &#163;198.45 for couples. As of August 2009, 4,860 pensioners in Croydon, Central are benefiting from pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/12">In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners living in relative poverty in UK compared to 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs).</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/13">Statistics on the proportion of pensioners living in relative poverty are not available at constituency level, and Government office region level data are only available as three-year averages. The London Government office region can however be split into inner and outer London. The latest data for outer London cover the period 2005-08, and show that around 100,000 pensioners (or 19 per cent.) are in poverty (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs)<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/14">Pensioners in the UK also benefit from a range of additional support such as the winter fuel payment which for winter 2009-10 is worth &#163;250 for households with someone aged between 60-79 and &#163;400 for households with someone aged 80 or over. These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than &#163;60 million per year was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-we now spend around &#163;2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In winter 2008-09 (the last winter for which information is available) 19,360 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Croydon, Central.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/15">We have also taken steps to strengthen and protect the private pensions system to ensure people can continue to have confidence to save for their future through the establishment of the Pensions Protection Fund, the Financial Assistance Scheme and a more powerful and proactive pensions regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/16">The protection system ensures that, unlike in 1997, people are not left without a pension even in the event that their employer becomes insolvent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/17">As at end of February a total of 516 people in the London Government office region are receiving compensation from the Pension Protection Fund (data not available at constituency level).<sup>(3)</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/18">We have also taken forward a radical package of pension reforms in the Pensions Acts of 2007 and 2008 which will deliver a fairer and more generous state pension and extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/19">The state pension reforms begin to come into effect from 2010 and will mean around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to qualify for a full basic state pension compared to half without reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/20" class="italic"> Support for disabled people and carers</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/21">Since 2001, we have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Croydon, Central will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents who are entitled to state support, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. This will be trailblazed in eight local authority sites from late 2010. Older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.7/22" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The Department for Work and Pensions was created in 2001 and so information relates to the Department and its predecessors.</p>

	<p pid="a.1428W.6/13">The spend in the period April 2009 to February 2010 was unusually high reflecting the need to quickly recruit over 15,000 additional staff into Jobcentre Plus to meet the extra demands created by the economic downturn. This action has paid off; Unemployment is now expected to be around 700,000 lower in 2010 than in the Budget 2009. The savings in benefits across the five years 2010-11 to 2014-15 compared with what was assumed at Budget 2009 is around &#163;14 billion. This includes spend relating to housing benefit and council tax benefit as well as jobseeker's allowance. I expect the spend on external recruitment consultants for 2010-11 to be substantially lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.1428W.6/14">The Department advertises all vacancies through Jobcentre Plus in addition to other methods. In line with common practice, we will incur expenditure when our recruitment involves an element of specialist executive search. The use of external agencies allows the Department to access the networking and contact with senior executives in different disciplines and organisations outside of the civil service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1437W.2/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS Constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18-weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and an NHS health check every five years for those aged 40-74 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Croydon Central constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/3">For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/4" class="italic"> Figures for January 2010 show that in Croydon primary care trust (PCT):</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/5" class="indent">93 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18-weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/6" class="indent">99 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18-weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/7" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2009 the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 people within Croydon Central PCT has increased from 50.4 to 69.6.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/8" class="indent">In December 2009, at Mayday Healthcare NHS Trust, 98.3 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/9" class="indent">Between September 1997 and September 2009 the number of consultants at Mayday Healthcare NHS Trust increased from 79 to 121. Between September 1997 and September 2009 the estimated number of nurses increased from 730 to 1,279.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/10" class="indent">95.5 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Mayday Healthcare NHS Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/11">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Croydon Central will have also benefitted from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/12" class="indent">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent, in real terms with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/13">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/14" class="indent">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence;</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision for a national care service for all adults in England which is fair, simple and affordable. The Department has consulted widely on this reform and is currently analysing the responses, which will feed into a White Paper later this year;</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/16" class="indent">The National Carer's Strategy-&quot;(Carers at the heart of 21st century families and communities)-launched in 2008;</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/17" class="indent">The first National Dementia Strategy was published in February 2009;</p>

	<p pid="a.1437W.2/20">Since 1998, there are now 2.4 million fewer smokers in England as a result of the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy which has had a measurable impact on reducing smoking prevalence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/21">Child obesity levels are reducing due to the efforts of families across England, supported by the Government's obesity strategy. In 2008, 13.9 per cent. of children (aged two to 10) in England were classified as obese, compared with 17.3 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.2/22">Overall, life expectancy at birth for men has increased from 74.5 years (1995-1997 data) to 77.7 years (2006-08 data) while for women, life expectancy at birth has increased from 79.6 years (1995-97 data) to 81.9 years (2006-08 data).</p>

It is for PCTs in partnership with local stakeholders, including practice based commissioners, local government and the public to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and to commission services accordingly.

	<p pid="a.1463W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March</phrase> last year, the Department made an interim allocation consistent with the budget set out in the LSC's annual statement of priorities in November 2008. Providers were therefore notified of a minimum working budget by the <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase> with which to plan for the forthcoming academic year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1463W.2/3">These allocation figures differed from the provisional funding figures that providers had discussed with the LSC at the beginning of March, which were meant to be indicative of the likely level of demand coming through from young people. It was clear that this was well above the budget published the previous November. However, discussions were ongoing across Government at that time on what extra financial support was needed to provide for the increased learner demand providers indicated they could deliver. This additional funding was found and announced in Budget 2009, which provided for a further 54,500 learners in 2009/10 than planned. All providers were notified of their revised allocation, to at least the level of recruitment indicated in their provisional funding figures, as soon as was possible following Budget 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1463W.2/4">The following tables set out the funding and learner allocations for the sixth forms in the Torbay constituency. All the sixth forms learner allocations matched the provisional allocations and all the funding allocations increased from the <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase> allocations post Budget 2009. Four of the sixth forms saw increases on their provisional allocation in their final funding allocations. Two schools<sup>(1)</sup> did however see slight reductions from their provisional allocations, on account of the necessary changed approach in the application of transitional protection between the two allocation notices. The reductions were 1.5 per cent. and 0.4 per cent. of their provisional allocation. This was to avoid volatility in the data between years producing significantly different out turns in funding levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.1466W.5/1">Young people's substance misuse is markedly different to that of adults, and so is the combination of treatment and support they receive. Addiction to Class A drugs among young people is rare, and although substitute prescribing for heroin dependency does occur, this represents only 1 per cent. of under-18s in drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1466W.5/2">Instead, interventions for young people tend to centre on psychosocial counselling-based therapies, which attempt to address the underlying causes and the behavioural consequences of the young person's drug and alcohol misuse. Most young people's substance misuse problems are with alcohol and cannabis, but these psychosocial therapies are also used with young people who misuse crack and cocaine.</p>
