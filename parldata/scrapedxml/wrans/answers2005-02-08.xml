	<p pid=".1359W.3/1">The Big Lottery Fund was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-01">1 June 2004</phrase> following the administrative merger of the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and the Community Fund. The National Lottery Bill, currently before Parliament, will establish one new body, which will replace the two existing Funds and the Millennium Commission and have responsibility for distributing half the money for good causes from the National Lottery. The Big Lottery Fund will build on the achievements of NOF and the Community Fund, but will be a genuinely new body. There will be much more opportunity to involve the public in priority setting, getting local people actively involved in improving life in their communities.</p>

	<p pid=".1361W.9/1">The impacts of free trade in agricultural products on biodiversity will be largely determined by the subsequent business decisions made by farmers. Prior to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, production decisions were influenced by the subsidy regime. To monitor and evaluate the impacts of changes in farmers' production decisions, Defra will establish a range of improved monitoring processes including an 'observatory' function. This will look at the environmental impacts of the reforms as a result of changes in farm practices and production levels. We have commissioned a scoping study to help us define this function and are currently considering options for delivering it.</p>

This puts the economic cost of the CAP at around 0.2 per cent. of GDP for the EU and 0.5 per cent. for the UK. It should be noted that this estimate predates recent reforms, which will reduce the estimated economic costs of the CAP.</p>

	<p pid=".1382W.2/2">It is not possible to say how many payments are still outstanding. Decisions from colleges and schools will continue to come through. Data shows that of the 274,000 young people enrolled on the EMA system there have been 21,000 decisions not to pay the bonus so far.</p>

In subsequent years they may be eligible to receive a third bonus in September if they return to study after the summer holiday. For the 2004/05 academic year the estimated cost of the bonuses is around &pound;43 million. For the 2005/06 academic year the estimated cost of the bonuses is around &pound;78 million rising to around &pound;86 million in the 2006/07 academic year when the scheme is fully implemented.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-08.209773.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-08.1383W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/965" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="1383W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/text/50208w08.htm#50208w08.html_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1383W.0/1">Government are committed to the development of extended schools to provide a range of enrichment activities and to support the Childcare Strategy. The Department for Education and Skills' &quot;Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners&quot; sets out the Government's expectation for all primary and secondary schools to offer a core set of extended services over time. The core offer for primary schools encompasses a wide range of study support and enrichment activities, parenting support, including family learning and swift referral to a wider range of specialised support services for pupils. Some schools will work with children's centres and other providers to make provision available for younger children. The Government's 10-Year Childcare Strategy sets out the expectation that by 2010 all parents with children aged 5&ndash;11 will be offered the guarantee of affordable school based child care between the hours of 8 am to 6 pm, all year round. By 2008, half of all parents of primary aged children will be able to access the child care offer. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local child minders.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.0/2">The core offer for secondary schools includes study support and enrichment activities, widespread community use of school's facilities, family learning activities, swift and easy referral from every school to a wider range of specialised support services for pupils and a child care guarantee, or 'youth offer' available between 8 am and 6 pm on weekdays. By 2008, at least a third of all secondary schools sites will be open year round and beyond the school day offering a range of interesting activities for young people. All schools will be doing so by 2010. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local child minders. We will also be testing out demand for a formal child care guarantee that is 8 am to 6 pm particularly for children aged 11&ndash;12.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.0/3">Schools will need to adopt new and innovative approaches to recruiting and deploying staff to ensure there is a staffing structure appropriate to the extended services they wish to deliver. Schools should look at the expertise both within the school and locally to determine who can best deliver each aspect of extended services. This will include working effectively with other services and with the voluntary, private and community sectors. In some cases school staff, such as support staff and teaching assistants, will already have the relevant skills and experience and may want to help deliver some of the services such as child care.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.0/4">The Government will be producing a strategy for the children's workforce shortly, following up the vision in &quot;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&quot;. This will include national and local action to ensure we can attract and retain the right people at all levels in this workforce, including those in extended schools. It will include simpler and more rewarding career pathways, alongside better workforce planning locally and more focused use of investment that is already being made to improve the knowledge and qualifications of people in different roles. We will also promote greater focus on good leadership, management and supervision. Remuneration levels will remain, for most of these workers, a matter between them and their employer.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.0/5">The Department have already committed around &pound;50 million over the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2004&ndash;05 for the development of extended schools, with the money targeting areas serving disadvantaged communities. Just under &pound;44 million of that &pound;50 million was paid via the Standards Fund (including &pound;2.8 million made available by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit and &pound;1.8 million from the Home Office) and &pound;6.8 million was paid through the Sure Start General Grant. In addition to this &pound;14 million from the Young People's Fund element of the Big Lottery Fund has been made available to 78 local authorities over three years from 2004&ndash;05 to support the development of extended schools across their areas. In the financial year 2005&ndash;06 my Department will make available just over &pound;107 million to support the development of extended services in both primary and secondary schools in all local authorities. In later years we will provide further sums including funding to support the development of school based child care. An announcement will be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.0/6">Funding to support the delivery of extended services, including the school age child care offer can be used flexibly by local authorities for both capital and revenue purposes to help overcome barriers that they may face in developing extended services. This can include minor capital works such as refurbishment of reception or play areas, and revenue funding, for example, to support a senior management post that might work across a cluster of schools to develop extended services. The funding is aimed at kick- starting the delivery of extended services but over time, these services should become self&mdash;sustaining within existing funding strands or through charging. Schools can charge for some services such as community use of the schools premises and child care. In the case of school based child care, parents, who are eligible, can claim part of the cost through the child care element of the working tax credit. Some services such as study support and other curriculum-related enrichment services will be developed by schools making best use of their existing baselines. Other services such as health and social care should be supported by budgets that support those services.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.0/7">My Department is supporting local authorities to work with schools, local child care providers and local partners in delivering the extended schools programme in logistical ways too. In 2002, the DfES published extended schools guidance that provides information and advice on a range of legal, financial and practical issues. The Extended Schools Prospectus, trailed in the Prime Minister's speech to the Daycare Trust on <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase>, will set out the vision for extended schools to schools, local authorities and stakeholders in health, social care and the private and voluntary sectors. It will include a core document that will be supported by a number of on-line know how leaflets that draw on the practical experience of schools already delivering services. These will include case studies, 'how to' advice, 'hints and tips' as well as emerging evidence of the impact on child outcomes. The prospectus and know how pack will be made available on the web, so that new issues can be addressed as they emerge. The prospectus will be launched shortly. The website <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools">www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools</a> also features a number of case study examples of schools delivering extended services that schools and other interested parties might use to draw upon key lessons. The DfES has also appointed ContinYou to run The Extended Schools Support Service (TESSS) to support and advise schools and LEAs developing an extended schools approach, and which includes advice on developing links with the community.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.0/8">My Department is very committed to research on extended services and child care in schools. We have in progress an evaluation looking at the impacts of full service extended schools on children, their families and communities; a nationally representative survey of schools to measure the prevalence and characteristics of extended services and child care; and an evaluation of an Extended Schools Childcare pilot. Initial findings from these projects will be published by the Department in summer 2005, autumn 2005 and spring 2006 respectively.</p>

	<p pid=".1392W.3/1">There is strong political will, both within the Indian Ocean region and internationally, to establish a tsunami Early Warning System in the Indian Ocean. This will involve countries in South East Asia and around the Indian Ocean working together to produce a workable and well co-ordinated system, building on those components already in place. The immediate need is for the countries in the region to determine the nature and organisation of the system they want.</p>
	<p pid=".1392W.3/2">A recent meeting organised by the Thai Government in Phuket reached a strong consensus on some important features of an early warning system for the region. It should: be designed and owned by countries in the region; build on mechanisms that already exist; and warn against multiple hazards, such as tropical storms and storm surges as well as tsunamis. It was also agreed that the UN should co-ordinate the development of the system and that investment should focus, not just on highly technical solutions, but on educating, and communicating any warning to, coastal communities.</p>
	<p pid=".1392W.3/3">The UK stands ready, if needed, to provide support to an early warning system once countries of the region have made progress on the design of a system. However, if there are other donors willing to provide all the finance needed&mdash;as looks likely&mdash;the UK is also willing to step aside and focus its resources on other equally important but less well funded measures to reduce the impact of disasters. Chief among these is the need to help developing countries of the region build on and enhance their own capacity to manage and reduce their risk to disasters.</p>

	<p pid=".1392W.6/1">Farmers have been badly affected by the tsunami and DFID is committed to rebuilding their livelihoods. Of the &pound;75 million allocation for emergency relief and first stage recovery, about 20 per cent. has been earmarked for immediate support to rebuilding farming and fishing communities' livelihoods through relevant UN agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGO's). I am conscious of the need to build on local capacity through encouraging targeted regeneration of local agricultural systems. I recognise the need to reach as many affected people from the region as possible and to enable them to return to productive work.</p>
	<p pid=".1392W.6/2">In Indonesia, we shall provide funds through United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to co-ordinate a broad-based livelihood recovery programme in rural areas of Aceh. This will include, among other initiatives, small grants to farmers, which will be disbursed by local organisations working with them. The grants are designed to be flexible and respond to needs, which for many, will involve restocking. We support a similar strategy for Sri Lanka and the Maldives through a regional programme led by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</p>
	<p pid=".1392W.6/3">International NGO's are, on the whole, well funded, but we add support where there are clear needs. In southern India and Sri Lanka, for instance, we have recently approved five projects that will provide immediate support to affected communities totalling approximately &pound;1.8 million. These projects include livelihood recovery activities and focus on the needs of fishing communities, farmers, agricultural workers and other livelihood groups. One of these projects includes land reclamation and desalination activities.</p>
	<p pid=".1392W.6/4">As for our contribution to long-term recovery, we intend to respond to needs assessed by competent agencies and to fund requests by affected countries, in partnership with other donors, the UN and the International banks, namely the World Bank and Asian Development bank.</p>

	<p pid=".1394W.2/1">It is important that countries have detailed action plans to address AIDS. DFID country offices make bilateral spending decisions based on countries' articulated priorities as identified through national strategies and detailed action plans which include support to orphans and vulnerable children. These plans are being developed at national level (often with UNICEF support), to create a supportive environment for children's access to health and education, community services and basic needs.</p>
	<p pid=".1394W.2/2">In responding to these action plans, DFID strongly supports the &quot;Three Ones&quot; approach: one strategic framework, one AIDS authority and one monitoring system. Thus DFID's own country assistance plans (CAPS) are designed to support the implementation of the &quot;Three Ones&quot;. All CAPS will reflect and report AIDS initiatives, indicating where more needs to be done. DFID will monitor all CAPS with reports going to the Management Board.</p>

	<p pid=".1397W.2/1">The sustainable and integrated management of land and water resources is critical to combating increasing water shortages. The UK agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg the target for all countries to develop Integrated Water Resources Management and Water Efficiency plans by 2005, with support to be provided for developing countries. DFID's approach to implementing this target is set out in the Water Action Plan (March 2004), which will be reviewed regularly.</p>
	<p pid=".1397W.2/2">DFID provides significant support to the Global Water Partnership (GWP), which is an umbrella organisation that supports development of national water resource management plans in key partner countries. GWP is also the key organisation coordinating policy and monitoring progress at the international level. A recent survey carried out by GWP has suggested that around 40 per cent. of countries have yet to make progress on developing Integrated Water Resources Management plans and only 20 per cent. of countries are likely to meet the 2005 target.</p>
	<p pid=".1397W.2/3">DFID also support the &quot;Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment&quot; reports of the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme which include water availability data, and the EU Water Initiative which includes a water resource management component. DFID has supported the UNESCO led World Water Assessment Programme from its outset in mid-2000. This is an effective long-term programme providing assessment, monitoring and reporting of the status of the world's water. These reviews assist in developing frameworks for better assessment, allocation and monitoring of water use, particularly in the water scarce areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1422W.5/1">An offender under current probation supervision is allocated an offender manager who is responsible for assessing the risk of harm posed by that individual. The offender manager will develop a supervision plan which is directly aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending. Where there is any indication that medical treatment may be required, the offender manager can direct the offender to local health services, whose responsibility it is to provide any necessary service. The offender manager cannot seek to enforce compliance with treatment unless it is a specific requirement of their supervision. Similarly with accommodation, local authorities are required to ensure that advice and information is made available about an individual's right to apply for housing, and to provide assistance where necessary. The probation service has a role in signposting offenders to local authority advice services, and can refer those who need additional housing support to local services run under the Supporting People Programme. In addition, there is a limited supply of approved accommodation available for those offenders who pose the greatest risk of harm.</p>

The Government are committed to enhanced partnership working and special arrangements have been put in place for the supervision of those offenders who represent the greatest risk of harm. These arrangements, known as Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) ensure that key agencies come together with others under the lead of the probation, prison and police services to plan and monitor the supervision of individuals. The key agencies, including local housing authorities and health Trusts and Authorities, have been placed under a duty to co-operate with their local police, prison and probation services.</p>

A key function of GOs is to support delivery of Government business in the regions, and in line with this role, I have asked them to work with CDRPs to ensure that the local targets agreed make an appropriate contribution to national delivery of the new Home Office Public Service Agreement (PSA) 1. This PSA requires a reduction in crime by 15 per cent., and more in high-crime areas, by 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/4">On the basis of advice from the Home Office, GOs' approach to this task has been to suggest to each CDRP a target &quot;range&quot; for which they should be aiming, The range suggested to an individual CDRP depends upon the level of crime in their area. CDRPs with higher crime levels are expected to achieve greater reductions than those in lower crime areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/5">Guidance on this process was issued to CDRPs on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-07">7 December 2004</phrase>, copied to chief constables and police authorities. In addition, the National Policing Plan published in November 2004 explicitly highlighted the need for GOs, police and CDRPs to collaborate closely in agreeing measures to achieve PSA 1. The National Policing Plan 2005&ndash;08 is available on the police reform website at <a href="http://www.policereform.gov.uk">www.policereform.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/6">As key members of CDRPs it is for police authorities to ensure that police performance requirements and CDRP targets are directed at achieving reductions in crime and improvements in performance. Chris Fox, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, recently sent a letter to chief constables clarifying the links between the Police Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF) and the requirement for CDRPs to set challenging targets. Many CDRPs across the country have now agreed targets with their GO with which all CDRP members&mdash;including the police&mdash;are satisfied.</p>

	<p pid=".1424W.5/1">As part of the Government's police reform programme, there are several programmes available to officers at the rank of inspector and above which enhance policing and leadership skills. These programmes promote ongoing development and present an integrated approach to police training.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.5/2">The Core Leadership Development Programme (CLDP) is available to officers up to and including the rank of inspector.

	<p pid=".1424W.5/3">The Senior Leadership Development Programme (SLDP) is aimed at commanders and their teams, for all types of command and management units&mdash; operational or support.

	<p pid=".1424W.5/4">SLDP leads on to the strategic command course, which prepares officers for promotion into ACPO ranks.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.5/5">In addition to these central programmes, the Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) has been developed to examine existing investigation procedures and develop ways to make the process more professional, ethical and effective for both officers and support staff involved in investigations at all levels, including the management of investigations.</p>

	<p pid=".1427W.3/1">The Code of Practice (Code B) for searches of premises by police officers and the seizure of property found by police officers on persons or premises, issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), deals with police powers to search premises.</p>
	<p pid=".1427W.3/2">Code B requires that police officers should consider if the necessary objectives of entry and search of premises can be met by less intrusive means. Officers should exercise their powers courteously and with respect for persons and property; and only use reasonable force when this is considered necessary and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid=".1427W.3/3">Code B recognises that on some occasions it may be necessary to enter premises at an unsociable hour where it is considered that access at any other time might frustrate the purpose of the search. Premises may be searched only to the extent necessary to achieve the object of the search, having regard to the size and nature of whatever is sought.</p>
	<p pid=".1427W.3/4">The officer conducting the search under Code B is required, unless it is impracticable to do so, provide the occupier with a copy of a notice in a standard format. This notice, amongst other things, should summarising the authority under which the search is being made, details of compensation procedures, explain the rights of the occupier and the rights of the owner of any property seized.</p>
	<p pid=".1427W.3/5">Copies of Code B and the other PACE Codes can be found at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimpol/police/system/pacecodes.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimpol/police/system/pacecodes.html</a>. The Codes must be readily available at all police stations.</p>

	<p pid=".1428W.3/1">Record numbers of prison officers have been recruited to the public sector Prison Service during 2003 and 2004. 2,420 officers were recruited in 2003 (an increase of 50.5 per cent. on 2002), and 1,983 officers were recruited in 2004. At <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase> 23,822 operational staff (prison officers, senior officers and principal officers) were employed at prison establishments against an operational staffing requirement of 24,682. In addition, the equivalent of 473 officers were available for operational duty through the contract supplementary hours scheme.

The national offender manager and the director general of the national probation service jointly issued guidance to probation boards in January 2005 on how they should implement offender management for community orders and licence cases. In implementing this model boards will distinguish offender management from intervention functions. Working closely in the course of 2005&ndash;06 they will develop the separation further (with the regional offender managers (ROMs)) to ensure a nationally consistent approach.</p>

	<p pid=".1431W.2/1">Local probation areas have always liaised with local communities in order to identify work which can usefully be undertaken by offenders. All areas survey those who benefit work undertaken by offenders to ensure that the nature and quality of the work help develop has met their needs; and they use this feedback to inform future work plans.</p>
	<p pid=".1431W.2/2">With the introduction of the new community order and the unpaid work requirement throughout the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the probation service is moving towards a much more structured approach to eliciting the views of local communities. In the course of February 2005, as part of a nationally co-ordinated &quot;Clean-Up&quot; campaign, residents in ten probation areas will be asked to vote on a number of possible projects to be undertaken in their locality. The work will then be undertaken in the order of priority identified by residents.</p>
	<p pid=".1431W.2/3">This desire to take greater account of the views of local people is reflected in the civil renewal strategy currently being developed by the National Offender Management Service. This explores ways in which the confidence of the public in community sentences can be increased. It is crucial that offenders make a visible contribution that can be identified by those in the community who benefit from it.

This includes how the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will help 80,000 people into home ownership by 2010, including through the FTBi and our traditional programmes. It also announces a new Homebuy scheme that will allow tenants of local authorities and housing associations to buy a stake in their home, which can increase over time. Finally, it also proposes changes to the planning system to ensure more affordable housing for key workers and young families in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1441W.11/1">Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: &quot;Housing (PPG3)&quot; explains that local authorities requirements for car parking, especially off-street car parking, are a significant determinant of the amount of land needed for new housing. In the 1990s, car parking standards for housing became increasingly demanding and were applied too rigidly, often as minimum standards.</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.11/2">With this in mind, PPG3 says that local authorities should have parking standards which allow for significantly lower levels of car parking provision where appropriate. For example, this could apply to developments:</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.11/3" class="indent">in locations like town centres where services are accessible by walking, cycling or public transport;</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.11/4" class="indent">which provide housing for older people, students and single people, all of whom are likely to have less demand for car parking than families; and</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.11/5" class="indent">involving the conversion of housing or non-residential buildings where off-street parking is less likely to be successfully designed into the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.11/6">PPG3 advises that parking policies should be framed with good design in mind while recognising that car ownership varies with income, age, household type and location. The Planning for Housing statement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-17">17 July 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-07-17.53WS"><i>Official Report,</i> column 53WS</phrase>, explained that car parking standards should result in an average of 1.5 off-street car parking spaces per dwelling over an authority's area. As this is an average, this does not mean that the Government expects all dwellings in new developments to have 1.5 car parking spaces. Policies which would result in higher levels of off-street parking, especially in urban areas, should not be adopted.</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.11/7">To help the development of appropriate standards, the Government are carrying out research to consider how varying levels of car parking can be achieved in ways consistent with their policies on sustainable residential environments. We aim to publish this research in summer 2005.</p>

That structure plan has been the subject of review and the structure plan third alteration, covering the period 1996&ndash;2016, has reached an advanced stage. Regional planning guidance for the south-west (RPG10) was approved in 2001 and became the regional spatial strategy on commencement of the new Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. RPG10 covers the period 1996&ndash;2016 and is being reviewed as part of the preparation of a new regional spatial strategy (RSS) for the south west.

	<p pid=".1444W.0/1">In 2004 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published Planning Policy Statement 22 on Renewable Energy, that provides the policy context for encouraging appropriate development of further renewable energy schemes, and its companion guide which gives practical advice as to how these policies can be implemented. These documents provide a positive planning framework for achieving the Government target of generating 10 per cent. of UK electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".1448W.2/1">The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Hemsworth constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road causalities in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 290,607 in 2003, and the numbers of children aged under 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 4,100 in 2003. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&ndash;97 to 40.9 billion in 2003&ndash;04, a rise of 27 per cent.

	<p pid=".1449W.2/1">Coventry city council and Centro receive funding for transport schemes through the joint West Midlands Local Transport Plan (LTP). The most up to date information we have is taken from the LTP Annual Progress Report for 2003&ndash;04. Excluding maintenance, the allocation to the West Midlands LTP for that year was &pound;51 million of which Coventry's share was &pound;5.251 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1449W.2/2">The Annual Progress Report does not specify spending in particular areas but it shows that &pound;70,000 was spent specifically on miscellaneous facilities for the disabled across the city. Most of this would have involved the provision of facilities such as dropped kerbing. However, many other highway improvement and bus corridor schemes would routinely include provision for the disabled. For instance improvements to traffic signals, where these include works to pedestrian facilities, would also involve measures such as tactile paving and audible warnings.</p>
	<p pid=".1449W.2/3">Last year we gave approval to a &pound;28.8 million funding contribution to the Coventry Primelines major scheme, which aims to improve bus services throughout the city. Three corridors in your constituency will be upgraded as part of the scheme. Works will include the provision of level boarding and improved shelters at 170 stops at a total cost of about &pound;800,000 over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid=".1449W.2/4">In addition, the West Midlands Special Needs Transport charity provides a Ring and Ride service throughout the metropolitan area. Centro provide an annual grant in the region of &pound;8.5 million to the charity.</p>

	<p pid=".1450W.5/1">Noise is continually monitored by BAA at 12 sites around the airport, including Dorney, to the south east of Maidenhead. Annual noise contours at Heathrow, which provide noise maps for a 16 hour day time period, are calibrated from mobile noise monitors and produced by the Civil Aviation Authority's Environmental Research Consultancy Department on behalf of the Department. These are published annually on the Department's website. They show that Maidenhead lies beyond the 57dBA contour area normally considered to represent the onset of significant community annoyance.</p>
	<p pid=".1450W.5/2">The Department and its predecessors have commissioned a range of studies over the years about the effects of noise on annoyance and sleep disturbance at various times of day and night. These include the large-scale &quot;Aircraft Noise Index Study&quot; (CAA DR Report 8402) in the early 1980s, which included fieldwork at Slough.</p>
	<p pid=".1450W.5/3">On behalf of the Department, a consortium led by The MVA Consultancy is currently engaged in a major study of &quot;Attitudes to Noise from Aircraft Sources in England&quot; (ANASE). As part of the extended pilot phase of this project, questionnaires about attitudes to noise at different times of day were trialled at a number of sites to the west of Heathrow, though not in Maidenhead itself. If this project proceeds to its second (major fieldwork and analysis) phase, sites will be sampled from a wide range of possible areas around Heathrow and other airports.</p>

	<p pid=".1456W.2/3">I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January</phrase>/<phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase> in the absence of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary. John Grant (UK Permanent Representative to the EU) accompanied me.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/4">Conclusions were agreed on the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP), Iraq, Ukraine, tsunami, Cuba, Western Balkans, and Sudan.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/5" class="italic">General affairs session</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/6" class="italic">Annual programme of the Council (2005)/annual work programme of the European Commission</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/7">The Council held a short public discussion on the Annual Operational Programme (AOP) of the Council for 2005. The debate concentrated on the identified priorities: negotiations on the financial framework for the budget of the EU during the period 2007&ndash;13; the Lisbon strategy; freedom, justice and security; and the launching of the preliminary works for the application, after its ratification, of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe. The AOP was previously discussed and agreed at the December GAERC. Copies are available in the Library of the House. The Council also took note of the programme of work of the new European Commission which was presented by Jose Barroso, President of the European Commission. The Council was pleased with the Commissions priorities which were developed through close co-operation between the presidency, the Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/8" class="italic">Future financing 2007&ndash;13</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/9">Based on a questionnaire submitted by the Luxembourg presidency to member states, Ministers discussed cohesion policy for 2007&ndash;13. As in previous debates on future financing the Government argued that the Commission's proposals for real terms spending increases of 35 per cent. from 2007 to 2013 are unrealistic and unacceptable. We, along with France, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, believe that the priorities of an enlarged Union can be met within a budget of 1 per cent. EU gross national income. This is sufficient to meet the challenge of cohesion provided that resources are focused on priorities&mdash;namely the poorest member states. The next meeting of the GAERC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February</phrase> will discuss competitiveness for growth and employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/10" class="italic">External relations session</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/11" class="italic">MEPP</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/12">The Council welcomed the holding of the Palestinian presidential elections and expressed its appreciation to Israel for the measures taken to facilitate the electoral process. The Council presented its congratulations to President Abbas and expressed its desire to work with him and his Prime Minister to implement the road map. In this context, the Council will develop the short-term action plan adopted by the European Council in November 2004. The UK briefed the Council on the London Meeting, which will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase>. The London Meeting is designed to offer the international community an opportunity to support the efforts of the Palestinian President.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/13" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/14">The Council discussed Sunday's election in Iraq and paid tribute to the courage and resolve of the Iraqis who voted despite the difficult security circumstances. The electoral turnout demonstrated the overwhelming importance that the Iraqi people attach to democracy and the rule of law. The Government share this view. This election was an important step on the road to democracy, freedom and peace for the Iraqi people. Recognition was paid to the enormous efforts made by the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, as well as local observers, the Iraqi Interim Government, and the UN. The Council reaffirmed its will to continue, together with the rest of the international community, to support the Iraqi transition process leading to a constitutionally elected government. The European Commission reported that it was ready to send experts to help with the constitution if requested to do so by the Iraqis.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/15" class="italic">Cuba</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/16">The Council had an exchange of views on its policy towards Cuba. Ministers reasserted the importance of encouraging a process of transition towards democratic pluralism and respect for human rights as well as fundamental freedoms in Cuba. The Council reaffirmed its commitment to constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities so as to achieve tangible results in political and economic areas and the sphere of human rights. Furthermore, the Council decided to develop more intense relations with the peaceful political opposition and with broader layers of Cuban civil society through enhanced and more regular dialogue. The Government were pleased to have an agreed EU policy which will, on the one hand, help us to strengthen our dialogue with the peaceful opposition and, on the other, normalise relations with the Cuban Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/17" class="italic">Ukraine</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/18">The Council held a discussion of the political situation in Ukraine and the EU's relations with Ukraine. The Council was pleased with the conduct of the re-run of the second round of the presidential election and welcomed the election of the new President. The Council also welcomed the extensive and ambitious political and economic programme that President Yushchenko plans to carry out in Ukraine during his term. The Council looks forward to being able to launch at the <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February</phrase> EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council, the action plan negotiated in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The action plan will pave the way for enhanced cooperation between the EU and the Ukraine. In this context, the Council welcomed the letter from High Representative Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, consisting of 10 concrete steps to strengthen cooperation between the EU and Ukraine. The Council will examine these proposed steps and return to the issue at its next meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/19" class="italic">Tsunami</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/20">The Council introduced an action plan to coordinate the initiatives that the European Union and its member states are to take following the tsunami to deal effectively with the consequences of such events today and in the future. The action plan outlines possible actions to address this type of disaster or similar disasters from the standpoint of a better use of existing instruments, possibilities for developing a rapid response capacity for the Union (planning, coordinating and resource mobilisation structure), and stronger consular cooperation in favour of the citizens of Europe. The presidency tasked the relevant committees with taking the work forward. The Government welcomed the presidency's action plan and looks forward to discussing ideas further with partners and the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/21" class="italic">Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/22">Enlargement Commissioner Rehn briefed Ministers on the current state of Croatia's compliance with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). He reported that Croatia is not cooperating fully with ICTY. High Representative Solana expressed concern at the current situation in Serbia and Montenegro. Ministers adopted Conclusions stressing the need for greater ICTY cooperation across the region and support for the actions of Lord Ashdown in December to encourage Republika Srpska to cooperate with ICTY. The Government support this assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/23" class="italic">Sudan</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/24">High Representative Solana welcomed the successful conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), and the improving EU relationship with the African Union (AU). However, the Council expressed concern over the recent bombardment of several villages in Darfur by the Sudanese Air Force. The Council condemned these attacks. The Council reiterated its call to respect the ceasefire of N'Djamena and the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. The Government welcome the signature of CPA. It is vital that the international community now supports the parties in implementing the terms of the agreement. The international community also needs to remain focused on Darfur, where both sides continue to violate the ceasefire. The Government believe that the EU should start actively to consider a range of possible targeted sanctions, which are balanced and effective.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/25" class="italic">AOB&mdash;EU/Africa dialogue</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/26">Portugal informed the Council of its continued contacts with African countries over the strengthening of the EU-Africa dialogue and in particular the organisation of a second Europe-Africa Summit. The presidency highlighted that the lack of progress in Zimbabwe meant that the EU was not yet in a position to consider a summit. The Government agreed with this assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/27" class="italic">AOB&mdash;effective multilateralism</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/28">Sweden called for the Council to consider how it could support the UN High Level Panel (HLP), and how it could be more effective in contributing to the international Rule of Law. The presidency noted that the relevant committees were looking at the HLP recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/29" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Latvia/Russia</p>
	<p pid=".1456W.2/30">Latvia stressed the importance of a resolution to the current border disputes between Latvia and Russia before the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the EU-Russia Summit to be held in Moscow in May 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1460W.9/24">Routine Training. The UK has traditionally sent two RNA cadets to the Royal Military Academy each year.

In addition, an RNA major attends the Joint Services' Staff College each year at Shrivenham. Young officers have attended the Jungle Warfare Course in Brunei in the past&mdash;these courses are now conducted in Belize (a team of 6 RNA officers attended this course in 2004).

This assistance has ranged from development assistance aimed at tackling the underlying causes of poverty, social injustice and conflict in the country to the provision of non-lethal military assistance to the Royal Nepalese Army (UNA). The military assistance was particularly aimed at boosting the RNA's intelligence gathering capability and selective training, including on human rights. Money from the GCPP has also been used to fund the Peace Secretariat, a body of civil servants connected to the Prime Minister's Office and tasked with identifying political solutions to the conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".1465W.0/1">Our Embassy in Ankara monitors the human rights situation in Turkey closely, including implementation of the Turkish Government's reforms introduced to eradicate torture.</p>
	<p pid=".1465W.0/2">According to NGO statistics, the number of allegations of police mistreatment for 2003 increased compared to previous years. However, NGOs attributed this to a greater inclination to report incidents of torture rather than an actual increase in the number of incidents. In the first six months of 2004 the Turkish NGO, the Human Rights Association, recorded 202 allegations of torture arid ill treatment under police custody compared with 818 in the whole of 2003. The European Commission's 2004 Progress Report on Turkey states that:</p>
	<p pid=".1465W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;the Government's serious efforts to implement the legislative reforms have lead to a decline in instances of torture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1465W.0/4">We believe that the number of police officers charged with mistreatment, and the number who have been dismissed following allegations of mistreatment has risen, but the numbers of cases opened and the number of successful prosecutions remains very low.</p>
	<p pid=".1465W.0/5">There is growing evidence of improved implementation of the Turkish Government's reforms introduced to eradicate torture. However, allegations of torture continue, and it is clear that more needs to be done.</p>

	<p pid=".1465W.6/1">The Turkish Human Rights Association (HRA) released a press statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase> detailing four separate cases of honour killings. In the statement the HRA called on state officials to take all necessary measures to stop honour killings and to protect women.</p>
	<p pid=".1465W.6/2">The Turkish Government's domestic reform programme has strengthened the rights of women in Turkey. The Turkish Government adopted a new Penal Code in September 2004 that removes sentence reductions for honour killings. The last few months have seen several landmark sentences handed down for honour killings. The Turkish Government passed a new Municipalities Law in December 2004 requiring municipalities to open shelters for women in communities of more than 50,000 people, and a package of constitutional amendments was passed in May 2004 that confirms equality between men and women.</p>
	<p pid=".1465W.6/3">The Turkish Government's commitment to address honour crimes and ensure the full protection of women's rights was demonstrated by their decision to co-table with the UK a successful resolution in the UN General Assembly on 'honour crimes'.</p>
	<p pid=".1465W.6/4">According to Ka-Mer (Turkey's largest women's NGO) at least 200 females are murdered by their families in Turkey each year. Accurate official statistics do not exist, as police records do not show whether 'honour' was a contributing factor in a murder.</p>

Before any licence is granted, a full and thorough review of all the available data takes place to ensure that the product is of appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy. The European regulatory guidelines &quot;Points to Consider&quot;, a document on the non-clinical assessment of the carcinogenic potential of insulin analogues provides guidance to industry on the general approach to the assessment of new insulin analogues, and these points need to be addressed before a licence would be granted. For any application, the documentation, including clinical trial details and results, accompanying the formal application for the product licence should be consistent with current European and national legal requirements and guidelines relating to applications for marketing authorisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1470W.2/2">As with all new medicines, several insulin analogues are currently under intensive monitoring by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the committee on safety of medicines. We are not aware of any clinical evidence to suggest that diabetic patients who receive either human insulins, insulin analogues or animal insulins are at an increased risk of developing cancer. Any further clinical trial data would always be considered to be of benefit and welcomed.</p>

There are a number of ways in which the public are informed.</p>
	<p pid=".1472W.8/3">The Department publishes the details of MRSA rates in every acute trust in England, and in December published &quot;A Simple Guide to MRSA&quot; by Professor Brian Duerden, the inspector of microbiology and infection control.

	<p pid=".1472W.8/7">One of the most important ways of reduce the risk of transmission of MRSA is by maintaining high standards of hand hygiene, and an important hand hygiene initiative is currently being rolled out through NHS hospitals. This is the &quot;cleanyourhands&quot; campaign, which includes the provision of patient information leaflets and posters. The patient information leaflet for a patient entering a Clean Hands Partner hospital invites patients to be a partner in maintaining high hand hygiene standards. The leaflet is also available on the National Patient Safety Agency website at <a href="http://www.npsa.nhs.uk/cleanyourhands">www.npsa.nhs.uk/cleanyourhands</a>.

	<p pid=".1473W.2/2">In 1989, charges were introduced for dental examinations and eligibility for national health service sight tests was restricted to children, people suffering from or predisposed to eye disease and people on low incomes. Over the period 1988 to 1990, the number of dental examinations in England fell from 20 million to 19 million per annum and the number of NHS sight tests from 12 million to 5 million per annum. Following our decision in 1999 to restore eligibility for free NHS sight tests to people aged 60, nearly 10 million NHS sight tests are now carried out annually in England.</p>

	<p pid=".1475W.3/2">At a stakeholder event on salt in November 2003, I called for industry to submit plans to reduce salt in processed food. To date discussions have been held with, and commitments received to reduce salt from over 60 organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1475W.3/3">The FSA launched a high profile public health campaign in September 2004 to raise awareness of health issues surrounding high salt intakes. Initial evaluation of the campaign shows it has had a very positive impact; and research has shown an increase in consumers who are making an effort to cut how much salt they eat and change their shopping behaviour. The next stage of the campaign is currently being considered. The FSA also publishes regular surveys of the salt content of processed foods, which have included soup, pizza, sausages, and baked beans and pasta in tomato sauce.</p>

	<p pid=".1477W.2/1">The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. A target of one month from diagnosis with breast cancer to first treatment was introduced in December 2002. 98 per cent. of patients with breast cancer were treated within this standard in the last quarter (July to September 2004). From 2005, there will be a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancer patients, including brain cancer, which will ensure that those patients who were non-urgently referred but subsequently diagnosed with cancer receive prompt treatment. Progress towards this target is being achieved through increased investment, additional staffing levels, installing new and replacement radiotherapy and diagnostic facilities and streamlining care processes through the Cancer Services Collaborative&mdash;Improvement Partnership.</p>

	<p pid=".1487W.0/4" class="indent">Roads Service has not yet been consulted on any proposal to remove the planning restriction, however, the planning application for the new terminal building and entrance was supported by a Transport Assessment, which provided a detailed analysis of the development's projected traffic impact on the local road network. Any proposed change to planning restrictions that would alter the impact on the road network will be examined to ensure that where necessary, appropriate mitigating measures are provided by the applicant.</p>
	<p pid=".1487W.0/5" class="indent">It should be noted that the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan (BMTP) 2015, published in November 2004, is bringing forward proposals that will improve public transport access to the Belfast City Airport, as well as proposals for increasing the capacity of both the Sydenham by-pass and Westlink.</p>
