	<p pid="a.1779W.9/1">A number of programmes are in place to help vulnerable consumers. In particular, the 2001 Fuel Poverty Strategy set out programmes across the UK with the target that no household in the UK should be in fuel poverty by 2018. Funding for fuel poverty programmes was increased by &pound;300 million in the Chancellor's pre-Budget report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1779W.9/2">The Government have no role in setting prices, and cannot direct Ofgem as to its approach to the market, which has delivered gas and electricity prices that remain below the EU 15 median price. Expenditure on energy was, on average, three per cent of household income in 2004/05. The Government are concerned that, at a time of rising prices, all consumers take measures to minimise energy expenditure while properly heating their homes, by choosing the most appropriate supplier and tariff, using the cheapest payment method (usually direct debit), and taking energy efficiency measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.1780W.2/1">The UK Government have previously assessed the potential geothermal resource from aquifers (permeable rock formations) as part of a broader strategic evaluation of indigenous energy supplies during the 1980s. The conclusions of this work were published in 1986 <sup>1</sup> . The results revealed that the resource was limited either because surface temperatures or permeabilities were lower than expected. It is possible that this resource could be developed in the future for commercial or other applications if the resource is sufficiently promising and is in close proximity to a large heat demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.2/2">Between 1977 and 1994 the UK attempted to develop Hot Dry Rock technology. The development of the technology revealed a number of problems. These included the creation of a suitable reservoir, the ability to seal short circuits, and the extrapolation of rock mass characteristics to a depth where temperatures might be sufficiently high enough for electricity generation (~6km). In order to determine the relative performance of an HDR system at this depth a conceptual design for a commercial prototype was developed which provided the basis for resource/cost modelling. This conceptual design highlighted the very high unit costs of generation (~17 p/kWh at 1990 prices). In view of these difficulties it was decided to re-evaluate the costs and performance of HDR systems in combination with collaborative participation in the European programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.2/3">The European HDR programme is still under development and will be further evaluated through the development of a small pilot plant. Its performance will be monitored, however there is no certainty that even if successful the technology would be competitive for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.2/4">More recently interest has been growing in the use of Ground Source Heat Pumps. This technology can be applied to buildings of virtually any scale including domestic dwellings. It relies on heat exchange with the ground immediately beneath or close to buildings. There are at least 15 installations connected to commercial or public buildings in the UK, including the recently opened Welsh Assembly building.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.2/5">The UK Government have directed its efforts into promoting the technology rather than resource assessment, which could be regarded as virtually ubiquitous. Both Defra and the DTI, in collaboration with the Heat Pump Association, have helped establish a UK Heat Pump Network to develop a partnership between manufacturers, specialist advisers, and user groups. This network will ensure that independent and authoritative advice is available on the application and use of heat pumps.</p>

	<p pid="a.1782W.4/2">The Air Transport Users Council (AUC) was set up by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to assist it in its statutory duty to further the reasonable interests of users of air transport services. The Government reviewed this arrangement during the preparation of the White Paper on the Future of Air Transport (2003). It concluded that the arrangement enabled the AUC to function independently of the air transport industry and that it remained a suitable model for representation of air passenger interests in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1782W.4/3">The AUC is accountable to the CAA for its efficiency through the CAA's business planning process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1794W.3/17">We take very seriously the problem of poverty and under-achievement within this group, particularly those who are not in employment, education or training (the NEET group). One of the characteristics of this group is the volatility of their circumstances which makes estimating numbers difficult. But our research into the problems faced by 16 and 17-year-old gives an estimated UK figure of 150,000 or 1 in 8 of the age group as NEET at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1794W.3/18">This Department has not carried out any comparative research on poverty levels among 16 to 19-year-olds in EU countries. However, together with Department for Education and Skills and HM Treasury, we have conducted a review of financial support for 16 to 19-year-olds. We have commissioned research into the support systems available in OECD counties. This found that most OECD countries have complex and often fragmented systems of financial support for 16 to 19-year-olds. The exception is Australia which has developed a unitary, large-scale system aimed at increasing the participation of young people in education, training and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1794W.3/19">As a result of our work we have introduced measures that come into force in April 2006, including the extension of financial support beyond the age of 19 to enable young people to complete their courses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1800W.7/1">As recommended by the report of the Commission for Africa, we are supporting the development of effective monitoring. As the UK, the Government have already published a Gleneagles Plan of Implementation setting out the milestones we need to meet to stay on track for delivery of the overall G8 package agreed last year which encompassed many Commission for Africa recommendations. This has been placed in the Library of both Houses and is updated regularly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1800W.7/2">The UK Government have regular meetings at ministerial level to monitor implementation of CFA and G8 commitments. At the international level, the Africa Partnership Forum will be tracking delivery on the basis of a Joint Action Plan, which brings together the commitments of Africa and her development partners for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1800W.7/3">One year on from the launch of the Commission's report, and eight months after the Gleneagles Summit, this is a good time to take stock of progress. I am depositing in the Libraries of both Houses today a detailed report on what the UK has been doing to take forward the Commission's recommendations and to make sure that the G8's commitments are implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.1801W.2/1">The Commission for Africa Report set out a wide range of recommendations for African countries and its donor partners. Each recommendation has its own timetable. This is reflected in the detailed report on what the UK has been doing to take forward the Commission's recommendations and make sure that the G8's commitments are implemented, which has been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1801W.2/3">Much of the UK's conflict work in Africa is carried out through the interdepartmental (DFID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence) Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP). Over the past few months, the ACPP has commissioned work on baseline conflict trends in Africa, this gives a much clearer picture of conflict across the continent and will be used to inform and revise sub-regional strategies for the ACPP and other UK government activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801W.2/4">DFID's own Security and Development paper also recommended that country programmes should undertake more conflict assessments. Following on from this, DFID has recently undertaken a review of the use of Strategic Conflict Assessments throughout our country programmes. The report concludes with a range of recommendations to increase the use and improve the quality of conflict assessments among DFID country programmes and to mainstream these.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801W.2/5">DFID has previously undertaken or supported conflict assessments, as part of the development of country assistance strategies, in Nigeria, Mozambique, Kenya, Angola, Uganda and, more recently, in Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="a.1803W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions concerning the number of electoral wards in the UK which have registration levels below 80 per cent. and the 100 electoral wards which have the lowest registration levels. I am replying in her absence. (57735 &amp; 57736)</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/4" class="indent">Data for Scotland are not available, and therefore this response reflects England, Wales and Northern Ireland only. Using the most recent electoral data for which estimates of the population aged 18 and above are available in order to calculate the registration rate, the number of electoral wards with a registration rate below 80 per cent. is 257. This represents 2.7 per cent. of the 9,421 wards in the England, Wales and Northern Ireland for which electoral registration rates have been calculated. I am placing in the House of Commons library a table listing the 100 electoral wards which have the lowest registration rates in ascending order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/5" class="indent">It should be borne in mind that the percentage of the resident population who are registered to vote does not provide a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population. This is mainly because there are definitional differences between &quot;usually resident&quot; and eligibility to vote and therefore the estimated resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. For example, the resident population includes all those who usually live in an area irrespective of nationality, whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included) and may include some overseas electors who do not currently live in the area. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate. This can occur for a number of reasons. People who have more than one address, including students, may register in more than one place. Electoral registration officers may vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/6" class="indent">For England and Wales, the closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/7" class="indent">The electorate counts are on electoral ward boundaries and so it has been necessary to convert these to the CAS ward geography.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/8" class="indent">The England and Wales ward registration rates have been calculated using December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers and the latest available ward population estimates which are for mid-2002. The parliamentary electorate has been used rather than the local government electorate, even though the latter is definitionally closer to the resident population, because the local government electorate is not available at ward level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/9" class="indent">The registration rates are based on population estimates that are subject to a margin of confidence, which is proportionately larger for ward level estimates than for local authority estimates. The CAS ward population estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the registration rates derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/10" class="indent">Where there are large differences between the electorate counts and population aged 18 and over, these cases may be attributable to: definitional differences between the estimates and electoral counts; the margin of confidence in the ward estimates; the accuracy of the electoral registers; and limitations in the methodology used to convert electoral counts to the CAS ward geography.</p>
	<p pid="a.1803W.0/11" class="indent">The Northern Ireland registration rates have been calculated using the December 2001 electorate (which reflects those resident and eligible to vote in October 2001), and the latest available ward population data which are from the 2001 Census, taken on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-29">29 April 2001</phrase>. The ward electorate counts include all those registered to vote in any election. These counts do not exclude foreign nationals but do include overseas electors.</p>

This analysis was carried out following the rebasing of population estimates after the 1991 Census. An updated analysis following the 2001 Census rebasing is planned for later in 2006. It has been delayed because of the need to take account of the revisions made to population estimates in 2003 and 2004.</p>

This comparison showed that 92 per cent. of the 354 local authority areas showed a difference of less than one per cent of the population between the population projection and the mid year estimate, with a mean absolute difference over all areas of 0.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1812W.3/1">A directly bookable service is one where the patient, or someone on behalf of the patient, can view and then book an appointment while in their general practitioner's (GPs) surgery, or later either on the internet or on the telephone through the choose and book appointments line. In order for services to be directly bookable, service providers, for example acute trusts, must have a patient administration system (PAS) which is compliant with the choose and book application. This means that the PAS is able to publish available slots to choose and book for the referrer, for example a GP, and patient to review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812W.3/2">Where a provider has not yet made their PAS compliant, the trust can use choose and book indirectly bookable services. This allows referrers and patients to identify and view the services commissioned by their primary care trust. However, because the PAS is not compliant, available dates and times cannot be shown. In these instances the appointment is booked by the patient telephoning their chosen provider from a clinically appropriate shortlist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1812W.3/3">The number of referrals made through the choose and book system in December 2005 and January 2006 through integrated patient administration systems and the indirectly bookable service, are shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1819W.0/1">Clinical trials submitted at the time of licensing have examined the safety and efficacy of the Lantus (insulin glargine) in diabetic patients treated for up to 12 months. Generally, the side effects observed with Lantus were similar to those seen with human insulins, with the most commonly observed side effects being hypoglycaemia, visual disturbance and injection site reactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1819W.0/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) receives reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) via the United Kingdom yellow card scheme. A total of 229 reports of suspected ADRs have been received in association with Lantus since January 2004 and of these, 12 had a fatal outcome. Where cause of death was reported there is no particular pattern. It is important to appreciate that the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean it was caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as underlying illnesses or other medicines taken concurrently.</p>
	<p pid="a.1819W.0/3">The longer term safety of the use of human insulin analogues, including Lantus, in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by the MHRA. Any possible new safety issue to emerge is evaluated and, if necessary appropriate action will be taken and the product information for prescribers and patients updated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1829W.2/1">Prisoners receive an assessment on their first reception into prison which helps to identify those at risk of having a significant mental health problem. For those so identified, or who present later with mental health needs, follow up will include primary mental health care, and where necessary, assessment and intervention by specialist prison mental health in-reach teams. 102 prisons currently have mental health in-reach provision and it is expected that all prisons will have access to such services this spring. Just under &pound;20 million of national health service investment is available for prison mental health in-reach provision in 2005&ndash;06, and 360 mental health in-reach staff are now in post.</p>

	<p pid="a.1829W.5/2">Also from April 2006, the NHS will be implementing major reforms to NHS dentistry. New contracts for dentists will abolish the fee per item remuneration system and support new ways of working. Evidence from personal dental services pilot schemes is that this will free up capacity that dentists can use to see a greater range of patients and provide more preventative care. The reforms are designed to support primary care trusts and dentists in improving access to NHS dentistry for all groups of patients.</p>

The Housing Revenue Accounts (HRA) subsidy system is always under review and Ministers and officials will continue to take into consideration the policy issues the report raises, just as they take into consideration advice from other stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1835W.5/1">Local Area Agreements (LAAs) are agreements entered into voluntarily by local areas and government and are a key part of the longer-term vision for a more mature central-local relationship. LAAs have been strongly endorsed by local government. Both phases so far were heavily over-subscribed. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes this is because all local authorities and their partners welcome the devolution of decision making, access to funding, increased flexibility, reduced bureaucracy and focus on local as well as national priorities that LAAs allow. The ODPM has every expectation that local authorities will remain committed to developing them further.</p>
