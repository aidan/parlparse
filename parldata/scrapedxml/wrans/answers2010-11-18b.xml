The Government are not aware of current plans to extend the term for recorded works to 75 years and have made no such evaluation of the type suggested by my hon. Friend. The previous Government published an impact assessment on the proposal to extend performers' rights in sound recordings to a term of initially 95, but later to 70 years. This proposal is still on the table in Brussels.</p>

The Government believe that ISAs are a trusted brand, and that it is important that this is maintained. The Government also believe that ISAs should be mainstream savings products, and therefore do not intend to allow shares listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM)-which can be riskier and less liquid-to be qualifying investments for ISAs. It is already the case that companies listed on AIM may benefit from other incentive schemes, such as investments made through the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts.</p>

	<p pid="b.898W.11/1">The UK's Protocol to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union contains certain provisions that preclude the application to the UK of sanctions under Article 126(11) of the Treaty. This exemption from sanctions is explicitly recognised in paragraph 18.ii of the final report of the President of the European Council's Taskforce (a copy of this document has been deposited in the Library of the House).</p>
	<p pid="b.898W.11/2">The European Commission has now published legislative proposals which would create additional sanctions to encourage compliance by member states with both the EU's Stability and Growth Pact and its Broad Economic Policy Guidelines.

	<p pid="b.898W.11/3">The &quot;EU Semester&quot; would require member states to submit their draft budgetary plans to the EU each spring. The Chancellor secured an exemption from this in the EU Stability and Growth Pact Code of Conduct, which explicitly states that the UK will send its final Budget to the EU after it has been presented to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.898W.11/4">The EU has conducted fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance of its member states for many years under the Stability and Growth Pact and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Many of the Commission and Taskforce proposals formalise this monitoring and are based on existing provisions of the Treaty under Articles 121 and 126.3-126.8. These articles apply to all member states and any proposals made under these Articles, if adopted, would apply to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.898W.11/5">The Commission's proposals will be considered by the Council and by the European Parliament in due course. They have been submitted to both Houses of Parliament for scrutiny in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="b.898W.11/6">Once legislation has been adopted it is open to any one of the EU institutions or to a member state to bring the matter before the European Court of Justice in accordance with Article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.2/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff may be eligible for certain allowances depending upon where they are posted to work; in the United Kingdom or in a mission overseas. The following figures represent the total amount paid in financial year 2009-10. To obtain figures prior to 2009-10 would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/2" class="italic"> Overseas</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/3">Diplomatic service staff have a global mobility obligation, and will typically spend over half of their careers outside of the UK, moving country every two to three years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office pays overseas allowances to compensate for the extra costs incurred through moving frequently and living overseas, the diplomatic service compensation allowance (DSCA). DSCA breaks down into:</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/4" class="indent">DSCA (diplomatic service allowance) is paid to compensate staff for the range of additional costs that result from the career-long disruption caused by frequent changes of location, and any indirect representational expenses. This can include the cost of visiting children at school back in England in the UK and transport to the UK for annual leave.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/5" class="indent">DSCA (hardship) is paid to compensate staff for the additional costs of maintaining quality of life at hardship posts. Examples include the cost of:</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/6" class="indent">taking additional rest breaks from the country</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/7" class="indent">security and the need for specialist four wheel drive vehicles</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/8" class="indent">extra maintenance of vehicles where driving conditions/servicing are poor</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/9" class="indent">preventative health measures and medicines.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/10" class="indent">Each post has an individual score in relation to hardship. Many posts do not reach the qualifying level and therefore people in them do not receive an allowance. Other posts do and for these the rate at which DSCA (hardship) is set depends on their individual score.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/11" class="indent">DCSA (spouse or partner pension compensation): there is a small contribution towards a pension for spouses who have lost their state pension entitlement through accompanying their spouse overseas for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/12" class="indent">The total for DSCA amount paid in 2009-10 was &#163;23,263,035.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/13" class="indent">Cost of living allowances (CoLA) compensate for the additional costs of maintaining UK living standards while staff are overseas. In countries where the cost of living is less expensive than in the UK, CoLA might be set at zero. CoLA may fall as well as rise depending on a number of factors. Rates of CoLA vary between countries and can go up or down during a posting. CoLA is based on data gathered by a private company, Employment Conditions Abroad (ECA). ECA supplies data on expatriate terms and conditions to a wide range of international companies, governments and organisations. Their data are based on information sent in by their members, i.e. expatriates employed by the companies who are part of the network, and are then checked against independent sources such as international surveys. ECA provides an objective and logical means of assessing CoLA requirements. The amount paid in 2009-10 was &#163;20,853,196.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/14" class="indent">It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. Members of the diplomatic service pay UK tax wherever they work and are entitled to have their children educated at public expense. Most parents prefer to take their children with them on postings, but in some countries we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. The FCO helps staff meet their potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK where staff choose this, or are obliged to do so given local conditions in the country to which they are posted. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/15" class="indent">Staff serving in the UK were paid &#163;7,487,435, with staff serving at posts overseas receiving &#163;5,843,415</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/16" class="italic"> United Kingdom</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/17">The FCO uses pay allowances as a cost-effective way to recruit and retain staff to posts that require specialist skills or to compensate for long or unsocial hours. Allowances are non-consolidated monthly payments which are paid in lieu of a consolidated increase to basic salary and cease when staff move from qualifying posts. These allowances are subject to statutory deductions for income tax and national insurance contributions:</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/18" class="indent">London location allowance: The amount paid in 2009-10 was &#163;6,749,178.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/19" class="indent">Overseas location allowance (OLA). OLA has now been abolished as a result of the 2009-10 review of FCO allowances. The amount paid in 2009-10 was &#163;1,366,466.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/20" class="indent">Market forces allowance, retention and recruitment allowance, professional qualification allowance, private office allowance, management reviewers/internal audit allowance. retention and recruitment allowance is payable only where our pay range cannot match the salaries we need to offer to recruit staff with unique or much sought after skills. It is awarded only with the express authority of the Deputy Director Human Resources. The total for all the allowances in this paragraph paid in 2009-10 was &#163;1,204,413.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/21" class="indent">Shift disturbance allowance, unsocial hours payment. This is paid to all staff below the senior civil service (SCS) working in the UK or on home civil service terms of service overseas who work shifts as their normal pattern of work. The amount paid in 2009-10 was &#163;531,544.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/22" class="indent">Hazardous conditions allowance is paid to staff on home tours who visit the top hardship posts-so is paid in the UK and is taxable. The amount paid in 2009-10 was &#163;91,348.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/23" class="indent">Overtime/time off in lieu. All UK based staff, below the SCS, working at home and those undertaking duty visits overseas qualify for pre-authorised paid overtime or TOIL, and call/pager/mobile telephone allowances. This is paid to staff who have a specific roster commitment to be continuously and immediately available on-call outside office hours. The amount paid in 2009-10 was &#163;1,917,631.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/24">All of our allowances are employment law compliant.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/25">It is not possible to break down the groups of allowances above without incurring disproportionate cost. Nor is it possible to provide information prior to 2009-10 without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/26">The information for non-departmental public bodies is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

As ESA is still a relatively new benefit, the number of customers claiming contributory ESA in the Work Related Activity Group will be likely to increase between now and 2012. In addition, we have now begun reassessing 1.5 million people on existing incapacity benefits, and anticipate that over half of these customers will move onto ESA in the Work Related Activity Group. Some of these customers will be making a claim for contributory ESA. The number of people who will be subject to the one year time limit will therefore be likely to have increased by the time we introduce the measure in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.912W.3/1">The Work programme will be delivered by contractors drawn from the private, public and voluntary sectors, as well as social enterprises. It will help people with a wide variety of needs, and providers will be given the freedom to design support based on an individual's needs. Specialist organisations will continue to have a role to play, and there will be lots of opportunities for them to work with larger delivery partners as subcontractors.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.3/2">We will offer flexible support through Jobcentre Plus to customers before they are referred to the Work programme. The support that Jobcentre Plus delivers to customers across all working age benefits will allow more flexibility to Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers to judge which interventions will help individual customers most cost-effectively and meet local need.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.3/3">Each Jobcentre Plus district has a mental health co-ordinator who supports advisers to provide tailored, personalised support to people who have mental health conditions and over the last year all Jobcentre Plus new claim advisers have had the opportunity to attend mental health training.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.3/4">Jobcentre Plus learning products currently available for frontline staff include awareness of a range of customer groups including an overview of disability and health conditions, with signposts to sources of specialist help, including the disability employment adviser (DEA) role. DEAs, who focus on customers needing more extensive support, receive further levels of skills training appropriate to their customers, including skills practice in interviewing customers with depression. Furthermore, this learning will be reviewed as appropriate in accordance with the needs of the Work programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.3/5">In addition, advisers, including DEAs, can seek help from their work psychologist colleagues to assist them in supporting customers where appropriate. All Jobcentres have access to DEA services, either by DEAs located within the Jobcentre or, for example, in more rural areas access to peripatetic DEAs who provide services across a number of locations.</p>

The fund will be allocated though a light touch bidding and assessment process which will maximise the discretion available to local authorities on how they use the funding. Further details about how the fund will operate will be published shortly.</p>

Any new subsidy provided through a national social tariff would also be likely to be classified as &quot;tax and spend&quot;. Any national social tariff treated as such would need to be consistent with Exchequer policy, and decisions on taxation are made by the Chancellor in the round.</p>

	<p pid="b.925W.7/1">Biomass heat and electricity could provide about 30% of the UK's 2020 target of 15% renewable energy (about 4.5%) of overall energy demand). Increased bioenergy deployment offers commercial opportunities for the UK's agriculture sector, which the Government are keen to see realised. Biomass resources include wood fuel from undermanaged woodlands; crop residues such as straw; waste resources such as manures, slurries, sewage sludge, waste wood and food waste; and purpose-grown perennial energy crops, such as short rotation coppice willow and woody grasses such as Miscanthus.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.7/2">We are working to reduce costs and overcome barriers to deployment. Support to produce and supply biomass fuel is available for farmers and rural enterprises through the Rural Development Programme for England. We support the deployment of biomass electricity through the renewables obligation, and through feed-in tariffs for anaerobic digestion. We will support biomass heat through the new Renewable Heat Incentive from June 2011. These measures provide long-term revenue stability for investors and developers alike. Working with DECC, DEFRA aims to publish shortly a framework document for anaerobic digestion which will set out the steps Government consider need to be taken to increase deployment of this technology in England. This document will be the starting point for close collaboration between Government, industry and other interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.7/3">It is essential that biomass fuel is produced sustainably. We intend to introduce sustainability criteria in April 2011 under the renewables obligation. The criteria will include minimum greenhouse gas emissions savings and restrictions to protect land important on carbon or biodiversity grounds.</p>

	<p pid="b.926W.2/1">In 2008, the Environment Agency, the Biomass Energy Centre and DEFRA developed a Biomass Environmental Assessment Tool (BEAT) as an aid to assessing the likely environmental impact of a biomass energy project in the UK. This tool calculates the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide over the whole lifecycle of a biomass transport of the biomass, to combustion at a power station or boiler and disposal of ashes.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.2/2">This tool was used in the preparation of a report, 'Minimising greenhouse gas emissions from biomass energy generation', published in April 2009, that assessed the greenhouse gas (GHG) savings for biomass feedstocks used in heat and power schemes in the UK compared to fossil fuel. A copy of this report is available from the Environment Agency's website. This report showed that where imported biomass feedstocks were cultivated, processed and transported with due consideration for sustainability, significant GHG lifecycle savings compared to fossil fuel could be delivered. Good practices would include, for example, shipping the biomass in large container vessels and using renewable or low carbon energy to fuel the processing plant.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.2/3">We are proposing to introduce sustainability criteria, under the renewables obligation, for the use of solid and gaseous biomass to generate electricity. These criteria include a GHG lifecycle emissions saving of 60% compared to fossil fuel and restrictions on the use of material from land important on carbon or biodiversity grounds. These criteria would apply to both UK and imported biomass feedstocks.</p>

	<p pid="b.930W.3/1">Based on our last published estimates in July 2010, we estimate renewables policies will add &#163;105 (26%) to the average annual domestic electricity bill in 2020 and &#163;246,000 (25%) to the average medium-sized annual non-domestic user's electricity bill in 2020 (compared with a bill in the same year in the absence of these policies, but including other energy and climate change policies). These estimates do not account for the potential offsetting impact from higher levels of renewables reducing wholesale electricity prices, which we estimate could be of the order of &#163;6/MWh on average in the years to 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.3/2">The above estimates are based on a fossil fuel price scenario consistent with an $80/bbl oil price in 2020. In a world of higher fossil fuel prices ($150/barrel in 2020) the impact of renewables policies would be to increase domestic electricity bills by only &#163;70 (13%) and add just &#163;163,000 (12%) to the average electricity bill of medium-sized non-domestic users in 2020.</p>

It is not yet possible to estimate future redundancy costs firmly because decisions on staff transfers to successor bodies have still to be settled and other factors will apply including the level of staff departures occurring through other reasons such as resignation. The impact of the Superannuation Bill and the timing of the implementation of the interim measures and the new negotiated terms will also have an affect on the cost of redundancies at Yorkshire Forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.952W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.9/2">The UK's Protocol to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union contains certain provisions that preclude the application to the UK of sanctions under Article 126(11) of the Treaty. This exemption from sanctions is explicitly recognised in paragraph 18.ii of the final report of the President of the European Council's Taskforce (a copy of this document has been deposited in the Library of the House).</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.9/3">The European Commission has now published legislative proposals which would create additional sanctions to encourage compliance by member states with both the EU's Stability and Growth Pact and its Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. However, these relate only to euro area member states and thus would not apply to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.9/4">The &quot;EU Semester&quot; would require member states to submit their draft budgetary plans to the EU each spring. The Chancellor secured an exemption from this in the EU Stability and Growth Pact Code of Conduct, which explicitly states that the UK will send its final Budget to the EU after it has been presented to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.9/5">The EU has conducted fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance of its member states for many years under the Stability and Growth Pact and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Many of the Commission and Taskforce proposals formalise this monitoring and are based on existing provisions of the Treaty under Articles 121 and 126.3-126.8. These articles apply to all member states and any proposals made under these Articles, if adopted, would apply to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.9/6">The Commission's proposals will be considered by the Council and by the European Parliament in due course. They have been submitted to both Houses of Parliament for scrutiny in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.9/7">Once legislation has been adopted it is open to any one of the EU institutions or to a member state to bring the matter before the European Court of Justice in accordance with Article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
