A transcript of this announcement in its entirety can be accessed via the DCMS website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.603W.8/3">The Government are committed to making a service level of 2 Mbps available in towns and villages still without a basic level of access. The office charged with delivering this universal service commitment, Broadband Delivery UK, held an industry event on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-15">15 July</phrase> to provide further information on this commitment. Roll-out of broadband is first and foremost a matter for private sector investors. However, as stated in the Coalition's joint programme for Government, we will seek to introduce superfast broadband in remote areas at the same time as in more populated areas, and pilots will be held in three areas to test the roll-out of superfast broadband in rural areas. The locations of these pilots will be announced later in the year.</p>

As a result of the action we are taking, basic rate taxpayers will gain from the &#163;1,000 rise in the personal allowance for income tax, and families will gain from increases of &#163;150 and &#163;60 above indexation per year to the child element of the child tax credit in the next two years respectively.

	<p pid="b.616W.2/1">We are conducting a counter-insurgency operation in Afghanistan, a key part of which is for troops to interact with the local population, some of which can only be carried out by patrolling on foot or in vehicles. We will not implement a policy on foot patrols that limits the ability of commanders on the ground to fulfil the operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.616W.2/2">We constantly assess the security situation and try to adapt our tactics in response while trying to reduce the risk to our personnel through measures such as varying the patrol routes and performing drills to help locate improvised explosive devices.</p>
	<p pid="b.616W.2/3">Despite this, Helmand, where the majority of UK troops are based, remains one of the most violent provinces in Afghanistan. But as security conditions allow, and when the Afghan security forces are ready, international security assistance force troops will increasingly step back from the front line into a supporting role and, over time, will reduce in number. This will be a phased, gradual process and will be subject to careful assessment by commanders on the ground. It is only through close engagement and partnering with the Afghan authorities that we will be able to transfer responsibility for security to the Afghans to deliver a stable country in the long-term.</p>

	<p pid="b.625W.11/23">The Department also publish six summary indicators for local authorities. There are six measures because there is no single best way of describing deprivation across large areas, such as local authority districts. This is due to the difficulties associated with describing or comparing places with different population sizes and patterns of deprivation. The six summary measures cover various different aspects of multiple deprivation so when considered together give a good overall impression of deprivation in the district. The six summary measures are; Average Score, Average Rank, Extent, Local Concentration, Income Scale, and Employment Scale. A description of what these indicators represent can be found in the Indices of Deprivation 2007 Report available from the Department website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.639W.2/1">Attrition is not a term which is formally defined in criminal justice statistics although in the past there has been one in common usage which relates to the ratio of convictions to offences recorded. In terms of police recorded crime, to achieve such an 'attrition' measure would require using two data sources which are not directly comparable. Within the current data collections, it is not possible to track individual offences through to any conclusion at court and there are important differences between the two data sources which prevent meaningful comparison.</p>
	<p pid="b.639W.2/2">The Home Office police recorded crime data are based on the number of offences recorded in each financial year. Prosecutions and convictions data are collected by the Ministry of Justice and are based on the number of offenders proceeded against. These data are published on a calendar year basis and are counts of persons classified by their principal offence. For these reasons the two datasets are not directly comparable.</p>

Where the UK Border Agency accepts that a person has been the victim of torture, he or she is normally released. However, there are a number of circumstances in which detention of an alleged or actual victim of torture may nonetheless be appropriate.

	<p pid="b.641W.0/2">I assume that the hon. Member is referring to family visitors as, unlike other categories of visitor, they have a full right of appeal in the event of a refusal of entry clearance.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.0/3">Where an applicant wishes to attend a family event in the UK and (a) has been refused a visit visa and (b) due to the imminence of the event is concerned that there is insufficient time to appeal against the decision, we would normally advise them that they may wish to re-apply, ensuring that, when they do so, they fully address the entry clearance officer's concerns about their original application, as detailed on the formal Notice of Refusal.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.0/4">Representations from hon. Members in such cases should normally be provided to their constituents, so that the applicant can submit them along with other supporting documentation when re-applying.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.0/5">Exceptionally, we will forward representations from hon. Members to an entry clearance manager for consideration outside the appeal process, e.g. where there are clearly compelling, compassionate circumstances. Compelling compassionate circumstances would normally be considered to be the death or serious illness of a close family member.</p>

A Competent Authority will take into account multiple factors when considering whether an individual meets the definition of trafficking given in the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. There is no prescribed list of factors that must be present before trafficking can be recognised, but the detailed training and guidance used by Competent Authorities and frontline staff includes a range of indicators drawn from international best practice. These indicators include being deceived about the nature of the job, location or employer, violence or threats of violence against victim, confiscation of a passport, debt bondage, isolation, confinement or surveillance, forced tasks and excessive working hours.</p>

	<p pid="b.652W.14/2">The &#163;545 million set out in the 2009 Policing White Paper included &#163;100 million intended for delivery in 2010-11. Savings were to be achieved through national frameworks for procurement, converging IT, reductions in overtime and streamlining support services. I have reduced this year's core Government funding to the police by a total of &#163;125 million. It is for chief constables to use their expertise and decide what makes most sense for their force, including taking account of the &#163;100 million opportunities, but I am quite clear that the &#163;125 million saving can be achieved by driving out wasteful spending on support functions, reducing bureaucracy and increasing efficiency in key functions, leaving the frontline of policing strong and secure. I expect forces to be held to this by both police authorities and Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary.</p>

	<p pid="b.661W.0/1">The House of Commons and House of Lords jointly have conducted public sector procurement exercises for Select Committee and Private Bill Committee transcription services periodically in the last decade. (Public Bill Committees have always been transcribed directly by the <i> Official Report</i> (<i> Hansard</i>).) Competitions for contracts beginning in 2002 and 2007 were won by W B Gurney's, a private firm which has carried out this work for a very long period. A review of the requirement for future transcription services was carried out in 2007, taking into account the increasing need for value for money, developments in technology, and the need to maximise the utilisation of the House's existing transcription expertise following reorganisation of the House administration. Those consulted by the review team included a range of other users of transcription services. The review recommended that future contracts should be managed by the <i> Official Reports</i> in the two Houses, so as to make better use of the Houses' existing professional expertise, and should build in greater business resilience by including the possibility of awarding work to more than one company. The present contract, subject to the possibility of renewal for up to two years, expires on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-31">31 July 2010</phrase> and the competition for the new contract was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-23">23 September 2009</phrase>. The tenders and award under the competition have followed the process set down by the Public Contracts Regulations 2006, SI 2006 No.5, which, as a Contracting Authority (as defined in the Regulations) both the House of Commons and the House of Lords are bound to follow. The competition has been conducted by a panel comprising senior officials of the Committee Offices and the Editors of the <i> Official Reports</i> of both Houses, advised and supported by the House's Commercial Services Directorate, acting on behalf of the Corporate Officers of both Houses. It is the Corporate Officers who have the legal capacity to enter into contracts of this nature on behalf of the House each serves. The House of Commons Commission itself has no direct involvement in procurement exercises of this nature.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.0/2">Following the competition, contracts for externally transcribed Committee sessions are being awarded to three companies: Ubiqus, Merrill Legal and Marten Walsh Cherer. The criteria governing the competition were set out in the procurement documentation, and included quality of work, reliability and value for money. The contract assessment process has paid full attention to the requirement for quality, with tenderers required to demonstrate their capacity to deliver the services required, including through sample transcripts of other work undertaken, a real-time practical exercise, and evidence of other work carried out by the companies. Separate contractual requirements are not specified for each element of the process, since the objective is to govern the quality of the end product, not the means by which it is achieved. There was thus no requirement for example to consider the specific language skills of the individual staff of potential providers, though the capacity of a tendering company to submit transcripts to a required standard of English was assessed by the process indicated above. Equally, tenderers were not required to commit to specific methods of transcription; there was thus no requirement for the process to assess the quality and accuracy of transcription services using specific methods carried out for other specific users, such as court services (although the Departments of the <i> Official Report</i> in both Houses, under the direction of their Editors, keep abreast of professional developments in their field). In practice, as at present, while there will always be a transcriber present in the committee room, some of the transcription work will be via verbatim note-takers, with the remainder via loggers using recordings, though the balance between different methods may differ from the present arrangements. The <i> Official Report</i> will continue to provide transcription services for up to 20% of select committee meetings using sub-editors to log meetings, as it has been doing satisfactorily for the past two years. As part of their normal contracted duties, Westminster Sound Systems will ensure that back-up recordings are made of every meeting; in addition, all note-takers and loggers will be required to make their own back-up recordings using mobile digital recording technology. As a further assurance measure all transcripts will be quality checked by the <i> Official Report</i>, with no extra delay in the turnaround time, before they are passed to committees. The <i> Official Report</i> will be managing the contracts with outside providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.0/3">The new arrangements will create very substantial direct savings for both Houses, as well as making more efficient use of existing <i> Hansard</i> resources. Obtaining best value for money in the use of public resources has been an important part of the process. The House of Commons 2010-11 Corporate Business Plan identified 'increased and demonstrable value for money' in services as a strategic objective for the House service. The Commission has agreed a commitment to reduce the Commons Administration budget by 9% over the period 2010-11 to 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.0/4">The Administration Committee and the Chairmen of the Commission and of the Liaison Committee were informed about the contract competition process. The Commission is aware of letters which have been received by a number of right hon. and hon. Members, some of which have been forwarded to the Commission.</p>

By providing essential security services, private security companies ensure other Government Departments, visiting journalists and non-government organisations are able to carry out their important work unhindered.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.7/16">Members of private security companies who provide security services for a diplomatic mission are treated as performing administrative and technical (A&amp;T) functions for that mission, even if they are not employees of the State concerned. Such people who are employed on FCO contracts are granted immunity from criminal jurisdiction, in accordance with Article 37 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961). However, such immunity has never had to be invoked.</p>

	<p pid="b.673W.6/1">It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. Members of the diplomatic service pay UK tax wherever they work and are entitled to have their children educated at public expense. Most parents prefer to take their children with them on posting, but in some countries we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps staff meet their potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK where staff choose this, or are obliged to do so given local conditions in the country to which they are posted. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.6/2">During the course of academic year 2009-10, 339 officers received Continuity of Education Allowance for 521 children. This represents about 6% of staff employed in the FCO and FCO Services. Three-quarters of the recipients are below the senior management grade in the FCO, including junior support staff and single parents. Staff serving in the UK were paid &#163;7,487,435, with staff serving at posts overseas receiving &#163;5,843,415.</p>

	<p pid="b.680W.2/3">In a general election using the alternative vote system, the count process may take longer in cases where no candidate wins outright on the first round as it will be necessary in these cases to count the further preferences of voters in order to determine the winning candidate. This will take some extra time, although precisely how much is difficult to predict as it would depend on how many candidates won outright on the first round, and how many further rounds of counting were necessary to determine the winner. As now, voter turnout, the total number of votes cast and any re-counting of votes will also impact upon the length and cost of the count.

	<p pid="b.686W.8/1">There are currently very little empirical data relating to debt management plans. It is estimated that 100,000 to 150,000 individual plans are created each year. However, there are no definitive data on the proportion of these where fees are charged.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.8/2">The consultation on debt management schemes that closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-18">18 December 2009</phrase> looked at the way that debtors deal with their indebtedness. It asked for evidence on whether the powers contained in chapter 4 of part 5 of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act (TCEA) 2007 to approve operators of debt management schemes (DMS) should be introduced or whether the taking of other steps to make sure that debtors are protected and creditors' interests are safeguarded would be more appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.8/3">An initial impact assessment was published alongside the consultation paper which considered the potential effectiveness of all of the options contained in the consultation paper. The impact assessment contained a number of questions which sought to obtain information relating to debt management plans. However, the few responses to these questions contained very little factual information relating to these plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.8/4">A total of 57 responses to the consultation were received from a variety of organisations, including those from the creditor, debt management scheme operator, debt advice, legal and Government sectors as well as individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.8/5">Officials at the MoJ have recently completed a full analysis of the views and opinions offered by all interested parties to the debt management consultation and the Government intend to publish their response to the consultation shortly.</p>

These savings, and a number of new financial controls, have been targeted to protect the most essential front line work and reduce running costs by:</p>

The recruitment of 59 judges and 48 independent members (including specialists) is now complete. The large programme of training necessary to allow them to sit on parole panels will be completed in October. The board is already sitting a record number of oral panels: In 2009-10 it considered 1,432 Indeterminate Sentences for Public Protection (IPP) sentenced prisoners. The board estimates that the current backlog will be reduced by around 25% over the course of 2010-11 and will be eliminated during 2012-13.</p>

	<p pid="b.710W.2/1">The following amounts were spent on electricity, heating (gas, oil and Whitehall district heating system) since 2002-03 and on water since 2004-05. Information is not held prior to those dates. In addition, availability of historic telephone services expenditure varies from body to body according to their archiving strategy. Those data are therefore incomplete. These data cover the core Department, its executive agencies, and its two largest NDPBs, the Environment Agency and Natural England; information for all NDPBs could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.714W.5/1">Officials from the Marine Management Organisation are working very hard to secure additional North sea sole quota for the under 10 metre fleet. I have also asked representatives from across industry to consider possible options for immediate-term relief. If these prove successful, I hope that a limited reopening of the fishery may be possible in the near future. At this stage, I foresee little prospect of being able to reopen the skate fishery, where uptake has been consistent with previous years, and closure of the fishery occurred later than in 2009. I am committed to delivering the long-term reform of the inshore fleet that is clearly necessary to prevent a recurrence of the difficulties that it currently faces and to ensure its future sustainability. It is my intention that a public consultation on proposals for such reform will be launched in the latter part of this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.726W.3/2">We will continue to work closely with lenders and debt advice agencies to ensure repossession is only ever a last resort. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has told the Department that it expects lenders to continue to exercise forbearance where it is fair to do so for the borrower, and the borrower has a chance of paying off any arrears in the future. The Council of Mortgage Lenders thinks that where arrears levels increase for some borrowers as a result of the change in the standard interest rate this does not translate into an immediate possession risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.726W.3/3">The Department does not capture information on reasons for ending a benefit claim, including support for mortgage interest, so does not capture the number of claimants who no longer receive support for mortgage interest payments because their property has been repossessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.726W.3/4">The Department is in the process of developing a model to estimate the impact of changes to support for mortgage interest on the number of repossessions. However any estimates will always be limited since detailed case-by-case information, such as arrears at the start of a claim, is not collected by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.739W.0/4" class="indent">ONS does not routinely calculate life expectancies for individual local authority wards. However, period life expectancy figures for 1999-2003 based on 2001 Census Standard Table wards in England and Wales were published as experimental statistics in June 2006. Experimental statistics-which are in a testing or consultation phase and are not fully developed-should be treated with caution. Life expectancies for wards can be based on very small numbers of deaths and small populations. They may therefore be subject to large variations even when aggregated over five years, as shown by the width of the '95% confidence interval' in the tables.

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> Five year averages, based on deaths registered in each year, and experimental ward population estimates based on the 2001 Census. The ward names and boundaries used are 2001 Census Standard Table wards.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Confidence intervals (CIs) are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup> The presence of medical and care communal establishments, such as nursing homes and hospices, can artificially depress the average life expectancy of the ward in which they are located. To aid interpretation of the figures, this indicator shows the proportion of the population of each ward, aged 65 and over, who were resident in such establishments in 2001. For this purpose, all wards in England and Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six groups which are numbered from 0 to 5:<br/> '0' means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care communal establishments;<br/> '1' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards;<br/> '5' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the highest fifth of all wards.</td> </tr>

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> Five year averages, based on deaths registered in each year, and experimental ward population estimates based on the 2001 Census. The ward names and boundaries used are 2001 Census Standard Table wards.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Confidence intervals (CIs) are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup> The presence of medical and care communal establishments, such as nursing homes and hospices, can artificially depress the average life expectancy of the ward in which they are located. To aid interpretation of the figures, this indicator shows the proportion of the population of each ward, aged 65 and over, who were resident in such establishments in 2001. For this purpose, all wards in England and Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six groups which are numbered from 0 to 5:<br/> '0' means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care communal establishments;<br/> '1' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards;<br/> '5' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the highest fifth of all wards.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.749W.3/1">Following its Energy Market Supply Probe, Ofgem introduced new standards of conduct which provide a guide to customers about the level of service they can expect from an energy supplier.</p>
	<p pid="b.749W.3/2">These standards are not enforceable against energy suppliers but are supported by obligations in licences and under consumer protection law, and form part of the wider context for possible Ofgem enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="b.749W.3/3">Ofgem will take the standards into account when it decides whether to investigate potential licence breaches by suppliers and, where relevant, as part of Ofgem consideration of consumer detriment for the purposes of suspected breaches of licence conditions and proposals for licence modifications leading to further regulatory rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.749W.3/4">Wholesale energy costs account for around 60% of a domestic customer's energy bill and are a major consideration in suppliers' retail pricing decisions. The relationship between wholesale costs and retail prices is complex, hence the importance of transparency. In the 2008 pre-Budget report, Ofgem were asked to produce a quarterly update on the link between wholesale and retail energy prices precisely in order to increase levels of pricing transparency. The latest report showed the major suppliers have cut their prices in response to falling wholesale prices and that margins were lower than in the previous quarter. Ofgem has said that if suppliers stopped competing on price or domestic prices did not respond to a sustained fall in wholesale prices, it would look closely at the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.749W.3/5">Competition is vital to keeping bills as low as possible. Ofgem continues working to reduce barriers to entering the retail market and will publish a report on wholesale market liquidity in summer 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.750W.5/1">The Analytical Annex of the Low Carbon Transition Plan (LCTP) from July 2009 included the last published estimates of the distributional implications of climate change and energy policies on energy bills. As noted in the LCTP lower income households face a lower absolute increase in their energy bills however, they typically spend a greater share of their income on energy bills. By 2020, energy bills as a percentage of income are estimated to increase from an average of 12.7% to 14.2% for households in the bottom income decile.

A significant number of fuel poor and vulnerable households have already received support to upgrade the thermal performance of their dwelling through policies such as Warm Front and CERT. In bringing forward our proposals for a Green Deal, we will ensure that we will help more of the most vulnerable households on the lowest incomes.</p>

The UK National Renewable Energy Action Plan contained projections for renewable energy based on the lead scenario for meeting the 2020 target. If markets and technologies develop along the lines of this scenario then we would expect the share of heat generation from renewable sources to increase to around 12% by 2020.

We will look to make an announcement on the future of the proposed scheme as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.758W.5/1">In 1998 the Department entered into a 20 year PFI contract for the provision of fully serviced accommodation for the Department for which the Department pays an all inclusive unitary charge. Refurbishment is one of the services provided but the cost of it cannot be disaggregated from the unitary charge.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.5/2">Some refurbishments are not covered by the unitary charge and are funded separately as capital expenditure, which would include major projects, and the fit out of new buildings. Expenditure increased from 2002 when the Department embarked on a major programme funded by the Treasury to improve the services delivered to the public, including those provided by Jobcentre Plus, the Pension, Disability and Carers Service and Debt Management Services. Expenditure increased in 2009-10 because of the Department's response to the economic downturn. The Department and its predecessors' expenditure on these major refurbishment projects is set out in the following table. To separate the costs prior to 2008-09 could be achieved only at a disproportionate cost.</p>

Key to this will be the measures set out in the Budget to secure a sustained, private sector-led, recovery in the economy and employment, through tackling the deficit, improving competitiveness and supporting business by cutting regulation and taxes. The Government are also exploring ways to ensure that people on benefit keep more of their earnings when they move into work or increase the hours they work.</p>

	<p pid="b.784W.2/1">No single source of information provides a count of the total number of people that have died each year from an occupational illness. For some causes of death, occupational cases are clinically indistinguishable from those due to other factors. For these causes numbers have to be estimated rather than counted, and year-on-year figures are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.2/2">Research commissioned by HSE estimates that 8,019 cancer deaths in Great Britain in 2005 were attributable to exposures to carcinogens at work, and it is likely that a similar number would have occurred in each of the other years from 1997. This estimate includes deaths from the asbestos related cancer mesothelioma.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.2/3">Using other international research, it is also estimated that there are currently approximately 4,000 deaths in Great Britain each year from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) due to past occupational exposures to dusts, gases, vapours and fumes. Again, it is likely that a similar number would have occurred in each of the other years from 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.2/4">Numbers of deaths each year in Great Britain from 1997 to 2007 (the latest year for which data are available) due to the small group of diseases that can be regarded as occupational on the basis of the cause of death alone are provided in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.2/5">Most of the occupational diseases that cause death usually take many years to develop following occupational exposures. Estimates of current deaths therefore largely reflect past industrial conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.786W.2/1">The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 1995 places a legal duty on employers and duty holders to report fatal and defined major injuries arising from work activity. There is no legal requirement under RIDDOR for the reporting of major accidents. The data collected under RIDDOR for non-fatal injuries are subject to the drawback that there is considerable underreporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.786W.2/2">It is not possible to accurately identify incidents reported under RIDDOR within parliamentary boundaries. Injury notifications received under RIDDOR are routinely allocated to the local authority (LA) administrative boundary of where the incident occurred. Statistics that HSE produce on a geographic basis are thus based according to this allocation, and not by parliamentary constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.786W.2/3">The only way to identify incidents by parliamentary constituency is via the postcode of where the incident happened; unfortunately, data may not be fully accurate at such level of detail. An examination of those records within the constituency of Wansbeck where a valid postcode exists shows that, in general, about 75% are within the former LA of Wansbeck and 25% within the former LA of Castle Morpeth.</p>
	<p pid="b.786W.2/4">The most recent full-year for which geographical figures are available from RIDDOR for fatal injuries and reported major injuries is 2008-09.

	<p pid="b.790W.11/1">The WCA is function-based rather than condition-based. The medical assessment is based on the severity of functional limitation caused by a condition; not on the basis of the condition itself, because different people may be affected in different ways by the same condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.790W.11/2">The WCA was developed in close consultation with experts and specialist disability groups, including the National Autistic Society. The National Autistic Society was also involved in a recent department-led review of the operation of the WCA, on whose recommendation we are implementing changes to the WCA. As part of the review, experts analysed a randomly chosen sample of cases, covering a wide range of conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.790W.11/3">The review reported in March 2010 and concluded that, generally, the WCA is accurately identifying individuals for the correct benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.790W.11/4">Their conclusions and recommendations were based on expert analysis of a range of cases, considering the impact of revising the descriptors. The main effect of these changes is to take greater account of the way in which individuals use aids of adaptation to mitigate the functional effects of a health condition or disability. The changes will also widen the support group for individuals with certain communication problems and severe disability due to cognitive impairment or mental disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.796W.3/24">The Department for Transport (Centre) has only been able to provide a partial answer for the year 2002-03, because of a move to a new accounting system following machinery of government changes in May 2002. The Driving Standards Agency is currently experiencing a problem with its accounting software, and cannot provide figures for the years prior to 2007-08. The Highways Agency holds financial information for the seven previous complete financial years in accordance with statutory retention periods. Railway Heritage has provided estimated figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.796W.3/25">In 2007 the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency changed to a new accounting system which accumulated the items which were previously accounted for separately as stationery and printed forms. An analysis of these accounts suggests that the difference in levels of expenditure year on year was caused by this accumulation. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency estimates the current spend on the initial stationery definition at between &#163;275,000 and &#163;325,000. To extract this data in the required format would involve interrogating numerous line items within these accounts and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.796W.3/26">Trinity House is funded from the General Lighthouse Fund, and therefore does not rely on government funding for its operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.796W.3/27">The Department for Transport branch that sponsor Cycling England have said that this information can be provided only at disproportionate cost so figures for Cycling England are not included in the table.</p>

There are a number of factors that are taken into consideration such as the level of use, the safety of riders in a collision and the proportionality of the costs of any regulation versus the safety impacts. The Highway Code advises that riders and passengers of tricycles and quadricycles should wear a protective helmet (rule 83).</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.5/4">Tackling congestion on A roads which are not trunk roads is the responsibility of the relevant local highway authority who can address congestion as part of their Local Transport Plans. Measures to tackle congestion may include improving alternatives to car travel as well as general improvements to road capacity and traffic management. Schemes include bus lanes, traffic calming, cycle routes, pedestrian crossings, urban traffic control, park and ride, junction improvements, better information and working with employers and schools on travel plans to promote non-car travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.807W.9/2">The academy funding ready reckoner is intended to give maintained schools an indication of the level of funding they would receive as an academy, compared to their current funding. The main change in funding that an academy would see is a grant to cover the cost of local authority central services that the academy will now be responsible for funding itself. These amounts are based on data from statutory financial statements, published by every local authority, which are thoroughly checked by the Department for inconsistencies and anomalies. Local authorities are given the opportunity to review and confirm the accuracy of the figures they provide.</p>

	<p pid="b.808W.3/1">The Department in 2006 commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake an independent evaluation of the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. This runs for a total of six years to support the longitudinal evaluation of the impact of investment in school buildings on educational achievement. Three annual reports have been published, the most recent in March 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.808W.3/2">The latest evaluation included that, to date, BSF has had little statistically significant impact on pupils' attitudes and behaviour, and that it is overall too early to measure impact on attainment or whether the programme is providing value for money. This echoes the finding of the National Audit Office in its 2009 report &quot;The Building Schools for the Future Programme&quot; which highlighted how the programme had initially over-optimistic expectations on delivery; how estimates of the overall cost of the programme have increased substantially; and how the cost of setting up local education partnerships has been too high for the first authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.810W.2/1">Although it is not part of the statutory national curriculum, guidance on enterprise education is included in the non-statutory programmes of study for personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) at key stages 3 and 4, within the context of work-related learning. The existing primary national curriculum handbook also contains non-statutory guidance on promoting aspects of the school curriculum such as enterprise education.</p>
	<p pid="b.810W.2/2">The Government have made clear that they intend to restore the national curriculum to its original purpose: a core national entitlement organised around subject disciplines. A slimmed down national curriculum will provide greater freedom for schools to build on the core statutory requirements and for teachers to use their professional judgment on how to teach. We will be announcing further details of our plans in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.816W.8/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of her reply has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/4" class="indent">The boycott of Key Stage 2 Standard Assessment Tests (SATs) will have little or no impact on inspection at this stage and this position is set out in guidance issued to schools and inspectors in the June 2010 version of our journal &quot;Schools and Inspection&quot;, available online at</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/6" class="indent">During inspections of those schools which participated in the boycott, inspectors cannot take account of the provisional Key Stage 2 SAT results which have, in the past, been available. These provisional results often provide a useful starting point for inspectors' discussions with schools, and judgements about pupils' attainment, pending publication of the validated results in the autumn term.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/7" class="indent">However, inspectors can still follow the broad principles set out in our &quot;Evaluation schedule for schools&quot; and supplementary guidance. In reaching an overall view about attainment, inspectors will continue to exercise professional judgement in weighing all the evidence they have gathered and setting this against the credibility and accuracy of the school's teacher assessment data.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/8" class="indent">Ofsted and Department for Education officials are currently assessing whether the absence of data for the schools which participated in the boycott will affect the validity of contextual value-added measures or distort national benchmarks for attainment thresholds. A critical factor relates to whether the historic performance of schools which boycotted the tests is broadly representative of schools as a whole. For example, if there was a predominance of weaker schools, the national picture of attainment for 2010 might be artificially inflated by their absence from the statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/9" class="indent">These are critical issues which require careful consideration before we issue further guidance for the autumn term 2010. The autumn term guidance will deal with the impact of the boycott on attainment and progress data in RAISEonline and its use by inspectors. In addition, It will continue to steer inspectors to exercise professional judgement in weighing all the evidence they have gathered.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.8/10" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Nick Gibb MP, Minister of State for Schools, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.817W.2/1">The Government plan to streamline and refocus Ofsted inspection, and introduce greater proportionality into the inspection arrangements.

Similar freedoms are proposed for colleges. Further detail on this programme of reform will be announced in due course.</p>

We are therefore reviewing the routes into teaching and the incentives offered to well qualified people who want to teach physics or one of the other science disciplines. We are considering a scheme to repay the student loans of science and mathematics teachers. We have also announced plans to double the number of participants in the successful scheme Teach First so that more schools may benefit from the talents of the country's best graduates. Three-quarters of Teach First participants teach the most demanding shortage subjects, including science. Further initiatives will be announced when we are in a position to do so.</p>

The latest available figures are for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.2/3">There were .3,114 patients on the dementia register in Cumbria PCT in 2008-09. The figures are organised by practice and aggregated into PCT and strategic health authority. It is therefore not possible to give figures for Carlisle constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.823W.2/1">The incubation period for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is unknown and may vary due to factors such as route of transmission and genotype of patient. For the majority of cases where consumption of meat or meat products is presumed to be the route of infection the minimum incubation period is likely to be five years, with a mean period of around 10-12 years and the maximum, as in other human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, may extend over decades. Of the three clinical cases of vCJD presumed to be associated with blood transfusion the incubation periods are estimated to be between six and nine years.</p>

	<p pid="b.829W.9/2">This has been driven primarily by modernisation of the FSA's executive agency, the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) implemented over the last three years, reducing MHS's expenditure by 22% (&#163;19 million) from &#163;87 million to &#163;68 million and headcount by 23% (426) from 1,860 to 1,434.

	<p pid="b.829W.9/3">The MHS was dissolved and merged with the FSA to create a more effective and efficient FSA Operations Group in April 2010. This is expected to save more than &#163;2 million per year ongoing.</p>

	<p pid="b.839W.0/1">It is for local commissioners, currently primary care trusts, to determine how best to meet the health needs of their local population. In respect of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other fertility treatments and services, there are no plans to move away from local determination in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.0/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) provides guidelines for the national health service on treatments that should be funded. The NICE fertility guidelines recommend that women aged between 23 and 39, if they fulfil the criteria, should be offered three cycles of IVF treatment funded by the NHS. NICE has just commenced a review of these guidelines and it is intended that the review will be completed in October 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.0/3">In June 2009, the Department published a commissioning aid to help the NHS to assess need locally for fertility treatment, learn about infertility treatment techniques and monitor uptake of services. The Department also supported the patient interest group, Infertility Network UK, to develop standardised access criteria as a guide for those commissioning NHS fertility services.</p>

	<p pid="b.839W.6/1">The Department has supported four Royal Colleges (the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Royal College of Midwives, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and Royal College of Anaesthetists) to develop a single integrated set of clinical standards covering the care pathway from pre-pregnancy to parenthood (June 2008). This gives the commissioners specific standards to use to negotiate service provision and helps to ensure the development of high quality maternity care, including postnatal care.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has published clinical guidelines on postnatal care which sets out the core care that women and babies should be offered during the first six to eight weeks after the birth. Every mother and baby will have an individual plan of care which may include additional care to that in the core guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/3">The Government aim to offer a better experience for women and their partners, with more scope to them to exercise choice across wider range of settings and services and with wider options through the crucial ante and post-natal periods.

	<p pid="b.839W.6/4">White Paper 'Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS' sets out Government's strategy for the national health service-with intention to create an NHS which is much more responsive to patients, achieves better outcomes with increased autonomy and clear accountability at every level. With regard to maternity Government will extend maternity choice (although recognising that not all choices will be appropriate or safe for all women) and help make safe, informed choices throughout pregnancy and childbirth by developing new provider networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/5">We recognise the important role that health visitors can play in the early years and announced in the coalition agreement that we will fund an extra 4,200 Sure Start health visitors. Health visitors provide the link between Sure Start children's centres and the NHS. They will need to work across general practice and children's centres, working closely with maternity services and other agencies concerned with children and families.</p>

	<p pid="b.840W.5/1">We believe there is a need for both patients and clinicians to be able to access patient records in an electronic form. This is part of our thinking about making information transparent and available, while involving patients in decisions about their health care. The experience in Scotland, which has had an electronic summary similar to the summary care record (SCR) operating for a number of years, shows the continuing benefits it provides to patients receiving emergency and out-of-hours care.</p>
	<p pid="b.840W.5/2">However, effective use of the SCR depends on patients and doctors feeling an ownership of the records. We believe the current processes that are in place need to be reviewed to ensure that both the information that patients receive, and the process by which they opt-out, are as clear and simple as possible. In addition, should patients choose to opt-out they must be able to do so as early in the process as is feasible. Foremost in our minds is the need to ensure the security of the data contained in the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.840W.5/3">We intend to review the content of the record and consider whether we can improve the process whereby patients can opt-out. Strategic health authorities have been informed that no further information letters should be sent out to patients about the SCR until after the review has concluded.</p>

This is a clear public health priority for us and we are currently working to identify how best to take it forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.2/2">Revised National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on schizophrenia was published in March 2009. This outlines the best way to treat and manage adults with schizophrenia in primary and secondary care. The guidance recommends that treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy should be offered to all people with schizophrenia.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.2/3">Psychological therapies can be a key element of the treatment of people with severe and enduring mental health conditions, particularly when these conditions are experienced alongside depression and anxiety disorders. In these cases, the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy and other NICE-compliant therapies is the recommended treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.2/4">Services for these clients are largely provided by psychology departments in specialist mental health trusts. The implementation of Improving access to Psychological Therapies services for people in community settings with mild to moderate conditions can reduce the number of referrals to specialist mental health trusts and enable them to focus on providing services to those with severe and enduring mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.2/5">General practitioners or consultant psychiatrists can prescribe any medicine or treatment which they consider to be necessary for treating NHS patients, including NICE-approved treatments, provided that the local primary care trust or NHS trust agree to supply it on the NHS. Clinicians are responsible for deciding on the most appropriate form of treatment for their patients, and in doing so they are expected to take NICE guidance fully into account.

	<p pid="b.852W.5/12">It is not possible to provide a meaningful average cost to the public purse of an apprenticeship. The public cost of delivering an apprenticeship varies significantly depending on the industry in which the apprenticeship framework is being delivered; length of stay on the programme; whether the framework is at Level 2 or 3; and whether the participant is in the 16-18, 19-25 or 25+ age group.</p>

Between industries the difference in estimated costs can be more marked. SFA estimate that the cost of delivering a Level 3 adult apprenticeship in clock and watch repair is &#163;13,409 but the cost of an adult apprenticeship at the same level in business and administration is &#163;3,327.</p>

	<p pid="b.860W.2/1">As part of the Government's drive to enhance the UK's representation and voice in the EU institutions, work is underway to develop a more strategic approach to the use of secondments of UK civil servants to posts in the EU institutions, where UK experience and insight can add real value. We aim to ensure that these secondments are joined up across Government and appropriately targeted so that our good people are sent to strategically important positions. Short-term secondees from Government to the EU are an important source of immediate advice, and of long-term EU expertise back in Whitehall. Departments will look to help staff prepare for secondments, keep in touch while they are away and fully use their skills and experience when they get back.</p>
	<p pid="b.860W.2/2">Supporting secondments is a valuable investment that can pay dividends, so it is important to ensure that UK secondees are placed in positions that matter in terms of UK priorities. Where opportunities become available in UK priority areas, then consideration will be given to providing a UK secondee.</p>
	<p pid="b.860W.2/3">BIS usually has between six and 10 secondees in the institutions at any one time. Our centrally-managed EU secondment programme focuses on BIS priority areas and sending the best candidates as opposed to the total number of secondees. Another consideration is that that EU secondments vary in cost according the grade of the secondee, length of secondment and whether the institutions provide living allowances.</p>

	<p pid="b.861W.5/1">It is assumed that the 'administrators' report' refers to the statutory disqualification return filed under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 by the administrators.</p>
	<p pid="b.861W.5/2">When a company goes into administration, insolvent liquidation or administrative receivership, the responsible insolvency practitioner has a duty under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 to report confidentially, via a 'D Return', to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on the conduct of the directors. This is a statutory obligation in every company and the fact that an insolvency practitioner submits a report on a company's director(s) does not necessarily mean that misconduct is alleged. However if misconduct is alleged, the Insolvency Service, on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, then has a discretionary power to seek the director's disqualification where it is believed to be in the public interest.</p>

Disclosure of the personal data of directors of a company would contravene the first Data Protection Principle. In addition, in some cases, prejudice to an investigation is likely to result from disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="b.861W.5/5">The investigation into Farepak was conducted under section 447 of the Companies Act, and carried out by staff of Companies Investigation Branch of BIS. Information obtained under section 447 cannot be disclosed except where the statute expressly permits it and, unlike with the section 432 inspection, there is no provision for publication of reports. The report is very long and detailed. Counsel has been considering the report and supporting information. If any proceedings are initiated as a result of the report, they must remain confidential until they reach court.</p>

	<p pid="b.867W.8/1">The Department has not undertaken an impact assessment of either the original decision to set up the University Modernisation Fund (UMF) or the decision to refocus it on the highest quality proposals. The bids made to the fund were for significantly fewer than 20,000 places and were of variable quality. It is for universities to decide who to accept for the additional 8,000 full-time and 2,000 part-time places provided by the UMF, not the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.8/2">However, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) carried out a full sector impact assessment on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-28">28 May 2010</phrase>. The relevant sections on equality and diversity are reproduced here. The full document is available on the HEFCE website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.867W.8/5">By increasing provision in areas where there is clear evidence of demand, it will widen overall access to such courses. It will support HEIs in delivering their own equality and diversity (E&amp;D) strategies by increasing the volume of provision they have available, especially in supporting those groups protected by equality legislation which have historically been considered to be underrepresented in the subject areas covered by the process, such as women. Analysis of current recruitment data by HEFCE has shown that the relatively small additional numbers of new entrants (10,000) will not have a significant impact on the make-up of the typical student body.</p>

	<p pid="b.867W.8/7">In order to calculate the 10,000 new entrants, in each HEFCE-funded institution we have identified populations of fundable undergraduates who commenced a programme of study in 2008-09. The current sector profiles in respect of the E&amp;D groups have been calculated based on these populations. Note that none of these students will be directly affected by the policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.8/8">Assuming that the new entrants recruited will be similar to those students recruited in 2008-09, the E&amp;D profiles of the 10,000 new entrants have been modelled.

The current E&amp;D profiles have been compared to those of the 10,000 new entrants:</p>

At the Farnborough International Airshow on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-19">19 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced that he will chair regular meetings with aerospace business leaders to focus on major strategic issues facing the aerospace sector. This will set the direction for action by a wider business/government Aerospace Growth Partnership group to be chaired by myself, involving ADS (the industry trade association) and representatives from across the UK aerospace supply chain. Together these groups will play a key role in meeting our objective of creating the conditions for growth and innovation within the aerospace sector. In developing the agenda to be addressed by these groups, we will take account of the recommendations made in the Select Committee's report.</p>

	<p pid="b.878W.2/1">UKTI recognise the opportunities that exist in Afghanistan, and support activities where appropriate. Representation within markets reflects business demand. Presently, the requests received by UKTI for assistance in connection with Afghanistan are limited and ad hoc. UKTI has been exploring private-sector interest in the idea of providing a secondee for an in-market scoping exercise, but so far it has been muted.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.2/2">UKTI will continue to monitor and review the scale of opportunities and level of demand for some form of in-market presence in this market, and to calibrate this with competing demands for resources from other markets.</p>
