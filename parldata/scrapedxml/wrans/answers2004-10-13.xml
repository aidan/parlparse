This process has included an electronic forum that engaged over 550 participants and the development of 14 working papers providing material for the strategy. The first working papers are now available on our consultation website, and the remainder will be released shortly. DFID acknowledges the valuable input of NGOs, notably members of the UK Food Group, in this process. A summary draft of the strategy is being prepared, and we anticipate releasing this very shortly for wider consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".266W.5/4">DFID is also working with village development councils through the National Solidarity Programme (&pound;13 million over three years) to help communities address their own development priorities. To date 5,947 village development councils have been elected, 3,258 projects have been approved and $29 million in block grants has been disbursed to fund community projects including the construction of roads, water supply systems, irrigation canals, hydro-power for electricity, public baths, schools and weaving facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.2/1">The Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) is one input into a decision about whether or not a project should go ahead. It shows those impacts that have established monetary valuations. There are often other significant impacts to which a monetary value cannot easily be attached, but which are accounted for when assessing overall value for money (vfm). Environmental and regeneration impacts for example could be very large and could alter the assessment of vfm from that implied by looking at the BCR alone. In some cases, where the other impacts of the scheme are sufficiently negative, a high BCR may not mean a scheme offers good vfm. Conversely, in other cases, where the positive impacts are sufficiently large a low BCR may not mean that the scheme offers poor vfm.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/2">In addition to the value for money assessment, there are other considerations that affect whether a project should go ahead, including:</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/3" class="indent">Practicality</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/4" class="indent">Deliverability</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/5" class="indent">Public acceptability</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/6" class="indent">Distributional and equity impacts</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/7" class="indent">Affordability and finance sustainability</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/8" class="indent">The achievement of central government, local and regional objectives</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/9" class="indent">The amelioration of identified problems</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/10">The following table reports the latest estimates available of the BCR of the transport schemes, which the Department for Transport has approved in principle or provisionally approved within the last three years.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/11">For local schemes the local authority does a value for money appraisal of the scheme using the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA)&mdash;launched in 1998&mdash;and submits that to the Department for independent scrutiny. The appraisal is assessed by the Department, and the BCRs listed are the Department's own best estimate, using the evidence presented in the promoter's appraisal and the information uncovered during the Department's own assessment process.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/12">The schemes were appraised in different years and due to changes in the Government's appraisal methodology during this period, the BCRs reported have not all been calculated on the same basis, so they are not directly comparable between schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/13">The list does not include those schemes agreed for implementation by Transport for London, since the decision to approve such schemes is the responsibility of the Mayor. The exception has been the Thames Gateway Bridge, where the Department have offered to provide some Private Finance Initiative (PFI) credits, and borough streetlighting PFIs. These are included in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.2/173">The Markham Employment Growth Zone originated as a response to the Coalfield Task Force's Report &quot;Making the Difference&mdash;A New Start for England's Coalfield Communities&quot;. It is principally a regeneration scheme for the former colliery and surrounding land. The method of calculating the BCR does not capture the wider economic benefits that the scheme will deliver.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.2/175">Ilkeston-Awsworth Link Road is justified largely on environmental grounds. The method of calculating the BCR does not capture the environmental benefits that the scheme will deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/176">3. Ryde Esplanade Transport Interchange: BCR 0.36</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/177">Ryde Esplanade Interchange is the main entry point to the Isle of Wight. It is primarily aimed at improving the quality of facilities, increasing security and encouraging tourism, which accounts for 24 per cent. of the island's economy. The method of calculating the BCR does not capture these wider benefits the scheme will deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/178">4. Merseytram: BCR 1.1</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/179">The scheme has significant benefits that are not included in the monetised BCR. These include significant regeneration and social inclusion benefits, as well as beneficial impacts on air quality and greenhouse gases.</p>

	<p pid=".273W.2/1">It would be for local transport authorities, including Passenger Transport Authorities and the Mayor for London, to propose new urban underground schemes as part of their plans. Each scheme would need to be considered on the basis of its value for money, including its wider benefits, and affordability. The cost of such schemes means it is unlikely they would be justified except on corridors with the highest level of demand.</p>

	<p pid=".283W.8/1">Leicester is a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) area. Recorded crime data at CDRP level has only been published from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards. Violent crime comprises violence against the person, sexual offences and robbery. In 2003&ndash;04, at least 52 per cent. of all recorded violence against the person involved no injury.</p>

	<p pid=".292W.9/1">The system of floors and ceilings referred to by the Audit Commission is in place to ensure that all councils receive an increase in funding each year and that there is stability in the funding of authorities. In setting the levels of floors and ceilings, Ministers are mindful of the need to make progression to the allocations implied by the formula in order to deliver the fairer distribution of funding which the formula review produced. We therefore agree with the Audit Commission that there is a balance to be struck in setting the level of the floors and ceilings.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.9/2">The minimum funding guarantee that was introduced in 2004&ndash;05 has brought stability and certainty to schools budgets. It was considered appropriate to put in place such stability given the funding difficulties experienced by some schools in 2003&ndash;04. As a result of the introduction of the minimum funding guarantee two thirds of schools nationally received an increase above the level of the minimum guarantee while the remaining third of schools received a per pupil increase in funding in line with the guarantee.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.9/3">Changes to a local education authority's funding formulae are matters for local discretion provided that they operate within the framework of the regulations. While the Audit Commission reports that some councils have suspended proposed changes to their funding formula, the survey was based on a sample of LEAs and was carried out before the start of the financial year 2004&ndash;05. Evidence from other authorities shows that there is no inherent need to suspend changes to formulae as a result of the minimum funding guarantee. Some authorities, in fact, have used the guarantee to provide transitional protection to ensure that such changes are phased in appropriately to ensure stability in school budgets.</p>

In the case of children who live with parents with shared responsibility, the Code of Practice recommends that admission authorities ensure that their oversubscription criteria make clear how the 'home' address will be decided in a fair and considered and consistent way. It is therefore for admission authorities themselves to set out the basis on which they will consider the geographical proximity aspect for applications for children with parents who are divorced.</p>

Following publication, there is a six-week representation period (or four weeks if the school is failing) during which anyone can make representations about the proposals. The proposals are normally then referred to the local School Organisation Committee (SOC). If the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision, the proposals are referred to the schools adjudicator.

	<p pid=".295W.2/1">It is the responsibility of each local education authority to plan school provision in its area taking account of changes in local population. The Department does not issue specific guidance on planning school provision to meet increases in housing, but does provide other guidance on the statutory processes for making changes to local school organisation and separate guidance on capital.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/2">Proposals to provide new primary schools, or enlarge any existing schools, to meet population growth, must be subject to local consultation before being published. The final decision on the proposals will generally be taken by the local School Organisation Committee or, if they cannot agree unanimously, an independent adjudicator. Where an LEA proposes to establish a new secondary school they must publish details of the need for the school, inviting other promoters to submit proposals, and the Secretary of State will decide which of the proposals submitted should be approved.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/3">The Department provides capital support for local authorities and schools to invest in school infrastructure, including for the provision of new pupil places. The Department allocates much of its capital resources to local authorities and schools by needs-related formulae, as they can best decide how to target their highest priority needs, in accordance with their asset management planning processes. Local authorities can also negotiate contributions from developers for new school provision, under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as substituted by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991). The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister provides guidance to local authorities about such agreements in its Circular 1/97.</p>

	<p pid=".302W.2/1">This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, the Commission has identified more than 450 pieces of legislation which it considers could be repealed or formally recognised as obsolescent, and it will be putting proposals to do this to the Council and the European Parliament. As EU regulatory reform champions, we have strongly supported the Commission's work in this area and will continue to do so. It should be a priority for the new Commission too, and I welcome Commissioner Verheugen's comments on the issue in his recent European Parliament hearing. We are also working with EU partners on initiatives to use impact assessments as a basis for competitiveness testing, to simplify existing legislative proposals and encourage the use of alternatives to regulation.</p>

Just under half of these left the island before the hurricane struck. A significant number of those who remained were visiting friends and relatives and could not be contacted. Subsequently, 131 were moved to another part of Jamaica and 2,497 were evacuated to another island or returned to the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.2/3">We understand there were about 5,500 holidaymakers booked through British tour operators on Cuba. Approximately 1,000 were evacuated to an alternative holiday destination, the remainder were moved to other parts of the island.</p>

	<p pid=".308W.2/1">As lead nation on counter narcotics in Afghanistan since April 2002, the UK has had regular discussions and works closely with the Afghan Government to support delivery of the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which was adopted in May 2003. I have visited Afghanistan for discussions with President Karzai and his Ministers about progress on the strategy. The UK has allocated &pound;70 million over three years to support this work. As a result of those contacts, in the first year of implementation of the strategy the basic counter narcotics structures have been put in place: drug control legislation, a Counter Narcotics Directorate, the Ministry of Interior's Afghan Special Narcotics Force, the Counter Narcotics Police and a central eradication capability. Work is also in hand to develop alternative livelihoods for farmers dependent on opium poppy cultivation. The measures we have put in place provide a sound basis for future co-operation with the Afghan Government and international partners to secure the further development of robust institutions and programmes to combat opium production and trafficking. Progress remains linked to the wider security situation in Afghanistan and to the implementation of other areas of institution building such as policing and judicial systems.</p>
	<p pid=".308W.2/2">Burmese opiates are not trafficked to the UK in significant quantities. Most stays within the Asia/Pacific region. Our Ambassador in Rangoon discussed the reduction of poppy cultivation and other drugs issues with Burmese Ministers during a visit to Northern Shan State in January 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".309W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has discussed the situation in the North Caucasus with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on several occasions since the tragic siege at Beslan in September. Most recently they discussed Chechnya on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-22">22 September</phrase>, when they met in New York. As in previous meetings, including those during the Foreign Secretary's visit to Moscow in July, they discussed international concerns about the human rights situation in Chechnya. They also discussed the difficult security situation in the region and the need for the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation to co-operate closely in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.2/2">I also raised the situation in the North Caucasus with the Russian Ambassador when I saw him recently. This followed my substantive discussions with senior Russian officials on this subject during my visit to Moscow on 6&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April</phrase>. During my discussions in Moscow, I specifically raised concerns over human rights abuses in Chechnya, and pressed too for progress on the political process there. In addition, I raised the situation in Ingushetia with regard to the conditions for internally displaced persons there.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.2/3">These exchanges are part of our ongoing, regular dialogue with the Russian Federation on the situation in the North Caucasus.</p>

	<p pid=".311W.5/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.5/2">Research has recently been published which estimated the cost of domestic violence to society in England and Wales at &pound;23 billion each year. &pound;6 billion of this related to the direct costs of services to deal with domestic violence (police, criminal justice system, health and social services care, housing and civil legal cases) and to the loss of economic output due to the suffering of victims. There has been no similar research on costs in Northern Ireland. Extrapolation of the research figures for England and Wales on a pro-rata population basis would indicate that the cost of services and loss of economic output due to domestic violence could amount to about &pound;180 million each year in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.6/1">Considerable progress has been made in making information about Committee activity more readily accessible to the public. In particular, I commend the new forward calendar of Committee activity on the Parliament website and the Committee Office telephone information line. The live webcasting of all Committee hearings is also a very welcome development. However, I believe that more needs to be done to ensure that the information provided reaches a greater section of the public; and to this end I hope that the House of Commons Commission will give sympathetic consideration to the recommendations in the Modernisation Committee's recent report on Connecting Parliament with the Public.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.6/2">The reception and security facility planned for Cromwell Green will facilitate public access to Select Committee hearings. I very much hope that the House will also support in due course plans for a Visitors' and Educational Centre, which would allow for live relay of Committee hearings, as well as proceedings in the Chamber.</p>

	<p pid=".317W.3/1">I have no plans to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.3/2">Until recently all public service pension schemes (and many in the private sector) only provided widows' and widowers' pensions up until the beneficiary remarries or cohabits with someone as their husband or wife. From October 2002, a new pension scheme for civil servants was introduced (known as premium) which has an improved benefit structure paid for by higher employee contributions. One of the improvements is to provide widows and widowers pensions for life. To provide a similar improvement in respect of the pre-October 2002 scheme (known as classic), where higher contributions have not been paid, would not only be unfair to the members of premium who are paying higher contributions for enhanced benefits, but would also result in tax payers meeting the additional costs to the classic scheme of doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.3/3">Public service-wide additional costs for future service have been estimated at &pound;150 million per annum, plus a one off cost of &pound;3 billion to cover all past service.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.0/1">The Government commissioned a study in 2003 to see if there are any possible mechanisms, consistent with the objectives of the Energy White Paper, which could be deployed to encourage the control of CMM emissions. This study was undertaken by independent consultants and was overseen by a Advisory Board of representatives from the industry, DTI, DEFRA, and the Coal Authority. The purpose of the exercise was to investigate means for controlling emissions to atmosphere from abandoned mines where the current practice of venting is clearly undesirable. The results of the study are available on the DTI's website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/coal/cfft/coalminemethane.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/coal/cfft/coalminemethane.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.0/2">The study included an assessment of commercially exploiting CMM for power generation or for use as a burner tip fuel. The consultants found that the least cost option for dealing with these methane emissions was through flaring rather than putting them to commercial use. It was also concluded that the potential capacity for power generation, beyond that already exploited by the industry, was limited at less than 20 MW. There was therefore no significant security of supply arguments for specifically encouraging electricity generation from CMM.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.0/3">However, as a result of this study it was proposed that a scheme be established to control CMM emissions, which would be open to all technology options, including electricity generation, burner tip fuel use as well as flaring. Proposals from the private sector to control the emissions would be competitively considered by the Coal Authority and the most cost-effective solution awarded a contract leaving them to decide on the most cost-effective means of control.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.0/4">The Government recognise and value the benefits the coal mine methane technology industry provides by tapping the methane emissions from disused coal mines and putting them to good use for generation of electricity. We have already demonstrated this support through our securing exemption from the climate change levy for electricity generated from CMM which came into force in November 2003, and why the proposed grant-scheme will be open to this technology.</p>
