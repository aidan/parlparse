	<p pid="c.627W.8/1">The Government believe that the time is right for the Northern Ireland Assembly to complete the process of devolution by requesting the transfer of policing and justice powers. However, the actual timing of devolution remains for the Assembly itself to decide upon, as set out in section 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Good progress continues to be made towards the completion of devolution and I believe that the financial package set out by the Prime Minister should enable the parties to move forward with the process.</p>

	<p pid="c.631W.0/1">The conflict that ended in January made worse an already extremely serious humanitarian situation. Today, more than nine months on, 75 per cent. of Gazans still rely on some form of food aid and over 60 per cent. do not have daily access to water. The onset of winter will further affect those whose homes remain damaged or destroyed since the end of the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.0/2">Since the start of the conflict in December 2008, the UK has pledged almost &pound;47 million for immediate humanitarian assistance, early recovery and reconstruction. Whilst some basic humanitarian assistance has been entering Gaza, access constraints have severely hampered early recovery and reconstruction efforts. The UK will continue to press the Israeli Government for the provision of full, immediate and unhindered access for aid, aid workers and reconstruction materials, in line with fundamental humanitarian principles.</p>

	<p pid="c.639W.8/1">The RAF makes a vital contribution to operations in Afghanistan. Our aircraft perform a number of roles such as: close air support; reconnaissance and surveillance; to providing support to land operations; and re-supplying front line troops. In particular, Chinook and Hercules aircraft provide an invaluable aeromedical service with rapid transfer to specialist care facilities in Afghanistan. As part of the airbridge C17 and Tristar aircraft provide a consistent and reliable service moving large numbers of personnel into sometimes hostile environments under difficult conditions and medically evacuating injured service personnel back to the UK. Many RAF personnel also fulfil a range of roles on the ground, including force protection around Kandahar airfield and Camp Bastion.</p>

	<p pid="c.642W.0/2">Defence's main effort is Afghanistan and in the very difficult financial climate hard decisions have had to be taken. This has resulted in a reduction to the funds available for this year to our Cadet Forces, and specifically to the Army's Cadets. This decision has not been taken lightly.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.0/3">The Department's commitment to the Youth agenda remains undiminished as evidenced by our recent response to the Milburn Report where, despite the challenging financial situation, we have accepted in principle the recommendation to ensure that those state school pupils who wish to get involved in Cadets may do so. We are investigating innovative methods of extending cadet provision to state school pupils which include working closely with the Department of Children Schools and Families.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.0/4">Financial constraints prevent the Government from meeting this recommendation in full, immediately. However this year, for example, we have delivered an additional six London Challenge Partnerships (Independent School CCFs offering Cadet places to neighbouring state school pupils) and the Air Cadet Organisation plans an annual expansion, targeted at state school pupils, of 700 cadets per year until 2018.</p>

	<p pid="c.642W.6/1">The provision of good quality living accommodation for both married and single service personnel continues to be a top departmental priority. Decades of under funding means that the standard of service accommodation has lagged behind the expectations of our people. Some housing stock is old.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.6/2">Investment over the last seven years has begun to correct this, but there is much more to be done. The Department plans to invest some &pound;3 billion on accommodation improvement programmes over the next decade. Since 2001, over &pound;200 million has been spent upgrading some 14,000 service family accommodation (SFA) properties to the top standard for condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.6/3">More remains to be done, but progress is being made and over 90 per cent. of SFA is now at the two highest standards for condition. Our aim is to ensure that by March 2013 very little, if any, of the occupied SFA estate should be below standard 2 for condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.6/4">In addition, since 2003, some 35,000 new or improved single living accommodation bed-spaces have been delivered as part of a &pound;1.4 billion programme that will see a further 21,000 delivered by 2013.</p>

A single programme has been established to deliver the VFM agenda, encompassing existing work and initiatives from the OEP and the Public Value Programme. This includes benchmarking of Defence back office costs and a review of MOD assets, where progress will be reported at Pre-Budget Report 2009. In addition, a &quot;VFM Team&quot; has been formed across MOD business areas which supports individuals at all levels in the delivery of VFM savings. Specifically on OEP, departmental leads have been appointed for each of the work strands to implement the recommendations. Ministers, senior officers and officials are fully aware of the guiding OEP principals established by HM Treasury. Value for money is integral to all the work of the Department and a wide range of learning and development opportunities are available to assist with driving the VFM programme.</p>

The Prime Minister has asked for a report on this by the end of the year. The UK remains committed to Continuous At Sea Deterrence which is the backbone of our deterrence posture, ensuring a credible and capable deterrent against blackmail and acts of aggression against the UK's vital interests including her NATO allies by nuclear-armed opponents. Continuous At Sea Deterrence is the UK's most enduring current operation and has been successfully delivered for over 40 years by our dedicated service personnel.</p>

	<p pid="c.660W.8/1">Some basic humanitarian assistance has been entering Gaza through the crossings from Israel, but the overall flow of goods into Gaza remains severely limited. Israel has not provided clarity on what types or volumes of goods it will and will not permit to enter Gaza. The flow of goods and materials falls far short of addressing basic human needs of Gaza's estimated 1.5 million people and prevents all but token efforts towards reconstruction. On average, the government of Israel allows the transfer of just 60 per cent. of the industrial fuel required per week to operate Gaza's only power plant at the current maximum capacity of 80 megawatts. The number of trucks carrying humanitarian and commercial goods is routinely restricted to approximately a third of the weekly average before restrictions were tightened. The import of building materials and agricultural inputs is heavily curtailed.</p>
	<p pid="c.660W.8/2">The Rafah crossing from Egypt is primarily a pedestrian crossing and is often closed. Restrictions imposed by the government of Israel also affect goods passing formally from Egypt, which are channelled via Israel through the Kerem Shalom crossing.</p>
	<p pid="c.660W.8/3">Large quantities of a wide variety of items continue to enter Gaza from Egypt via tunnels. Given the illicit nature of the trade, it is hard to quantify the trade. Reports from Gaza suggest that a wide variety of goods which cannot be imported any other way are entering through the tunnels, and are then available on the open market. Arms are undoubtedly part of this trade. According to a recent UN report approximately 100,000 litres of diesel and 100,000 litres of petrol is transferred into Gaza via the tunnels each day.</p>
	<p pid="c.660W.8/4">We will continue to urge action to press the Israeli authorities to ease border restrictions into Gaza and allow the passage of essential humanitarian aid and reconstruction material. The Prime Minister stressed this point most recently in his joint letter, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-16">16 October 2009</phrase>, with President Sarkozy to Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

	<p pid="c.663W.2/1">Israel is entitled to build a security barrier to protect its citizens from acts of violence. But the barrier should be confined to Israeli territory and not encroach on occupied territory. In some places, the barrier breaks up Palestinian territory, cuts Palestinian farmers off from their land and divides Palestinian communities, separating people from their families. We have particular concerns about the route of the barrier near East Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="c.663W.2/2">In recent years, there has been a drop in the number of terrorist attacks in Israel. The political context is clearly an important factor. The barrier, which remains far from complete, may have played a role. There has also been a notable improvement in security provided by the Palestinian Authority Security Forces in the West Bank in line with Palestinian commitments under the Roadmap.</p>

	<p pid="c.663W.8/1">The economic situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories remains difficult. According to the World Bank, gross domestic product is estimated to have declined by 34 per cent. in real per capita terms over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="c.663W.8/2">More recently, increased international aid in 2008 and 2009 has allowed Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad to stabilise the public finances and pay salaries in both the West Bank and Gaza. The economy of the west bank has also benefited from the improved security provided by the Palestinian security forces and from the removal of some obstacles to movement around the west bank by the Israeli Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.663W.8/3">The International Monetary Fund recently estimated that growth in the west bank could reach 7 per cent. for 2009. But unemployment remains close to double the level of a decade ago and much more needs to be done to return the economy to sustainable growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.663W.8/4">In Gaza, the situation remains extremely serious. Israeli restrictions mean the productive sector of the economy has come to an almost complete standstill. 95 per cent. of the manufacturing sector has shut operations and exports have effectively ceased. The economy now depends on Palestinian Authority and UN salaries together with illicit earnings from smuggling as the main sources of income. Official unemployment stands at 42 per cent. but the actual figure is likely to be in excess of 50 per cent. and there are worrying levels of aid dependence.</p>
	<p pid="c.663W.8/5">We are working to support economic growth. We also call on the Israeli Government to go further in removing movement restrictions, to release telecoms frequencies for a second Palestinian mobile operator, to resume normal banking relations with Palestinian banks and to remove other barriers to economic growth.</p>

	<p pid="c.664W.2/1">As our ambassador made clear to the Human Rights Council, the UN fact finding mission on Gaza has its flaws:</p>
	<p pid="c.664W.2/2" class="indent">not adequately recognising Israel's right to protect its citizens or paying sufficient attention to Hamas's actions;</p>
	<p pid="c.664W.2/3" class="indent">making broad assertions about detailed interpretation of international law with which we differ; and</p>
	<p pid="c.664W.2/4" class="indent">(because Israel did not cooperate) lacking an authoritative Israeli perspective so crucial to determining the legality of actions.</p>
	<p pid="c.664W.2/5">However, the report raises very important issues that are of serious concern and that we want to see addressed. Rocket attacks by Palestinian militants targeted at innocent civilians in southern Israel constitute a breach of international humanitarian law.

	<p pid="c.666W.2/1">Although this year has seen an increase in the number of attempted pirate attacks (156 attacks from January-September 2009, compared to 111 attacks from January-September 2008), the number of successful attacks has reduced significantly, especially in the critical Gulf of Aden transit artery. According to International Maritime Bureau statistics the actual rate of successful hijacking against attacks has reduced from one in three in December 2008 to one in 11 in June 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.2/2">Up to <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase> the EU Naval Force had successfully escorted 44 World Food Programme (WFP) vessels, providing 220,880 tons of aid to Somalia, which the WFP would otherwise not have been able to send.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.2/3">Furthermore international efforts to tackle piracy off the coast of Somalia have achieved unprecedented levels of naval coordination with international partners including India and China coordinating their efforts with EU, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and coalition forces through a Shared Awareness and Deconfliction forum. The Contact Group of Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) represents 53 nations. The CGPCS also established the New York Declaration (to which the UK is a signatory) that strengthens best management practices in dealing with piracy as well as supporting regional capabilities to tackle piracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.2/4">The international community in conjunction with the International Maritime Organisation have also established a code of best practice for industry while travelling off the coast of Somalia. Between December 2008 and October 2009 there has only been one successful attack on a ship complying with best management practices while transiting the Gulf of Aden. Agreements have been initiated with Kenya and the Seychelles to allow pirates apprehended in the region to be prosecuted there.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.2/5">Collectively, these measures are improving the effectiveness of the international community's efforts to tackle piracy off the coast of Somalia, but in the long term the solution has to be found on land. To this end Working Group 1 (chaired by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) led a regional needs assessment to the Horn of Africa in September 2009, which provided a clear map on how regional states can be assisted in addressing piracy on land as well as at sea.</p>

	<p pid="c.667W.3/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) provides specific recommendations both to commercial vessels and to members of the public while travelling near Somali waters. This information is available on the FCO website.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.3/2">In terms of commercial advice, specific guidance is given in relation to the practical steps in avoiding pirates which have been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a successful pirate attack. The advice also links to guidance from Department of Transport and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It advises ships to register with the EU's Maritime Security&mdash;Horn of Africa website and transit through the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor in addition to adhering to the latest Maritime Advisories in force throughout the piracy threat region.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.3/3">The Government endorse the advice prepared by the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia which provides specific advice on how to prevent, deter and delay acts of piracy off the Horn of Africa. The Maritime Security Centre&mdash;Horn of Africa website contains general advice to shipping companies, and the UK Maritime Trade Organisation advises mariners on planning their passage through the Gulf of Aden.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.3/4">As Chair of Working Group 1 of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS), the FCO has been instrumental in securing greater dissemination and adherence to industry's best practice of vessels travelling in the waters in the vicinity off the coast of Somalia. The FCO also signed the New York Declaration which provided further guidance to industry in relation to best management practices to avoid and deter acts of piracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.3/5">In terms of specific advice to members of the public travelling in waters in the vicinity of the coast of Somalia, the FCO advises mariners to remain at least 200 nautical miles from the Somali coast when transiting between the equator and 08N latitude, and 100 nautical miles from Somalia's northern coastline in the Gulf of Aden. However, as pirates have been using mother ships to attack shipping further than 200 nautical miles from the Somali coast, the FCO also advises mariners to maintain a high level of vigilance and to exercise extreme caution when anywhere near Somali waters.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.3/6">This advice is provided within the FCO's travel advice relating to the Indian Ocean as well as more specifically the advice provided to individuals intending to travel to Seychelles, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. The River and Sea Safety section of travel advice also advises yachters travelling in their own yacht or boat to be aware of the risks of piracy in the Indian Ocean.</p>

	<p pid="c.671W.2/3">The list of countries from which animals may enter the UK under the PETS Scheme without going into quarantine is set out in European legislation (see Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 as amended). In order to be included in that list, countries need to demonstrate to the European Commission that they meet certain criteria set out in the regulation. Inclusion is then subject to agreement by EU member states.</p>

	<p pid="c.671W.5/1">Operators of appliances with a rated thermal input of 20 megawatts or more in which biomass is combusted need a permit under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 which will contain emission limit values set by the relevant environmental regulator. If the biomass is waste, permits are required if the rated thermal input of the appliance exceeds 0.4 megawatts.</p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/2">The use of biomass for heat and power can pose a significant air quality problem. Large scale heat or combined heat and power schemes should not normally be used in heavily built-up areas (subject to an Environmental report) unless they are of high quality (20g/GJ PM10 or less) or have efficient abatement equipment specified. There are, however, technology options coming on stream which could substantially reduce emissions, even in urban areas (ceramic filters, for example). It would be easy to infer that biomass should not be encouraged in air quality management areas, which obviously already have a significant problem with air pollution. Seeking non-combustion alternatives&mdash;ground or air source heat pumps, solar thermal, better building design should be the first option; the second is to attempt to group users together&mdash;this allows the use of a smaller number of larger plants, and larger plants are easier to control.</p>

Ofwat supports this form of assistance as part of an overall package of debt prevention and management.

The guidance specifies that where a charitable trust or a restart scheme is in place, companies should, where appropriate, tell customers about them or refer customers to a relevant contact.

	<p pid="c.685W.8/1">Neighbourhood policing is central to providing a police service that is responsive to local crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) concerns. Since 2002 we have invested over &pound;1 billion to ensure that there is now a Neighbourhood Policing team in every neighbourhood, including in total more than 13,500 officers and 16,000 PCSOs. In December 2008, we introduced the Policing Pledge, which outlines commitments that the police service have made to the public, including minimum response times, holding monthly meetings to understand local concerns and providing regular updates on action taken to deal with those concerns.</p>
	<p pid="c.685W.8/2">The latest British Crime Survey (BCS) figures released in October 2009 show an improving trend that, nationally, 50 per cent. of the public now agree that the antisocial behaviour and crime issues that matter locally are being dealt with. In October 2009, HMIC published a report on the progress of all forces in delivering the pledge. The report graded Staffordshire police as &quot;fair&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.685W.8/3">It is for individual police forces and authorities to ensure the effectiveness of neighbourhood policing in their area. The Government will hold forces to account for progress through the single top-down target that antisocial behaviour and crime issues that matter locally are being dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="c.685W.8/4">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has inspected every force in England and Wales to assess their capabilities in delivering Neighbourhood Policing and Developing Citizen Focus. HMIC's assessment in September 2008 was that all forces, including Staffordshire police, had met this standard.</p>

	<p pid="c.687W.11/5" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary question asking how many deaths of persons aged <i> (a)</i> below 16, <i> (b)</i> 16, 17 and 18, <i> (c)</i> 19 to 25 and <i> (d)</i> over 25 years of age were attributed to the use of illegal drugs in the most recent year for which figures are available. (295922)</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.11/6" class="indent">Drugs classified under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) are termed 'controlled substances', and unlawful possession of a controlled substance is illegal, as is possession with intent to supply. Lawful possession of a controlled substance would include when the drug was in the possession of a person it had been prescribed to. It is not possible to ascertain from information collected at death certification whether a drug was obtained lawfully or not.</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.11/7" class="indent">The table attached provides the number of drug misuse deaths of persons aged <i> (a)</i> below 16, <i> (b)</i> 16 to 18, <i> (c)</i> 19 to 25 and <i> (d)</i> over 25 years of age, in England and Wales, for 2008 (the latest year available).</p>

Although the decision on a visa application may be made in another location, applicants continue to submit their applications to, and collect their visas from the visa application centre in their country of residence, or the visa application centre designated to handle applications from applicants of their nationality. The registration part of the process can, in many cases, be separated from the decision part, making full use of modern communications systems and our partnerships with VFS Global and CSC Wordbridge.</p>

	<p pid="c.690W.8/1">The decision on whether to detain or not is made very carefully on a case by case basis. While the UK Border Agency always aims to detain immigration offenders for the shortest period of time possible, the likely duration of detention is dependent on a range of factors, such as the relative difficulty of obtaining the appropriate travel document with which a person's removal can be effected, or where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with the conditions attached to a grant of temporary admission or release.</p>
	<p pid="c.690W.8/2">As an alternative to detention, the introduction of better contact management through the use of physical reporting at reporting centres and police stations together with the use of electronic monitoring (tagging and voice recognition) has allowed the UK Border Agency to maintain contact with individuals at all stages of the asylum process and with those who have breached immigration law.</p>
	<p pid="c.690W.8/3">The UK has not participated in and has no plans to implement the EU Returns Directive 2008/115/EC. We agree that a collective approach to removal can have advantages. However, we are not persuaded that this Directive delivers the strong returns regime that is required for dealing with irregular migration. Our current practices on the return of illegal third country nationals are broadly in line with the terms of the Directive, but we prefer to formulate our own policy, in line with our stated position on retaining control over conditions of entry and stay.</p>

	<p pid="c.691W.6/1">Neighbourhood policing is central to providing a police service that is responsive to local crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) concerns. Since 2002, we have invested heavily to ensure that there is now a neighbourhood policing team in every neighbourhood, including in total more than 13,500 officers and 16,000 PCSOs. The latest British crime survey (BCS) figures released in October 2009 show an improving trend, that, nationally, 50 per cent. of the public now agree that the antisocial behaviour and crime issues that matter locally are being dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.6/2">Funding is made available to police authorities, and it is for each police authority and each police force to allocate resources within the local force area. We provided &pound;15.17 million to West Midlands police authority in 2008-09. The 2009-10 funding is &pound;15.58 million, an increase of 2.7 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.692W.2/1">The Government regularly receives representations relating to blocking, from different sections of society. The Government discusses issues relating to child protection, including blocking of websites containing illegal images, with a wide range of stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.692W.2/2">The Government are clear that the use of blocking to prevent access to such images is something that internet service providers should do, and the Government have been very pleased with the response from the internet industry. The internet industry, and the Internet Watch Foundation which they support, have worked closely with law enforcement to tackle websites hosted in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.692W.2/3">This has led to less than 1 per cent. of the total number of such sites being hosted in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.692W.2/4">Ofcom has recently published figures showing that 98.6 per cent. of consumer broadband lines are now covered by blocking based on the IWF list. It remains the Government's hope that the target of 100 per cent. of consumer-facing ISPs operating a blocking list will be achieved on a voluntary basis. However, the Government do not rule out legislation at some point in the future if it is not, and will keep progress on the target under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.705W.5/1">The Department has not commissioned research on the impact of the economic downturn on levels of demand for mental health services. However, we recognise that there are links between poor mental health and difficult economic circumstances. Mental health services in England are now better prepared than ever before to provide help for these people.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.5/2">Since 2001-02, total planned investment in adult mental health services has increased by 50 per cent. (or &pound;2.0 billion), putting in place the services and staff needed to transform mental health services. Total planned investment increased from &pound;5.530 billion in 2007-08 to &pound;5.892 billion in 2008-09, a 6.6 per cent. increase in the amount, and 4.0 per cent. in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.5/3">We also have 64 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists, 71 per cent. more clinical psychologists and 21 per cent. more mental health nurses than we had in 1997, providing better care and support for people with mental health problems. (Full-time equivalent).</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.5/4">Because of the National Service Framework and increased funding, we now have over 740 new community mental health teams offering home treatment, early intervention, or intensive support for people who might otherwise have been admitted to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.5/5">We are also investing significantly in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme with annual funding rising to &pound;173 million in the third year (2010-11), to train 3,600 extra therapists and treat 900,000 more people in those three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.5/6">The talking therapy services that are already up and running under the IAPT programme have been very successful, with 73,000 people entering treatment and 1,500 more therapists being employed under the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.5/7">In March 2009, a &pound;13 million package of measures was announced to tackle the effects of the economic downturn. Employment is key to good mental health and the &pound;13 million will strengthen the health service's links with employment services at local level, speed up the introduction of IAPT services in the areas most affected by the recession and provide better public access to information online at NHS Choices. The NHS Credit Crunch Stressline has also been established and is taking calls from people whose health is being affected by money worries.</p>

	<p pid="c.706W.2/2">Some research is still ongoing and due to deliver in 2010. Most other research projects have resulted in a considerable number of related publications in academic journals.

	<p pid="c.717W.7/2">The Government are fully committed to ensuring that individuals are able to achieve their full potential and ambitions for work. This includes providing services which better meet the needs of the Public Service Agreement 16 customer group, which includes people with moderate to severe learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.7/3">With this in mind, the Government launched 'Valuing Employment Now: real jobs for people with learning disabilities' on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-24">24 June 2009</phrase>. Our aspiration is to close the gap between the employment rate for people with learning disabilities and that of the disabled population as a whole. In real terms this means an extra 45,000 people with learning disabilities in employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.7/4">Access to Work is an important specialist disability employment service delivered by Jobcentre Plus, and therefore will be vital in achieving this aspiration. We are currently exploring how we can ensure that the programme provides the most flexible, responsive and appropriate support for all customers, and to ensure that the funding is focussed on those who need it most, including customers with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.7/5">Currently customers are limited to 26 weeks of job coach support. From this autumn we will be making the programme more flexible to ensure that people who require further job coaching can access the service for longer. We anticipate this will be particularly helpful for customers with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.7/6">In making the changes to job coaching rules for Access to Work, we will ensure that customers who would be better supported by other provisions such as WORKSTEP and its successor Work Choice (from October 2010) are referred to the most appropriate service for their needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.7/7">The Welfare Reform White Paper 'Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future' contained a commitment to double the Access to Work budget from &pound;69 million to &pound;138 million by 2013-14. This was a confirmation of the announcement originally made in the Welfare Reform Green Paper 'No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility'.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.7/8">In addition, Access to Work customers have been able to apply for support to participate in a Jobcentre Plus Work Trial since <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>. Work Trials give customers the opportunity to 'try out' work, and also builds employer confidence in their ability to do the job. Work Trials can last from a few days to six weeks and because there is a genuine job vacancy at the end they are a direct route into paid employment. This may be another route in to meaningful work for people with learning disabilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.720W.2/1">Jobcentre Plus is working in partnership with the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils and individual Sector Skills Councils in order to identify the labour market sectors that have the potential to provide sectoral routeways.</p>
	<p pid="c.720W.2/2">Care First Careers, a joint Department for Work and Pensions initiative with the Department for Health and the Devolved Administrations, is a sector specific initiative to help 50,000 young people into work in the adult social care sector.

	<p pid="c.720W.2/4" class="indent">Cheshire, Warrington and Halton;</p>

	<p pid="c.720W.2/7">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has funding for approximately 37,000 training places in England to March 2011 and is contracting for these using a staged approach. The LSC is now nearing the conclusion of the commissioning process for the first 30,200 places which will be in the following sectors:</p>

	<p pid="c.720W.2/14">The distribution of training places within each sector and the take-up of provision each month will, depend on employer demand at local level.</p>

	<p pid="c.726W.3/1">Three bidding rounds have been completed to date and information can only be provided on the jobs awarded under those rounds. It is not possible to estimate how many additional jobs may be awarded under future bidding rounds in the first 12 months of the project.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.3/2">Under the first two bidding rounds, 111 jobs will be created in Luton, 137 jobs will be created in Bedfordshire and 1,375 jobs will be created in East of England. These jobs will be created between October 2009 and April 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.726W.3/14">It is also not possible to provide details of the funding allocated to Luton or Bedfordshire. Due to the make-up of the awards in those areas, to reveal information on the number of jobs awarded together with the amount of funding awarded could enable a calculation to be made which would reveal commercially sensitive information about the bids involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.729W.2/1">The information requested has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.729W.2/2">The ratio of jobseeker's allowance claimants to staff varies between regions. The staff figures provided includes people deployed on work focussed and claim processing activity for a wider group than jobseeker's allowance claimants so staff numbers and therefore ratios are impacted by other factors. The contact centre directorate operates a virtual network and therefore aligning their work to geographic boundaries would be misleading. For instance, Wales has three large contact centres handling calls as part of the virtual network. On the same principle, the network of benefit delivery centres can, and do, move work around the country on a weekly basis to maximise speed of claim processing. Although benefit delivery centres are in the main linked to regions/countries, such work movement and some centralised functions mean there is not a clear distinction. For example, applications for national insurance numbers are processed in two centres, Glasgow and Isle of Wight, so staff numbers will be included in the Government office region for Scotland and south east respectively.</p>

A key outcome from these discussions is the agreement of a development plan for every member of staff.

In addition, they have access to the Department for Work and Pensions Leadership and Management journey events. These provide staff with generic leadership and management skills and in some cases access to accreditation. Our staff are encouraged to use a wide range of learning solutions in addition to products such as coaching; for example, Jobcentre staff are encouraged to visit local providers to ensure they are able to confidently talk to our customers about the range of support that we are able to offer to them. All business changes are reviewed to identify the learning that staff will require to deliver them successfully, update learning products accordingly and develop new learning products where required.</p>

	<p pid="c.736W.3/2" class="indent">We are now in the final stages of bringing the three main ICT organisations together to form a single ICT function.</p>
	<p pid="c.736W.3/3" class="indent">The MOJ has agreed an estates strategy to rationalise the estate it inherited on its creation and deliver significant financial, sustainability and effectiveness gains.</p>
	<p pid="c.736W.3/4" class="indent">A detailed strategy for the MOJ procurement function called Procurement Success has been developed and signed off by our Corporate Management Board.</p>
	<p pid="c.736W.3/5" class="indent">A new programme of activity designed to achieve the MOJ wide shared service vision for finance and human resources transactional services is currently under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.736W.3/6">The Department is also participating in HM Treasury led back office benchmarking exercises and engaging with Government heads of profession in implementing other recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.736W.3/7">Value for money features in several of the Department's internal financial training guides for Ministers and staff alike. &quot;Money for Ministers&quot;&mdash;An Introduction to Finance in the Ministry of Justice for Ministers&mdash;for example, is aimed at helping ministers through the finance framework MOJ operates to achieve value for money, staying within the fiscal rules, and efficient, effective service delivery and offers contacts for further help and/or one-to-one tuition.</p>
	<p pid="c.736W.3/8">For staff, a monthly programme of workshops &quot;Improving Financial Management in MOJ&quot; has a specific section on looking at value for money and how to achieve it. Staff are able to get access to an e-learning module on the Department's intranet and developed by the National School for Government called &quot;Finance Skills For All&quot; which covers topics such as why value for money is a better measure in the public sector then profitability. More generally, the Department has embarked on a programme of bottom up change (LEAN), supported by training, aimed at reducing or eliminating waste within a business system or process of an organisation, so that staff can use their time efficiently, concentrating on the work that adds value to their business.</p>

This requires The National Archives to prepare resource accounts for each financial year, in conformity with an HM Treasury direction, detailing the resources acquired, held, or disposed of during the year, and the use of resources by The National Archives during the year.

The Accounting Officer is also required to produce an annual Statement of Internal Control, which must taken into account actions highlighted by both the Management Board (which contains four non-executive directors) and the Audit Committee, which is chaired by a non-executive director. The Audit Committee is responsible for providing advice and assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control and risk management. It also oversees internal and external audit arrangements, which cover all areas of The National Archives' work, including both financial and non-financial systems. The Comptroller and Auditor General is required to produce a certificate and report to the House of Commons on the financial statements of The National Archives and this has been issued for the past three years with no comment. Therefore, I am assured on an annual basis that The National Archives' financial governance arrangements continue to meet all expected requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.740W.2/1">As at October 2006, The National Archives employed 34 staff at grade G and 15 at grade H, five of which joined in 2006 when The National Archives merged with the Office of Public Sector Information. In October 2007 The National Archives employed 46 staff at grade G and 17 staff at grade H. This increase from 2006 was as a direct result of a drive across Government to professionalise core services in IT, finance and HR. 11 of the new staff were professionally qualified in these areas. In October 2008 there were 51 staff at grade G and 15 staff at grade H, one of which joined when the Statute Law Database became part of The National Archives and seven of which were new posts, funded externally. As of October 2009 the figure stands at 54 staff at grade G and 16 staff at grade H.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.2/2">The organisation is at the final stages of completing a cost saving exercise which involves reducing the number of management and administration posts at G and H grade by four. This will bring the net total of G and H grades to 66 in 2010 of which seven will continue to be externally funded.</p>

After both post holders departed, the roles were restructured to reflect the changing needs of the organisation, and the posts filled temporarily on an interim basis. The National Archives therefore currently employs an Interim Director of Finance and an Interim Head of Finance. It is in the process of recruiting a permanent Director of Finance. Following the review of the finance department, the Head of Finance post has been split into two roles&mdash;one focussing on financial accounts and the other on management accounts.

All social visits should last at least one hour. Under guidance issued by the National Offender Management Service prisoners should have the opportunity for some of these visits to take place at weekends. In addition some prisons also provide opportunities for family visits which focus on improving the relationship between the imprisoned parent and their children.</p>

For this reason, ECL operates according to precise fixed criteria: if prisoners meet the set criteria they are released on ECL. Prisoners serving a sentence for a violent offence (such as conspiracy to murder, manslaughter, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, unlawful wounding, cruelty to children) are excluded.</p>

As with any release, if the prison has information that indicates a risk to a victim, that information should be provided to the police and, where appropriate, submitted to the Multi Agency Pubic Protection Panel, in line with routine risk management arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.741W.5/4" class="indent">Where the prison has information that indicates the prisoner has given the address of his victim as his release address, this should be flagged up to the local police so that measures to address the risk can be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="c.744W.2/2">NOMS attributes the increase in numbers during February 2009 to the severe snowfall in London on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-02">2 February</phrase>, which disrupted prisoner escorts to and from courts.

	<p pid="c.750W.5/1">The school funding system provides a sum per pupil in a local authority for it to distribute for all its education responsibilities including schools. Once delegated to a school, it is for the school governors to decide upon the use of the delegated budget to meet the school's priorities, which may include purchasing the services of a counsellor.</p>
	<p pid="c.750W.5/2">We do not collect information on the use of school funding in sufficient detail to capture information about which schools are providing counselling services and what is spent on these services. We do not collect information on which schools employ professional counsellors.</p>
	<p pid="c.750W.5/3">We are committed to improving the emotional and mental health of children and young people and to help them develop social and emotional skills, improve self-esteem and self-control, enabling them to develop good relationships and to promote their resilience, so they can adapt to change and cope with difficult circumstances. This may include the use of services such as counselling.</p>
	<p pid="c.750W.5/4">Access to counselling services has been provided locally through a number of DCSF initiatives developed in recent years. Counselling services may be provided through schools (including Pupil Referral Units) working with other agencies such as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, social care and or third sector organisations. For pupils with behaviour related difficulties, counselling support may be provided through local Behaviour and Education Support Teams and Learning Support Units.</p>
	<p pid="c.750W.5/5">Supporting the psychological well being and mental health of pupils is a key component of whole school programmes such as the Healthy Schools Programme and the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning programme. Such programmes are intended for pupils generally and may need to be supplemented by more specialist support for certain pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.750W.5/6">The &quot;Your Child, Your Schools, Our Future&quot; White Paper, published in June, stated that in order that every young person in secondary school gets the help they need to progress in learning and has a source of personal support, we will make sure that each one has a Personal Tutor who knows them well and who will support them in planning their learning, in making choices and through difficult times.</p>
	<p pid="c.750W.5/7">The Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme, funded by &pound;60 million between 2008-2011, builds on the successful social and emotional aspects of learning programme (SEAL) for those pupils who need additional support. Some of the schools involved in the programme have chosen to offer counselling based approaches as part of their package therapeutic interventions to children at risk of developing mental health problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.755W.2/1">The Adaptation Fund was established under the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC and launched at COP-7 in Marrakech, in 2001. Its aim was to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in vulnerable developing countries. The Board of the Adaptation Fund was then established in 2008. The Fund is expected to become operational before the climate change conference in Copenhagen at the end of this year. The Adaptation Fund has a unique mechanism for financing, which is not dependent on contributions from specific countries. Instead, it is financed by a market-based source of funding&mdash;a 2 per cent. levy on the proceeds of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which was also established under the Kyoto Protocol. Nevertheless, the UK has been supporting the design and implementation of the Adaptation Fund both as a board member and through provision of &pound;0.5 million start-up funding.</p>

	<p pid="c.757W.5/1">Information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library and via the CLG website:</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/homelessnessq22009">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/homelessnessq22009</a></p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/3">Data collected includes the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty to secure that suitable accommodation is available (&quot;homeless acceptances&quot;). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/4">The priority need categories include a person (other than a relevant student) who is under 21 and, at any time after reaching the age of 16, but while still under 18, was, but is no longer, looked after, accommodated or fostered. Between April and June 2009 (the most recent period for which data is available), 130 homeless acceptances fell within this priority need category.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/5">The priority need categories also include a person (other than a relevant student) who has reached the age of 21 and who is vulnerable as a result of having been looked after, accommodated or fostered. Between April and June 2009, 40 homeless acceptances fell within this priority need group, but it is not possible to identify the age of the applicants.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/6">The term &quot;relevant student&quot; means a person to whom section 24B(3) of the Children Act 1989 applies, who is in full time further or higher education and whose term-time accommodation is not available to him during a vacation.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/7">Former relevant children under 21 are likely to qualify for advice and assistance from the responsible Children's Services authority, including assistance in meeting their accommodation needs. The general expectation is that they will receive sufficient support to avoid them becoming homeless. However, if a former relevant child's accommodation arrangements break down unavoidably, the homelessness legislation provides a safety net to ensure they will have suitable accommodation available.</p>

	<p pid="c.761W.2/1">Good progress has been made on a number of fronts: eight out of nine regional control centres (RCCs) buildings have been built, fire and rescue authorities have come together to form regional local authority controlled companies to run the RCCs and equipment installation in local fire stations is on track.</p>
	<p pid="c.761W.2/2">However, in July we rescheduled the implementation timetable. It became clear that technical problems with developing the IT system in a way which met all our and the fire and rescue services' requirements meant that further time would be needed to complete the project.

'Direct access' services are defined as night shelters, emergency or crisis accommodation, including direct access hostels, and other homeless hostels. Therefore Supporting People data does not separate out 'emergency' from 'night shelter' accommodation.</p>

Over this period, growth in the number of short term vacants accounts for the entire increase. Short term vacants are defined as being empty for less than six months. Short term vacancies occur for a variety of reasons including repairs, maintenance, housing sales and other transactions.

The Government wish to be satisfied that reasonable alternatives to these proposals were tested by the Sustainability Appraisal published with the Proposed Changes in July 2008. The testing of 'reasonable alternatives' is a requirement of the EU Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive. We expect this additional work to be completed early in the new year.</p>

It would not be sensible to speculate on what action will be necessary before the findings are available, or how long any action is likely to take.</p>

	<p pid="c.784W.6/1">The Government recognise the difficulties separated parents face when sharing responsibility for a child. There is no easy solution, which is why, ideally, parents should themselves reach an arrangement how the financial support provided through child tax credit and child benefit should be divided.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.6/2">However, where parents cannot reach such an arrangement, the Government believe that the best outcome for the child is achieved by directing support to the family with the main responsibility for caring for the child. As with all aspects of the tax credits system, the issue of shared care is kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.785W.7/2">Poor payment practices in the construction industry give rise to substantial additional financing and transaction costs. More importantly certainty over how much and when payment is made builds trust between supply team members and underpins collaborative working to achieve value for money for clients. That is why Government are committed to a 'Fair Payment Charter' in construction contracts which applies equally between the client and lead contractor and throughout the supply chain. To ensure effective and equitable cash flow for all those involved, all contracts will provide for regular payments and have payment periods not exceeding30 days.</p>
