This year presents an opportunity to make significant progress towards a lasting peace settlement in the Middle East. Last week's London meeting on Supporting the Palestinian Authority was an important step forward. We need to build on the successful elections in Iraq and Afghanistan to secure a peaceful future for the people of both countries. We will also use our twin presidencies of the G8 and EU to tackle climate change and address the challenge of development in Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.1798W.3/2">As reported in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February 2005</phrase>, DFID has provided &pound;287,000 to the immediate flood response in Guyana. Since that statement we have provided an additional &pound;30,000 in materials. Through the UK's contribution to the European Commission (EC), we have provided &pound;185,000 out of the &euro;1.7 million provided by the EC as immediate relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.1798W.3/3">The UK has tried to ensure that our support goes to areas not otherwise covered by other members of the international community. The World Food Programme and the Red Cross met immediate food needs, and were funded by others from the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1798W.3/4">The UN, through the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), is currently undertaking an assessment of the impact of the floods on Guyana's economy and on people's livelihoods. These assessments have been tried and tested in many regional disasters. The assessment will indicate longer term food security needs, as well as reconstruction needs. To date there has not been an identified need to replace accommodation. The priority has been to clean flood affected accommodation, as well as schools and health centres, to make all such places useable again. The Government's cleaning programme is being supported by the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.1798W.3/5">Some schools are still unable to operate as normal. Those affected were used as shelters for displaced people, and they are currently waiting to be reached by the Government cleaning programme. Of the public utilities only the provision of piped water was affected. Pumping stations and distribution networks were severely affected in many areas. This service is now getting back to normal. The management improvements at Guyana Water Incorporated&quot; provided through the water reform programme ensured an effective response to the flood situation. This programme was funded by DFID and others to improve the supply of potable water. There are sufficient resources in place, and sufficient capacity, to undertake the necessary ongoing repairs. Oxfam have been working very closely with the water utility to ensure the supply of potable water during and after the crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1798W.3/6">The Guyanese Drainage and Irrigation Board, supported by UN sourced experts, have identified a set of emergency works to be undertaken on the water management system damaged by the floods. This work is urgent as there are fears that this system was compromised by the floods, and might fail in the main May/June rains. DFID are now in the process of finalising assistance to support implementation of these emergency restoration works. In conjunction with United Nations Development Programme we are funding the cost of a Dutch expert to assist the Government of Guyana in overseeing the emergency rehabilitation of the water management system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1807W.2/1">The latest estimate of breeding cormorants in the UK and Ireland is provided by the Seabird 2000 survey. These data indicate that there are 3,145 breeding pairs of cormorants in England (including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man). This includes the majority of the estimated 1,646 breeding pairs of cormorants at inland colonies in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1807W.2/2">UK coastal colonies are dispersed more widely, with many birds breeding in Wales and Scotland. However, many of the coastal breeding birds from all parts of the UK, and their progeny, move onto inland fisheries in England and Wales in the winter and these, together with significant immigration of wintering birds from the continent, give rise to elevated numbers inland during winter. The winter cormorant population in the UK has increased four fold in the last 25 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1807W.8/1">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development produce an estimate of the level of subsidy provided to agricultural producers in OECD countries, the Producer Support Estimate (PSE). The latest estimate, in Agricultural Policies in OECD Countries: At a Glance, 2004&quot;, puts the EU's PSE at &euro;108 billion or approximately 37 per cent. of output. This estimate covers all direct payments to producers under the common agricultural policy (and national schemes) including those under agri-environment measures. It also covers gross transfers to producers as a result of market price support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1807W.8/2">Defra has not made an assessment of the impact of the CAP on developing countries' agricultural markets. However there are a number of published studies which consider the effects of developed countries' agricultural policy on developing countries. One such estimate is presented in the World Bank report Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries, 2002&quot;. This puts the annual benefits to developing countries (in 2015) from liberalisation of agriculture and food policies in high income countries at $99 billion (when dynamic productivity gains are included). It is important to note that developing countries are not all affected in the same way: for example the effect depends on whether the country is a net exporter or net importer of highly protected agricultural products. In addition, the magnitude of an estimate will depend, in part, on the modelling methodology used to generate it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1808W.2/1">In May 2003, the USA, Argentina and Canada filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation against the procedures regulating the import and marketing of GMOs in the European Union. The focus of the complaints is that the EU has allegedly not been operating its own approvals system for GM products since 1998. It is alleged that this is more trade restrictive than is required to achieve the desired level of public health protection, that it is not based on proper scientific criteria, and that it unfairly discriminates between GMO and non-GMO products. The case is made against the European Commission, not individual member states, but it specifically cites Austria, France, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy and Greece.</p>
	<p pid="a.1808W.2/2">The Department has received correspondence from stakeholders and the public in relation to this WTO case, in the main supporting the EU regulatory position. The UK Government has also raised this issue in meetings with the US administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1808W.2/3">The UK Government has expressed its disappointment that this action has been taken by the USA and we are working with our EU partners to defend the case and find a solution. As with any WTO dispute we will be bound by the ruling, which will be reached after due consideration of the evidence. The UK agrees with the European Commission that existing EU legislation on GMOs is compatible with trade rules and that significant progress has recently been made in dealing with applications under the legislation for placing GM products on the market.</p>

	<p pid="a.1811W.2/1">Defra supports the appropriate use of sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) such as reed beds, but recognises that, at present, barriers to the implementation, adoption and maintenance of SUDS exist. In order to address these problems, Defra is a member of the The National SUDS Working Group&quot; (NSWG), of which representatives of water companies and Water UK are also members. Regular meetings of this group are held facilitating discussion between all parties interested in the implementation of SUDS. In July 2004 the NSWG published an Interim Code of Practice (ICOP) for SUDS. The aim of the ICOP is to provide a strategic approach to the allocation of responsibilities for the maintenance of sustainable drainage systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1811W.2/2">The new strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management that Defra has just finished consulting on, looks at ways of better coordinating the various responsibilities for urban drainage, including SUDS. A technical annex to this consultation explores in more depth, the specific options and proposals that have been made to government by stakeholders (such as water companies and Water UK) to encourage and facilitate implementation of more sustainable surface water drainage systems in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1811W.5/1">The Single Payment Scheme (SPS) is open to applications from farmers who meet the scheme conditions. A farmer is someone who carries out an 'agricultural activity' as defined in the EC legislation. A commoner who is a farmer, may seek to establish SPS entitlements on a notional share of the eligible area of the common where he or she has rights to graze. On most commons in England, the notional share will be calculated in proportion to the commoner's right to graze the land, as registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965. It will be up to an individual to decide whether or not he or she will apply for the scheme. All applications will be included in the normal inspection arrangements, including checks to determine whether the applicant is a farmer.</p>

I understand from London 2012 that &pound;530,000 of costs are directly attributable to the visit. This figure is largely associated with the production cost of the three days of presentations, plus hiring hotel venue space and providing technical support.

	<p pid="a.1815W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1815W.3/2">A number of factors influence the choice of location of a sale, including the location at which the highest price will be achieved and seller's fees. It seems likely that for many sales the cost of relocating would exceed any saving on royalty and would prevent diversion. In addition, based on figures provided by the art market for the 2001&ndash;02 season, the total value of the market was &pound;4,227 million and of this &pound;442 million (approximately 10 per cent.) worth of these sales would attract a royalty payment if the right was applied to works by living and deceased artists. If the right was applied only to works by living artists &pound;64.8 million (less than 2 per cent.) worth of the total value of sales would attract a royalty payment. The Patent Office has asked interested parties during the present consultation for any information which would help complete the partial impact assessment, and will be commissioning further economic analysis during the consultation process.</p>

These policy directions require them to ensure that all parts of the UK have access to lottery funding. The arts, sports and heritage distributors have also been directed to take account of the scope for reducing economic and social deprivation at the same time as ensuring benefits for the arts, sport and heritage.</p>

MDP also contribute to the effective safety and security of the station, its residents, employees, and passing members of the public, by carrying out external patrols and joint Counter Terrorist Unit armed patrols with North Yorkshire police, to prevent unauthorised entry and interference with the station and its mission, reducing the potential for unlawful activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1822W.5/7">MDP liaise with the organisers of the smaller more regular demonstrations, when those demonstrations take place. A supervisory officer in charge of the police officers present at the demonstration, conducts a briefing to protesters, detailing the intentions of the police to allow a lawful and safe demonstration, while ensuring that others in the area are permitted to go about their lawful activities without interference. The briefing also advises that where unlawful activity takes place appropriate police action will be taken. Any concerns raised by the protesters are, wherever possible examined and resolved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1827W.8/2">The Report recommended that the latter should be explored further as the opportunity offers. That opportunity has been taken through the Workforce Modernisation Programme introduced following enactment of the Police Reform Act 2002. The Thematic Report on Workforce Modernisation published in July 2004 by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary recognised the benefits forces were achieving in this area. The Report proposed that police staff could perform the role of custody officer provided appropriate training and co-ordination was in place. That is why we are looking to carry out a pilot programme in a number of force areas for staff custody officers. This will look at processes around selection, training and practical application at the police station.</p>

	<p pid="a.1828W.8/2">We recognise that there are clear links between alcohol use and domestic violence. Studies have shown that there are strong correlations between perpetrators of domestic violence and alcohol use. The British Crime Survey indicated that 32 per cent. of incidents of intimate partner violence were committed when the perpetrator was under the influence of alcohol (Mirlees-Black, 1999). However, it must be stated very strongly that alcohol is a trigger for domestic violence and not a cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.1828W.8/3">In relation to drug use and domestic violence, research from other countries has highlighted that there are clear links. In the UK, research into the links between substance abuse and domestic violence was commissioned and then undertaken by the School of Health and Social Studies at the University of Warwick. The research is now complete and we expect the findings to be published in April.</p>

	<p pid="a.1830W.11/1">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>, extradition between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland was carried out under a backing of warrants system. This was carried out on a police-to-police basis, under the close supervision and assistance of the Crown Prosecution Service with, in cases where the person was an accused rather than a convicted person, the involvement of the UK and Irish Law Officers. The Home Office had minimal involvement in the process and statistics were not kept centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1830W.11/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>, the extradition process between the UK and Ireland has taken place under the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).

	<p pid="a.1830W.11/3">Her Majesty's Government will not list unexecuted requests, as for good and obvious reasons, we cannot confirm or deny the existence of any arrest warrant before an arrest is made. It follows therefore that information on representations, if any, also cannot be disclosed.</p>

In general in 2006&ndash;07, our priority is to review and replace funding formula which no longer reflect the pattern of service provision on the ground, or which are calculated using very out of date data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1840W.0/2">Several funding formulae currently contain a sparsity top-up which is calculated using information from the 1991 Census. This top-up recognises the higher costs of service delivery that are likely to occur in sparsely populated areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1840W.0/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not currently planning to undertake any research into the extra costs of providing services in rural areas. However as part of the current formula review the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will re-assess how best to take account of sparsity in these funding formulae. This work will need to consider which data best reflect differences in the cost of providing services in rural areas, be it data on population density, settlement patterns or population dispersal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1843W.8/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was created in May 2002. One staff survey has been conducted since that date, in January 2003. The amount paid to consultants to undertake this survey was &pound;51,820 excluding VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.1843W.8/2">The staff survey collects data about staff demographics and attitudes which informs the development of corporate strategies. Through regular staff surveys, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also able to measure progress against the delivery of corporate objectives and benchmark itself against similar organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1843W.11/2">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) provides funding for a national helpline for Gypsies and Travellers at a cost of around &pound;50,000 a year. It is not possible to say how much of this money was spent in relation to North Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.1843W.11/3">In addition, legal help, which provides for basic advice and assistance, is available subject to satisfying the statutory tests of the applicant's means and the merits of the case. The LSC does not hold data on how much legal help is awarded to Gypsies and Travellers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1843W.11/4">Legal representation at planning applications and appeals is generally outside the scope of legal aid. However, since April 2000, funding can be made available in exceptional cases under section 6(8)<i>(b)</i> of the Access to Justice Act 1999, when the relevant criteria are satisfied, for example, where the case concerns the applicant's home. This protects the applicant's fundamental rights and ensures a fair hearing. It is not possible to give a precise figure for total costs, but since April 2000, a maximum of &pound;45,000 plus VAT (excluding legal help costs) has been spent on planning applications in relation to Gypsy and Traveller encampments. None of these applications related to planning applications or appeals in North Essex.</p>

	<p pid="a.1845W.0/2">Making work pay and supporting parents in balancing their work and family responsibilities helps enable parents to participate in the labour market, which in turn is critical to tackling child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845W.0/3">Since October 2004, the minimum wage (adult rate), in conjunction with the working families tax credit and other benefits have provided a guaranteed minimum income of at least &pound;252 a week for families with one child and one earner in full-time work (35 hours per week). On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-25">25 February</phrase> we announced that the minimum wage will be increased to &pound;5.05 from October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845W.0/4">In 2003 we introduced a new right for parents to request a flexible working pattern. In the first year 800,000 requests were either wholly or partly accepted. In addition to this new entitlement, we extended maternity leave so most mothers can choose to take up to one year. We also introduced new rights to two weeks' paid paternity leave and introduced paid adoption leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845W.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February</phrase> my Department published a consultation document, Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility&quot;. Through the consultation we are seeking views on the details of commitments and proposals set out in the 2004 pre-Budget report which build on the our successful package of family friendly working rights. These include extending Statutory Maternity Pay, Maternity Allowance and Statutory Adoption Pay to nine months from April 2007 towards a goal of a year's paid leave by the end of the next Parliament, introducing a right for mothers to transfer a proportion of their maternity leave and pay to fathers, and looking at options for extending the right to request flexible working to carers of adults and to parents of older children. These measures would give families more choice about how to balance their work and caring responsibilities, supporting parents who may otherwise have been forced to drop out of the labour market to stay in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1845W.0/6">Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/workandfamilies">www.dti.gov.uk/workandfamilies</a>.</p>

This recommends that local highway authorities consult road users on a winter operational plan on an annual basis, and publish and implement it.

	<p pid="a.1860W.6/1">The Commission for Integrated Transport and the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions criticised the congestion PSA targets set in 2000 on the grounds that they did not relate to specific roads and were not meaningful to road users, since they did not capture important aspects of road users experience such as journey time reliability. In the light of these concerns the Government announced in the White Paper The Future of Transport&quot; (July 2004) that it was replacing the previous targets with new ones, to be published in July 2005. In the Transport 10-Year Plan 2000: Delivering better transport&mdash;progress report&quot; (December 2002) the Government said that congestion forecasts were higher than previously, largely due to higher economic growth. The report went on to say that although the measures set out in the 10-Year Plan will deliver significant reductions in projected levels of congestion, these may not be sufficient to secure a return to 2000 levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.1862W.9/1">Recent progress on policies and other programmes to reduce emissions from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the transport sector and other sectors was published in Review of the UK Climate Change Programme: consultation paper&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-08">8 December 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1862W.9/2">Examples of measures which have led to reductions in carbon emissions from the transport sector include the Government's support for low carbon vehicles and fuels through fiscal and other incentives and support for research, development and demonstration programmes such as the New Vehicle Technology Fund. Policy measures in the transport sector alone are forecast to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 4.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1862W.9/3">The Government expect that, as a result of their policies, carbon dioxide emissions will fall. In 2003, they are estimated to have been about 7 per cent. below 1990 levels. By 2010, they are forecast to be 14 per cent. below 1990 levels based on current projections. This figure includes only the estimated emission reductions gained from measures that are firm and funded. It does not include, for example, measures that may happen but are not yet finalised, such as a possible further round of voluntary agreements on average new car fuel efficiency between the European Commission and the automotive industry after the current agreements expire in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1864W.4/1">Our first step towards eradicating child poverty as set out in our current Public Service Agreement target is to reduce the number of children in low-income households by a quarter by 2004&ndash;05. This is measured using the proportion of children in relative low income households. Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in Households Below Average Income 1994&ndash;95 to 2002&ndash;03&quot;. Data are not available below the regional level and are only available as proportions at the regional level. It should be noted that the reporting of year-on-year changes in the regional low-income rates are not reliable. 'Measuring child poverty', published in December 2003, outlines the Government's measure of UK child poverty for the long term. The measure will consist of three tiers; absolute low income, relative low income and material deprivation and low income combined. The Government will set a target as part of the 2006 SR06 Spending Review to halve by 2010&ndash;11 the numbers of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and relative low income. Data will not be available below the regional level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1868W.2/5" class="indent">Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 we have to provide a service to both employers and to people seeking employment. We must, therefore, have strong reasons for refusing an employer access to our services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1868W.2/6" class="indent">Some vacancies advertised by Jobcentre Plus include statements which, due to the nature of work or the employer's circumstances, jobseekers are not obliged to apply for. These include vacancies in the adult entertainment, sex and related industries and/or involving nudity, and vacancies from employers where industrial action is taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1868W.2/7" class="indent">Whilst the payment of Jobseekers Allowance is intended to provide a safety net of a minimum level of income for those between jobs, unemployment must not be voluntary. Sanctions therefore underpin the benefit system.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-09a.219871.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-09a.1869W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1017" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="1869W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050309/text/50309w21.htm#50309w21.html_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1869W.2/1">As part of its range of new deal promotional materials, the Department provides a leaflet for employers about the new deal for disabled people (NDDP), which is used by Jobcentre Plus in working locally with employers. It includes case studies of and for employers and can also be used by NDDP Job Brokers as a marketing tool. The NDDP News Magazine, which is published on a quarterly basis and has a circulation of 10,000 to 15,000, also includes positive features on employers' experiences of employing people who have found a job through NDDP and is frequently requested by Job Brokers for use in their promotional activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1869W.2/2">The main emphasis in promoting NDDP to employers lies with individual Job Brokers. Job Broker services vary and are focused on customers' requirements and the needs of the local labour market. Their marketing activities are also tailored to need, and are most likely to be primarily directed towards potential customers. Job Brokers can work directly with an employer but will only do so with the agreement of the customer concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1869W.2/3">A key indicator of success is in the programme's achievement of job entries. Up to September 2004, over 46,000 people had gained a job through NDDP since the programme began in 2001. The Department has in place a comprehensive research programme for NDDP, designed to establish the experiences and views of the range of stakeholders, including Job Brokers, customers and employers, among others. This does not directly assess the success of Job Brokers' measures to publicise the programme, but emerging findings show that employers are broadly aware of the new deal and, although less so of NDDP specifically, they are aware of Job Broker organisations in their area, where Job Brokers often advertise under their own name for their NDDP service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1877W.3/1">The Organised Crime Task Force has carried out detailed analysis of the scale of paramilitary involvement in counterfeiting and piracy and its assessment is that paramilitary gangs carry out 80 per cent. of organised intellectual property crime in Northern Ireland, with loyalist and republican gangs equally heavily involved. The Independent Monitoring Commission's report of <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-04">4 November 2004</phrase> also highlights paramilitary involvement in this form of criminality.</p>

In Karachi we have reopened the visa office with 3.5 staff and will shortly be posting a further two officers there. We have also outsourced the application procedure to Gerry's Fedex (a local joint venture with Federal Express) to remove the need for every application to be lodged at the high commission in person. We now accept visa applications from all categories except working holidaymakers and first time visitors under 25. We are in discussions with the Pakistani authorities about putting in place the necessary conditions to restore a full service as soon as possible.</p>

Among the EU accession countries there are officers only in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Network reports on industrial research and development, among other scientific issues, to help inform UK policy and practice on science and innovation. For example, the Network made a significant input to inform the Department for Trade and Industry's Innovation Report in December 2003.

	<p pid="a.1890W.2/1">Russia has made important progress along the path of economic and democratic reforms since the break-up of the Soviet Union. President Putin's first term saw an impressive programme of economic reforms launched, designed to liberalise the economy. Further progress was made on issues such as land law and tax reform, deregulation, and helping to create better conditions for small and medium sized businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1890W.2/2">Russia was recognised by the EU and US as having attained market economy status in 2002. We support Russia's objective of joining the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and welcome the stimulus this has given to further market reforms. A bilateral agreement on WTO accession terms and conditions was concluded with the EU in May 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1890W.2/3">We are, through bilateral Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development programmes, supporting Russia's process of economic reform, and we are working on programmes connected to issues such as corporate social governance and media oversight, designed to improve economic transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1890W.2/4">It is clear that the handling of the Yukos affair has raised concerns in the minds of investors in Russia about the Government's commitment to transparency and the rule of law. We have raised these concerns with the Russian Government. We have also underlined the need to reaffirm commitment to open markets and democratic processes. In that respect, we welcome President Putin's recent statements in Bratislava on Russia's commitment to democracy and want to see this and the rule of law firmly entrenched in the reform process, as well as human rights protected.</p>

Latest published figures show that, by October to December, 96.8 per cent. of patients were admitted, transferred or discharged from accident and emergency within four hours.

	<p pid="a.1894W.6/1">The uses approved for licensed botulinum products are limited to the treatment of certain kinds of muscular spasms and disabling spasticities. For those uses we are satisfied that the products meet all of the safety requirements laid down in European legislation and guidance and these together with standards for quality and efficacy are a prerequisite for the licensing of medicinal products.</p>
	<p pid="a.1894W.6/2">If these products are being used for cosmetic purposes then they are being used outside the terms of the product licenses the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted. However, doctors may prescribe and use a licensed medicine for unlicensed purposes to meet the need of an individual patient, on their own responsibility, where they judge the benefit to the patient is justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1894W.6/3">The Chief Medical Officer established the Expert Group on the Regulation of Cosmetic Surgery to provide advice on whether the current regulation of cosmetic surgery was sufficient to ensure patient safety. The expert group published its report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-28">28 January 2005</phrase>. It recommended that the current law relating to the prescription of botulinum toxin&mdash;which allows for its prescription by a doctor and its administration by a doctor or nurses&mdash;should be more consistently adhered to, and that facilities where botulinum toxin is injected should be licensed by the Healthcare Commission and subject to its regulations. The Government accept these recommendations, and will work with the Healthcare Commission, professional bodies and other key stakeholders to formulate an implementation programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1895W.0/1">The new contractual framework for community pharmacy gives primary care trusts (PCTs) the opportunity to work with local pharmacists to develop a range of high quality community pharmacy services. This will make them an integral part of local primary care provision. PCTs should be able to exploit fully the opportunities in order to maximise the benefits to patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1895W.0/2">The framework offers considerable benefits for general practitioners (GPs) and the opportunity to work closer with community pharmacists whether in rural or non-rural areas. This includes support for self-care, the management of common ailments and helping patients get the best from their medicines. The introduction of repeat dispensing in every pharmacy will mean that patients will be able to get a prescription from their GP to be dispensed in instalments by their pharmacy for up to a year without patients having to make repeat visits to the surgery for their prescriptions. This will help reduce GP workloads, offer opportunities for pharmacists to review patient medication and minimise waste by not dispensing medicines that patients no longer require. Repeat dispensing is especially of benefit to people with long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1895W.0/3">We have recently finished consulting representative organisations on the regulatory changes needed to bring in the new framework and the reforms to the control of entry system. We will shortly lay these before Parliament together with the final regulatory impact assessment. We will also publish directions to PCTs, concerning how they are to implement some of the aspects of the new framework and a determination regarding the remuneration to be paid to national health service community pharmacy contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1895W.0/4">The regulations will ensure the new framework and the balanced package of control of entry reform measures broaden the range and quality of services for patients, encouraging innovation and excellence in service provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1896W.3/1">The national health service counter fraud and security management service (CFSMS) provides training for all staff who counter fraud and corruption within the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1896W.3/2">It is mandatory for all NHS counter fraud specialists to complete successfully a counter fraud foundation level course. This high quality professional training has been accredited by the universities of Portsmouth, East London and Wolverhampton and is worth 40 higher education credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1896W.3/3">Successful completion of the foundation level leads to the nationally recognised professional qualification of accredited counter fraud specialist (ACFS). The NHS is one of a number of organisations where staff are trained to this standard. At the end of 2004, there were 8,274 qualified ACFSs from hundreds of organisations in both the public and private sectors including six Government Departments, such as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Government agencies such as the Audit Commission, several police forces, banks, investment companies and over 300 local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1896W.3/4">Further training includes an intermediate level course, which focuses on prevention and deterrence of fraud. Additionally, the CFSMS provides refresher training on issues such as interviewing skills and regularly updates training where there are changes in law or procedures that have an impact on work to counter fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1896W.3/5">Throughout the year, the CFSMS ensures ongoing support and training for staff through quarterly forums and an annual conference. There is also assistance through a training centre helpline and a regional network.</p>
	<p pid="a.1896W.3/6">Because the training attracts higher education credits, it can lead on to further academic study and the CFSMS supports staff who want to continue to develop and work towards a BSc. (Hons) in counter fraud and criminal justice studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1896W.3/7">At present there are no plans to change the training. It is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is relevant and meets the requirements of staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.1899W.2/2">The NHS Modernisation Agency set up the Modernising Dentistry Programme in 2002 following the publication of Options for Change report to look at new ways of working in dentistry. The total budget for the programme, which includes field sites, was &pound;1 million in 2004&ndash;05. The 48 field sites involve around 250 dental practices, which are widely distributed across England. They range from practices looking at remuneration and commissioning, electronic booking, the patient experience, clinical governance and customer care, through to primary care trust wide and strategic health authority wide remuneration sites. Field sites have been supported to develop, and monitor their Option for Change projects, some of which have required conversion to personal dental service (PDS) schemes. Building upon these foundations, PDS is now providing dentists with the opportunity to take advanced benefit of the new contractual arrangements, which we are to introduce by April 2006. We now have some 4,400 dentists in over 1,500 dental practices working under PDS arrangements and, by April 2005, we expect 25 per cent. of all dental practices to have moved to PDS.</p>
