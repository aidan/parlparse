	<p pid="a.312W.2/1">Ofgem has put in place rules to protect consumers on pricing, including licence condition changes to prevent unfair price differentials, including those between different payment methods, such as between pre-payment meters and standard credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.2/2">Ofgem has reported on the effectiveness of these changes and found that the differentials for customers paying by pre-payment meter (PPM) have been completely eliminated and are, on average, &#163;19 below the equivalent standard credit tariffs.

	<p pid="a.313W.0/1">The Golden Rule, the principle that the charge attached to the energy bill should not exceed the expected savings on an average bill sits at the heart of the Green Deal and is a key consumer protection mechanism. Satisfying the Golden Rule at the outset will protect bill payers and enable the charge to transfer automatically from one bill payer to the next. We have not therefore considered a Green Deal scheme without this protection. There is no limit on the face of the Energy Bill to the amount of finance available to each household. As we develop secondary legislation we will be considering what limit is appropriate alongside other consumer protections. We will publish analysis of the effects of our proposals at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/2">It is important to ensure that as many households as possible are eligible for a Green Deal. The new Energy Company Obligation will interact with the Green Deal and provide support to vulnerable and low income consumers as well as those in expensive to treat homes. In addition, ambitious consumers will have the opportunity to pay any excess costs up front to ensure the charge attached to the energy meter will meet the Golden Rule.</p>

	<p pid="a.313W.6/1">Participants in the London Energy Meeting did not enter into formal commitments to act but did agree on the importance of key actions aimed at improving the functioning of global energy markets and improving dialogue between energy producing and consuming countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.6/2">Participating countries noted the importance of working closely with the International Energy Forum (IEF) to provide high quality data on oil and gas production, supply and demand to the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI). The IEF reports that the data supplied are of increasingly good quality. At their summit in Seoul in November 2010, G20 leaders strongly supported JODI and asked the IEF to work with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency to produce a report suggesting specific steps to improve the quality, timeliness and reliability of the JODI database.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.6/3">Participants also agreed to support the establishment of an expert group to recommend how to strengthen the architecture of the consumer-producer dialogue and the functioning of the IEF. At the IEF Ministerial In March 2010 in Cancun, Ministers from 66 countries endorsed that group's recommendations for analytical work, approving a programme which is now under way under the aegis of the IEF. They also agreed that a new charter for the IEF should be developed to underpin that organisation's work. With Saudi Arabia, the UK has co-chaired the group developing the new Charter. Work is now at a very advanced stage and we hope the new Charter will be agreed over the next few weeks. At the Seoul summit, G20 leaders supported the establishment of the Charter and welcomed the IEF programme of analysis and dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="a.317W.10/1">Responsibility for maintaining electoral registers lies with electoral registration officers (EROs) who are appointed by local authorities, but independent of them. Legislation requires EROs to determine applications for registration that they receive. It also requires EROs to remove entries from the register if the ERO determines that a person with an entry is not entitled to be registered, and provides for objection and review processes to enable EROs to make such determinations. It is an offence under Section 13D of the Representation of the People Act 1983 to provide false information for any purposes connected with registration and if a person does so it is within the discretion of the ERO, depending upon the relevant circumstances of the case, to pursue the matter further and refer the case to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.10/2">Ensuring the integrity of the electoral register is a key part of rebuilding trust in the political system. The Government are therefore committed to tackling electoral fraud and has announced that it will legislate to bring forward the implementation of individual electoral registration to 2014. This will require those applying to be registered to provide evidence of their identity, and so provide greater protection against fraudulent entries on the register.</p>

	<p pid="a.319W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) relies on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for data on UK transfers. The ONS does not publish separate estimates for remittances because they are not considered to be of sufficient quality. Instead, estimates for remittances are combined with estimates for net transfers to UK charities. Together, these estimates are defined in the UK Balance of Payments (the Pink Book) as 'other payments by households'.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/2">In 2009, 'other payments by households' totalled &#163;5.3 billion, the majority of which were remittances. However, this covers remittances to all countries, not just developing countries, with data quality issues preventing a more accurate country disaggregation. In recent years, the ONS has investigated a number of new sources to improve the quality of remittances statistics and will continue to do so going forward.</p>

Guidance and toolkits they have developed to support community asset transfer are also available such as a legal toolkit to assist community groups and local authorities; guidance on community-led open spaces exploring transfer of parks and green spaces; transferring heritage assets; and making buildings work for your community through design and refurbishment. The Unit's Information, Advice and Referral service has received over 650 inquiries since the unit opened in January 2009. SQW consultants are carrying out an independent evaluation of the Asset Transfer Unit and their interim report is available on the unit's website. They have also carried out a baseline survey of local authorities' attitudes to asset transfer. The Year 1 report was published in November 2009 and the Year 2 report is being published in March.</p>

	<p pid="a.326W.2/1">Information about local authorities' discharge of their duties under homelessness legislation is collected on quarterly PIE returns. Summary information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library of the House and via the DCLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.326W.2/3">Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to ensure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.2/4">The number of households accepted as owed a main homelessness duty during the July to September quarter 2010 and the number of households in temporary accommodation at the end of September in each local authority is given in the table at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.326W.2/6">Information is also collected on rough sleeping. Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count-which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, the coalition Government wanted a more complete measure of rough sleeping and when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.2/7">Rough sleeping figures are published by the Department on the DCLG website and are given by local authority in the table at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.326W.2/9">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>

	<p pid="a.327W.2/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>, private tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit will receive funding equivalent to the thirtieth percentile of local market rents for a suitable privately rented property in their area. This means that they will have access to approximately one-third of the privately rented housing in their area-a reasonable proportion of the available housing. We have also announced that we will allow direct payment of benefit to landlords where a landlord has reduced the rent on their property to reflect the lower local housing allowance in an area. We anticipate that this will provide a real incentive to landlords to make their property available to housing benefit recipients.</p>

This initiative will support the voluntary sector to work with local authorities to expand access to private rented housing for single homeless people.</p>

Currently mink trapping takes place in some river catchments, supported by combinations of the Environment Agency (the lead partner for water vole conservation in England and Wales), Natural England, the local Wildlife Trusts and other conservation organisations. These aim for local suppression of mink numbers, to assist water vole populations, rather than eradication.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.3/1">This information is not collected centrally. The reporting requirements relating to breaches of national guidance on same-sex accommodation are unlikely to have any impact on out-patient appointments.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.3/2">Our policy on providing single-sex accommodation (except when it is in the patient's overall best interest) has not changed. Organisations providing national health service funded care are expected to provide single-sex sleeping accommodation, along with single-sex bathroom and toilet accommodation. Patients should not have to pass through opposite-sex areas to reach their own facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.3/3">Only patients who are admitted to hospital are included in the reporting policy. This includes patients undergoing day surgery and procedures such as endoscopy; however, it does not apply to the majority of out-patient appointments. None the less, high standards of privacy and dignity must be maintained, even when patients are not admitted.</p>

	<p pid="a.333W.3/1">National health service organisations are expected to eliminate mixed sex accommodation, except where it is in the overall best interests of the patient, or reflects their personal choice. The Operating Framework for the NHS 2011-12<sup>(1)</sup> confirms requirements for reporting and sanctioning breaches of national guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.3/2">Organisations providing NHS-funded care must agree with their commissioners how they will determine whether a particular episode of mixing is justified. One of limited number of circumstances in which mixing can be justified, relates to patients who actively choose to share with others of the same age or clinical condition, rather than gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.3/3">The Department has issued guidance, including PL/CNO/2010/3<sup>(2)</sup>, to help service providers and commissioners in making decisions, and these resources also support appropriate use of sanctions. One element of this guidance specifically refers to 'patients with long-term conditions, including renal dialysis'. Here, guidance states that it can be acceptable for mixing to occur-the crucial factors being that it reflects the decision of the whole group and does not adversely affect the care of others.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.3/4">In the context of the guidance referred to above, it will be for local commissioners to decide about the imposition of sanctions on dialysis units. It is not expected that renal dialysis will prompt a significant number of sanctions, though the Department will be able to monitor the situation in the new year, when the first set of data about breaches of the guidance is published.</p>

	<p pid="a.340W.8/1">In line with other Government Departments, the Department for Education is able to recover substantial amounts of VAT, reclaimed under section 41(3) of the VAT Act 1994 (commonly known as the contracting-out directive). An additional 2.5% on the average amount reclaimed in the last six months could add approximately &#163;16,500 monthly, if reclaim patterns remain the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.8/2">In addition, there are certain other purchases of goods and services sitting outside the contracting-out directive. For these goods and services neither the Department, nor our arm's length bodies, can recover VAT, and will therefore need to carry the additional 2.5% cost of the VAT increase. The exact amount of VAT paid on each contract held by the Department and our ALBs is not monitored centrally and could be determined only at disproportionate cost. In line with Government priorities, we would expect these increased costs to be covered by efficiency savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.8/3">As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-22">22 November 2010</phrase>, legislation will be introduced to allow academies to recover VAT on a similar basis to local authority maintained schools. More details of this proposed scheme are available via the consultation pages of the Treasury website.</p>

	<p pid="a.341W.8/2">It is for fostering service providers to decide whether to pay their foster carers allowances above the national minimum and whether, in addition to the allowance, to pay their carers a fee in recognition of the skills and experience they bring to their role. It is also for providers to decide whether to make payments between placements. They should make these decisions in the light of local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.8/3">It is important that foster carers know what payments will be made to them by their fostering service. We recently consulted on draft revised National Minimum Standards for Fostering Services (NMS) that make clear that fostering services should have a clear and transparent written policy on payments to foster carers, and that this should include their policy on payments during a break in placement. The revised NMS will come into force in April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.8/4">The Department is also working with the sector on developing a Charter for Foster Care that sets out what foster carers can expect from their fostering service and local authority and what is expected of them in return. The draft charter is clear that fostering service providers should make sure that their foster carers understand what financial support they will receive, including during gaps in placements.</p>

	<p pid="a.344W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education took into account a range of factors before deciding how best to support school sport in the future. This included the findings of the PE and sport survey, which showed that, despite &#163;2.4 billion of funding and seven years of work, the proportion of pupils taking part in regular competitive sport has remained disappointingly low. The survey showed that only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.2/2">The coalition Government have recently reiterated their aim to give schools greater freedom and flexibility including choosing what PE and sport is offered to their pupils and what staff they will need to meet those needs. In order to allow a smooth transition to the new approach, the Department announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-20">20 December</phrase> a package of support to encourage wider take up of competitive sport. This includes further funding of &#163;47 million to support the work of school sport partnerships in August 2011; and new funding of &#163;65 million which will be available to secondary schools until 2013 to increase opportunities in sport for pupils in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.352W.4/1">For the purposes of this reply, it is assumed that the question refers to Approved Premises (formerly known as probation or bail hostels).</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.4/2">Occupancy of Approved Premises is calculated as the proportion of available bed-days over a calendar month when beds are occupied. Where beds are temporarily unavailable, due, for example, to repair work, these are counted as occupied. Therefore, occupancy can exceed 100% where an Approved Premises takes in extra residents over its normal capacity and temporary additional beds are provided. This happens only as a short-term measure, to meet operational demands and subject to risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.4/3">The most recent month for which figures are available is November 2010. The following table gives the capacity and occupancy rate of each of the 101 Approved Premises in England and Wales for that month.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.4/4">Approved Premises provide for enhanced supervision, particularly of high risk of harm offenders on release from custody. It would be much more difficult to provide that level of supervision, were such offenders to be dispersed into less suitable accommodation in the community on release from custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.357W.2/2">The Government do not believe that the introduction of a system of guardianship would be helpful here. Responsibility for the care, protection and accommodation of child trafficking victims rests with local authorities under their duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children. Separated and vulnerable children from abroad have the same entitlements as UK born or resident children.</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.2/3">Where a child becomes looked after by a local authority, a social worker will be responsible for putting in place an individualised care plan covering the full range of the child's needs. This will include any needs identified following an assessment which concludes that they may have been trafficked. The social worker will also make an assessment of the type of placement which best matches the needs of the child including, if necessary, the need to safeguard them from contact with traffickers.</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.2/4">The additional involvement of a guardian risks adding unhelpful complexity to existing arrangements; there is already a risk of confusion for children themselves if plans for their care are not effectively coordinated by the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.6/1">We have looked carefully at the different options for providing financial services through the post office network, including the case for creating a state-backed Post Office Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.6/2">The cost of setting up a Post Office Bank would have three main components. First, the need for Government to capitalise Post Office Ltd. (POL) to allow it to obtain a banking license and lend off of its own balance sheet. Second, exiting existing contractual arrangements relating to the provision of financial services through the post office network. Third, operational costs associated with setting up and running a new financial services unit within POL. The level of public funding required would depend on the remit and performance of a Post Office Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.6/3">We have concluded that the announced &#163;1.34 billion of funding for POL over the spending review period will be better used maintaining and modernising the network to safeguard its future, ensuring that there will be no further programme of Post Office closures.</p>
