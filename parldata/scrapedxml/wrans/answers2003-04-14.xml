	<p pid=".477W.6/1">The Government are currently considering the implementation of the revised Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC), in particular, the costs and benefits of the options.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.6/2">Article 2(7) of the revised Directive defines a combustion plant as &quot;any technical apparatus in which fuels are oxidised in order to use the heat thus generated&quot;. It provides for certain qualifications and exceptions to this definition (eg exclusion of gas turbines licensed before <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-27">27 November 2002</phrase>) which do not constitute combustion plants for the purposes of the Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.6/3">Article 1 of the revised Directive provides that it only applies to combustion plants (as defined in Article 2), &quot;the rated thermal input of which is equal to or greater than 50MW, irrespective of the type of fuel used (solid, liquid or gaseous)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.6/4">Accordingly, if a power station or generating unit falls within the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the Directive and does not benefit from any of the exclusions set out in Article 2(7), it will constitute a combustion plant for the purposes of the revised Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.6/5">Article 4(6) of the revised Directive, which deals with the implementation of the Directive via a &quot;national emission reduction plan&quot; specifies the requirements that those plans must include, which among others comprise &quot;objectives and related targets, measures and timetables for reaching those objectives and targets, and a monitoring mechanism&quot; (Article 4(6) (a)). This Article further provides that &quot;the national emission plan shall reduce the total annual emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (S02) and dust from existing plants to the levels that would have been achieved by applying the emission limit values referred to in paragraph 3 to the existing plants in operation in the year 2000&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.6/6">There is nothing in the revised Directive to prohibit emissions trading in the context of a national emission reduction plan, though any emissions trading would have to comply with all other requirements of Community law, including rules of competition and state aids.</p>

	<p pid=".482W.3/1">The scope of the control on the provision of technical assistance in relation to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) was drawn up after consultation on the draft Export Control Bill which sought views on the Bill and on the Government's proposals for the content of the secondary legislation. The scope of this control is in line with both the new WMD controls on the transfer by any means of technology and with the WMD provisions contained in the EC Dual-Use Regulation. The EC Dual-Use Regulation requires member states to control the physical export and electronic transfer of dual-use goods or technology which the exporter or transferor knows, or has been informed, is or may be intended use in connection with WMD.</p>

Subject to their views, the second round in the summer is expected to focus on how the NDA might work with stakeholders with a view to developing a draft stakeholder engagement framework which the NDA can build on once it is in place. This programme of regional events supplements existing arrangements for bilateral dialogue with stakeholders through the BNFL Stakeholder Dialogue, and regular meetings with the nuclear regulators, trade unions, BNFL and UKAEA staff, local authorities, environmental groups and the local liaison committees for individual sites.</p>

	<p pid=".487W.11/1">The amount of coal fired generation capacity taken out of the system in future will depend on a range of factors, including energy prices and economic conditions generally, together with any impacts from environmental legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".487W.11/2">In the CH case contained within the most recent official energy projections, published in November 2000 as Energy Paper 68, it was projected that around 14GW of coal plant, including some with dual firing capacity, would close between 2000 and 2010, with little further change by 2015. Since the publication of EP68, coal's competitive position has improved somewhat, leading to relatively high generation from coal plants, in excess of the levels anticipated in Energy Paper 68. My officials are currently beginning the process of formally reviewing the projections and it is expected that the results will feed into other work, including preparations for carbon trading and the review of the UK Climate Change Programme, due in 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".497W.2/2">It should be noted, however, that the figures given do not necessarily reflect the relative abilities of wage earners and pensioners to pay council tax. Gross earnings and basic state pension figures are not comparable as measures of income, and neither of them can be said to represent disposable income. Gross earnings figures are, for example, before tax and other deductions, whereas the basic state pension represents a relatively small proportion of the income received by many pensioners. Furthermore, it has been assumed, in the absence of precise information, that reductions in council tax as a result of council tax benefit are spread evenly across all council taxpayers, whereas it is likely that, in reality, pensioners are assisted by benefit to a greater extent than wage earners.</p>

This includes the use of voter specific PIN numbers and passwords, real time electronic registers to cast and record votes and systems to prevent an electronic vote being cast where voter identification has been used previously. Should a voter find that a vote has already been cast in his name, he will be entitled to ask for a tendered ballot in the normal way. All pilot authorities are under a legal obligation to report instances of fraud to the Police and the Electoral Commission, the appropriate authorities to investigate alleged electoral abuse. The Commission will conduct a thorough post-election evaluation exercise looking at all aspects of the programme, including fraud and security, to consider what lessons need to be learnt for the future.</p>

Figures for Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's agencies and non-departmental public bodies are not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's internal directory is stored electronically and all its staff and one of the Executive Agencies (The Planning Inspectorate) have on-line access to it. The remaining three agencies and the non-departmental public bodies have no on-line access, but are provided with data extracts on request.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.0/2">The following two tables give all the special and specific grants inside Aggregate External Finance (AEF) provided to Tunbridge Wells and Kent. The information is taken from the Reporting Officer forms returned on an annual basis by authorities to ODPM. The entries for 1997&ndash;2002 are actual figures. These are not yet available for 2002&ndash;03 and therefore budgeted figures have been given. The definition of ring-fencing was updated last year to reflect the types of grant which now exist. Some grants previously classified as ring-fenced are not now classified in this way. The key distinction made remains that ring-fenced grants are those which restrict local authority spending. For completeness the following list includes all special grants inside Aggregate External Finance. Further details of classifications are in an annex to the freedoms and flexibilities announcement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-26">26 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.2/2">A statutory disregard of &pound;10 is applied to War Disablement Pensions and War Widows Pensions when calculating entitlement to income-related benefits. In the case of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, local authorities have the discretion to apply a further disregard up to the full amount of any War Pension in payment. Any amount on top of the statutory disregard is funded from authorities' own resources.</p>
	<p pid=".513W.2/3">Local authorities, through their discretionary schemes, are best placed to determine the needs of their local residents, taking account of local priorities. At the end of March 2003, 387 local authorities were disregarding War Pensions in full and from this month April 2003, six more authorities have given an undertaking to apply a full disregard. A further four authorities apply a disregard in excess of the statutory &pound;10, and have confirmed their intention to make further improvements to their local schemes. The remaining 11 authorities apply the statutory disregard.</p>
	<p pid=".513W.2/4">Lists of the authorities which fall into each of these categories have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.6/2">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. This reported that the level of cultivation in 2002 was 74,000 hectares. This was higher than the mid-1990s average but below the record level of 1999 (91,000 hectares).</p>
	<p pid=".513W.6/3">The UNODC is in the process of carrying out the 2003 survey. Its results will be published in the autumn. In March 2003 the UNODC published an Opium Rapid Assessment Survey for Afghanistan. This gave an early insight into the pattern of opium poppy cultivation for the 2002&ndash;03 growing season but did not predict the level of opium poppy cultivation for 2003 or beyond. It did find however that there was a trend for farmers to cultivate opium poppy in increasingly remote and inaccessible areas.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.0/1">The provision, use and management of water are central to both sustainable development and poverty reduction. Nearly two thirds of the world's population will be living in countries of significant water stress by the year 2025. If we do not pay more attention to equitable water management we will see conflict and war generated by water shortages. 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. The provision of clean drinking water and sanitation is essential to prevent 2 million children dying of diarrhoea every year. Carrying water also exhausts women and keeps girls out of school.</p>

Global water issues were discussed at the Kyoto World Water Forum in March and will also be discussed at the G8 Summit in Evian in June. The UK made no new commitments at Kyoto. The third World Water Forum and the Kyoto Ministerial Declaration added little to the achievements of WSSD in Johannesburg last year but has reinforced efforts towards ensuring that the international community delivers on its promises made at WSSD.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.3/1">Zimbabwe continues to suffer from a major humanitarian crisis. Assessments indicate that 6.7 million people (50 per cent. of the population) required food assistance from December 2002 until the next harvest due in May. However, there has been little access to displaced farm workers or to urban areas where there are serious concerns about vulnerability. Early indications are that this year's maize harvest while double last years will still be 40 per cent. less than required.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/2">DFID, have contributed &pound;51 million to help Zimbabwe since the humanitarian crisis began in mid 2001. We are supporting the World Food Programme, which is now feeding 4.6 million people, while government and NGOs are also supplying food. We have directly funded NGOs that are providing supplementary food to 1.5 million, mostly children, pregnant and nursing women and the elderly. We have supported home care programmes for families affected by HIV/AIDS and have provided seeds and fertilisers to 180,000 households to assist food production.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/3">The international response has averted a crisis and malnutrition rates have increased only marginally. Adequate supplies of food have been secured until June when the harvest will temporarily improve the situation. However, the disastrous economic policies in Zimbabwe mean that food aid will still be needed particularly for the large numbers of poor who are unable to buy food.</p>

	<p pid=".528W.5/1">Construction of the fence has only recently begun. The Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network (PENGON) estimated in March 2003 that 100 buildings, most of them used as stores, had been demolished as a result of fence construction. When completed the fence is expected to be 360km long. Officials from our Embassy in Tel Aviv and our Consulate in Jerusalem who have travelled to Palestinian areas affected by construction of the fence have reported that a corridor up to 40 metres wide in places has been cleared for the fence's path.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.5/2">The proposed path of the fence, as described in the Israeli media, would run east of the Green Line for most of its length. Approximately 10 per cent. of the entire West Bank would lie to the west of the fence. Palestinian land is being seized for fence construction, cultivated farmland is being destroyed and some towns will be separated from surrounding farmland by the fence. Current estimates indicate the northern and Jerusalem sections of the fence, approximately 215km long, will leave 290,000 Palestinians on the Israeli side of the fence. Of those, some 70,000 do not have Israeli residency permits and, as a consequence, may feel it necessary to move east of the fence in order to retain access to basic services.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.5/3">Our view is that, the building of the fence, and the adverse impact it will have on Palestinians living in the West Bank, is unacceptable. We have made our opposition known to the Israeli Government.</p>

	<p pid=".538W.5/2">The introduction of the Child Tax Credit and the Working Tax Credit represents a large one-off piece of work for the Inland Revenue. That work includes handling telephone inquiries and processing claims, and it involves several thousand staff. As a one-off exercise, call handling and claims processing are effectively being managed as a single stream of work&mdash;allowing resources to be allocated across the two in the light of changing workload priorities. The balance between answering calls and processing claims is kept under constant review. In response to recent increased demand, resources have been switched to answering calls.</p>

The Child Tax Credit and the child care element of Working Tax Credit are paid directly to the person in the family mainly responsible for looking after the children. Employers are not involved in making these payments. The Working Tax Credit is paid to employees with their wages, but decisions on entitlement are made by the Inland Revenue. The Department has already begun notifying employers of the amount of tax credits to be paid to employees entitled to Working Tax Credit.</p>

The Office for National Statistics and the National Archives (Public Record Office) will work together on plans to make these returns available to the public nearer the time, in the light of the available technological options. The long-term plans for methods of storing Census records will be the responsibility of the National Archives once the forms are transferred to their custody.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.3/5" class="indent">None of the post 1920 Census records are currently digitised or microfilmed except for those for 2001. For this Census the forms were scanned and digitised by the Office for National Statistics as part of the processing of the results. The 2001 Census records have been microfilmed and the paper copies destroyed.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.3/6" class="indent">All of the extant post-1920 Census decennial population census records for England and Wales remain in our keeping, and none are stored at the Central Repository. There are no plans to relocate census records to the Midlands.</p>

	<p pid=".549W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can intervene only in limited circumstances. First, if a school governing body or local education authority is acting unreasonably or in default of a statutory duty, he may&mdash;if he thinks this expedient&mdash;direct them to put things right. These direction powers might be used, for example, to secure a child's entry to a community or voluntary controlled school if the governing body had refused to comply with the decision of the LEA (the admission authority) to admit that child. Secondly, if a LEA intends to direct the governing body of a foundation or voluntary aided school, which has refused to admit a child, to admit him or her, and the governing body refers the matter to the Secretary of State, he may uphold the LEA's decision to make the direction, or decide that the child should be admitted to another school instead.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.2/3">Many admission authorities use catchment areas to help decide which children should be admitted, if there are more applicants than places. The Admissions Code of Practice includes catchment areas in its list of common and acceptable over-subscription criteria. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would only direct an admission authority to make changes to its choice of catchment area if he was satisfied both that the admission authority had acted unreasonably in the very strict sense the courts defined in the 'Wednesbury' case, and that it was expedient for him to intervene.</p>

This increase of &pound;34 million includes the LSC provisional grant of &pound;18 million and &pound;1.5 million of specific formula grants.

	<p pid=".560W.2/1">The purpose of the &quot;unique pupil number&quot; (or UPN) is to facilitate the collation of information about pupils accumulated over the course of their school career and so to create profiles of their progress. These profiles are built up from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC) showing the whereabouts and status of the pupil each January in terms of (for example) the school they were attending, their special educational needs, eligibility for free school meals and ethnic group, plus information obtained separately from schools, marking agencies and exam boards on their results in Key Stage assessments and public examinations. The profiles are stored in a National Pupil Database.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.2/2">A small number of technical staff engaged in collating the pupil level data and creating the profiles have access to pupils' UPNs and names. Analysts in the Department and partner agencies (Ofsted, QCA and LSC) have access to anonymised profiles for use for statistical purposes only. LEAs, and through them schools, can access the profiles of their own pupils (including UPNs and names in this case) in order to fill gaps in their own data which have arisen through information being lost as pupils move from school to school.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.2/3">Analysis of the profiles in the national database provides schools, LEAs, the Department and its partners with major new information to support standards raising and other policies such as ethnic monitoring. Schools are also helped to make appropriate provision for their pupils by being able to obtain from the national database more complete information about them.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.2/4">The introduction of UPNs in 1999 was preceded by extensive discussions with the then Data Protection Registrar. The system is operated in a manner agreed with her in order to minimise any threat to personal privacy which might be posed if access to and use of UPNs and the National Pupil Database were not properly controlled.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.2/5">The use of UPNs for non-education purposes is not permitted. There is no evidence that any agencies or organisations have attempted to use UPNs improperly for non-education purposes. If such evidence began to emerge, powers exist under the Data Protection Act 1998 which would enable the Department to set out in a Parliamentary order the permitted uses of UPNs, thereby rendering their use for any other purpose illegal.</p>

	<p pid=".563W.0/1">There is no fixed fee for part-time higher education. Unlike the position for full time provision, higher education providers are free to set the fees for part-time higher education at a level they choose. We announced in the White Paper &quot;The future of higher education&quot; that we would improve the package of support for part time students by introducing a new fee support grant for those whose income is below certain thresholds, and who are studying courses that are at least half-time. Full details of the package will be announced later in the year.</p>

Independent evaluations carried out for the Department point to the need for improvements of practice in some schools and businesses. We are taking steps to promote improvements in the context of our plans to make work-related learning a statutory requirement for all Key Stage 4 pupils from 2004&ndash;05, and to enable them all to have at least two weeks of high quality work experience.</p>

	<p pid=".565W.12/1">The Ministry of Defence has been considering responses to the consultation paper on a new Armed Forces Pension Scheme which it published in March 2001. These included comments from Service personnel, from the ex- Service community and from the House of Commons Defence Committee. Our work on the review is also taking account of proposals in the Government's two pensions Green Papers published in December 2002. I expect to receive shortly recommendations for the revision of the original proposals reflecting this further work, and to publish the Government's final decisions on the design of a new scheme before the summer recess.</p>

	<p pid=".566W.11/1">Most of the Service family housing in England and Wales was sold in 1996 to a private company, Annington Homes Ltd., under a sale and leaseback agreement. Under the agreement, houses which subsequently become surplus to Defence requirements are released to Annington's for disposal. The identification of surplus properties for release is a matter for the department, but the method of subsequent disposal or usage by Annington's is entirely a matter for the company, based on their commercial judgment.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.11/2">The Ministry of Defence retains responsibility for the disposal of all family quarters in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and a few outside the Annington sale and leaseback deal in England and Wales. When properties in this category become surplus to predicted long term requirement, they are sold in accordance with Treasury guidelines which stipulate that Departments should obtain the best possible price for surplus publicly-owned assets. They are usually offered for sale on the open market at market price.</p>

	<p pid=".567W.2/20">1. Information for the years 1995&ndash;96 to 1998&ndash;99 is reproduced from the House of Commons Defence Committee Seventh report &quot;The Strategic Defence Review: Defence Medical Services&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-27">27 October 1999</phrase>. The final outturn for 1998&ndash;99 was the same as the estimated figure contained in the HCDC Report.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/21">2. The figure for 1995&ndash;96 is the cost of the DMS estimated by Defence Cost Study 15(DCS 15). The figure contained in the DCS 15 report included primary care costs, estimated at &pound;81.1 million. This has been removed here to allow accurate comparison with the figures for subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/22">3. Figures for 1996&ndash;97 to 2001&ndash;02 comprise the costs of the Surgeon General's Department and the four medical agencies (the Defence Secondary Care Agency, Defence Dental Agency, the Defence Medical Training Organisation, and the Medical Supplies Agency), the single Service Medical Directorates General, the Institute of Naval Medicine, the Centre for Aviation Medicine and British Forces Germany.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/23">4. The estimated figure for 2002&ndash;03 comprises the costs of the Defence Medical Services Department (formerly the Surgeon General's Department) and the three medical Agencies (the Defence Secondary Care Agency, Defence Dental Agency, and the Defence Medical Training Organisation), the single Service Medical Directorates General, the Institute of Naval Medicine, the Centre for Aviation Medicine, British Forces Germany and the Medical Supplies Agency, which was transferred to the Defence Logistics Organisation in April 2002. Figures for Germany cover secondary care for Army and RAF personnel and primary care for Army personnel from 1996&ndash;97 to 2000&ndash;01 and both Army and remaining RAF personnel in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/24">5. Except where advised above, primary care costs cannot be provided without disproportionate effort as they are disaggregated and are embedded in individual units' budgets.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/25">6. In financial year 2001&ndash;02, the Ministry of Defence changed accounting systems to include full Resource Accounts (which include costs of fixed assets etc, not reported previously). However, the figures for 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 in the table have been adjusted to allow comparison with prior years.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.2/2">Findings from two major independent epidemiological studies funded by the Ministry of Defence into Gulf veterans' illnesses following the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict have been published. The results from a study of mortality were published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase>. The researchers found that the number of deaths and the causes of death in the comparison group comprising of those who did not deploy to the Gulf were similar to those for Gulf veterans. There was however a small non-significant excess of non-disease related deaths among Gulf veterans, particularly due to accidents.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/3">Results from an epidemiological study of ill health were published in the May 2001 edition of &quot;Occupational and Environmental Medicine&quot;. The researchers found that Gulf veterans reported symptoms with a greater severity than those who were not deployed to the Gulf although the overall severity of symptoms was not high. There was no evidence of any illness unique to Gulf veterans. In terms of symptom severity, the various symptoms reported were ranked in generally the same order by both groups. The researchers found no evidence of a &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot;. Weak associations between particular self-reported exposures (handling pesticides, vaccinations and exposure to oil well fire smoke) and particular types of ill health were found although no indication was given of a link between &quot;handling pesticides&quot; and actual contact with the pesticides. In another study, clinical tests on a number of Gulf veterans who had significant neuromuscular symptoms were carried out. A paper reporting results from the study was published in &quot;Neurology&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-26">26 November 2002</phrase>. The paper reports that the researchers found no neurophysiological evidence for a specific neuromuscular disorder that could be linked to deployment to the Gulf. In addition, interim results have been published from the Ministry of Defence's Vaccines Interactions Research Programme. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-04-01.55"><i>Official Report,</i> column 55WS</phrase>, I announced that preliminary results from the current phase of the study using marmosets are available and were presented by means of a scientific poster. These preliminary results indicated no apparent adverse health consequences three months following the administration of vaccine and/or pyridostigmine bromide (the active chemical in Nerve Agent Pre-treatment Sets tablets) to marmosets.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/4">The findings from other studies are yet to be published. Full details of all the Gulf veterans' illnesses related research studies being funded by the Ministry of Defence are available on the Internet at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a>.issues/gulfwar/research.htm.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/5">A considerable amount of research into Gulf veterans' illnesses has been undertaken in the United States and the United States Department of Defence have also funded research in the UK. There is scientific evidence that some veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict report a large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms as well as recognised medical conditions. However, the overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or 'syndrome'.</p>

The Ministry of Defence accepts that some veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf Conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is related to their Gulf experience.

However, the overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or &quot;syndrome&quot;.

	<p pid=".571W.3/1">Cluster bombs are only used strictly in accordance with international law. This includes the principles of distinction and proportionality as well as precautionary measures to be taken in planning and conducting an attack, as contained in the First Additional Protocol of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The targeting process takes account of these principles in matching the type of weapon used to the target to be attacked. There will be circumstances when it would be considered more appropriate to use other munitions than cluster bombs. These circumstances are more likely to arise in urban or populated areas as cluster bombs engage targets that cover an area. However, a decision on which type of munition to use has to take into account all the circumstances at the time of an attack. It follows that it would be unlikely that cluster bombs would be used in an urban unpopulated area.</p>

Payments under a new Armed Forces Compensation Scheme would replace awards currently made under the War Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme for injuries or illness caused on or after the date of implementation. The new scheme should provide simpler and fairer arrangements that recognise the special status of the armed forces and focus better on those personnel most severely disabled.</p>

	<p pid=".574W.5/2">The presence of wind turbines in most areas of the United Kingdom presents no difficulty to low flying aircraft as these and other naturally tall structures are taken into account as part of route planning. However, within the tactical training areas, a large proliferation of obstacles is avoided as this would negate the value of the training. For these reasons, wind farm proposals may compromise flight safety to an unacceptable level and result in an objection from the Department.</p>

These set standards of access for disabled people, which have applied to all new trains (since the end of 1998), and all new buses and coaches used on local and scheduled service with a capacity of more than 22 passengers (since the end of 2000). Proposals for regulations applying to taxis will be brought forward later this year. Transport infrastructure is covered by Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act which requires the removal of policies or practices that discriminate and, from 2004, the removal of physical barriers to access.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/2">In addition we have accepted the recommendations on transport made by the Disability Rights Task Force. These include extending some of the requirements of Part III of the DDA to cover vehicles, setting an end date by which all trains in service must be accessible and taking powers to introduce regulations to apply to the refurbishment of trains. We have just completed consultation on the first of these sets of proposals and will shortly publish a consultation paper on the second.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.6/1">There are already sufficient powers to regulate the use of motorcycles off-road, and we do not see the need for a review of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.6/2">A vehicle&mdash;even if specifically designed for off-road use&mdash;used on the public highway should comply with the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. The rider should also hold a current driving licence, vehicle excise duty, insurance, and wear a safety helmet.

	<p pid=".590W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Mr. Oaten, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-14">14 April 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/3" class="indent">David Jamieson has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about noise reduction measures on the trunk road and motorway network.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/4" class="indent">In 2002&ndash;03, the Agency spent &pound;5.9 million on noise mitigation measures such as noise barriers on trunk roads and motorways, against a ring fenced annual budget of &pound;5 million. In addition, it is our policy to use low-noise surfacing whenever a road surface needs renewing. In 2002&ndash;03, &pound;235 million was spent on resurfacing trunk roads and motorways, two per cent. above the budget for this work.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/5" class="indent">For 2003&ndash;04, the allocation for resurfacing concrete trunk roads and motorways is &pound;52 million. The programme for 2004&ndash;05 is currently still under development. We shall be resurfacing the highest priority sections of concrete road ahead of maintenance need, in order to reduce traffic noise.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/6" class="indent">Following consultation with local highways authorities and others, the following criteria were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-17">17 October 2001</phrase> for prioritising the surfacing of concrete roads with quieter material:</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/7" class="indent">(i) that wherever possible the application of quieter surfaces will fit in with normal maintenance needs;</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/8" class="indent">(ii) that priority will be given to those sites where treatment would benefit the greatest number of people;</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/9" class="indent">(iii) that the works will be carried out in such a way to minimise disruption to the general public and users of the network;</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/10" class="indent">(iv) that priority will be given to roads, opened since June 1988, where actual noise levels have turned out to be significantly higher than predicted at the time of the public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/11" class="indent">These criteria have been used to prioritise the list of schemes announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April</phrase>. The main determinants of priority are the number of properties affected (proxy for criterion ii) and for newer roads, the increase in noise levels above those predicted at public inquiry (criterion iv). The high priority group is defined by sections of road which affect more than 100 properties per km or for which the current noise level is at least 3 dB(A) greater than predicted at public inquiry (an increase of 3 dB(A) is equivalent to the noise increase expected from a doubling of the volume of traffic on a road). The medium priority group is defined by sections of road which affect more than 10 properties per km or for which the current noise level is 1 dB(A) greater than predicted at public inquiry, which equates to a noticeable noise increase.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.3/12" class="indent">It is expected that the sections indicated as having a high priority will be completed by the end of March 2007, subject to funding being available. We expect to resurface sections of road in the medium or low priority groups between April 2007 and March 2011, subject to funding being available. Where there is an identified maintenance need, some of the medium or low priority sections may be resurfaced earlier, for road safety reasons.</p>

	<p pid=".600W.2/1">I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Mr. Woodward, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-14">14 April 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/3" class="indent">I have been asked by David Jamieson to reply to your six recent Parliamentary Questions about ongoing works to the northbound bridge of the M6 Motorway Thelwall Viaduct, in Cheshire.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/4" class="indent">The Highways Agency is responsible for the operation, management, maintenance, and improvement of the trunk road and motorway network in England, including the Thelwall Viaduct, which typically carries some 150,000&mdash;160,000 vehicles per day. All but one lane of the northbound viaduct was closed in July 2002, following the discovery of a failed roller bearing.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/5" class="indent">Detailed investigation has concluded that all 136 roller bearings on the northbound viaduct should be replaced before further traffic lanes can be opened on the viaduct. The increased scale of the problem has led to a thorough analysis of all the issues on the viaduct and, over the course of the next few months, this further work will enable us to establish a realistic programme for the works.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/6" class="indent">The current restrictions comprise three narrow lanes in each direction on the new southbound viaduct and a single lane on the northbound viaduct, to facilitate traffic leaving the M6 at Junction 21, in Warrington. There are advance warning signs on all the motorway approaches to the works advising of likely delays, but there is no convenient diversion route using the motorway network. Traffic could be diverted along the M62, M60, M56, and A556, but this would add around 15 miles to journey lengths, and parts of this diversion are already at full capacity during peak periods. We will continue to monitor traffic patterns closely and keep under review all possible diversion routes to mitigate the effect of the restrictions.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/7" class="indent">Laboratory testing and investigations into how the bearings have failed is substantially complete. These findings will be used to inform the design process for the replacement of the bearings and associated works required to bring the structure back fully into long-term service. A different kind of bearing has been specified to replace the failed roller bearings. We are content that these bearings will not be susceptible to the same failure as the existing bearings, and that there is no risk of a repetition of the problem. Our thorough maintenance inspection regime revealed the current problems and this regime will continue to monitor the condition of this and our other bridges in future years.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/8" class="indent">We are conscious of the effects that restrictions on the viaduct are having on local businesses, and are working closely with affected stakeholders, in particular Warrington Borough Council, to identify the scale of the impact on the local community. Traffic-count information on both motorways and the local road network is being collected to enable the changes in driving patterns to be quantified and appropriate mitigation measures devised.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/9" class="indent">We are currently looking at a phased re-opening of lanes on the northbound viaduct. Initially, the strategy will be to open a second lane on the northbound viaduct at the earliest opportunity. This will enable four running lanes to be reinstated in each direction and should significantly reduce delays for southbound traffic, which is currently restricted to three lanes.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information about this matter, you may wish to contact the Agency's Project Manager for the viaduct repairs, Paul Hupton, Room 703, Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester, Ml 4BE (Tel 0161 930 5641).</p>

That is why we will shortly be publishing finalised regulations and guidance for a new national framework for adoption support and backing this with &pound;70 million over the next three years from April 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".613W.9/1">Data on the proportion of patient occupied floor area that is not compliant with statutory health and safety and statutory fire safety regulations, including compliance with the national health service firecode standards, began in 2001&ndash;02 and is shown in the tables. Figures are not yet available for 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.9/2">These figures reflect the proportion of the estate that is not fully compliant. Figures are collected for each category separately, and some of the areas covered by one category will also fall into the other. Non-compliant estate will cover a wide variety of conditions, including that which is just below standard. Therefore the figures do not indicate levels of risk, and despite significant proportions being non-compliant, the degree of risk to patients could be very small. Trusts make every effort to remedy any concerns from local enforcement bodies as quickly as possible. This is reflected in the very small numbers of injuries and deaths arising as a result of fires and reportable health and safety incidents in NHS hospitals in England, despite the very high numbers of people who use healthcare premises.</p>

Experts considered that there was no difference in efficacy between vaccines based upon the Lister strain and those based upon the New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) vaccinia strain as both were known to have been effective in the past.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.2/4">The JCVI sub-group also concluded that there is a greater body of evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of the Lister strain vaccines against the more severe form of smallpox &quot;variola major&quot; in the past than there is for the NYCBH based vaccines. The view was taken that using a different strain for our new vaccine than that chosen by the United States offered the greatest safeguard in the event of difficulties arising with the production of either new vaccine.</p>

	<p pid=".623W.5/1">If we are to ensure protection against passive smoking in public places, we need action nationally and locally both to raise awareness of the risks associated with passive smoking and to increase the prevalence of smoke free environments. The Department will continue to encourage the development of smoke free policies, working with employers and communities.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.5/2">At a national level, the Department has, since 1998, worked with the hospitality industry to reduce the problem of exposure to passive smoking through the development of a Public Places Charter. The Charter commits signatories to increase the provision of facilities for non-smokers, improving ventilation and giving customers better information about the level of smoke free facilities in an establishment. An independent evaluation of the Charter has been commissioned, and further work will be considered on the basis of the findings.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.5/3">The Government are giving careful consideration to the Health and Safety Commission's proposals for an approved code of practice (ACoP). We encourage all employers to introduce smoke-free workplaces, but are particularly concerned about the implications such a code would have for the hospitality sector and small businesses. While consideration of the ACoP continues, other action is being taken to encourage the provision of smoke-free areas in public and workplaces. We recognise that making places entirely smoke free is not always going to be possible and encourage in these circumstances other measures to be taken to reduce people's exposure to smoke.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.5/4">Locally, the Department is funding tobacco control alliances across England to work in communities to raise awareness and to increase the number of smoke-free environments. Findings from these projects will inform future development of the Department's work in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.5/5">The Department will, in addition to action already underway, develop education and information resources to raise awareness and understanding of the risks associated with passive smoking.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.8/1">The fall in the percentage of men aged 65 receiving both the basic State Pension and additional State Pension between September 1995 and September 2002 is due to the reduction in the number of men aged 65 in receipt of net additional State Pension over that period.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.8/2">Gross additional State Pension entitlement for men aged 65 has been steady in recent years. 92 per cent. of men aged 65 who were receiving a State Pension, received gross additional State Pension in September 1999, compared with 91 per cent. in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.8/3">However, the percentage of men aged 65 in receipt of net additional State Pension is falling because of the increase in excess Contracted Out Deduction cases due to the interaction between the gross additional State Pension and Contracted Out Deduction calculations. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that there are more early leavers with fixed revaluations coming into retirement. These revaluations were in the past far higher than the current revaluations meaning that more people have excess Contracted Out Deductions than in the past and these excess Contracted Out Deductions themselves are larger. The second reason is that there are relatively low post award upratings experienced in the last few years, which means that it takes longer to reduce the excess Contracted Out Deductions and for the gross additional State Pension to exceed the Contracted Out Deductions.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.0/1">Our strategy for tackling fraud focuses on prevention by tightening the gateway to benefits, making stringent checks to verify a person's identity and details of their claim at the outset.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.0/2">The Department has introduced a range of measures to strengthen the evidence of identity procedures as well as improving the security of National Insurance Numbers (NINOs). People claiming benefits, including housing benefits, and anyone they are claiming benefit for, now have a statutory obligation to prove their identity, as provided for in the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997. This ensures that the NINOs being used belong to the people in question before any benefit is paid.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.0/3">The Department introduced a Verification Framework in 1998 to help reduce the amount of fraud and error entering local authority benefit administration. The Framework provides local authorities with recommended minimum standards on the checks they must make to verify information provided by customers when assessing claims for housing benefit and council tax benefit. 80 per cent. of local authorities have so far signed up to the Framework.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.0/4">The Targeting Fraud campaign is part of our long-term strategy to prevent fraud before it happens, underlining our message that benefit fraud will not be tolerated. Evaluation shows that public attitudes are moving in the right direction as a result of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.0/5">Jobcentre Plus is providing a more comprehensive and integrated service for all benefit claimants. One-to-one interviews create a personal environment where the full and accurate details of a claim can be established and customers can be reminded of their responsibility to notify us of changes to their circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.0/6">We have made excellent progress in the fight against fraud and error. By March 2002 we had reduced fraud and error in income support and Jobseeker's allowance by 24 per cent. compared to 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.9/1">The health and safety of both staff and customers is of paramount importance. Therefore it is vital that staff know how to deal with customers in a way that does not endanger their own health and safety or that of other people in the office.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.9/2">The main source of health and safety advice is the departmental website, which can be accessed by all members of staff. This contains comprehensive guidance on all aspects of DWP health and safety policy. The Health and Safety Division is currently developing a new comprehensive programme of health and safety training and awareness for Jobcentre Plus. In the interim, staff receive a variety of training including a H&amp;S induction course for staff working on Trillium sites, training in how to prevent and calm difficult or aggressive situations for staff with face-to-face contact with customers, and a number of health and safety leaflets and videos which are used to prompt and reinforce safe working practices.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.9/3">The hepatitis virus is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, or by cross blood infection. Therefore in principle, staff working in a DWP business are at low risk of contracting the hepatitis virus through dealing with customers.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.9/4">The first contact with a customer is normally by telephone. If during the course of the conversation, the staff member becomes aware that the customer has an infectious disease, the computer record is noted to alert staff who subsequently deal with the customer. Customers with the hepatitis virus do however have full access to all the services provided by Jobcentre Plus but, wherever possible, those customers would be dealt with by telephone or post.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.9/5">Most of the time, staff will be unaware of when a customer has the hepatitis virus. They are therefore encouraged to safeguard their own health at all times by considering their own basic hygiene, and not taking any risks if a customer is bleeding. All blood spillages must be treated as infected regardless of the source. Detailed advice and guidance on how to maintain basic hygiene when dealing with discarded needles/syringes or blood spills is available on the Jobcentre Plus health and safety website.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.9/6">As with all our records, information held by Jobcentre Plus on a customer's health is protected by the Data Protection Act. As such this information is not given to any other organisation or person, including members of the customers family, without the express permission of the customer.</p>

	<p pid=".647W.2/1">Joint Working Unit (JWU) was set up in April 2001 as a result of recommendations made following reports produced by Lord Grabiner into the informal economy and the Scampion report countering benefit fraud in the then Department of Social Security.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/2">The main focus of the JWU's work is to promote, encourage and facilitate joined-up working across central government departments and with local authorities and to act as formal stewards of the powers enacted by the Social Security Fraud Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/3">Examples of joint activities with other government departments include the Joint Shadow Economy Teams, which are made up of members from this Department, Her Majesty's Customs &amp; Excise and the Inland Revenue. The aim of the teams is to bring those working within the informal economy into the real tax paying economy and keep them there. The Joint Fashion Industry Teams focus on those working in the fashion industry, looking at businesses who are suspected to be potentially, collusive or non-compliant employers. Operation Gangmaster was initially set up to investigate the use of agricultural gangmasters and their methods of operating, and has now widened to include other labour providers who demonstrate non-compliant behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/4">Examples of joint activities with local authorities include Joint Regional Boards who work to develop region-specific counter-fraud strategies. The strategies are then implemented through Joint Operational Boards. JWU also acts as the Departmental contact for local authority groups such as the National Anti-fraud Network, the London Team Against Fraud and the Local Authority Investigation Officers Group. The JWU also supports the implementation of a joined-up intelligence-led investigative process for local authorities. It is currently working with Nottingham and Cardiff authorities by co-locating Intelligence Officers within the East Midlands and Wales Operational Intelligence Units.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/5">Together with the Departmental Professional Standards Unit, JWU supports local authorities, the National Anti-fraud Network and Operational Intelligence Units on all aspects of the Social Security Fraud Act 2001 and its associated powers. This function includes ensuring the Fraud Act powers are understood and implemented effectively, accurately, securely and efficiently. The Unit is also responsible for the management of the relationship with our external information providers, and the provision of advice and expert guidance to front-line staff in both the Department and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".651W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, wrote to all MPs on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-17">17 March 2003</phrase>, outlining how the Department is planning to ensure Pension Credit take-on is completed successfully. To support the take-on of Pension Credit a marketing campaign has been developed for pensioners and those who support them such as family and friends.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.5/2">The core of the campaign involves contacting pensioner households by direct mail and inviting them to make their applications by telephone. In this way we can support and complete the application form for them. The Pension Service has now started to send the invitations, building up the numbers progressively and plans to complete this activity in June 2004. This systematic approach will be supported by regional and national advertising around the launch of Pension Credit in October when it becomes payable.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.5/3">By working with local partners The Pension Service will be able to help vulnerable pensioners or those who need to overcome barriers that might prevent them from applying.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.5/4">To ensure pensioners do not lose out, a 12 month backdating provision will exist until October 2004. This will allow applications to be backdated to October 2003 where entitlement exists.</p>
