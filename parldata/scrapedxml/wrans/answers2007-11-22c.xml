	<p pid="c.1019W.5/1">The modelling work used as an assumption that current policies would continue. On this basis, it assumed that rents would increase at RPI + 0.5 per cent. following convergence with formula rents in 2011-12 and that allowances would rise in line with GDP. Interest charges were based on local consolidated rate of interest forecasts. The modelling work however also tested sensitivity to changes in all the variables which have an impact on a business plan, including debt levels, interest and inflation rates, expenditure levels, rental and other income, and sales. The 30-year model business plans run well beyond medium term forecasts and policy commitments so it is important to consider a wide range of scenarios.</p>

Due to ongoing validation of data from the new Joint Personnel Administration system, Naval Service statistics for 1 October 2006 onwards and Army statistics for 1 March 2007 onwards are provisional and subject to review.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1035W.6/2">Following the Burmese regime's brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators in September, the international community has made clear that there can be no return to the previous situation. The UN, EU and Association of South East Asian Nations have been pushing for fundamental political and economic transformation, leading to national reconciliation, respect for human rights and the establishment of accountable civilian government in Burma.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/3">The UN has led international efforts to bring about substantive political change. The UN Secretary-General's envoy to Burma, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, visited the country in October and November, and reported to the Security Council after each visit. The Government of Burma has so far taken only limited steps to address the international community's key concerns. They have releases only a limited number of political prisoners and have not lifted the restrictions on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to allow her to participate fully in the process of national reconciliation. However, we welcome her constructive and forward-looking statement calling on the regime to enter into a 'meaningful and time bound dialogue'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/4">We will continue to work with our partners in the UN, the EU and across the region to press the Government of Burma to establish a genuine dialogue between the regime, opposition parties and ethnic groups as a first step towards the re-establishment of democracy, stability and freedom in Burma.</p>

	<p pid="c.1040W.11/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.11/2">We are extremely concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza. As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase>, only two crossings into Gaza were operating: Kerem Shalom: for humanitarian aid and commercial supplies; and Erez: for personnel movement (workers and traders) to and from Israel and the West Bank.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.11/3">We are doing all we can to help improve the situation. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced to the House a commitment of up to US$500 million to Palestinian development, conditional on progress towards peace; creating the necessary conditions for economic development; and easing security restrictions on movement and access. During this financial year (2007-08), the UK has provided &pound;31 million bilaterally to the Palestinians: &pound;15 million through United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA); &pound;1 million to the Red Cross' work in the West Bank and Gaza; and &pound;15 million through the Temporary International Mechanism. The UK has also pledged &pound;100 million over five years to UNRWA to help Palestinian refugees.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.11/4">The ability of Palestinians to move within the West Bank has deteriorated. In October 2007, the UN Office for the Co-ordination for Humanitarian Affairs reported a total of 561 closures in the West Bank. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the humanitarian situation in Gaza and movement and access in the West Bank during his visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories on 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-18">18 November</phrase>. I also refer the hon. Member to the written ministerial statement on the Middle East issued by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-11-20.127"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 127-8WS</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.11/5">Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon continue to live in unacceptably poor conditions. There is a particularly pressing problem in the North of Lebanon where fighting between the Lebanese army and Fatah Al Islam has destroyed the Nahr El Bared refugee camp. Our ambassador in Beirut has raised this issue with the Government of Lebanon at the highest level. We have pressed them on the need to improve living conditions including by granting them access to government services and the right to work and own property. We are currently looking at measures that the UK can take to support this work. In particular we are exploring ways to support the reconstruction of Nahr Bared, in the first instance through support to a World Bank Assessment mission.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.11/6">Conditions for Palestinian refugees in Syria are considerably better than for those in Lebanon. However, most refugees continue to have a low standard of living. Many of the water and sewerage systems in refugee camps are in need of upgrading, while some camps still lack networks altogether. Poor sanitation in the camps poses health risks for the refugees. In most of the refugee camps shelters remain very basic and many require structural rehabilitation. Palestinian refugees in Syria have access to government services and whil the Syrian government has taken on the responsibility for providing basic utilities in the camps, UNRWA continues to provide basic environmental health services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.11/7">Under long-standing arrangements with the Government of Jordan, UNRWA provides services to Jordan's registered Palestinian refugees. 1.8 million registered Palestinian refugees in Jordan are eligible for UNRWA services. Facilities provided for refugees are concentrated in the 10 official UNRWA camps (there are three other camps which do not come under UNRWA). These services include clinics, schools, vocational training and microfinancing projects; these complement services provided by the Jordanian government. The most disadvantaged refugees are eligible for UNRWA's &quot;special hardship&quot; programme. We continue to engage with UNRWA on prioritising its work with Palestinian refugees.</p>

	<p pid="c.1041W.5/2">Somalia unfortunately has a proliferation of illegal arms, many imported in violation of the embargo. The lack of a functioning government means that arms markets are unregulated. The situation is further exacerbated by the presence of clan militias and insurgents operating in the country. The Government institutions in Somalia do not currently have the capacity to hinder the illegal arms trade. The UK is working with the UN, and wider international community, to encourage the development of Government institutions in Somalia that will enable the authorities to develop its capacity in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.1046W.5/2">There are currently three road user charging schemes in England. The Dartford Crossing and Durham charging schemes were implemented under the road user charging provisions of the Transport Act 2000, and the London congestion charge was implemented under the Greater London Authority Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.5/3">Accounts for the charging regime at Dartford are published on the Highways Agency's website. Operating costs are below 40 per cent. of revenue. The charging scheme took over the infrastructure of the toll that preceded it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.5/4">The Department does not routinely collect information on costs and revenues of the other two schemes, in London and Durham. However we understand that revenues for the Durham scheme in the last financial year were &pound;65,820 and operating costs &pound;26,517.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.5/5">The capital cost of introducing the Durham scheme was in the region of &pound;175,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.5/6">For London the published figures for 2006-07 show total revenues of &pound;252.4 million and total costs (including depreciation and start-up costs for the western extension) of &pound;163.3 million. The original capital cost of setting up the congestion charge in 2003 was &pound;161.7 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.1060W.11/1">The UK, together with a majority of members of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), has consistently criticised Japan for its lethal whaling operations, authorised under special permits (so called 'scientific' whaling) and urged Japan to desist from these operations forthwith.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.11/2">Like most IWC members, we do not believe that lethal scientific research can be justified: there are perfectly adequate non-lethal alternatives which could secure the information required by the IWC for stock assessment and management purposes. The whale meat and other products from this so-called 'scientific' whaling are sold domestically in Japanese markets and restaurants. These whaling operations severely hamper international efforts to conserve and protect whales, and clearly demonstrate that these programmes are driven by commercial, rather than scientific considerations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.11/3">Japan's proposal to kill 50 humpback whales, a species that remains on the World Conservation Union's (IUCN) List of Threatened Species, is nothing less than outrageous. We will continue to make our opposition to whaling known to Japan at every appropriate opportunity, and argue that Japanese action undermines the credibility of the IWC as an effective organisation for the conservation of whale stocks worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.11/4">Whaling is not an issue on which the European Union (EU) exercises competence. As such, it is not generally a subject for discussion at meetings of EU Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.11/5">At official level, we do have regular contact with other like-minded countries, including those EU countries who are, like the UK, parties to the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling and thus members of the IWC.</p>

A note drawn up for internal purposes only covered the seven key issue areas which Gould made the focus of his review. Also discussed was Mr. Gould's request to have access to ballot paper images to assist in his analysis of rejected papers. I will provide to the Scottish Affairs Committee, to assist them with their discussions, the timelines for legislation and ballot paper design that were requested by Ron Gould as written evidence from the Scotland Office.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-11-22c.166218.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-11-22c.1066W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" colnum="1066W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071122/text/71122w0013.htm#07112251001732">
	<p pid="c.1066W.5/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) is a nationally representative survey of households in England and Wales. Its primary purpose is to estimate levels of crime committed against the population of private households and adults living in such households. As such, the survey cannot estimate crimes committed against those outside the scope of the survey, such as commercial and public sector bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.5/2">The BCS provides a measure of fraud (including identity fraud) committed against individuals in private households, which is important because it captures unreported incidents. However, fraud is a complex area and there are conceptual difficulties around its definition and measurement in surveys. On the one hand, some members of the public who had been victims of poor service may perceive themselves to have been de-frauded, when this is not the case in law, whereas many of those who had been genuine victims of fraud may not be aware of the fact.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.5/3">A special module of questions has been included in the BCS in recent years focusing on credit and debit card, internet and identity fraud. However, fraud offences are not currently included within the main crime count of the BCS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.5/4">The most recent results have been reported in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 11/07 'Crime in England and Wales 2006/2007'. More detailed figures can be found in the Home Office Online Report 10/07 'Mobile phone theft, plastic card and identity fraud: Findings from the 2005/06 British Crime Survey'. New questions have recently been developed, in the card and ID fraud module currently being run within the BCS, and these will be reviewed before continuing inclusion in the 2008/09 BCS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.5/5">Information about fraud is included on a number of Government websites including that of the Home Office, which also created and maintains a mini site devoted to fraud within the Government's Crime Reduction Website. The Get Safe Online website, a joint Government and private sector initiative, provides advice to help computer users stay safe online and includes information about fraud. The Home Office has also produced, in conjunction with the banking industry, a leaflet to help prevent plastic card fraud. The leaflet was distributed to police forces and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships and is available on the Home Office website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.5/6">The cross Whitehall review of fraud which reported last year recommended establishing a National Fraud Strategic Authority (NFSA) which will implement a national strategy on fraud. Key actions for the NFSA will be to raise the profile of fraud and to co-ordinate the response to it. A measurement will also be established within the NFSA to measure the national extent of fraud based on robust measurement methodologies.</p>

	<p pid="c.1078W.6/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1078W.6/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1078W.6/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what estimate his Department has made of the number of cases in each constituency being dealt with by the Child Support Agency in Scotland under the old system which will remain open when the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission's rules are introduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.1078W.6/6" class="indent">At the end of September 2007, the Child Support Agency had 67,900 cases assessed under old rules where the non-resident parent lived in Scotland. This figure covers all cases, including those with a positive assessment as well as those currently with a nil maintenance liability. It also includes those cases where the old rules are being processed on both the old and new computer systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1078W.6/7" class="indent">It is expected the number of old scheme cases will reduce from around 740,000 to around 300,000 before cases move into the new statutory maintenance service expected to start in 2010-11. The reason for this is predominantly the age and nature of these cases. It is also expected that a number of clients will wish to leave the statutory maintenance service and make their own arrangements following the removal of compulsion. No separate estimates have been made for Scotland or at a constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1078W.6/8" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.1084W.6/1">DWP has commissioned three studies relating to worklessness and ex-prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1084W.6/2">Research report 464 &quot;progress2work and progress2work-LinkUP: an exploratory study into evaluation possibilities&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-30">30 October 2007</phrase>. A copy of this report is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1084W.6/3">A qualitative study following up on 40 prisoners for six months after leaving prison is due to be published in spring 2008.

	<p pid="c.1084W.6/4">A Joint Pilots Baseline Study was commissioned in July 2007 and is due to report in 2009.

These include Job Developer Pilots (EXit2Work) and the Green Paper on Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment Test Bed regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1084W.6/5">Activities supporting the employment of ex-prisoners include Jobcentre Plus staff working in prisons to facilitate job retention and search, and the pre-booking of interviews with Jobcentre Plus on release. Additional support is available through the contracted-out programme progress2work and progress2work-LinkUP, whose clients are ex-prisoners, drug addicts and the homeless. Ex-prisoners are also supported by mainstream services, and have early access to the new deals.</p>

	<p pid="c.1085W.3/2">The Afghan economy has grown by between 40 per cent. and 70 per cent. since 2002, driven primarily by high aid inflows and the opium economy.

	<p pid="c.1086W.6/2">Food price inflation has stayed stable at an average of 8 per cent. per year since 2003. However these prices are likely to increase in the future due to significant increases in international food prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.6/3">Food poverty in 2005, as measured by the number of people consuming less than 2,100 calories a day, was 30 per cent. The figure for rural and urban Afghanistan is almost the same. There is no reliable time series, but according to the United Nations, during 2001-04 the proportion of people suffering food poverty in rural areas remained relatively constant. This suggests that the majority of Afghans manage to maintain a minimum level of calorie intake despite year-to-year rainfall fluctuations. However millions are still chronically or seasonally food insecure.</p>

	<p pid="c.1088W.8/1">There has been no formal assessment of this issue by the Government, but in 2004 the Department for International Development (DFID) funded seven independent studies that, inter alia, seek to assess the impact of the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on developing countries who wish to manufacture generic HIV/AIDS drugs. These are summarised in a 2004 publication by the DFID Health Systems Resource Centre: &quot;Access to medicines in under-served markets: what are the implications of changes in intellectual property rights, trade and drug registration policy?&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.1088W.8/4">These studies suggest that local production, which may be facilitated by TRIPS flexibilities, can contribute to better access and availability, but only if countries have the skills, infrastructure and regulatory capacity to produce and deliver quality medicines at lower prices than the brand-name producer.</p>

	<p pid="c.1091W.2/1">The US Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) estimate that electricity generation since November 2006 has fluctuated between 3,500 megawatts (MW) and 4,975 MW. The average for 2006 was 4,400 MW, just above the pre-2003 level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.2/2">Although 5,000 MW have been added to the national grid since 2003, electricity generation in Iraq is not meeting demand. This is due to several reasons: old and dilapidated infrastructure; a result of years of under-investment and mismanagement; shortage of fuel supplies; and sabotage of key facilities. Furthermore, demand has increased considerably to over 9,000 MW, with the influx of electrical goods such as refrigerators, televisions and air conditioning units.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.2/3">The most recent reliable data available for water supplies in Iraq comes from the Iraq living conditions survey carried out in 2004 by the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation and the United Nations Development programme. This survey can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1091W.2/5">The 2004 UN survey found that in urban areas, 99 per cent. of households have access to safe drinking water (but for 33 per cent. the supply is unreliable). In rural areas, 65 per cent. of households-have access to safe drinking water (but for 22 per cent. the supply is unreliable). Since 2003, donors (including DFID) have worked hard to restore supplies. As a result, IRMO estimates that an additional 5.4 million Iraqis have improved access to drinking water.</p>

	<p pid="c.1092W.2/1">According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Iraq remains on the list of the 60 countries in the world with the highest infant, under-five and maternal mortality rates. The latest joint UNICEF&mdash;Government of Iraq Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey was published in March 2006. It estimated an infant mortality rate at 35 per 1,000 live births. The under-five mortality rate was estimated at 41 per 1,000 live births. According to a 2004 Iraq Living Conditions Survey (ILCS), the maternal mortality rate was 192 per 100,000 live births.

However, the UN, led by UNICEF, continues to support the Iraqi Government to improve nutrition rates in Iraq through infant feeding campaigns, the provision of medical supplies and other support. DFID is supporting humanitarian agencies providing emergency relief, including food assistance, to children and other vulnerable groups. Since 2003, DFID has committed over &pound;130 million in humanitarian assistance, of which &pound;15 million has been for this year alone.</p>

The precise date on which we reach these targets will depend on the outcome of future spending reviews and on continuing to increase demand for higher education among people of all ages and backgrounds who would benefit from entering higher education. Our policies will therefore continue to increase and widen participation</p>

Friend the Secretary of State has just issued the Learning and Skills Council with its Grant Letter 2008-09, and a copy has been placed in the House Libraries. However, the funding of specific organisations providing learning opportunities for post-16 learners is an operational matter for the LSC as it determines the level of funding required at local level to deliver their key priorities and targets. The LSC will continue funding of any organisation (whether they are charitable or not) which can assist people who suffer from mental health problems to return to work through learning and skills provision, where it is clear that the organisation can deliver the quality and type of provision to meet the requirements of the LSC in ensuring the very best for those learners, and where this type of work has been identified as a priority for funding.</p>

Given the small size of these units, posts have been relocated to existing regional accommodation and it is expected that, from an operational and financial viewpoint further units will be relocated using this rationale.

	<p pid="c.1115W.2/2">Basildon hospital is subject to the national standards that have been put in place in relation to healthcare associated infections.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.2/3">The &quot;Health Act 2006: Code of Practice for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections&quot; came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. It requires national health service bodies to have appropriate management and clinical governance systems in place to deliver effective infection control. Compliance with the Code is assessed by the Healthcare Commission, which has the power to issue an 'improvement notice', to an NHS body that in its view is not properly observing it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.2/4">This is the first Government to introduce mandatory surveillance of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs), beginning with methicillin resistant <i> Staphylococcus</i><i> aureus</i> (MRSA) bacteraemias in April 2001. In January 2007, we introduced quarterly publication of mandatory data for MRSA and <i> C. difficile</i>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.2/5">Tackling HCAIs is a priority in the NHS operating framework. We have set a nationwide target, to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by April 2008, and each Trust has its own local MRSA target. From April 2007, primary care trusts and trusts have been required to agree local targets to reduce significantly <i> C. difficile</i> infections. Under the new &quot;Better Care for All&quot; public service agreement, we have set new requirements for the period to 2010-11, to maintain the current MRSA target (keep MRSA bloodstream infections below half the numbers in 2003-04), and to deliver a 30 per cent. reduction in <i> C. difficile</i> infections compared with the numbers in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.2/6">We have introduced a wide range of measures to help support the NHS in tackling HCAIs. I refer the hon. Member to the written ministerial statement, given on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-15">15 October 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-10-15.49"><i> Official Report,</i> column 49WS</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1116W.8/1">The current arrangements for handling complaints in social care are determined by the provisions of the Local Authority Social Services Complaints (England) Regulations 2006 and the Care Standards Act (CSA) 2000. Together, these define the respective statutory responsibilities of local authorities and regulated care providers in matters of complaint.</p>
	<p pid="c.1116W.8/2">The current framework for the regulation of provider care services was implemented in 2002, with the creation of the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC). The CSA 2000 placed no statutory complaints duties upon the NCSC and did not provide any powers for their investigation. The legislation defined the role of the regulator as one of ensuring the compliance of providers with their statutory complaints responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1116W.8/3">As a regulator, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) has mandatory powers of compulsion under the CSA 2000 to ensure the compliance of care providers where a complaint indicates a breach under the Care Homes Regulations 2001 or the associated National Minimum Standards (NMS). In such instances, CSCI will issue requirements aimed at bringing the provider into compliance, and if necessary, will issue a statutory notice where the requirement has not been observed. Non-compliance with a statutory notice is an offence that can result in a cancellation of a provider's registration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1116W.8/4">CSCI can ensure that a breach of regulations identified by an individual complaint is acted upon through its compliance activity, to the benefit of all people using a regulated care service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1116W.8/5">In effect, CSCI uses its powers of inspection as the regulator to undertake proportionate inquiries into all information (including complaints) brought to its attention about regulated care services. CSCI considers that its focus is correctly upon provider compliance with service specific regulations and NMS, not interpersonal conflict resolution between complainant and provider, for which it has no statutory responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1117W.2/1">The Government regard the abuse of vulnerable and older people in any setting as unacceptable in all its forms and are determined to root it out. We are addressing the issue in a variety of ways.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/2">We set out standards for care and treatment for the national health service and social care services via the National Service Frameworks for Older People and Mental Health and the White Paper, Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/3">We introduced regulations and national minimum standards for care homes, domiciliary care agencies and adult placements. These are intended to ensure vulnerable and older people can live in a safe environment, where their rights and dignity are respected, staff are properly trained and care is of the requisite quality. The regulations and national minimum standards apply equally to all providers of care, whether in the private, voluntary or public sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/4">We have created independent regulators, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) and the Healthcare Commission, and given them the powers they need to take action against poorly performing providers or where abuse occurs. Ultimately, they have the power to close services down. All providers of care, including private care homes are legally required to register with and be inspected and regulated by CSCI.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/5">We expect local authorities to play their part. No Secrets, published by the Department in 2000 provides a complete definition of abuse and a framework for councils to work with the police, the national health service and regulators to tackle abuse and prevent it from occurring. On June 14 this year, I also announced a review of the No Secrets guidance. The case for legislation to protect vulnerable adults will be considered as part of the review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/6">Local authorities have been given specific responsibilities. Statutory guidance issued in May 2006 required them to ensure that Directors of Adult Social Services maintain a clear organisational and operational focus on safeguarding vulnerable adults and that relevant statutory requirements and other national standards are met, including Protection of Vulnerable Adults (POVA) requirements. Local authorities must make sure the Director of Adult Social Services has the powers and resources necessary to encourage a culture of vigilance against the possibility of adult abuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/7">We introduced the POVA Scheme in July 2004, under the provisions in Part 7 of the Care Standards Act 2000, which requires staff who provide personal care to older people in their own homes or in care homes to be subject to statutory checks, including checks of their criminal record. At the heart of the POVA scheme is the POVA list, which operates as a workforce ban and prevents dangerous or unscrupulous people from gaining access to older and vulnerable people in care homes or being cared for in their own homes. Only the employers in regulated social care services or the regulator, CSCI, can make referrals to the POVA list.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/8">The Mental Capacity Act 2005, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>, introduces a new criminal offence of ill treatment or wilful neglect of a person who lacks capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/9">The Government support the work of Action on Elder Abuse (AEA). AEA has been awarded a Section 64 grant, totalling &pound;360,000. This grant covers the three year period from 2007 to 2009 and is to help fund central administrative costs, which will include their freephone helpline for anyone concerned in any way about the abuse of older people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/10">We are introducing a new centralised vetting and barring scheme for people working with children and vulnerable people. This scheme, as set out in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, will extend the coverage of existing barring schemes, such as POVA and draw on wider sources of information to provide a more comprehensive and consistent measure of protection for vulnerable groups across a wide range of settings, including the whole of social care and the NHS. The new scheme will make it far more difficult for abusers to gain access to some of the most vulnerable groups in society and will be a significant step forward.</p>

Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes.

	<p pid="c.1136W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1136W.6/2">In 1997 the Government published their Green Paper &quot;Excellence for all children: Meeting Special Educational Needs&quot; which set out policies for working with parents and improving provision to meet children's special educational needs (SEN). In 1998 the Government set out a programme of action to implement the policies in the Green Paper over the following three years and in 2001 passed the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act and published a revised SEN Code of Practice. The Act strengthened the right of parents of children with SEN to have their children educated in mainstream schools if that is what they wanted; it laid duties on schools and local authorities not to discriminate against children with disabilities, including those with learning disabilities, to make reasonable adjustments to prevent such discrimination, and to plan to increase access to schools and the curriculum; and the Act obliged each local authority to have a parent partnership service for the parents of children with SEN in order to offer factual and unbiased advice on SEN provision and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1136W.6/3">Since 2004, through a range of initiatives, the Government have been implementing their SEN strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; which promoted earlier intervention, improvements to mainstream SEN provision so that a wider group of children can have their needs met effectively in mainstream schools, an enhanced role for special schools providing for children with severe and complex needs and working with mainstream schools to help other children with SEN reach their potential, improved SEN training for prospective and qualified teachers and improved partnership working between agencies to meet children's needs. In the past eight years, spending by local authorities on provision for children with SEN has risen from &pound;2.8 billion in 2000-01 (the first year in which this figure was collected separately) to &pound;4.9 billion in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1136W.6/4">Complementing the initiatives under these programmes and strategies, others have focused on disabled, including learning disabled, children and their parents. For example, the Early Support programme has promoted joint agency approaches to earlier identification and key workers to work with families to negotiate access to services and offer support. Early Support has also produced a range of support resources for parents. The programme is now being rolled out nationally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1136W.6/5">Finally, &quot;Aiming High for Disabled Children&quot; (May 2007) announced &pound;340 million of investment, including &pound;280 million to improve the provision of short breaks for the families of disabled children, &pound;5 million to encourage parents' participation in influencing the design and delivery of services and &pound;19 million for a Transition Support Programme to help young people realise their ambitions in their transition to adult life.</p>

Kent county council, like all local authorities receiving this ringfenced funding, has freedom to determine the level of resource for each individual SSLP in its area from within its overall ring-fenced allocation for SSLPs to ensure the core children's centre services remain available to families in the area. My officials wrote to local authorities in August this year giving revenue allocations for children's centres and SSLPs for the next three financial years. The letter explained that the ringfenced funding must be used for</p>

Kent county council is responsible, like all local authorities, for allocating resources to those children's centres not based on SSLPs to enable them to deliver mainstream children's services to meet local needs. We issued guidance earlier this month to support local authorities in allocating resources effectively &quot;Sure Start Children's Centres : Planning and Delivering Phase 3&quot; which is available on the Sure Start website</p>

	<p pid="c.1139W.6/1">The Steiner Waldorf Schools Association responded to our formal consultation on the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) last year. Since then officials have had extensive discussions with representatives from the Steiner Waldorf Schools Association on how the EYFS can support Steiner early childhood best practice. They have also held a conference attended by representatives of most of the Steiner kindergartens at which they explained the Early Years Foundation Stage, listened to the concerns of those present and discussed how the aims of EYFS sit alongside those of the Steiner educational philosophy. The EYFS is a broad framework which does not prescribe any particular teaching approach and as such it has the flexibility to accommodate a wide range of philosophies and practices.</p>

	<p pid="c.1140W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/2">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/5" class="indent">In April 2006 the Commission for Social Care Inspection started a three-year programme of inspections of the way in which local authorities discharge their duties and functions in relation to private fostering. The new Ofsted assumed responsibility for this programme in April 2007 and is continuing to carry out these inspections.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/6" class="indent">CSCI collated the findings of the 50 inspections of private fostering arrangements which took place in the first year of inspection, from April 2006-March 2007. Ofsted will continue to produce collated findings, with the next review to be published after March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/7" class="indent">All councils have strategies in place to identify and meet the needs of privately fostered children. However, they are very variable in quality and councils are at very different stages in their implementation. Although the size and demography of councils will determine the likely incidence of private fostering, the figures set out below highlight the range of performance at the time of the inspections. The Office for National Statistics figures show that at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> there were 1,250 privately fostered children. British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) have estimated that there could be between 7,000 and 10,000 privately fostered children in England. All councils still face a significant challenge in implementing these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/8" class="indent">i. 5 councils (10%) had comprehensive strategies and arrangements to identify and meet the needs of privately fostered children. They knew of over twenty privately fostered children in their areas and had taken appropriate action in relation to them. They recognised that there were other privately fostered children that they had yet to identify.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/9" class="indent">ii. 7 councils (14%) had made significant progress in implementing their strategies, and this has had some impact on notifications. All these councils knew of at least ten privately fostered children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/10" class="indent">iii. In 27 councils (54%), there had not been a significant increase in notifications, with between 2 and 9 privately fostered children known in each of these areas. These councils will need to give priority to private fostering if they are to implement their plans effectively over the next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/11" class="indent">iv. 6 councils (12%) did not know of any privately fostered children in their areas and 5 councils (10%) knew of only 1. These councils need to give high priority to private fostering.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/12" class="indent">The best councils have improved the effectiveness of their private fostering arrangements by:</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/13" class="indent">developing comprehensive strategies for identifying and meeting the needs of privately fostered children</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/14" class="indent">involving all agencies through the children's trust arrangements and the Local Safeguarding Children Board, particularly universal services</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/15" class="indent">identifying a senior officer to be responsible for this area of work</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/16" class="indent">establishing and publicised clear notification, assessment and approval processes designed to assess private foster carers' suitability to meet children's needs</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/17" class="indent">developing publicity and information to inform families, children and the public at large about private fostering</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/18" class="indent">All Local Safeguarding Children Boards are responsible for monitoring arrangements for ensuring the safety of privately fostered children. Joint Area Reviews, a cross-inspectorate programme to review children's services in an area, always consider safeguarding as a core investigation. As part of this they report on how well private foster carers are identified, monitored and supported in developing and maintaining positive relationships with their children. This allows inspectors to examine whether or not procedures are in place, and how effective they are in identifying privately fostered children in an area. The findings from Joint Area Reviews mirror the findings outlined above. Most councils have developed procedures and have produced information to raise awareness in partner agencies and the public at large. However the impact of this in identifying privately fostered children has been slow.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/19" class="indent">Inspections therefore have shown that local councils have been slow to implement private fostering arrangements. Greater progress is needed in ensuring that private fostering arrangements have been effectively implemented and safeguards for these potentially vulnerable children have been improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/20" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.1158W.2/1">The national gifted and talented programme is designed to meet the needs of all children and young people identified as gifted and talented by their schools. Currently some 91 per cent. of secondary schools and 65 per cent. of primary schools are identifying about 733,000 gifted and talented learners. We want all schools to identify their gifted and talented pupils now, so giving a national population of around one million. We want all to join the new Young Gifted and Talented Learner Academy (YG&amp;T). Every school should already have access to an identified leading teacher for gifted and talented, a lead professional responsible for securing high quality personalised learning and support.</p>

	<p pid="c.1165W.0/1">In 1996, the National Foundation for Educational Research found that there had been little or no improvement in literacy standards for most of the period since the second world war. Improving standards of literacy at all stages of education has therefore been one of this Government's top priorities. Primary literacy standards as measured by the results of national curriculum tests are now at their highest levels ever. No Government have achieved the sustained improvements in primary results that we have.</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.0/2">Since the introduction of national curriculum tests in 1995, results in English have improved significantly. Today, four out of five 11-year-olds are reaching the target level 4 compared with under half in 1995.</p>

	<p pid="c.1165W.0/42">Although the results achieved by 11-year-olds in 2007 are the best ever, we know that we can and must achieve more. I believe we are right to be ambitious for the system and for what individual pupils can achieve&mdash;that is why we have set such stretching national targets for improvements in standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.0/43">We have a strong platform for securing further improvements. From this autumn, every primary school is using the renewed Primary Framework which puts phonics at the heart of the teaching of reading. This is the most significant enhancement to the Primary National Strategy since we first introduced the literacy hour in 1998. We are also rolling out nationally the Every Child A Reader (ECAR) programme. By 2011, this programme will provide 30,000 six-year-olds who have difficulty reading with intensive one-to-one tuition each year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.0/44">We are also developing a new programme of intensive support for writing in primary schools&mdash;Every Child a Writer&mdash;to ensure that every teacher uses the best teaching methods, including one-to-one coaching, in areas of writing which primary children find hardest to master.</p>

	<p pid="c.1166W.2/2">Following extended discussions with the Department for Transport and its agencies at both ministerial and official level, my Department published a policy statement in April 2006, &quot;Licensing Incidental Drivers of the School Minibus&quot;, which clarifies the existing law&mdash;there is no new requirement. It explains that school staff who are not contracted to drive the minibus are exempt from having to hold a D1 PCV licence and may drive the minibus on their car licence subject to other conditions of exemption being met. Such incidental drivers are commonly trained in conjunction with the Minibus Driver Awareness Scheme (MiDAS), though it is also open for local authorities to arrange for their incidental drivers to take the D1 PCV route as good practice. Our policy also states:</p>
	<p pid="c.1166W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;In the medium term, when a school replaces its minibus, it is likely to lose its exemption because newer minibuses tend to weigh more than 3.5 tonnes, and the Government has no plans to change the weight limit on the exemption. Therefore we advise schools to consider investing in D1 PCV training over the next few years, since the law will require it in the longer term, if or when they move to a heavier minibus.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.1166W.5/1">From 1998-99 to 2003-04 the Department has allocated &pound;531.2 million to primary schools and local authorities to support the National Literacy Strategy. From 2004-05 to 2007-08 the Department has allocated a further 720.5 million to support the Primary National Strategy (formerly the National Literacy Strategy and the National Numeracy Strategy). We are unable to split the latter figure down to specific literacy funding as the precise allocations between literacy and numeracy are a matter for each local authority taking account of local needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1166W.5/23">In addition to these grants the Department also holds a contract for the central delivery of the National Strategies. This contract includes the provision of an education field force, continuing professional development (CPD) materials and training events. The central delivery support for primary literacy in the current comprehensive spending review (CSR) period (FY 2005-06 to FY 2007-08) is approximately &pound;10 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1166W.5/24">Improving standards of literacy is one of the Government's top priorities. As part of the drive to raise standards in education, the Government introduced the National Literacy Strategy in 1998 and the results achieved by 11-year-olds since 1997 as measured by national curriculum tests in English have risen dramatically. Provisional data for 2007 show that 80 per cent. of 11-year-olds in England reached the expected level or above, an increase of 17 percentage points since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1166W.5/25">The renewed primary literacy strategy, with a stronger emphasis on phonics, Every Child a Reader and Every Child a Writer to help those pupils who are struggling, will help to ensure that we maintain and extend the improvements we have already achieved.</p>

	<p pid="c.1170W.3/3">Table D gives data for Academies and City Technology Colleges (CTCs). This table is not comparable with the others because Academies and CTCs have academic year budgets, and also receive funding arising from their independent status. For example, they receive funding for VAT liability, and also funding which derives from their responsibility for some expenditure which for maintained schools is met from centrally retained local authority funding. The average level of funding is also high because nearly all pupils at Academies (and all pupils at CTCs) are of secondary age; and Academies mainly serve areas with a high level of pupil deprivation, which itself increases funding levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.1177W.2/2">All accredited providers of initial teacher training (ITT) must design their programmes to ensure that they meet the Secretary of State's Requirements for ITT, and that all trainees demonstrate the Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). These standards are statutory and are rigorously inspected by Ofsted. They were reviewed recently along with all classroom teacher standards and new standards, effective from September 2007, have been significantly strengthened in the areas of special needs and disability. There is no prescription as to how much time must be spent on individual elements of training; the standards are outcome statements, and training must be sufficiently personalised to ensure that every trainee, irrespective of their training route, meets all of them before being recommended for QTS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/3">To be awarded QTS, all trainee teachers currently must demonstrate that they:</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/4" class="indent">know how to make effective personalised provision for those they teach, including those who have special educational needs and disabilities (including children and young people with speech, language and learning difficulties); and</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/5" class="indent">know and understand the roles of colleagues with specific responsibilities including those with responsibility for learners with special educational needs and disabilities, and other individual learning needs (including colleagues that have specific responsibility for children and young people with speech, language and learning difficulties).</p>

They have the freedom to decide the best way of delivering while taking into account government policy and local needs. The recent CSR settlement for local government, which included an increase in Formula Grant of 4.2 per cent./3.5 per cent./3.4 per cent. is a very positive one for children and young people's services. These increases in Formula Grant will enable local authorities to build on 10 years of sustained growth in the area and continue our work on improving outcomes for children and young people. In July 2007 the Government published &quot;Aiming High for Young People: a ten year strategy for positive activities&quot;, with the aim of increasing young people's access to positive leisure time activities. The strategy is supported, over the 2008-11 period, by &pound;184 million of new money, in addition to &pound;495 million of continuing funding and reinvestment of unclaimed assets.</p>
