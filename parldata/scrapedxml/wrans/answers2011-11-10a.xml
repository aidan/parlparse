	<p pid="a.398W.3/1">There are two key guidance documents for reservoirs engineers. The first is &#8216;A guide to the Reservoirs Act 1975&#8217;, published by the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in 2000 with the support of the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which is a guide to understanding the intent of the Act and approaches to managing reservoirs in compliance with the Act. The second is &#8216;Floods and Reservoir Safety, 3rd Edition&#8217;, published by the ICE in 1996. This provides technical guidance for reservoir engineers particularly with respect to their safety under flood loading.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.3/2">A review of these guidance documents has been initiated and to that end the President of the ICE has been asked to lead a review of these documents and to include the Environment Agency on the review panel. The review will be carried out with the support of DEFRA. The ICE has agreed to this in principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.3/3">The review of &#8216;A guide to the Reservoirs Act 1975&#8217; will commence with an initial meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-17">17 November</phrase> to discuss the work programme. The proposal is that the reviewed guidance on the amended legislation would be published by DEFRA in parallel with the making of the various legal instruments (Phase 1 is due to begin in October 2012).</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.3/4">The reviewed technical guidance should be based on currently available knowledge and be published by the ICE to a programme, and although the programme has yet to be agreed, completion is expected within two years. However, if the timescale of the introduction of the legal instruments slipped this publication would slip.</p>
	<p pid="a.398W.3/5">The review of &#8216;Floods and Reservoir Safety&#8217; will be taking place over a longer timescale and no meetings have yet been scheduled.</p>

	<p pid="a.398W.6/1">Under the water framework directive we classify our aquatic environment as water bodies: this includes rivers, estuaries, lakes and groundwaters etc. There are over 8,000 water bodies in England and Wales, of which there are over 5,800 river water bodies. Currently fewer than 300 of these are considered to be at high risk from abstraction pressures.</p>

	<p pid="a.400W.3/2">The greater proportion of food procured by local authorities is for schools. DEFRA is working with the Department for Education, the School Food Trust and the major local authority buying organisations, in particular those in the PRO 5 consortium, and others to embed the Government Buying Standards (GBS), as they are developed, into national procurement frameworks for food and catering services.</p>
	<p pid="a.400W.3/3">Mandatory GBS criteria currently bans the use of fresh (in-shell) eggs from conventional cage systems. If a cage system is used they should be enriched cages. In light of the forthcoming EU ban on conventional cages, we intend to extend this mandatory criteria to cover all liquid and powdered egg products, which are currently in voluntary best practice criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.400W.3/4">The Government believe that their role is to set a credible and workable example for the wider public sector to follow, and it is this that the GBS is designed to deliver. All public bodies have a different set of requirements and the local people most closely connected with them, staff, patients, governors, will have different priorities, making them best placed to decide how to achieve the objectives we are aiming for.</p>

This would be achieved through amending the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007. I have no intention of delaying transposition and implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.0/7">The RED sets mandatory sustainability criteria for biofuels. The RED was published in 2009. The introduction of mandatory biofuel sustainability criteria was discussed between summer 2009 and spring 2010 at regular departmental stakeholder advisory group meetings, which included industry representatives. Those discussions and other meetings with various stakeholders helped formulate proposals which were the subject of a full public consultation between March and June this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.0/8">The current RTFO has been in place since 2008, with voluntary reporting on carbon and sustainability. The RTFO administrator has worked closely with transport fuel suppliers as we prepare for the introduction of mandatory sustainability criteria including adapting the current RTFO Carbon and Sustainability reporting system and guidance to a &#8220;RED-Ready&#8221; standard in April 2011. Those companies that have taken the opportunity to report on a voluntary basis and to establish sustainable biofuel supply chains will be well placed to meet the requirements of an amended RTFO.</p>

	<p pid="a.409W.8/2">We recognise though that some prospective FITs generators who have incurred or committed expenditure may not be able to complete their installations and submit their applications for FITs before the proposed reference date. In forming the proposal, we have taken into account the possibility of hardship to persons in this situation. However, on balance, we consider that the proposed approach is reasonable, given a number of factors. These include the urgency of the concerns about the impact on the scheme's budget of continuing high levels of uptake at the current tariffs, including any rush of new installations triggered by the consultation. In addition, the proposed new tariffs are designed to provide a reasonable rate of return in line with those intended when the scheme was first introduced. The FITs scheme was never intended to provide windfall profits, paid for by energy consumers in general, and in the current climate we regard the returns expected for FIT generators under the proposed new tariffs to be reasonable. The Government do not intend to provide compensation for those who miss the deadline.</p>

However, in addition, in relation to litigation and some other matters FCO instructs the Treasury Solicitor's Department.

We are also of the view that the convention does not apply extra-territorially. For these reasons, we would not be able to give effect to the convention.

	<p pid="a.417W.5/2">The greater proportion of food procured by local authorities is for schools. DEFRA is working with the Department for Education, the School Food Trust and the major local authority buying organisations, in particular those in the PRO 5 consortium, and others to embed the Government Buying Standards (GBS), as they are developed, into national procurement frameworks for food and catering services.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.5/3">Mandatory GBS criteria currently bans the use of fresh (in-shell) eggs from conventional cage systems. If a cage system is used they should be enriched cages. In light of the forthcoming EU ban on conventional cages, we intend to extend this mandatory criteria to cover all liquid and powdered egg products, which are currently in voluntary best practice criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.5/4">The Government believe that their role is to set a credible and workable example for the wider public sector to follow, and it is this that the GBS is designed to deliver. All public bodies have a different set of requirements and the local people most closely connected with them, staff, patients, governors, will have different priorities, making them best placed to decide how to achieve the objectives we are aiming for.</p>

	<p pid="a.418W.6/1">The National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review prioritised the cyber threat as one of the top four threats facing the UK (Tier 1). According to Dettica, in their report &#8216;The Cost of Cyber Crime&#8217;, cyber crime alone costs the UK economy &#163;27 billion a year. Because of the scale and complexity of this threat to our national security, combating cyber crime will be an important part of the Government's forthcoming cyber security strategy.</p>

Gang injunctions for over 18s are already in place and can be used to prohibit someone from being in charge of, or in a particular place with, a particular species of dog. We are also planning to introduce Criminal Behaviour Orders and Crime Prevention Injunctions which will apply to under 18s and could contain prohibitions and requirements which relate to antisocial or dangerous dogs. For example the court could order that a dog had to be kept muzzled in public, or that an owner had to attend dog training classes, if this was required to prevent future antisocial behaviour involving dogs.</p>

Support varies from country to country. In Burundi, development assistance through a multi-donor effort is helping to establish an independent Revenue Authority. Over the first nine months of 2011, revenue was 37% above the same period in 2010. In both Bangladesh and Sierra Leone our development assistance is helping to establish a unit to manage large taxpayers. In Bangladesh it is also helping to strengthen the audit function and in Sierra Leone it includes help with introducing new computer systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.432W.3/1">In February 2009, DFID contributed &#163;650,000 to the United Nations 2008 Flash Appeal for the Kyrgyz Republic. The appeal aimed to help support the needs of some two million people as well as to ensure continuation of essential services. DFID's support was provided to: (a) the World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure food access for the 580,000 most vulnerable people (&#163;500,000); and (b) the Office of the UN Resident Co-ordinator in Bishkek to strengthen its co-ordination capacity for implementation of the Flash Appeal and design and implementation of early recovery programmes (&#163;150,000).</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.3/2">In 2010, following the violent conflict in the South of Kyrgyzstan, DFID did not directly fund the UN appeal, but made a contribution through a number of international organisations, including: (a) the UN Central Emergency Fund (CERF) which allocated $8 million in response to the situation; and (b) the European Commission which earmarked up to &#8364;5 million for emergency aid on top of &#8364;6 million allocated from its Instrument for Stability in response to the initial unrest in April 2010 (the UK provided approximately 15% of this EU expenditure).</p>

This is because information is not recorded in this form and in order to establish the answer, it would be necessary to gather together every file over the 3&#189; year period (the bulk of which would have to be retrieved from store, as non-current files are not retained within offices of the reasons of lack of space) and then have a lawyer go through them to identify each and every occasion on which such advice was sought. Equally, such an exercise would be necessary in relation to each and every court case. In addition, it is possible that such an exercise would not identify every case of oral or telephonic advice. For these reasons the probable cost of answering this parliamentary question would be well in excess of &#163;800.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.11/1">Departmental headcount has been reduced by around 7,000 full-time equivalents since the beginning of the spending review in April 2011. It is estimated that headcount will continue to reduce for the remainder of this year and next year as streamlining and efficiencies are realised.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.11/2">Headcount levels in the following two years, 2013-14 and 2014-15, will be significantly impacted by the planned introduction of universal credit and migration of claimants from legacy benefits. Work force plans for these years are still being developed and at this stage it is not feasible to provide an estimate of the headcount levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.437W.2/1">In the 2010 Emergency Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" name="George Osborne">the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne)</phrase>, announced that a two year pay freeze would be implemented for civil service staff outside the senior civil service (SCS). Base pay for the SCS was also frozen in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.2/2">The pay freeze for non-SCS applies for two years. In DWP the pay freeze applied to the pay years 2010-11 and 2011-12. Public sector pay guidance is clear that staff on full time equivalent earnings of &#163;21,000 a year or under are guaranteed an increase of at least &#163;250.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.2/3">The guidance also allowed for increases where there was a contractual entitlement to progression. DWP does not have contractual progression.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.2/4">In DWP payments were therefore limited to those earning &#163;21,000 or under, plus a number of individuals who earned slightly more than &#163;21,000 to ensure that they were not 'leapfrogged' by colleagues lower down the pay scale. In addition, during the 2010-11 year, pay rises were approved by Cabinet Office for four senior civil servants who each took on substantially bigger roles with increased responsibility. There have been no pay rises for any senior civil servants in the 2011-12 year.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.2/5">In both 2010-11 and 2011-12 DWP provided increases to eligible staff above the &#163;250 guaranteed minimum. This is because DWP is a lower paying Department. Around 57% of staff received a pay rise in 2010-11 and around half of staff received an increase in 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.2/1">The Pensions Act 2004 introduced a scheme-specific approach to regulating pension scheme funding. The Pensions Regulator, which is operationally independent of Ministers, has made it clear that funding objectives must be set prudently, to uphold stability during various economic climates. The scheme funding regime is sufficiently flexible, in terms of both the form and duration of recovery plans, to support pension schemes in meeting long-term liabilities through fluctuations in the economic cycle. It allows trustees the flexibility to develop prudent funding strategies which take account of the particular circumstances of their particular scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.2/2">Pension scheme funding strategies are designed to deliver members' benefits over the long-term, during which time there will inevitably be fluctuations in the economic cycle. I understand that the Regulator will continue to apply the system pragmatically looking for outcomes in the best interests of the scheme and sponsor. This will be the case whether schemes are due their triennial valuation during the phase of quantitative easing or at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="a.448W.5/1">The rate of unemployment, including youth and long-term unemployment, is still far too high and the Government are taking significant steps to reduce it. In particular we are supporting young people into work by investing in flexible, personalised employment support, apprenticeships, work experience and training. I am undertaking discussions with a wide range of agencies, work programme providers and partners in the public, private and voluntary sectors at both local and national level to help ensure that young people are able to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/2">Jobcentre Plus in Dudley has been working closely with colleges and providers to support the Dudley borough in a variety of areas such as jobs, training, apprenticeships and work experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/3">The Jobcentre Plus employment manager for Dudley borough has developed close working relationships with both Dudley and Stourbridge colleges as well as a local provider&#8212;Mercury Training&#8212;using local labour market information to establish the employer/customer supply and demand data to then identify suitable provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/4">Specific examples of Jobcentre Plus current and planned activity across the Dudley borough are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/5">Developed a Hospitality Academy with Stourbridge college which has resulted in positive job outcomes with the Copthorne Hotel through pre-employment training and work experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/6">Working with Mercury Training to identify security training provision and employment opportunities for claimants within the Dudley borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/7">An event is planned for jobseekers seeking employment in the care sector on the <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-29">29 November 2011</phrase>. This event has been developed through local partnership work with colleges across the Black Country through the Care to Make a Difference programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/8">A joint retail jobs event was recently held at the Merry Hill Centre through work between the Jobcentre, Westfield Retail Academy, local colleges and providers in supporting customers in recruitment processes for seasonal vacancies, in particular supporting jobseekers with the online application process.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/9">Stourbridge College has been successful in a recent Flexible Support Funding bid to deliver HGV training to 100 customers within the Dudley borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.5/10">The Jobcentre has recently held an event in the borough specifically for customers aged over 50 to maximise on recruitment and training opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.449W.2/1">Universal credit provides a new single system of means-tested support for working-age people who are in or out of work. As a result, some existing means-tested benefits will no longer be needed. The Government recognise the importance of passported benefits such as free school meals and free prescriptions to claimants and to their decisions about moving into work. The Government aim to ensure that passported benefits are targeted to people that require them most.</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.2/2">Defining entitlement to certain passported benefits is the responsibility of other Government Departments and devolved Administrations. Policies and provision vary by country and the value of benefits can also vary by country or local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.2/3">The Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) has been commissioned to carry out an independent review on passported benefits on behalf of the Government. This review is still taking place and the Committee has been asked to report by the end of January 2012. The Department will publish the final report alongside our response in April.</p>

	<p pid="a.457W.3/1">The Government are pursuing amendments to the Freedom of Information Act in the Protection of Freedoms Bill. The amendments will place a new requirement on public authorities to make datasets available for re-use, where reasonably practicable, in a re-usable format when releasing them in response to requests or through publication schemes. These changes to the Freedom of Information Act support the Government's commitment to deliver an enhanced right to data.</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.3/2">The Cabinet Office's consultation &#8220;Making Open Data Real&#8221; which closed last month, sought views on how the Government can further enhance the right to data to increase transparency for a wider range of bodies than those covered by the Freedom of Information Act and other legislation. Cabinet Office is analyzing the responses received over the coming weeks to inform the forthcoming White Paper due early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.457W.3/3">The Freedom of Information Act will also be subject to post-legislative scrutiny to see how it is working in practice. Further policy in this area will be developed in light of the evidence drawn from both sets of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.5/2">These measures include making greater use of the &#8220;open&#8221; procedure to avoid excluding suppliers unnecessarily; seeking to removing pre-qualification questionnaires from contracts below the &#163;100,000 threshold for goods and services; greater transparency, for example through &#8216;Contracts Finder&#8217; to make opportunities easier to find (which is obviously beneficial to smaller local businesses that may have fewer resources to devote to looking for opportunities); simplifying the public procurement process; making more use of outcome-based specifications; breaking procurements into smaller lots; greater use of pre-market engagement; and encouraging different contracting models, such as consortia.</p>

The first stage of the review was carried out internally and considered the existing evidence on the overall effectiveness of the enforcement architecture. It found significant fragmentation within the enforcement landscape as a whole, largely as a consequence of the underpinning regulations. Therefore, it has been essential for us to first consider the regulations as part of the Red Tape Challenge Spotlight on Employment Law, before beginning to develop proposals further.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.2/2">The Spotlight on Employment Law launched on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-03">3 October 2012</phrase> and has involved systematic consultation of businesses, unions and civil society. These groups were also invited to respond to a discussion paper on employment law strategy which accompanied the challenge and included discussion points on the enforcement arrangements. We received a number of considered responses from businesses, unions and some members of the public to this paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.2/3">Following the outcomes of the Red Tape Challenge, we plan to make further announcements of the Workplace Rights Compliance and Enforcement Review in spring 2012. There will be a full consultation on any recommendations that emerge from the review.</p>

The fund will be allocated as unringfenced grants and therefore, recipients will have the flexibility to allocate in line with local priorities. Local enterprise partnerships will be asked to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire and if they meet the requirements they will qualify for funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.9/2">The numbers and proportions of professors at UK higher education institutions in each cost centre (includes subject areas) who were male and female are shown in the table for the academic years 2008/09 and 2009/10.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.9/3">Due to a change in the definition of the professorial role comparable information for earlier years is not available. From 2008/09 onwards the professor role indicates whether the contract of employment confers the title of professor to the holder, regardless of whether an institution's local grade structure contains a professor grade. Prior to 2008/09 the professor grade included heads of department, professors, former Universities Authoritative Panel scale researchers (grade IV), clinical professors and those recorded as professors on a locally-determined scale. The differences in the definition of professor role and professor grade means that these two categories are not comparable.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-07">7 December 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/2">The coalition Government understand the importance of engaging all people in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and encouraging more people to consider studying these core disciplines and pursuing careers related to STEM. We have a substantial programme of work in place to achieve this aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/3">The Department has asked the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society to jointly develop a diversity programme for the STEM community. This will build on the academies' existing activities and excellent relationships with a diverse mix of institutions, and place a much greater emphasis on challenging the leaderships at all levels to take on responsibility for delivering the change needed to promote equality across all affected groups, including, but not exclusively focused on, gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/4">The Department's work also includes helping all young people to appreciate how studying STEM disciplines, including engineering, leads to a wide choice of rewarding future career opportunities. Our support includes STEMNET and its cohort of 29,000 STEM ambassadors, National Science and Engineering Week, the Big Bang Fair and the National Science and Engineering Competition. We also run a three-yearly Public Attitudes to Science Survey which in 2011 included evidence about young peoples' attitudes to science.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/5">In addition, we have worked with industry to launch 'See Inside Manufacturing': a programme of open days across industry, so that we can show young people who have never stepped inside a factory how exciting it can be. The programme has been piloted by the automotive sector this year, with taster events in June aimed at teachers and careers advisers and again in October involving young people as well. This autumn over 40 automotive companies across the UK opened their doors offering over 100 events to teachers, career advisers, parents and young people all showing the exciting and rewarding careers manufacturing offers. It is likely the programme will be rolled out more widely next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/6">The National Apprenticeship Service identifies 27 current apprenticeship frameworks as having a STEM status. Additional STEM apprenticeship frameworks are being developed at advanced and higher levels, which will give apprentices the qualifications they need to meet the standards required to register for professional technician status.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/7">Overall, women and men are fairly evenly balanced on apprenticeships, although we know that women are under-represented in some traditionally male-dominated sectors. The National Apprenticeship Service is currently funding 16 &#8216;Apprenticeship Diversity&#8217; pilots over the 12 months to March 2012, designed to test out different methods for improving access to apprenticeships for under-represented sections of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/8">The Department works with the Department for Education to ensure that STEM issues affecting young people of all ages, from school to university, are considered in a coherent way. This includes regular joint meetings of Ministers from this Department and the Department for Education with representatives from the STEM community.</p>
	<p pid="a.471W.5/9">In addition, BIS's partners, including the national academies and the research councils, deliver a range of educational outreach activities directly aimed at school-aged students.</p>

	<p pid="a.472W.2/4">HEFCE does not generally have targets in respect of the number of or participation in STEM courses, although targets are set in relation to the numbers of students on undergraduate medical and dental courses and particular conditions of grant apply to some allocations to support provision in strategically important and vulnerable subjects, which includes some STEM subjects.</p>

	<p pid="a.476W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-07">7 November 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/2">The Department has received a range of correspondence that touches on skills in the life sciences sector. The main evidence we have received in this area was as a result of extensive consultation with stakeholders including business organisations and individual companies for the Growth Review, published in March. This highlighted a number of concerns relating to skills shortages in the sector. We have also recently carried out a major consultation that builds on the earlier Growth Review work, and this has reinforced the messages received in the earlier work.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/3">Areas where concerns have been raised include practical skills such as laboratory skills, mathematical and analytical skills, commercialisation skills and skills related to specific disciplines. In order to address these issues, the Growth Review sets out two actions on skills. Firstly, Cogent, the sector skills council for the life sciences industry, is to lead on activities to improve market signalling by bringing companies and educators together to ensure educators provide the skilled individuals the sector needs to grow; and secondly support for the Society of Biology as it rolls out its accreditation scheme for biological sciences degrees, which will signal to students which degrees will provide the skills needed for a career in life sciences. The pilot scheme covers biochemistry and in vivo subjects, and is on track to deliver the first accreditations by March 2012. There are plans to expand the number of courses to be accredited in the following year.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/4">Cogent has since developed an action plan that provides a framework for employers and educators to work together to address the issues identified, supported by a Strategy Board, that sets the strategic direction and a working level Advisory Council. In summary, the plan identifies the following priorities:</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/5">building effective two-way communication between employers, educators and others with an interest in skills;</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/6">tackling specialist skills gaps;</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/7">developing a clear vision of careers for the sector; and</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/8">brokering a laboratory placements scheme for graduates.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/9">Longer term challenges to be addressed by the action plan include:</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/10">developing professional recognition of vocational qualifications;</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.2/11">building management and leadership capability;</p>

However, we have been able to estimate a figure by using data provided by the NHS Information Centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.3/2">Figures collected from schedule 4 (national health service trusts and primary care trusts combined) of the national schedules of reference costs for the financial year 2009-10 (the most recent year for which data has been published) showed that in total &#163;260 million was recorded as spent on cataract procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.484W.5/1">The Department is very aware of the importance of new and innovative medical technologies and the role they can play in delivering the reforms. This is why we already have a number of initiatives in place to improve the relationship with the technology industry and the speed at which technologies are adopted by the national health service. As such, key initiatives will continue to support SMEs so that they can participate fully in the development and manufacture of new technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/2">The Department is committing &#163;10 million to the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) over the next two years. SBRI uses the power of Government procurement to bring innovative solutions to specific public sector needs. It aims to drive innovation by supporting technology based businesses, especially early-stage companies, through the stages of feasibility and prototyping which are typically hard to fund. A broad range of companies are engaged, through open competitions, for ideas that address specific challenges. Selected applicants are then awarded contracts to develop their technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/3">The Department is committed to continuing the NHS Life Sciences Innovation Delivery Board, which was set up to look at ways in which the relationship between the life sciences industries and the NHS can be improved and support rapid adoption of innovative technologies. The Department is also keen for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to continue its role in evaluating medical technologies through the Evaluation Pathway Programme and the Medical Technologies Advisory Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/4">In addition, the Department's Innovative Technology Adoption Procurement Programme is providing a pathway for existing medical technologies to be considered by senior executives in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/5">Furthermore, the National Institute for Health Research Invention for Innovation (i4i) programme supports the development of innovative medical technologies that address existing or emerging health care needs in the NHS. i4i supports collaborative research and development involving at least two partners from industry, academia or the NHS. Small and/or early-stage companies are particularly welcome as applicants. Funding for the programme has increased from &#163;4 million in 2006-07 to &#163;13 million in 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/6">In summary, we are now exploring how the NHS can build processes and structures to support adoption at scale and pace at both a national and local level. As announced in the Plan for Growth, the NHS Chief Executive will report in November, on how the adoption and diffusion of innovations can be accelerated across the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.485W.2/1">Innovation is crucial to delivering a first-class health service, in terms of improving the quality of patient care and its contribution to economic growth. The national health service has an impressive track record of inventions and new ideas, but the adoption and spread of these ideas has been variable. That is why it is important that innovation is supported and encouraged, and why a series of initiatives to help encourage and foster innovation, and particularly the spread of innovation, have been implemented in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.6/1">Decisions regarding renewal of radiotherapy machines are taken locally and need to be assessed against local priorities. It is the responsibility of each individual organisation to ensure that it adopts good asset management and financial planning. However, national teams such as the National Cancer Action Team and NHS Improvement provide support to help providers plan for their equipment needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.6/2">Within the Cancer Peer Review programme, the radiotherapy measures require local organisations to agree an equipment replacement programme with their cancer network. The outcome of the Peer Review programme is shared with commissioners.</p>

This report, entitled &#8216;Allied Health Professionals Workforce Risks and Opportunities&#8217;, was published in June 2011 and a copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/2">The CfWI has also been commissioned by the Department to undertake a piece of work to examine the future demand of non-medical staff and to develop supply strategies to meet this demand. The CfWI will publish its report on the non-medical work force in two stages, the first in December 2011 (which will include radiography) and the second in March 2012. This report will support and inform strategic health authority education commissioning, enabling the Department and strategic health authorities to understand non-medical demand and supply in greater depth, and thereby improve their work force planning strategies.</p>
