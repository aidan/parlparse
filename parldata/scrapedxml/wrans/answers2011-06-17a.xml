	<p pid="a.968W.5/2">Government believe that it is important that the public sector sets a strong example. So central Government Departments now aim to pay 80% of undisputed invoices within five days.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-06-17a.58870.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-06-17a.969W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="969W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110617/text/110617w0001.htm#11061741001450">
	<p pid="a.969W.2/1">Businesses in the same sector and often of similar sizes are normally subject to the same baseline standards of regulation regardless of the risk they might pose. This is because most regulatory requirements are of general application, which means that they apply to their addressees equally. This is necessary to ensure consistency and a level-playing field across the regulatory landscape.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/2">However, while similar businesses may be required to meet the same levels of regulation, the enforcement of the regulation may, and should, be varied according to risk. The Regulators' Compliance Code (issued under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006) gives statutory effect to these principles. The Code requires regulators to ensure that all aspects of their regulatory activity are informed by risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/3">The Government agrees that legislation and enforcement should reflect levels of risk and how well these are controlled. To that end, we have commissioned an independent review of health and safety legislation, led by Professor Lofstedt. We plan to reform Britain's health and safety system and ensure we reduce unnecessary burdens on business while maintaining standards of protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/4">The following support the drive to reduce burdens:</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/5">In March 2010, the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" name="Chris Grayling">the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase>, announced that leading risk management specialist Professor Ragnar E Lofstedt would chair a review of all health and safety regulation, with a view to simplifying the rules and easing the unnecessary burdens on business. The review is due to report in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/6">We continue to simplify legislation and provide better targeted guidance for businesses so that they do not waste time on unnecessary bureaucracy. Example risk assessments for low risk workplaces are published on the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/7"><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/casestudies/index.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/casestudies/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/8">and HSE has just completed its public consultation on amending the law to reduce the number of 'lost-time' accident reports businesses need to make&#8212;see the following website:</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/9"><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2011/hse-riddor.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2011/hse-riddor.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/10">Inspection and investigation activities are targeted at those who create the most serious risks. HSE has no plans to proactively inspect low risk workplaces which would be counter to the principles of proportionate enforcement&#8212;see HSE's Enforcement Policy Statement at the following website:</p>

	<p pid="a.972W.0/1">We recognise the vital role that the UK steel pipe industry plays in the supply chain in the UK, supplying steel to a range of key industries which underpin many parts of manufacturing. High technology industries like oil, gas and chemicals require high value continually improving steel pipe products.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.0/2">We work closely with the steel industry, including the steel pipe sector, to minimise unnecessary regulatory burdens by involving the sector in discussions on regulatory policy and other issues that impact on them, for example on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, energy costs and supply, climate change and environmental protection. Our aim is to avoid unintended consequences and harness the sector's many creative ideas for alternative, lighter touch approaches.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.0/3">Any Government support for the steel pipe industry needs to meet the requirements in the EC state aid rules which only permit support for research and Development (R and D), environmental protection and training within specified limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.0/4">For example, the steel pipe industry has opportunities to participate in collaborative R and D projects funded by the Technology Strategy Board and the EU Research Fund for Coal and Steel.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.0/5">In addition, UK Trade and Investment has an ongoing and active programme of support for the UK manufacturing sector, including the steel industry, in partnership with numerous stakeholders. This includes organising UK groups at overseas trade shows, leading targeted trade missions and bringing potential buyers and decision-makers to the UK to see our manufacturing capability first-hand.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.11/1">As set out Waste Review the Government will be working with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, and to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.11/2">The Government understand that the public have a reasonable expectation that household waste collections services should be weekly, particularly for smelly waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.11/3">Waste services are a matter for local authorities to develop fit for purpose local solutions. However the Government believe that better procurement and joint working can improve the efficiency of collections while improving the frontline service for the public in an affordable and practical manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.11/4">My Department has already moved to remove Audit Commission guidance and inspections which marked down councils who do not adopt fortnightly rubbish collections; and to abolish local area agreements imposed by Whitehall which created perverse incentives to downgrade waste collection services.</p>

However, the Fairness provisions of Ofcom's Broadcasting Code contain practices that broadcasters should follow when dealing with individuals or organisations participating in or otherwise directly affected by programmes as broadcast.

	<p pid="a.986W.0/1">The Government supports the architectural heritage of ecclesiastical buildings in Peterborough and the East of England in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.0/2">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport operates the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme which makes a contribution towards the VAT incurred in making repairs to the listed places of worship of any faith or denomination.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.0/3">In partnership with the Church Commissioners, the Department funds the Churches Conservation Trust (CCT) which cares for the most significant Church of England churches no longer needed for regular worship. In the 2010-11 financial year, CCT spent &#163;97,000 on repairing and maintaining its churches in the Diocese of Peterborough and &#163;500,000 in total on churches in East Anglia.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.0/4">The running and maintenance of relevant English Heritage and Heritage Lottery Fund schemes are their responsibility. I have therefore asked their chief executives to consider the question raised by the hon. Member for Peterborough and to write to him direct. Copies of their replies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.987W.3/1">The Government strongly supported the introduction of Article 23a into the revised Universal Services Directive, and its clarification of powers for National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to specify, where appropriate, requirements to be met by undertakings providing electronic networks and services in relation to equivalence in access and choice for disabled end-users. To implement these revisions the Government have affected changes to the Communications Act 2003 that enable Ofcom to specify, where appropriate, requirements to be met by undertakings providing publicly available electronic communication services.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.3/2">Separately, and in line with their responsibilities to further the interests of citizens and consumers, Ofcom, the independent telecoms regulator, is currently undertaking a review of relay service provision in the UK. The objectives of this review are to assess whether current arrangements are adequate in delivering equivalence to voice telephony for hearing (including BSL users) and speech impaired end-users. This review will look at, among other things, the existing text relay service and additional relay services including video relay and captioned telephony. It will also include a cost benefit analysis of the different potential options. The Government believe this is an appropriate and sensible way forward. However, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome of that review or attempt to influence its conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="a.992W.2/1">The July 2010 Ofsted report on personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education found that teaching was good or outstanding in over three quarters of the schools visited. It did not identify the teaching of emergency life support as an area of weakness.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.2/2">The national PSHE framework currently includes teaching primary school pupils about basic emergency procedures and where to get help. The Ofsted report uses the Heartstart course in one primary school as a case study of effective practice. The course has been developed from the British Heart Foundation's Heartstart Programme and teaches young people the skills needed in a life threatening emergency which include making a 999 call, placing someone in the recovery position, or performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.2/3">At secondary level, pupils are currently taught to develop the skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic first aid procedures, including, at ages 15-16, resuscitation techniques. Ofsted inspectors commented on one school that had responded to views expressed in a school survey and introduced a first aid course for all pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.2/4">This assessment demonstrates that schools are well placed to take decisions about how best to teach pupils about important life skills, including the teaching of emergency life support.</p>

	<p pid="a.993W.8/1">SMEs will play a significant part in the delivery of the Green Deal. If the Green Deal is to serve homeowners and businesses well, it is essential that there is a competitive market for all aspects of Green Deal delivery&#8212;as Green Deal providers, assessors, installers or product suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.8/2">As such, we are designing the Green Deal framework to place the minimum administrative burdens on organisations as possible, while ensuring the necessary consumer protections are in place. For example, where possible we will build on existing accreditation schemes and improve established assessment methodologies that are already understood by industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.8/3">This is an opportunity for SMEs as much as for large installers and each will need to find their unique selling point. Provided SMEs meet the required standards, they will be able to compete in this growing market.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.8/4">We also wish to ensure Green Deal providers who are able to deliver cost-effectively have access to funding through the new Energy Company Obligation (ECO). This will enable all providers who reach the accreditation standards to compete fairly with energy companies' energy services arms. To this end, we are designing the ECO to operate as simply as possible so as not to inadvertently block the emergence of a diverse and dynamic market.</p>

	<p pid="a.994W.2/1">DECC's assessment of the impact of energy and climate change policies on gas and electricity prices and bills was published alongside the Annual Energy Statement (AES) in July 2010. The headline messages were that energy and climate change policies were:</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/2">Adding 6% to the average gas price and 20% to the average electricity price paid by medium-sized non-domestic users<sup>(1)</sup> in 2010, rising to 24% and 43%, respectively, in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/3">Adding 5% to the average gas bill and 19% to the average electricity bill and 14% to the average energy (gas plus electricity) bill paid by medium-sized non-domestic users in 2010, rising to 20%, 29% and 26%, respectively, in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/4">The above impacts are consistent with a wholesale gas price of around 70p/therm in 2020.<sup>(2 )</sup>Under a higher gas price scenario, the impact of the same policies on bills is estimated to be lower. For example, at a gas price of around 120p/therm in 2020, the impact of these policies is estimated to be 13% (instead of 26%) on the average energy bill faced by these users, compared to a bill in 2020 in the absence of these policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/5">The largest component of energy bills is wholesale energy costs&#8212;based primarily on the price of natural gas. Reducing our dependence on fossil fuels will help reduce the exposure that energy consumers have to volatile movements in international fossil fuel prices, as well as making our energy supplies more secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/6">The above estimates do not include the subsequent announcements that the Renewable Heat Incentive and Carbon Capture and Storage demos would be funded through general taxation rather than a levy on gas and electricity prices, the introduction of a Carbon Price Floor, or the potential impacts of the Government's Electricity Market Reform proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/7">An updated assessment, including these announced policy changes, will be published alongside the next AES and will include an assessment of the impacts of energy and climate change policies on gas and electricity prices and bills paid by illustrative large energy intensive industrial users.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/8">In terms of other effects, energy and climate change policies are also helping UK businesses to become more energy efficient, to invest in low carbon innovation and to compete in the growing international market for low carbon products.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/9"><sup>(1)</sup> Non-domestic energy consumers include industry, transport, public administration, commercial and agriculture. A medium-sized gas user is defined by an annual consumption of between 2,228MWh and 27,777MWh of gas. A medium-sized electricity user is defined by an annual consumption of between 2,000 and 19,999MWh of electricity (both based on Eurostat definitions). The midpoints of these ranges were used for our analysis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001W.3/2">The former Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)</phrase> and Ministers were first informed of the novel MRSA strain that had been identified by the university of Cambridge on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-24">24 September 2009</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-01">1 June 2011</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40391" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman)</phrase>, was notified of the impending publication of the university of Cambridge's paper on this novel MRSA strain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.3/3">As a result of the university of Cambridge notifying the Department of the identification of this novel strain in 2009, DEFRA, including its Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), alerted colleagues from the Department of Health, the Health Protection Agency and the Food Standards Agency about the initial findings. As a result of the consequent discussions, DEFRA commissioned the university to undertake some further work to enhance understanding of the origin and the significance of this new finding. Included within this additional work was the investigation of some cattle <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> isolates that the VLA had retained as an archive after a research project into mastitis (inflammation of the udder) in cattle. None of these isolates were identified as MRSA by the VLA using normal testing protocols, although a few showed some resistance to the antibiotics commonly used to identify MRSA. These isolates identified by VLA as having a degree of resistance underwent further examination during this additional research and some were shown to be similar to the strain identified by Cambridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.3/4">Now that this research has been completed, DEFRA will continue to collaborate with public health bodies that are all represented at the DEFRA Antimicrobial Resistance Coordination (DARC) group. A sub-group specifically on MRSA will also continue to monitor all new developments relating to all types of MRSA and will advise on potential policy options accordingly. Further research projects will be commissioned on antimicrobial resistance. Their scope will continue to be prioritised, and this will be informed by the DARC group, which assesses risk to help target funding to where it is most needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.3/5">The Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency will continue to test clinical samples from cows with mastitis (and other diagnostic submissions from cows and other farmed species) and so monitor such material for the presence of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and whether such isolates demonstrate resistance to antibiotics. The VMD is responsible for authorising all veterinary antimicrobial products and monitors the overall volume of sales and any suspected adverse reactions (including being notified about suspected failures in effectiveness, which may be an indication of the development of antimicrobial resistance).</p>

As set out in the Government's response to the NHS Future Forum report, the intention is to create a new duty for clinical commissioning groups to promote integrated services for patients and to strengthen the duty on the NHS CB. The NHS CB will promote innovative ways of demonstrating how care can be made more integrated for patients.</p>

Support from the Department for International Development's (DRD's) regional programme is helping build evidence on the potential effects of climate change for Caribbean countries. For example, we have funded detailed studies of climate change on tourism investments. We plan to help 228,000 people in vulnerable communities build their resilience by making their homes safer and stronger and will support introduction of hazard insurance products for small scale farmers and businesses in the region. We will invest in efforts to develop low carbon energy and the protection of marine habitats and livelihoods of fishermen/women most at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.1016W.8/1">The Ministry of Justice does not issue any central guidance to those appointed as lay advisers. However, in his guidance to the MAPPA responsible authorities issued under section 325 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the Secretary of State provides guidance on the nature and responsibility of lay advisers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.8/2">In addition, the responsible authority in each MAPPA area is required to provide an induction programme consisting of relevant reading material, a range of visits to criminal justice premises including a prison, a police station and a probation office, and attendance at meetings. The responsible authority must also nominate a person to provide continuing support and guidance during their time as lay advisers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1017W.8/1">Both the Green Paper &#8220;Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders&#8221; and the recently published offender learning review &#8220;Making Prison Work: Skills for Rehabilitation&#8221; place skills and employment at the heart of rehabilitation.

	<p pid="a.1017W.8/2">To ensure dialogue between Government and employers, a number of business leaders have been brought together to lead the Employer Forum for Reducing Re-Offending, acting as advisers, champions and advocates to other employers regarding supporting offenders to obtain employment. The forum is driven by a leadership team chaired by James Timpson OBE, Chief Executive of Timpson Ltd and comprises membership of 14 other companies including Marks and Spencer, DHL, Mitie Group, Greggs, Cisco Systems, Transport for London, Sodexho, Bovis Lend Lease, SERCO and Compass Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.8/3">Within the wider forum of employers, there are many other private sector organisations currently supporting skills training in both custody and community including National Grid and its extensive supply chain of companies, Sainsbury's, Enterprise plc and Tesco. There are many other examples of successful partnerships across NOMS, whether employers are recruiting offenders directly from prison, running a prison workshop, providing work placements or helping shape policy and practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1027W.2/2">The Welsh Government received a fair settlement in both the comprehensive spending review and the Budget. The reduction in the Welsh Government's budget is smaller than the UK average and the Budget, despite being fiscally neutral, allocated an additional &#163;65 million to the Welsh Government.</p>
