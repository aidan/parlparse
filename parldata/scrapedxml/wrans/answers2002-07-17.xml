	<p pid=".275W.6/1">The Junior Staff Officers' Course (JSOC) (Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)) project is a joint initiative between the United Kingdom and The Netherlands, together with the Slovak Republic as the host nation. Its purpose is to set up a Regional Training Centre in Central and Eastern Europe similar to the UK initiatives at Vyskov in Czech Republic and Bucharest in Romania. The division of costs, less personnel related funding, is UK 75 per cent. and The Netherlands 25 per cent. The Netherlands will provide and fund 25 per cent. of the personnel. The Slovak Republic will provide the infrastructure, food and accommodation and some locally employed staff.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.6/2">The aim of the JSOC is to provide command and staff training in English, based upon British/NATO Defence Doctrine, for Senior Lieutenants, Captains and Majors from the Partnership for Peace partners. This will enable them to participate effectively within a multinational environment in training, exercises, military operations and 'operations other than war' (OOTW) operations. OOTW includes Peace Support, Humanitarian and Natural Disaster operations.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.6/3">It is intended to run three courses per annum, each for up to 60 students, of approximately 12 weeks' duration. It is intended to begin the first course in late April or early May 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.6/4">The JSOC project is an initiative within the Outreach Programme, part of the Defence Diplomacy Mission. This programme of bilateral and multilateral defence co-operation in CEE contributes to international stability by assisting countries in the region to establish democratically accountable, cost effective armed formes capable of contributing both to national and regional security and, increasingly, to international security through participation in peach support operations.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.6/5">The UK funding for this project will come from the Global Conflict Prevention Fund (GCPF)(GEE Strategy). The estimated cost to the UK in the Financial Year 2002&ndash;2003, including personnel, is &pound;1.2 million as setting up costs. Running costs in subsequent years are estimated to be &pound;1.3-&pound;1.4 million.</p>

	<p pid=".277W.9/1">A review of armed forces personnel processes is to be carried out this year. Preliminary work (Phase 1) has defined the scope of the study and identified the processes concerned. The aim of the review os to ensure that the outcome of the processes (providing the armed forces with the right number of people with the right skills in the right place at the right time) is achieved effectively and as efficiently as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".277W.9/2">The review will proceed in two further phases, under the sponsorship of the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel). Phase 2 will identify management, organisational, and structural options for improving the delivery of the personnel process outputs. The examination will include the business planning and performance management framework within which these processes operate. The sponsor expects to receive the report early in 2003. Phase 3, to be completed in mid-2003, will develop more detailed proposals for improvements in future performance and service delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".277W.9/3">This process-based review, whose approach is supported by the Treasury and Cabinet Office, will replace planned quinquennial reviews of the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency (NRTA), the Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA), and the RAF's Training Group Defence Agency (TGDA). Although the future of these agencies will be considered in detail, the review will focus on end-to-end processes, and not primarily on historical agency performance.</p>
	<p pid=".277W.9/4">The review team will conduct wide consultation with representatives of stakeholders. However, the team would be interested to hear the views of other organisations or individuals (including people currently in the armed forces) who would like to make a contribution to the review.

	<p pid=".282W.3/1">An assessment of the likely environmental impact of the project to build new antennas at Akrotiri was undertaken by a firm of consultants in 1997 and its results were reviewed by the company in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".282W.3/2">Last year the British and Cypriot Governments agreed that these environmental impact assessments should be reviewed by an independent panel of international environmental experts. This review was co-ordinated by the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment. The panel found that there were significant deficiencies in the original assessments, when judged against today's best practice standards and that there was not sufficient information on which to base a decision to proceed with the second phase of the project. The Ministry of Defence therefore commissioned further studies to fill the information gaps identified by the panel and to address their criticisms of the approach to mitigating the potential environmental impact. The panel confirmed in May that this additional work satisfactorily addressed the deficiencies in the original assessments.</p>

As part of this dispersal activity it is planned to work together with customers and stakeholders to ensure that the resultant distribution of munitions stock more readily lines up with the required outload points for the munitions themselves. Once this re-positioning is completed, the overall planning assumption is that there would be no increase in the volume of munitions carried by road or rail. Likewise there would be no increase in the length in transportation time for the munitions stockpile as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".291W.5/1">HIV/AIDS is both a contributor to and a likely consequence of current food shortages in Southern Africa. The burden of disease has contributed to families' inability to grow enough food or earn the money to buy it; and shortage of food is leading women to trade sex for survival, to family separations and to reduced access to medical care. In assessing vulnerability NGOs and international organisations through whom we are working are taking account of the need to provide AIDS-affected families with appropriate rations and to design delivery mechanisms which will reach them; and to prevent widespread hunger leading to large scale population movement.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.5/2">We have made no specific assessment of the contribution of lack of access to water and sanitation to the current crisis, but expect needs in this sector to figure in forthcoming UN appeals.</p>

	<p pid=".291W.8/1">At the national and regional level reservoirs provide security against inter and intra annual variations in rainfall. At the local and household level water storage systems are an important factor to ensure that drinking water does not become contaminated. Our focus in water supply is on sustainable access to safe and affordable drinking water. Storage is an important part of this, and we support initiatives ranging from the work of the World Commission on Dams to rainwater harvesting, and groundwater development. But we also emphasize the importance of other factors that affect sustainability, such as appropriate institutional structures, cost recovery for operation and maintenance, and the involvement of local communities to ensure that services respond to their needs. Last year we provided &pound;30 million for water related programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

We have not made any specific studies of the impact of transportation on access to clean water. But improved transport facilities clearly improve access for construction materials, for spare parts and for maintenance of existing water systems. Intermediate transport, such as improved bicycles, donkey carts and handcarts all contribute to reducing the load carrying drudgery of the poor&mdash;particularly women and children&mdash;releasing time for other livelihood and household activities and to attend school.</p>

	<p pid=".305W.6/2">All farms supplying pigs to the abattoir in question, together with a market and a collecting centre, were traced and inspected by official veterinarians. No disease was found. However, due to deficiencies in the identification of the suspect pig and a number of others in the same batch at the abattoir, inquiries so far have not established which of 17 farms was the farm of origin of the suspect animal. I have met pig industry representatives to discuss the implications of this episode. Investigations continue into what appear to have been serious breaches of identification regulations and prosecutions may follow. This could have had major consequences for the livestock industry should this pig had been proved to be carrying a disease.</p>

	<p pid=".306W.5/2">Introduction of exceptional support measures is dependent on the member state being able to demonstrate that the restrictions due to a disease outbreak have caused severe market distortion. While the impact on those caught up in the control measures was severe, the UK pig market overall did not exhibit clear indications of distortion.</p>
	<p pid=".306W.5/3">The cull sow market was most severely affected by the export restrictions linked to the foot and mouth outbreak, and officials explored the possibility of a market support based solution with the European Commission&mdash;either exceptional market support under the CAP pigmeat regime and/or a cull sow disposal scheme. The Commission were not encouraging on either; although there are precedents for exceptional market support measures in animal disease situations, these have always been restricted to protection/surveillance zones. A scheme restricted in this way was not seen by the pig industry as being of any help to the cull sow market. A nationally funded cull sow disposal scheme was considered by the Commission to be income support; which is prohibited by state aid rules. Therefore no application for such support was made.</p>

	<p pid=".307W.5/1">Following the general election in June 2001, the previously informal Green Ministers Committee was upgraded to a Cabinet Sub-Committee of ENV and it is established practice under exemption two of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information not to disclose information relating to the proceedings of Cabinet Committees.</p>
	<p pid=".307W.5/2">The terms of reference for the Committee include the commitment to improve the performance of all Departments in contributing to sustainable development. DEFRA has been active in this area, for instance the Department's strategy for sustainable development &quot;Foundations for our Future&quot; was published in June 2002. The purpose of this strategy is to initiate change in the way the Department approaches its responsibilities and to ensure better and more sustainable outcomes. The strategy will be supported by a programme of events and activities for all DEFRA's staff over the next few months. These will explore the way in which the Department carries out is business and how each person can contribute to achieving our aim of sustainable development. This will put the spotlight on projects demonstrating best practice.</p>

	<p pid=".308W.5/2">In 1997 the Countryside Agency published research which showed that 72 per cent. of villages had a village hall. The definition has been refined following responses to that research which indicated that some villages have a community hall which is technically not a &quot;village hall&quot; but fulfils largely the same purpose. In November 2001 the Countryside Agency published a report entitled &quot;Rural Services in 2000&quot; which revealed that 85 per cent. of parishes had a village hall or a community hall in 2000. The proportion of parishes with a hall is 32 per cent. for those below 100 population, 77 per cent. for those with between 100 and 300 people, 92 per cent. for those between 300 and 500, 94 per cent. for those between 500 and 1,000, 95 per cent. for those between 1,000 and 2,000, 98 per cent. for those between 2,000 and 5,000, and 96 per cent. for those over 5,000.</p>
	<p pid=".308W.5/3">Village halls can play a vital role in rural communities as multi-purpose community centres and hubs for village life. We are supporting the development of active local communities and parish and town councils in a variety of ways; the village hall as a hub for social activity and service provision fits in well with our policy objectives, and support of village halls and the activities that take place there is available from a range of public sector and other sources.</p>

Some of these have been further considered as part of the recent consultation on the Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review, and others were referred to in the Cabinet Office Emergency Planning Review&mdash;The Future of Emergency Planning in England and Wales. The Agency has also recently commissioned an independent external audit, which should provide a further independent assessment of its effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.9/3">In the White Paper &quot;Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot; we confirmed our intention to amend the agricultural exemption. First, we intend to ensure that the exemption applies to a range of flexible farming arrangements such as share farming, contract farming and machinery rings, which do not currently qualify for the exemption.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.9/4">Second, we intend to ensure that the exemption is properly targeted on agricultural activities. Case law has determined that a body corporate can qualify for the agricultural exemption in respect of ancillary activities such as food processing and packaging operations, provided that the corporate body includes a member who occupies agricultural land. The Government are proposing to amend the legislation so that ancillary premises occupied in connection with agricultural land and buildings can become exempt only where the occupiers of the agricultural land have a controlling share in the body corporate that occupies the ancillary premises. A consultation paper on these proposals was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase>.</p>

The vision, which will take several years to be fully realised, covers travel by all modes&mdash;air, car, train, tram, tube, taxi, bus, coach, ferry, bike and on foot&mdash;plus, importantly, mixtures of these modes.</p>
	<p pid=".327W.5/3">The centrepiece of Transport Direct will be a one-stop internet portal information point for all forms of travel information. In addition to schedules and details of any disruption on the chosen route, travellers will be able to look at maps of the area they are intending to visit. The initial portal service will go on-line during 2003.</p>

There will be further discussion of this at the October ECOFIN.

However, this duty does not apply to unadopted roads as they are not 'relevant land' as specified under section 86 of the Act. The clearance of litter on these roads is therefore the responsibility of the residents on that road.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.8/1">The gas and electricity supply industry is working with the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) and Energywatch on an action plan to address the problem of sales malpractice. Among other things, this will involve the establishment of an industry-wide code of practice. Six companies will also pilot the Electricity Association's EnergySure scheme, which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-15">15 July</phrase>. This will ensure that all agents are trained to an agreed, externally monitored standard. It will specifically require that sales agents understand the range of general and specific regulations that protect energy consumers.</p>

	<p pid=".348W.0/1">The treatment of erroneous transfers is governed by the Erroneous Transfer Customer Charter, which was developed by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) and Energywatch. The charter, which is intended to improve co-operation between suppliers with a view to resolving problems quickly, with minimal involvement on the consumer's part, was agreed by the industry last year and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase>. OFGEM will review the industry's performance against the charter in October 2002, and has made clear that, if the industry's performance against the charter is inadequate, it will consider the modification of standard licence conditions or the introduction of guaranteed standards of performance, which carry an automatic right to compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".348W.0/2">Where erroneous transfers arise from mis-selling, the mis-selling may be dealt with under the appropriate consumer legislation or under condition 48 of the gas and electricity supply licence&mdash;the marketing licence condition. OFGEM may take a wide range of action in respect of breaches of licence conditions, including levying financial penalties.</p>

However in general we welcome the Commission's determination to tackle state aid which illegally distorts competitive markets. The decision will have no impact on our proposed funding for the post office network and mails business as this will be dictated solely by the need to ensure that the company continues to perform its vital social and economic role in a context of growing competition in postal services. Such objectives are legitimate in state aids terms and we will ensure that any aid or investment we provide will be fully compatible with the European rules.</p>

It will also confirm the scope to consider relevant elements of a company's environmental management systems in selecting tenderers, and to take account of whole life cost and quality issues, such as energy and disposal savings which benefit the contracting authority, at the award stage. This is all very much in line with UK objectives. Discussions are continuing on parallel proposals to amend the utilities directive, where it is expected that the scope to take account of environmental issues, under this directive, will be very similar to that for the public sector. It is not yet clear whether procurement will be a matter for the September Internal Market Council.</p>

In particular, the Government have focused on encouraging the Commission to draw on the report as a solid basis for its Action Plan to improve and simplify the European regulatory environment, called for at the Lisbon European Council (March 2000). In January 2002 the Government issued a formal response to a Commission Communication on this issue, reiterating the need for the rapid implementation of the Mandelkern Report and informing the Commission of the action we are taking at the national level in line with the Report's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".361W.2/3">For its part the Commission has responded by including the majority of the Mandelkern recommendations in its Action Plan, presented to the Seville European Council in June. The Government welcomes the Action Plan which sets out a clear strategy for better regulation at the European level and contains 16 specific measures with defined deadlines for implementation.

	<p pid=".362W.2/2">Our plans for the modernisation of the alcohol and entertainment licensing regimes were set out clearly in the White Paper &quot;Time for Reform&quot; (Cm.4696) published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-10">10 April 2000</phrase>. Alcohol and public entertainment licensing will be integrated into a single scheme. This will remove at a stroke a considerable amount of existing red tape and reduce licensing costs. Our estimate is that the existing costs of the licensing regimes to industry of around &pound;4&ndash;5 billion over ten years would be reduced by &pound;1.9 billion under the new regime. The reforms will be implemented by means of primary legislation to be brought forward as soon as parliamentary time permits.</p>

Neither do we actively encourage recruitment by others from developing countries. But suitable teachers choosing to come and work in England for a time are welcome. Some are likely to return to their home countries, taking with them valuable experience of initiatives such as the numeracy and literacy strategies. We are committed to making the experience of those overseas teachers who do choose to work here as productive and developmental as possible, not least to maximise the benefits to their home countries. We have introduced a Quality Mark scheme, which will badge agencies that demonstrate, among other things, good practice in the recruitment and induction of overseas teachers. And we have established a new Recruitment and Retention Unit in the Government office for London which will support London LEAs in improving the experience of overseas-trained teachers.</p>

Our records indicate that for the Home Department the number of staff with a medical retirement certificate issued by the Civil Service pension scheme medical adviser for the period <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>&ndash; <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase> was 505. Benefits provided on medical retirement are set out in the rules of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme and laid before Parliament, and provide for an immediate payment of enhanced pension and lump sum. Ill health retirement expenditure is met centrally from the Civil Superannuation Vote. For the year ending March 2002, provisional expenditure met from the vote was &pound;310 million in respect of all Civil Service cases for which an ill health pension has been awarded. These cases number approximately 67,000 and include those who have formally been ill health retired but who have now reached and exceeded the normal retirement age.</p>

	<p pid=".394W.8/1">The Government are taking forward a number of initiatives to ensure security of information when purchasing goods on the internet. Last year the Government, working closely with stakeholders, launched their Safe Internet Shopping Campaign to help explain how consumers can shop on-line with confidence. This included guidance on safe payment and data protection, together with directions to the Government's Consumer Gateway (<a href="http://www.consumer.gov.uk">www.consumer.gov.uk</a>) which provides links to sources of detailed information.

	<p pid=".394W.8/2">The use of personal information on the internet is regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, which sets rules for the handling of data about living, identifiable individuals throughout the United Kingdom. Among other things, these require personal data to be held securely. The Act is administered independently of the Government by the Information Commissioner, who has the power to take enforcement action if any of the Act's requirements is breached.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.2/2">The work permit arrangements are designed to strike the right balance between enabling employers to recruit or transfer skilled people from abroad while safeguarding the interests of the resident labour force. The arrangements are labour market led.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/3">Before a work permit can be issued the employer will normally be expected to demonstrate by advertising the post that there is no suitably qualified resident workers. However, this requirement is waived where the vacancy is in respect of an occupation included on Work Permits (UK) shortage occupation list. Such applications will nevertheless need to meet the other criteria of the work permit arrangements as to the skills, qualifications and experience of the employee and the terms and conditions of employment.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/4">If Work Permits (UK) has any doubts about the validity of the information provided on the application form, they can request further evidence, such as a job description, copies of qualifications and references from previous employers to assess whether the overseas worker has the necessary qualifications and skills.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/5">In order to maintain the accuracy of the shortage occupation list, Work Permits (UK) has established a number of industry sector panels. The panels, including one for the Information Technology, Communications and Electronics (ITCE) sector, meet on a quarterly basis to review changes in the labour market and make recommendations on the occupations that should form the shortage list. Members of the ITCE sector panels include other Government Departments, trade unions, relevant industrial bodies and independent representative organisations such as the Professional Contractors Group (PCG).</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/6">Work Permits (UK) is also developing arrangements to ensure that the work permit arrangements are not abused once the work permit has been granted. In addition to the existing Allegations Team, Work Permits (UK) is setting up a new Intelligence Team, which is expected to be operational by autumn. This team will facilitate links with the Immigration Service, the police and other interested bodies and allow a more thorough and coherent investigation of allegations. Additionally, a Post Issuing Checking (PIC) team, which will take a pro-active role in targeting sectors and visiting employers, overseas nationals or representatives who Work Permits (UK) suspect are not abiding by the scheme criteria.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.8/1">There are no estimates of the value of the United Kingdom (UK) domestic and international trade in the drugs specified in the question. However, a study by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) produced the following estimates of the value of the market in 1998&ndash;99 for the following specific drugs: amphetamines &pound;257.7 million; cannabis &pound;1,577.9 million; cocaine &pound;352.8 million; crack &pound;1,817.4 million; ecstasy &pound;294.6 million; and heroin &pound;2,313.0 million. These figures should not be regarded as definitive since the purpose of the study &quot;Sizing the UK market for illicit drugs&quot; was to carry out research into different methodologies for assessing the size of illicit drug market. Her Majesty's Customs believe the cocaine (and probably ecstasy) figure from the NERA study is likely to significantly understate the true position by missing much recreational use. This work was in large part derived from the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) and therefore reflects drug users who have come to the attention of the criminal justice system&mdash;which is more likely to be the case with heroin or crack users.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.8/2">A United Nations study published in January 1998 reported that estimates of the turnover of the global illicit drug industry varied considerably from US$100 billion to US$1,000 billion a year, with the most frequently found figures in the literature in the range US$300 billion to US$500 billion a year.</p>

	<p pid=".397W.2/1">Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, para 30.2.5, which notes that Government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where <i>(a)</i> insurance is a condition of a lease <i>(b)</i> the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity <i>(c)</i> incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective that other accommodation options [Government Accounting, para 30.2.11a].</p>
	<p pid=".397W.2/2">The Home Department complies with this policy and with rare exceptions self-insures buildings in which it is the sole occupier. Where part of a building is leased and insurance forms part of the services provided to the building as a whole by the lessor, an element of the service charge payment will relate to the insurance cost, but extracting this element from such charges could only be done at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.2/3">Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts involving accommodation provision an insurance element also forms part of the overall PFI charge. The Department's policy, based on advice from the Office of Government Commerce is that any additional insurance costs following <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> is primarily a matter for the private sector.</p>

	<p pid=".398W.0/2">The Home Department undertakes a wide range of research activities that support the development of information-led policy, including scientific and engineering research, market and opinion research and social research. My Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDS) conducts social research supporting all seven Home Office aims. However, RDS do not collect statistics at parliamentary constituency level for a number of reasons. In particular, many of the statistics collected locally are based on administrative areas, such as local and police authorities, and these do not always share boundaries with parliamentary constituencies.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.0/3">In the past, following each United Kingdom (UK) Parliamentary General Election a House of Commons Paper compiled by RDS was laid before Parliament in the form of a Return to an Address, and similarly, after each European Parliamentary Election a Home Office Statistical Bulletin was published by RDS. Each publication contained statistics of individual candidates' Election Expenses (except for the bulletin covering the 1999 European Parliamentary elections where, because of the voting system used, individual candidates did not have control over their expenses). Both publications also contained details, by UK Parliamentary or European Parliamentary constituency, of rejected ballot papers, postal and proxy votes, and votes polled. The responsibility for compiling and publishing these figures passed on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-01">1 December 2000</phrase> to the Electoral Commission.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.11/2">National road accident statistics do not identify cases where drivers involved in fatal road accidents were under the influence of drugs. There are no estimates of the numbers involved in accidents where drivers had been under the influence of cannabis. Recent research shows that 12 per cent. of those killed in road accidents had traces of cannabis in the body. However, the presence of the drug cannot be taken as evidence of accident causation. In addition, the inactive element of cannabis remains detectable for a long time after any impairing effect.</p>

The Government's policy is to give greater freedom and autonomy to front line managers, including for pay and grading, in order to encourage innovation and improve delivery. A system which included all Civil Servants within national pay scales would be incompatible with this policy.</p>

	<p pid=".408W.0/1">English Heritage's Images of England project is currently taking a single external photograph of each of England's 370,000 listed buildings. The project is grant aided by the Heritage Lottery Fund and began in 1999. Details of all listed buildings are already in the public domain. The photographs are primarily being taken from public land and will be published on the project's website. Where it is not possible to take a photograph from publicly accessible land, the Images of England photographer will seek consent from the owner, and if it is refused, will not take a photograph.</p>

	<p pid=".408W.0/3">The Government are keen to improve access to all publicly available information. We have no plans to ask English Heritage to abandon the scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".408W.3/1">Neither my Department, nor the Home Department which previously had responsibility for alcohol licensing, have commissioned their own research into the ages of the purchasers of alcopops. In formulating policies regarding alcohol Ministers have, however, considered research from a number of sources, including the Department of Health's teenage drinking survey, the British Medical Association's alcohol and young people survey and other work carried out by the Alcohol Education and Research Council.</p>
	<p pid=".408W.3/2">I am pleased to say that the Portman Group's second review of its Code of Practice, on the naming, packaging and merchandising of alcoholic drinks found that &quot;underage appeal&quot; of alcoholic drinks, which was the predominant cause for complaint in the code's first years, has now virtually disappeared as a problem. The Government are not, however, complacent about these issues and the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 strengthened the ability of the police and trading standards officers to use young people to carry out test purchases of alcohol with the aim of ensuring that young people do not obtain alcohol illegally.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.3/1">The Government's position is that the definition of basic care includes the offer of food and fluids. These should always be offered to patients who are capable of swallowing them. Where nutrition and hydration have to be provided by artificial means, their possible withdrawal is, in all cases, a matter of clinical judgment which is undertaken in accordance with professional advice provided by a responsible and recognised body of medical opinion and the general law. The current consultation paper, &quot;Making Decisions: Helping People who have Difficulty Deciding for Themselves&quot;, reflects this position.</p>

	<p pid=".416W.2/2">While other developed countries have broadly similar incidence of cancer, there is evidence to suggest that for many cancers, including colon cancer, survival rates for patients diagnosed a decade ago are lower in this country than in comparable European countries and the United States. Experts in the field suggest that the reason for the lower survival rates is due at least in part to patients in the United Kingdom having more advanced disease at the time of treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/3">That is why, in September 2000, we published the &quot;NHS Cancer Plan&quot; which sets out a programme of action to improve cancer prevention, detection, treatment and research which are intended to bring our survival rates in line with the rest of Europe.</p>

	<p pid=".417W.2/1">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the Agency's Board endorsed a report on bovine spongiform eucephalopathy (BSE) and sheep from a core group of stakeholders at its meeting in Armagh on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June</phrase>. It contained a recommendation that the European Commission be requested to add sheep intestine to the current list of specified risk material for sheep as an additional precautionary measure. The Board agreed the recommendation on the basis that the measure, added to the current controls, could reduce potential infectivity entering the food chain by up to two-thirds if BSE were found in sheep. Current precautionary measures are estimated to reduce risk by approximately one-third.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/2">There is a theoretical risk that BSE exists in the national flock as some consumed the same type of feed that is thought to have infected cattle. A sheep apparently suffering from scrapie could instead be suffering from BSE as it is currently not possible to differentiate between the symptoms of the two diseases. In an Opinion issued in February 2001, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Union stated: 'the agent causing scrapie, the expression of clinical disease in scrapie- affected sheep, cannot currently be distinguished from BSE by any means other than biological strain typing of the agent responsible.' Bioassays in mice take up to two years to complete. It has only been possible to test a small sample of brains from sheep thought to have scrapie to determine whether a BSE-like strain is present.</p>

	<p pid=".418W.5/1">The quality of drinking water is subject to The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 (SI 1147) as amended. This sets a maximum limit for fluoride at 1.5 mg per litre. Therefore, companies making baby food or infant formula using tap water would have less than 1.5 mg per litre for the water component of the feed, plus any other source of fluoride. As the limit for fluoride is the same for Private Water Supplies (The Private Water Supply Regulations 1991 SI 2790), manufacturers using such a supply would not be expected to produce baby food with a different level of fluoride.</p>

	<p pid=".425W.5/1">The Department has not carried out any risk assessment of wood pre-treated with copper/ chromium/arsenic (CCA) wood preservative, nor has the Department received any representation on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.5/2">In the United Kingdom wood preservative products are regulated under the Control of Pesticide Regulations (1986) and the Health and Safety Executive lead on such non-agricultural pesticides. CCA is approved for use in products for pressure impregnation at industrial sites. This follows the advice to Ministers from the independent advisory committee on pesticides that such products do not present any risk to human health or the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.5/3">Recently an expert advisory committee to the European Commission, the scientific committee on toxicity, ecotoxicity and the environment has reviewed the safety of wood treated with this preservative and has concluded that there may be a risk to health of children from the use of such treated timber in playground equipment and also when treated wood is burnt or disposed.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.5/4">The European Commission has drawn up proposals under the Marketing and Use Directive to prohibit the use of CCA wood preservatives but by way of a derogutim to continue to allow its use in a number of essential areas where human contact is limited. Draft proposals are currently being considered by member states.</p>

	<p pid=".426W.5/2">The information is not available in the form requested. In 'The UK Smoking Epidemic: Deaths in 1995' (published by the Health Education Authority, 1998) it was estimated that in the United Kingdom in 1995, smoking caused more than 120,000 deaths of people aged 35 years or more; one in five deaths at all ages. Men of 35 who smoke will, on average, die seven years earlier than men who have never been smokers. Similarly, women of 35 who smoke will, on average, die six years earlier than women who have never been smokers. As well as being the prime cause of cancer and heart disease, smoking also causes other fatal conditions and chronic illnesses among adults.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/3">In 'Smoking Kills' published in 1998, the Government set out a comprehensive programme to tackle smoking. A key element of this programme has been the development of smoking cessation services which were launched in the health action zones in 1999&ndash;2000, and were rolled out to all health authorities in England in 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/4">Regional prevalence data shows how the burden of smoking has varied over the past five years. Table 1 shows a regional breakdown of the prevalence of smokers among adults aged 16 and over. Table 2 details by region the number of people who had successfully quit at the four week follow-up and rates per 100,000 population for April to December 2001. Table 3 illustrates the regional variations in coronary heart disease. Table 4 illustrates the regional variation in cancer mortality.</p>

	<p pid=".428W.5/2">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that as the risk of BSE in sheep is theoretical, there is no quantitative assessment of the risk of consuming sheepmeat. Current precautionary controls require the removal as specified risk material of the spleen from all animals and the skull (including brain and eyes), spinal cord and tonsils of sheep over one-year-old. A report on BSE and sheep compiled by a group of stakeholders was endorsed by the Board of the FSA on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-13">13 June 2002</phrase>. The assessments taken into account in this report indicate that animals over one year would represent a higher risk, if BSE were present. Removal of lamb brain from younger animals was assessed to have a minimal impact on increasing the level of risk reduction compared with the current requirement to remove brains from sheep over one-year-old.</p>

Following recent reports that antibiotic residues have been found in natural sausage casings from China and hence might pose a risk to consumers, a European Commission Decision has been implemented whereby 20 per cent. of all consignments of casing from China are required to be sampled and tested for a range of chemical residues including antibiotics. No other countries have been implicated to date.</p>

The results of this survey were made public in December 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".430W.6/2">The monitoring and enforcement of labelling of all foods, including imported frozen chicken breasts, is the responsibility of local authorities. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has also carried out two surveys on the accuracy of labelling of frozen chicken breast, one in 2000 on retail samples and a further joint survey with 22 local authorities of frozen chicken breast destined for the catering sector in 2001. Both surveys have been published on the FSA's website.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.6/3">As a result of these surveys and subsequent work undertaken by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the European Union Commission has asked the Dutch authorities to take action to ensure correct labelling of chicken exported to other member states.</p>

	<p pid=".430W.9/2">As a result of the Food Standards Agency's survey and subsequent work by the Food Safety Authority-Ireland, the agency has approached the authorities of the exporting countries to ensure correct labelling of these products. The agency is working with local authorities to follow up survey findings and take prosecutions where appropriate. The issue has also been raised with other member states, and the European Commission have agreed to take action against the Dutch authorities if they do not ensure correct labelling of frozen chicken breast exported to member states.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.9/3">All bovine material entering the food chain is subject to European Union-wide BSE controls. Therefore, provided these controls have been applied, any traces of beef that may be in any other products would not raise new food safety concerns.</p>

Arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Defence to ensure resources are made available to reflect this transfer.

The Department has provided capital funding of &pound;725,000 this year to support the development. Last year &pound;40,000 was made available for project management costs. The centre will move to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham on completion of the private finance initiative re-development. This is scheduled to take place in 2007 and cost associated with the transfer cannot be estimated at this time.</p>
