	<p pid="a.1034W.2/1">Current levels of digital terrestrial coverage are not indicative of the situation post-switchover. Coverage is, at present, limited to only nine of the 200 transmitters in Wales to prevent interference being caused to viewers of analogue television services. At the time of switchover, these restrictions can be removed and the power and coverage of digital services will increase to match that currently achieved by analogue. Planning for switchover is making provision for all of the existing transmitters to broadcast digital services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/2">We are committed to achieving digital switchover between 2008 and 2012 ensuring universal access to high quality digital television through a mix of terrestrial, cable and satellite services.

	<p pid="a.1041W.8/1">In common with other transport infrastructure such as stations and ports, airports are covered by Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) which covers access to goods, facilities and services. The Disability Rights Commission has produced a code of practice for service providers on meeting the Part 3 duties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1041W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;any service insofar as it consists of the use of any means of transport&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1041W.8/4">which means that the element of the service involving air travel is not covered. We have, however, amended that exemption under Section 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 to make clear that it applies only to services involving the provision and use of a vehicle (including an aircraft) and to allow for it to be lifted to different extents, for different services at different times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041W.8/5">We have said that we would use the new power in respect of air services if the voluntary code of practice which we issued in March 2003 proves to be ineffective. That code, &quot;Access to Air Travel for Disabled People&mdash;Code of Practice&quot;, was developed in close co-operation with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (the Government's statutory advisers on transport and mobility for disabled people) and industry representatives. It draws on internationally agreed best practice from the European Civil Aviation Conference and the International Civil Aviation Organisation and includes specific advice on all aspects of air travel, from accessing information through to on board services and disembarkation at the final destination.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041W.8/6">Research is currently under way to monitor the sector's compliance with the code's recommendations. The study is due to report around the end of this year and will inform our decision on whether to use the provisions in the 2005 Act to bring air services within the scope of Part 3.</p>

It has caused significant cumulative delays to the Department's assessment of the proposals as we have had to consider carefully the consequences of all the requested changes. We also had to give other interested parties the opportunity to comment on the changes, in the interests of natural justice. On the basis of the information we now have available, we hope to announce a decision shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047W.3/1">The Department has a PSA target for at least 28 per cent. of young people to start an Apprenticeship for the first time by age 22 by 2004. Measurement of the target will be based on starts in the 2004/05 academic year. At the end of 2003/04, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) met its milestone of 24.5 per cent. However, since then, starts have fallen behind profile. The LSC have therefore put in place a range of measures to address this shortfall although it is too early to assess their impact. The target outturn will be reported by December 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047W.6/1">Data on bullying are not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate of prevalence. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often, now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.6/2">However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack 'Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence', the anti-bullying charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. We also offer specific advice to schools on tackling homophobic bullying and are developing advice on racist bullying.</p>

This is in addition to their commitment that every 16&ndash;18 year old can have a place in post-16 education and training. Changes introduced in 2004/05 were to improve the referral and learner review processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052W.2/2">Some young people are not in a position to be able to benefit from E2E. This may be, for example, because of emotional difficulties and serious substance abuse. These young people receive a range of specialised support and provision, particularly from the voluntary and community sector providers. This type of provision is not formally evaluated, however the aim is to enable them to progress onto E2E.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052W.2/3">The Qualifications Curriculum Authority and the LSC are working to establish an inclusive curriculum offer below level 2. It will draw from units and/or qualifications at entry level and level 1 of the Framework for Achievement and will also recognise and incorporate broader aspects. This is an important development to support, facilitate and direct learners into units and/or qualifications both below and beyond level 2, where E2E is not the best option.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052W.2/4">The local LSC network is working closely with the Connexions Service and the providers it contracts with, to ensure that it has appropriate programmes to enhance the range of choices to engage all young people. The Government announced, in the recent budget, plans to pilot Activity Agreements and an Activity Allowance to help re-engage 16&ndash;17 year olds who have been out of education, employment or training for some time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1053W.5/1">The challenge of reducing the number of surplus places is one that many local authorities currently face. However, the Government believe that planning the supply of school places is best done locally by the local authority. Local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure there are sufficient places and that high quality education is provided in a cost effective way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.5/2">Should proposals be brought forward to close schools, the School Standards and Framework Act (SSFA) 1998 includes a requirement on local authorities to consult locally and publish statutory proposals. If objections are received, local independent school organisation committees will take decisions about school closures. Ministers have no direct involvement in decisions to review provision or reorganise schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.5/3">Consequently, neither the Secretary of State nor members of her ministerial team have entered into discussions with Gloucestershire about their review of primary schools. However, officials are in regular contact with local authority officers and are aware of the steps being taken in Gloucestershire to address the problem of surplus places in the primary sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.1056W.2/1">DFID's central training team covers the Race Relations (RR(Amendment) Act 2000 through its Corporate Induction Courses, Diversity Awareness training, Management Development Courses, and its Reporting Officer Training for Line Managers. All of these courses are mandatory and the vast majority of staff will have attended at least one of them in the last few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/2">In 2003 and 2004, for example, 1,659 spaces were filled on these courses. With a total staff compliment of 2,884, this suggests that up to 57 per cent. of DFID staff may have received training through one of these routes in this period. However, there will be some double counting as individuals might have attended more than one of these courses. Our current systems do not permit this level of analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/3">Other training that covers the Act may be delivered across DFID and overseas. DFID departments do not necessarily report on all training and development activities centrally, so there may be under reporting on the above figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/4">Where we have identified functions that are relevant to the RR(A)AOO, we have trained staff working in these areas on both the general provisions of the Act and their duties under it. For example, our Procurement Department staff receive specific training on the RR(A)AOO, and we have included a reference to our obligations under the RR(A)AOO in our departmental guidance. We are unable to provide precise details of the numbers of staff who have received this training or a breakdown of attendance by ethnicity and grade. However, DFID is fully aware of its obligations under the RR(A)AOO and we are currently in the process of developing a Learning Management System that will enable us to monitor both applicants for, and recipients of, all training courses by ethnicity, grade and other personal characteristics. We aim to have the learning management system in place by the end of 2006 at the latest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/5">However, as an interim measure, we completed a manual data collection exercise of actual training delivered, which was then analysed by ethnicity, for a 10 per cent. sample of randomly selected staff in the organisation. There was no evidence of disparities in attendance rates between ethnic groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.1059W.8/3">Almost 90 per cent. of NOPES funding has now been committed. We anticipate that the remaining funding will be committed by December 2005 with the great majority of new facilities in use by spring 2006, in line with the original timetable.</p>

In addition DCMS have supported the introduction of provisions in the Finance Act 2002 to allow community amateur sports clubs to benefit from a package of tax and rates relief. The scheme's purpose is to enable grass roots sport to grow and develop so that the widest possible range of people can participate in healthy recreation. To date the scheme has brought more than &pound;5 million into grass roots sport, benefiting some 2,500 clubs.</p>

Prior to any planned demonstration both MDP and North Yorkshire police contact the organiser to discuss the event and the policing arrangements. On the day of any demonstration officers consult with the organiser again to emphasise where protestors can demonstrate safely and the areas they need to avoid. An information leaflet is given to all protesters on the day of the event.</p>

HMSO has considered the publication of Acts prior to 1988, which is the earliest date when these were available electronically, but has decided not to do so as many have been heavily amended. To publish them in their original form would be misleading for many users. The Government are, however, taking forward development of a Statute Law Database which will contain the fully revised and updated text of all legislation from 1275. It is expected that this will be made available to the general public during 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is currently engaged in 11 public-private partnerships, of which nine are private finance initiatives. The status of each of these is operational. These are a combination of those let to April 2001 by the former Department for Social Security and the Employment Service, which was an executive agency of the former Department for Education and Employment; and those let subsequently by the DWP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/2">The nine DWP private finance initiatives are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/3" class="indent">1. PRIME (Private Sector Resource Initiative for the Management of the Estate). A 20-year PFI partnership deal competitively awarded by the then Department of Social Security to Trillium (now called Land Securities Trillium) on <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase>. This will provide serviced offices until 2018 in return for payments over the life of the contract estimated at &pound;2.008 billion in net present value. Following the creation of DWP in June 2001 the former Employment Service estate was transferred to Land Securities Trillium from <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase> under an expansion of the PRIME contract. The National Audit Office has carried out an independent scrutiny of this transaction and its report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/4" class="indent">2. A 10-year PFI IT Partnership (ITP) between the Employment Service and EDS for the provision of IT and telephony services awarded in August 1998 and extending to July 2008. So far this has developed and delivered the &quot;Modernising ES&quot; IT initiative, including the set up of Jobpoints, and will continue to provide all ES IT and development of innovations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/5" class="indent">3. A PFI partnership between the Employment Service and Northgate HR (formerly Rebus Human Resources Services) awarded in February 1999 to deliver human resources services, including payroll and personnel administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/6" class="indent">These services will be delivered under this contract until they are incorporated into the new, DWP-wide resource management system currently being developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/7" class="indent">4. A 10-year PFI deal for the Strategic Outsourcing Business Allocation (SOBA) awarded to Affinity consortium (EDS, IBM and PricewaterhouseCoopers) on <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-08">8 August 2000</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.5/13">The Department's private finance initiatives and annual expenditure are all disclosed in the Department's Resource Accounts. This information is recorded in the operating cost statement.

	<p pid="a.1081W.2/1">The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that our current and future work force have access to relevant training to ensure they have the skills required by employers to get into and get on in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081W.2/2">From 1997 to March 2005, 1.22 million young people aged between 18 and 24 have improved their job prospects and raised their skills levels through New Deal for Young People (NDYP), and of these 460,550 have moved into work. NDYP offers four options; a period of full-time education and training, voluntary work with training, participation on an environmental task force which combines training with community focused work experience and a subsided employment option. Skills training is available on all four options.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081W.2/3">From April 2004 we gave New Deal personal advisers the flexibility to individually tailor provision to allow participants to move freely between options. Young people are encouraged to take part in the options by a weekly &quot;top-up&quot; payment of &pound;15.38. Those who refuse to take part in the options period can face benefit sanctions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081W.2/4">Jobcentre Plus Districts are also working with local Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs), through annual joint delivery plans. These ensure that customers without a qualification, or with less than a level 2 qualification, are given the opportunity to access skills training funded by the LSC where that training is needed to gain sustainable, productive employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081W.2/5">There are also opportunities for Jobcentre Plus clients to train in the work environment. Access to training in employment has increased through the successful Employer Training Pilots. The Government's decision to develop these principles through a national Employer Training Programme will further increase these opportunities. The Skills for Business Network also works with the LSC and Jobcentre Plus to increase access to Modern Apprenticeships by disadvantaged young people and adults.</p>

	<p pid="a.1082W.10/1">Women's rights have improved dramatically since the fall of the Taliban and progress continues to be made under the new government. Ensuring that women play a full role in Afghan society remains an important priority for the international community. In many areas ordinary women are now able to work and move about freely in a way that was impossible under the Taliban. The new constitution specifically protects women's rights and reserves a proportion of seats in parliament for women candidates. For last year's presidential elections, over 40 per cent. of those registered to vote were women. 40 per cent. of those who actually voted were women. Presidential candidates included one woman. President Karzai's cabinet includes two women, Dr. Massooda Jalal, Minister of Women's Affairs and Sediqa Balkhi, Minister of Martyrs and Disabled. Habiba Sarabi became Afghanistan's first female Governor (of Bamiyan) earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.10/2">Securing the full participation of women in all sectors of the economy and society will take time.

	<p pid="a.1085W.3/1">In a vote of no confidence at the March 2002 Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons Executive Council, a significant proportion of the Council showed they had lost confidence in Mr. Bustani in his role as director general. Only five of the council's 41 members voted in support of Mr. Bustani. As Mr. Bustani did not resign following this vote, a special conference of states party was held in April 2002 and a subsequent vote supported the earlier results. Mr. Bustani's appointment was accordingly terminated. It was our view that Mr. Bustani should be replaced by someone who enjoyed the full confidence of all the states party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Our policy throughout was guided by our judgment of what was in the best interests of the OPCW and the CWC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.3/2">Mr. Bustani pursued a compensation claim against the OPCW before the International Labour Organisation Administrative Tribunal. The judgment reached by the Tribunal in July 2003 awarded Mr. Bustani damages, including payment for loss of earnings. The OPCW subsequently appealed against the award for loss of earnings and the damages were later reduced. The OPCW duly paid Mr. Bustani the reduced damages in accordance with its legal obligation to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1085W.6/1">We are encouraged that the three-year-old ceasefire between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) remains in place. It is essential that it continues to do so and that both sides desist from activities which could put it in danger. In this context we fully endorse the recent statement by the Tokyo Conference of Co-chairs expressing concern that respect for the ceasefire is being undermined by persistent violence producing a climate of impunity. We call upon the LTTE to end their assassinations and stop their recruitment and use of child soldiers. We also call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to take decisive action to ensure that killings are stopped and paramilitaries are disarmed immediately as required by the ceasefire agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.6/2">The Government are concerned that there have been no direct peace talks since April 2003. We work closely with international partners to encourage all parties to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible. The tragedy of the <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-26">26 December 2004</phrase> tsunami represented an opportunity for all communities in Sri Lanka to work together. The putting in place of a post-tsunami aid coordination mechanism for the North and East should provide a framework for more effective tsunami assistance and help build confidence between the two sides. We welcome the determination shown by the President to achieve the enactment of such a joint mechanism and encourage all sides to implement it rapidly and effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090W.3/1">In 1997 this Government cancelled a previously planned reduction of 300 Customs staff. In 2000 we launched the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling (TTS) strategy which provided HM Revenue and Customs with an extra &pound;209 million to fund almost 1,000 additional officers and a national fleet of x-ray scanners. In 2001, as part of TTS, we introduced Fiscal Marks for tobacco to prevent the sale of smuggled products.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.3/2">This strategy has been successful in first halting the previous rapid growth in cigarette smuggling and then reducing the market share for illicit cigarettes to its current level of an estimated 15 per cent. In the past four years more than nine billion cigarettes have been seized and over 259 gangs involved in large scale smuggling broken up. Furthermore, the total number of cigarettes successfully smuggled into the UK each year has been reduced by over five billion sticks, which represents a reduction of over one third.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.3/3">At Budget 2005 the Government confirmed the strategic approach it is taking to tackle spirits fraud&mdash;through the introduction of regulatory change, including duty stamps for spirits, enhancing operational activity and working closely with the UK industry&mdash;aimed at reducing spirits fraud by half by 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090W.6/1">Responsibility for tackling the importation of counterfeit medicines lies with HM Revenue and Customs using their powers to take enforcement action against goods that breach the import and export prohibitions on counterfeit, pirated or patent infringing intellectual property rights as set out in EC Council Regulation 1383/2003. HMRC has publicised these procedures in Public Notice No. 34 'Intellectual Property Rights', which can be viewed at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/Forms">www.hmrc.gov.uk/Forms</a> leaflets and booklets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.6/2">HMRC targets counterfeit goods at importation using profiles set on its central systems in response to information received from those right holders who have submitted an application to have their rights protected at importation. HMRC detains any suspect consignments and provides the right holder with information that has been declared to HMRC, including details of the goods, importer and manufacturer. HMRC will seize any goods where the right holder confirms in a witness statement that the goods are counterfeit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.6/3">Where HMRC detects a consignment of medicines that they suspect is counterfeit, and there is no application from a right holder in place, HMRC will detain the goods and invite the right holder to lodge an application. If the right holder does so within three working days and subsequently confirms in a witness statement that the goods are counterfeit, HMRC will seize the goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.6/4">In May 2005 officials from HMRC and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency met representatives from the pharmaceutical industry to explain the role of HMRC and agree steps that aim to improve the flow of information to HMRC and thereby enhance the targeting of suspect consignments of counterfeit medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.6/5">HMRC also publicises its role through bodies such as the Anti-counterfeiting Group, at which officials offer advice concerning frontier protection of intellectual property rights to businesses whether they are registered right holders or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.6/6">HMRC are in discussion with the Patent Office and other enforcement agencies as part of the development of the UK's National Intellectual Property Crime Strategy. This strategy is designed to improve consumer awareness of the dangers of counterfeit goods, disseminate information of specific cases against known offenders and ensure a unified approach across Departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1094W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning the percentage of residents who are registered to vote in each Local Authority area. (5980)</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.2/4" class="indent">The percentage of residents who are registered to vote in each local authority area is not a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) does on occasion publish comparisons of the resident population of voting age (aged 18 and over) and the number of people who are registered to vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.2/5" class="indent">I am placing in the House of Commons Library a table which gives a comparison between the number of registered electors and the estimated mid-2003 population for local authorities in England and Wales. Data are given for both parliamentary electorate and local/European electorate. In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase>, a weighted average is taken of the <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-01">1 December 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase> electoral data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.2/6" class="indent">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. In addition there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This latter is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.2/7" class="indent">Any comparison of these data with figures for previous years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>

It is for each national health service ambulance trust to determine how this is done.

In the event of a major incident, every trust has emergency equipment vehicles carrying the extra medical supplies required for a large-scale incident and a mobile control unit, plus sufficient ambulance officers to manage the incident.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.3/1">Rehabilitation services for blind and partially sighted people are predominantly provided by local authorities and to some extent NHS trusts. It is for those organisations to commission appropriate services based on local need. This would include the number, training and composition of teams available to provide rehabilitation for blind and partially sighted people, based on local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.3/2">Fair Access to Care Services (FACS) is a system to help local authorities to set eligibility criteria for provision of services.

The Healthcare Commission has responsibility for assessing progress towards achieving these standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.2/2">Clinicians are expected to take full account of NICE guidelines because they are based on the best available evidence and have been put together after wide consultation, drawing on the views of patients and carers as well as the experts in the field.</p>

	<p pid="a.1100W.5/2">Choice is already an important part of the national health service breast screening programme. All invitations to be screened for breast cancer include leaflets on the benefits and limits of screening, allowing the woman to make an informed choice about whether to be screened or not. The invitation letter also includes details on how the screening appointment can be changed to a more convenient date and time. On average 30 per cent. of women rearrange their appointments each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.5/3">It is important to note that the amount of choice that the programme can offer is limited by the logistics involved in a screening programme that sees, on average, 1.4 million women each year. However, we are looking at how greater choice can be given. We are exploring, in London, the use of a central call centre, which will be closely followed and evaluated for implementation elsewhere in the country.</p>

Up to 2005&ndash;06 capital expenditure limits have been set by the Department for strategic health authorities, primary care trusts and NHS trusts primarily on a formula basis. From 2006&ndash;07, we will introduce a process where organisations put forward investment plans based on what they need and what is affordable. This should increase the extent to which capital expenditure reflects local circumstances. This policy is still being developed, and further details will be set out in the NHS financial strategy to be published in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108W.2/1">While it is well established that poor hand hygiene practices contribute to the spread of some healthcare associated infections it is too early to determine the effects of the &quot;cleanyourhands&quot; campaign on infection rates and on cleanliness, as it was only launched in September 2004. Research to evaluate implementation of the campaign is under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.2/2">However, at this very early stage in implementation of the &quot;cleanyourhands&quot; campaign, figures show that the usage of alcohol-based hand rubs has increased steadily, with some trusts showing a marked increase of between 100 and 400 per cent. Further evidence from a repeat of previous observational audits on compliance, some two years following the pilot, show compliance in excess of 60 per cent.&mdash;a sustained improvement from the average of 28 per cent. reported before the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.2/3">The national health service's hard work to improve infection control is shown by the 6 per cent. reduction in meticillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) blood stream infections for April to September 2004, compared with the same period in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108W.5/1">During the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06, total funding to primary care trusts (PCTs) will have increased in cash terms by &pound;12.7 billion or almost 31 per cent. Further substantial increases for PCTs will take the funding to &pound;64 billion in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;70 billion in 2007&ndash;08. In addition, another &pound;108 million was allocated in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 specifically to fund improvements to primary care premises. Further funding of &pound;83 million is to be made available in each year between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08 for premises growth. The proposed White Paper will consider the provision of accommodation as part of its review of services outside hospitals following a process of wide public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.5/2">It is the responsibility of PCTs to plan, develop and improve services to meet the needs of local people and to decide how available funding should be prioritised.</p>

	<p pid="a.1111W.6/1">Phthalates are a family of chemical substances, with a range of properties. Extensive research into the effects of certain phthalates on human health has been carried out at a European level, under the auspices of the European Union's Existing Substances Regulation (793/93/EC). Details of this programme can be found on the European Chemicals Bureau website at: <a href="http://ecb.jrc.it/existing-chemicals/">http://ecb.jrc.it/existing-chemicals/</a> The United Kingdom has commented on the detailed risk assessments and ensuing risk reduction strategy for the various phthalates that have been studied.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.6/2">The Government take the view that phthalates must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Where the EU database is insufficient to complete a risk assessment, it is normally expected that the industry will carry out the required additional research. The detailed EU risk assessments have indicated that some phthalate compounds have been shown in animal studies to produce toxic effects on the reproductive system. Therefore, the Government have asked its expert committee, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, to keep the area of environmental chemicals and reproductive health under review and will consider its advice on the need for additional research in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1111W.9/2">Reducing the incidence of pressure sores in hospitals is tackled locally through clinical governance; a programme of continuous improvement in clinical care. The toolkit, &quot;Essence of Care&mdash;patient focused benchmarks for clinical governance&quot;, includes a chapter specific to pressure ulcers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.9/3">This is underpinned by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines that also focus on screening and assessment, informing patients and their carers, the development and implementation of an individualised plan for prevention and treatment to be agreed and delivered by a multidisciplinary team working with patients and their carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.9/4">It is not possible to separately identify the costs&mdash;in hospitals and all other settings where the national health service cares for patients&mdash;of treating pressure sores.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.9/5">The number of patients who were diagnosed, in NHS hospitals, with pressure sore in the years between 2001&ndash;02 and 2003&ndash;04 are shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1117W.0/1">There has been very little work regarding the effects of the radiofrequency signals from mobile phone base stations on the electrical activity of the brain as these exposures are very small; usually many thousands of times below human exposure guideline values. Research in this area has therefore focused on the effects of exposure from the fields associated with mobile phone handsets. Exposure measurements around base stations are available on the websites of the Health Protection Agency at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a> and Ofcom at <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1117W.0/2">The research on health effects from radiofrequency electromagnetic fields was comprehensively reviewed by the independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation in 2003. The review concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1117W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1117W.0/4">Nevertheless, in view of the recommended precautionary approach to the use of these technologies, the mobile telecommunications and health research programme in the United Kingdom, funded jointly by the Government and the mobile phone industry, is supporting a study examining if signals from handsets may affect brain wave activity in volunteers under rigorous experimental conditions. The results of the study are expected to be published in due course.</p>
