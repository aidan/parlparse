	<p pid=".558W.2/1">The drought conditions in the Horn of Africa have caused serious stress to the most vulnerable communities in the region, in some cases resulting in humanitarian crisis.

	<p pid=".560W.2/1">The most recent UN Humanitarian Profile (October 2004) indicated that approximately 529,000 internally displaced people are in the South of Darfur, of which Nyala is the capital. A large proportion of these are in camps and settlements. The UN reports that 170,963 are internally displaced people known to be hosted in camps in the Nyala area. It is likely that there are further numbers of displaced persons in host communities and recent arrivals due to insecurity moving into the area.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-02">2 November</phrase>, the Government of Sudan forcefully relocated of 6&ndash;8,000 internally displaced people from the El Geer camp (previously known as the El Seraif camp) in the Nyala area. This occurred without prior consultation with the UN. It was therefore in breach of the established and agreed mechanism to determine voluntary return and movement of people. The UK strongly condemns any forced relocations, and through our Ambassador to Sudan, has made representations to the Government of Sudan to adhere to its obligations and commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding on Darfur, between the Government of Sudan and the International Organisation for Migration, which prohibits involuntary movement of internally displaced persons. This has been echoed by the EU and UN. DFID continues to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid=".560W.5/2">It is very difficult to provide accurate monthly figures of internally displaced people in Sudan as a whole of Darfur due to the issue of access constraints, notably due to problems of security affecting agency movements.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.5/3">Due to very limited access in Darfur up until April 2004, the UN did not estimate figures on a monthly basis beyond its September 2003 report of 250,000 displaced people. From April 2004 until August, the UN estimated that there were just over 1 million displaced people. From September this figure reached 1.5 million. The reasons for this increase is due to the on-going violence and improving access to Darfur. For Sudan as a whole, the UN has not made monthly estimates. It has been estimated that in September 2003 there were 3.7 million displaced.</p>

The latest United Nations Humanitarian Profile estimates that approximately 1.6 million people are internally displaced within Darfur as a result of the crisis there. It is estimated that up to 4 million people have been displaced in Sudan as a whole.

Both took place in Brussels. The UK was represented at these meetings by the Strategic Rail Authority. The Committee is primarily responsible for assisting and overseeing the production, adoption and revision of Technical Standards of Interoperability (TSIs). The purpose of these specifications is to technically harmonise the European railway supply market. The Committee oversees the development of these TSIs for both the High Speed (96/48/EC) and the Conventional Interoperability (2001/16/EC) Directives. During the specified period, the Committee discussed principles for the drafting groups to adhere to in writing the TSIs and monitored the progress being made on the production of these TSIs. It also considered the cost-benefit analyses that accompany the TSIs and the co-ordination of notified bodies (organisations appointed in Europe to verify compliance with TSIs.). The other information requested would require an unreasonable diversion of resources to obtain.</p>

It also discussed the date of implementation of the transportable pressure equipment Directive and the work of the Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. The other information requested would require an unreasonable diversion of resources to obtain.</p>

It considered and approved amendments to the technical specification to Commission Regulation (EC) 1360/2002, adapting to technical progress Council Regulation (EEC) 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport (tachographs). These amendments were subsequently published as a corrigendum to that regulation.</p>

	<p pid=".574W.2/1">We have made no such statement. However, we are aware of reports attributed to the Government that we would like motorcyclists to have experience on a 125cc motorcycle for two years before gaining access to a larger motorcycle. We certainly believe that some motorcyclists who gain their licence via Direct Access arrangements, allowing them to ride large motorcycles without earlier experience on a smaller machine, are at risk, simply through inexperience of riding a powerful motorcycle.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.2/2">The Advisory Group on Motorcycling (AGM), amongst other things, concluded that since the majority of novice riders choose to pass their test via the Direct Access route, as a relatively fast route to big bike riding, it is timely for the Government to consider its effectiveness (a copy of the report is lodged with the House). We will do so, in the context of wider ranging AGM suggestions and recommendations for the future of motorcycling. Should that review lead to proposals for change, we would consult before implementing them.</p>

The report &quot;Aviation and Global Warming&quot; includes assessments of fleet renewal, fuel efficiency improvement and emissions improvement. The report Air Quality Assessments Supporting the Government's White Paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; focuses more on prospects for engine improvements in emissions of oxide of nitrogen (NOx ). Technology projections relate to different timescales up to 2030 and span a range of emissions performance given uncertainty over proving technologies and bringing them to market.

	<p pid=".575W.10/1">The regulation allows member states to apply for various derogations regarding the disposal of animal by-products, and, among others, we have applied the derogation to permit the burial of dead pet animals. However, this does not automatically mean that all horses and donkeys may be buried.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.10/2">The definition of a pet animal given within the regulation is: any animal belonging to species normally nourished and kept, but not consumed, by humans for purposes other than farming.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.10/3">The situation with regard to equines is complicated. Although it can be argued that humans within the UK do not consume members of the equine family, the UK does export horses/ponies which may be used for human consumption. Under a strict interpretation the EU regulation would, therefore, ban the burial of pet equines but we would expect local authorities, who enforce the legislation, to take a sensible approach to the burial of horses that are clearly pets.</p>

	<p pid=".577W.9/5" class="indent">the National Peatland Resource Inventory has been wrongly interpreted which has led to far more degraded raised bogs being selected as pSACs than is necessary to satisfy the guidance received from the European Commission;</p>

Initial conclusions emphasise site-specific management as the key. Further work has been agreed, on an inter-disciplinary approach taking account of social and economic interests. Discussions at ORNIS (the EC Committee covering the Birds Directive), also covered the Development of a Framework for Biodiversity Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). The data from REDCAFE will be input into this process, along with other European initiatives such as the IMEW (Integrated Management of European Wetlands). The RAP aims to fully quantify the problems, develop a solution and provide synthesis and dissemination of the results. This process will provide a participatory decision strategy. The approach is being supported with EU research funding, and member states are also encouraged to participate.</p>

The first two funding streams below are both part of the Department's Rural Voluntary and Community Sector and Social Inclusion Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.8/2" class="italic">(a) Nationally:</p>
	<p pid=".580W.8/3" class="indent">(1) A contribution to The Pensions Partnership Fund which seeks to increase benefits uptake by the elderly. &pound;834,000 has been allocated in 2004&ndash;05 to fund projects in the priority wards in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.8/4" class="indent">(2) An action research contract examining social enterprise in rural areas. Some &pound;500,000 has been allocated in 2004&ndash;05 to fund projects in four English Regions, with priority being given to those which operate in priority wards.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.8/5" class="indent">(3) For the Warm Front programme, the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2000 has not been used as a sole indicator for any allocation purposes. It is considered with a number of other indices&mdash;including the fuel poverty indices under the English House Condition Survey. In 2004&ndash;05 the Fuel Poverty budget is &pound;169 million.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.8/6" class="indent">(4) Defra uses the Index as one of a number of measures which contribute to the priority scores of proposed flood and coastal erosion risk management improvement projects, when considering which projects should receive grant from the ring-fenced national budget. The budget being allocated in 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;56 million across local authorities and internal drainage boards.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.8/7" class="italic">(b) Government Sponsored Bodies:</p>
	<p pid=".580W.8/8" class="indent">The Environment Agency is a Non-Departmental Public Body sponsored by Defra and its share of the flood and coastal erosion risk management improvement projects funding in 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;76 million.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/1">Defra has published advice on its website to help central and local government implement the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI). A key objective is to increase the opportunities for small and local suppliers to compete to supply food to public sector bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/2">Within the EC policy and legal framework they can inform local suppliers of forthcoming contract opportunities and explain to them how the procurement process works and what is expected of them. There is also scope to specify more in-season food, rather than out of season or exotic produce that can only be supplied from abroad, and to organise the size of contracts and lots within contracts so that small and local suppliers have more chance of being able to meet demands. Public bodies do, of course, have an overarching duty to secure value for money and so must ensure that the measures they adopt to encourage more supplies of local food are proportionate and justified. They are also required by the EC treaty, the EC procurement directives and the UK regulations that implement them to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and not used to discriminate by setting up barriers to free trade. We are also encouraging public sector bodies to work with their food service companies to play an active part in achieving this aim by ensuring that local suppliers are given opportunities to be part of their supply chains, provided they are able to provide value for money and meet their requirements on quality, consistency of supply and food safety etc.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/3">The newly restructured PSFPI website contains more detailed guidance, best practice case studies (including one for South Gloucestershire schools) and links to other sources of useful information.

	<p pid=".584W.13/1">This is a matter for the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.13/2">The Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937 makes provision for the preservation, care and custody of the public records of Scotland. There is not, however, any statutory basis for closure of records created by Scottish public bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.13/3">By contrast, in England and Wales the Public Records Act 1958 (as amended by the Public Records Act 1967) sets a statutory &quot;closure period&quot; of 30 years after which records must, with limited exceptions, be made available to the public. The 1937 Act does not impose similar obligations on Scottish Executive departments, but in practice those procedures are followed in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.13/4">The criteria for closures longer than 30 years were defined in a White Paper on Open Government published in 1993 (Cm 2290), which stated that it is for the department responsible for depositing the material to decide on the closure period.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.13/5">Documents containing information about individuals, whose disclosure would cause either substantial distress, or endangerment from a third party to persons affected by disclosure or their descendants can be subject to a variable closure period of between 40 and 100 years.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.13/6">At the conclusion of Lord Cullen's inquiry, the papers were lodged with the then Scottish Record Office. As is normal practice, the closure periods were identified by the SRO, in consultation with the Secretary to the Inquiry and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. In light of the obvious sensitivities in relation to the information about children and alleged offences against them the productions were closed for 100 years. This closure was in accordance with the Government guidelines published in the White Paper &quot;Open Government&quot; Cm 2290 (1993) and Lord Cullen was content with these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.13/7">However, subsequently the Lord Advocate decided that the material from the Dunblane inquiry should be catalogued by staff at the National Archives of Scotland in a way which did not lead to the identification of children. The cataloguing of the productions has recently been completed. Officials from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service are currently reviewing this material and considering what information is suitable for release either in its entirety or in an edited format. However, the sensitive nature of the information contained in some of the material will obviously prevent its release before the end of the 100-year closure period.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.0/1">The DTI commissioned research into the effect of interest rate ceilings in France, Germany and the USA, which found that: lenders do not provide credit for small loans repayable over a short period, excluding some low-income consumers from the market or leading others to take out larger loans than they need; the choice of products is reduced, limiting competition; some low-income consumers will take out credit on products that have extra charges that are not included in the interest rate calculation, but which low income consumers are particularly likely to incur, such as late payment charges; and the percentage of consumers who admitted to having borrowed from unlicensed or illegal lenders was twice as high in Germany and France as in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.3/1">The White Paper &quot;Clear, Fair and Competitive&mdash;The Consumer Credit Market in the 21st Century&quot; set out the Governments' plans to increase the quality and transparency of information available to consumers about the costs and other terms of credit at all stages in the contractual process.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/2">To that end, Regulations have already been made governing the advertising of consumer credit; the provision of pre-contractual information; and the form and content of credit agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/3">The Consumer Credit (Advertisements) Regulations 2004 which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-31">31 October</phrase> this year&mdash;require lenders to present a balanced picture of the costs of a product; and establish the typical APR as the prime comparator.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/4">The Consumer Credit (Agreements) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 will require lenders to disclose full details about interest and other charges in the credit agreement. Penalties are illegal under consumer credit law. Interest charges will need to be listed under the prescribed &quot;Key Financial Information&quot; heading. Other charges will need to be listed under the &quot;Other Financial Information&quot; and &quot;Key Information&quot; headings. The Consumer Credit (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2004 require the lender to provide similar information in advance of the agreement being made. Both of these Regulations come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/5">The Government have also announced their intention to introduce a Bill as soon as parliamentary time permits that will include proposals to require creditors to provide debtors with regular information about the state of their accounts throughout the life of the agreement, including:</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/6" class="indent">providing an annual statement showing the activity on the account for the previous 12 months for fixed term agreements of more than one year in length;</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/7" class="indent">providing information about sums in arrears when the debtor gets into arrears for all forms of credit (e.g. loans and credit cards);</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/8" class="indent">providing information about fees, charges and interest applied to the account where there is a default; and</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/9" class="indent">providing debtors with information sheets published by the OFT and setting out user-friendly and relevant information about managing debt issues and seeking advice with all arrears and default notices.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.3/10">It is proposed that failure by a creditor to provide the required information may mean that the creditor cannot enforce the agreement or recover interest in respect of the period of their failure.</p>

	<p pid=".590W.2/1">My Department undertakes 'Character Enquiry' checks prior to any unconditional offers of employment being made as part of its recruitment procedures. The procedure requires potential recruits to complete a stencil detailing any current or previous criminal convictions.

Decisions on whether the information would prevent the Department from offering the individual an appointment are taken as appropriate at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.2/2">Additionally, procedures are in place for serving staff to report any convictions received since their employment with the Department commenced. If the position requires working in direct contact with children or vulnerable adults, Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) checks are carried out prior to any unconditional offers of employment being made. The information is available to staff and managers via the Department's Intranet. Personal criminal convictions, are potentially disciplinary issues, as is the failure to declare a conviction.</p>

Each authority is responsible for making sure that ICT in Schools' funding is used to best effect in support of national priorities. The NGfL Pathfinders and ImpaCT2 studies investigated the roll out and effect of the programme nationwide. These reported the different approaches to implementing the then National Grid for Learning taken by authorities and ImpaCT2, for example, reported that the effective use of ICT could improve levels of pupil attainment by the equivalent of half a grade at GCSE.</p>

	<p pid=".598W.2/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), in partnership with the Department, recently launched a new non-statutory national framework for Religious Education to support the delivery of high quality religious education (RE) in schools. While it provides for opportunities for pupils to study all of the principal religions in Great Britain, and other religious traditions and secular philosophies in line with the Government's goals of inclusion, tolerance and diversity, it also reinforces the position of Christianity as the dominant religion of this country. All of the major UK faith and belief communities and professional groups were involved in its development.</p>
	<p pid=".598W.2/2">While the Framework is non-statutory, we will be encouraging Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs) and Agreed Syllabus Conferences (ASCs) to use it in drawing up their locally agreed syllabus for schools in their area. Voluntary aided schools of a religious character are required to deliver RE within the tenets of their own faith, but we hope they too will see the value of the Framework and adopt it to enhance their existing RE provision.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has discussed the on-going preservation and conservation of the huts of the Antarctic explorers Scott and Shackleton with the Prime Minister of New Zealand which has territorial responsibility for the Ross Dependency in Antarctica where the huts are located. In September, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Media and Heritage met the High Commissioner of New Zealand to discuss proposals by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust to preserve the huts.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.2/2">The British Government are keen to support New Zealand's efforts to preserve these historic huts. In 2002, the Government, through the Government of the British Antarctic Territory, donated &pound;70,000 to support the proposed Ross Sea heritage restoration project developed by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust. Officials in my Department have also been exploring funding options to assist with this but no suitable sources of funding within the UK heritage sector have been found. However, the Government will continue to support fundraising efforts for the preservation of these unique huts.</p>

There have been peaks in insurgent activity, such as that in August, which have presented particular challenges to the Coalition but progress continues to be made towards successful elections in January.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.2/1">Before a submarine goes to sea it undergoes an extensive series of trials and equipment setting-to-work in the shipyard. It is not unusual for defects to emerge during the course of the Sea Trials, or within six months of a newly commissioned submarine entering service, and careful planning is undertaken to ensure such defects can be dealt with as they arise. The vast majority of these defects have no impact on a submarine's seaworthiness. Systems that could affect seaworthiness generally have some form of back up to prevent the submarine from being at risk as a result of a single failure; this is inherent in the design. Safety is of paramount importance and a submarine would not be sent to sea unless it was safe to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".631W.11/1">Following the referendum on the UN Secretary General's comprehensive settlement plan in which the Greek Cypriots voted &quot;no&quot; and the Turkish Cypriots &quot;yes&quot;, the EU agreed to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. In practice, we are working to reach EU agreement on regulations to enable preferential direct trade between north Cyprus and the rest of the EU, and to disburse the &pound;259 million of aid allocated for the north of the island.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.11/2">We support these measures as we believe it is important for the EU to bring Turkish Cypriots closer to Europe, and help to build trade links and reduce the economic gap between the two communities. This will make reunification more likely, easier to consolidate and less costly. Trade will increase trust and lay the foundations for co-operation in a reunified Cyprus. A widening wealth gap and continued economic division will make a solution much more difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.11/3">As I told the Greek Cypriot leadership during my recent visit to the island, we understand the concerns that made Greek Cypriots vote &quot;no&quot; to the UN plan and look forward to seeing Greek Cypriot proposals on moving the process forward. If we believe the proposals are reasonable and have a realistic chance of success, we will encourage the UN Secretary-General to re-engage and put all our resources and influence behind finding a solution on the basis of the Annan Plan that is acceptable to all sides. We continue to believe that the Annan Plan offers the only realistic basis for a settlement to the Cyprus problem.</p>

Subject to the approval of an Order to be made under Section 60 of the Health Act 1999, we plan to give the General Dental Council powers to register dental technicians early in 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.8/1">Precise information is not available centrally, but I understand from the General Dental Council, which is responsible for the curriculum for dental undergraduate education, that the proportion has reduced. The reasons are that there has been an encouraging reduction in the number of edentulous patients&mdash;from 37 per cent. of adults in 1968 to 12 per cent. in 1998&mdash;and recognition that most dentists now delegate the manufacture of dentures to dental technicians.</p>

	<p pid=".644W.11/1">Engaging clinicians and national health service management in planning and preparation for successful implementation of the national programme has always been, and continues to be, a key priority. As well as the national professional bodies and groups, the national programme team has also consulted closely with individual expert primary and secondary care practitioners, including practising general practitioners. A series of workshops has also been held across the NHS involving clinicians to help inform the information technology development by suppliers.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.11/2">In addition, the care record development board, established in July and chaired by Mr. Harry Cayton, the Department's director for patients and the public, has its membership drawn from clinicians as well as representatives of patients and social care. The board brings together patients, public, social and healthcare professionals to provide clinical and patient input into the national programme's work. The work of the board will enable wider consultation and input into the way the NHS care records service is being developed and aims to ensure the NHS maximises the benefits that the new IT has to offer to support improvements in care.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.11/3">Arrangements for clinical engagement are being further strengthened by the appointment of clinical leads to represent GPs, hospital doctors, nurses and allied health professionals at national, cluster and local health community level.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.2/1">The national programme for information technology (NPfIT) has always made it clear that the best use should and will be made of the existing asset base so long as it continues to provide value and be fit for purpose. General practitioners are being advised that, certainly in the short and medium term, existing clinical systems can continue to be used subject to compliance criteria. This message has been repeated in guidance published by the national programme, aimed at existing systems suppliers. No practice will be expected to move from current systems until the same or greater levels of functionality than GPs currently enjoy are available under the national programme, unless that is part of an agreed strategy or by choice for specific reasons.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.2/2">However, in the longer term it may be necessary for some existing systems to be replaced or integrated. At that stage each GP practice will have a choice of more than one system so long as these have been accredited against national standards and can deliver the required functionality. This undertaking is spelt out in guidance agreed jointly with the British Medical Association.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.2/3">Individual GP practices will receive funding to upgrade to NPfIT systems through their primary care trusts. Systems provided by NPfIT will be at no cost to GP practices. In addition, the National Programme will cover centrally the cost of supplier-developed training material, including e-training services, and training the trainers in the use of new IT services.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.0/1">Because of low reporting rates, the current incidence of medication errors within the national health service is not known. The Government have established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) to collect, collate, review and analyse error reports and produce and disseminate solutions to ensure that we learn from errors and reduce, risk. Medication errors are an early priority for the NPSA, and its reporting and learning system will provide data on their frequency overall, and in children.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.0/2">We are committed to making drug treatment for children as safe as possible and have taken a number of steps to achieve this. The Chief Pharmaceutical Officer issued guidance for health professionals and NHS organisations in January this year, entitled &quot;Building a safer NHS for patients: improving medication safety.&quot; This included a chapter on improving medication in children. The national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, launched in October includes a standard for medicines management in children, with a chapter on safe medication practice.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.0/3">Additionally, the Government launched a strategy on medicines for children in August this year, which among other issues highlighted the need for a single source of authoritative information on paediatric prescribing. The first children's British National Formulary will be available during the summer of 2005 and will be published annually thereafter.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.3/1">Monitor (whose statutory name is the independent regulator of national health service foundation trusts) is an independent corporate body established under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003.

	<p pid=".646W.3/2">In authorising NHSFTs, Monitor must be satisfied that they are legally constituted, financially sustainable, effectively governed and locally representative.

	<p pid=".647W.2/1">Monitor, the statutory name of which is the independent regulator of national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs), is an independent corporate body established under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. It is therefore Monitor's responsibility to authorise, monitor and regulate NHSFTs.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/2">I am informed by the chairman of Monitor that the monitoring exercise for the first quarter of the financial year identified that financial performance at the Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHSFT was significantly behind that forecast at the point of authorisation. At its meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-29">29 September 2004</phrase>, Monitor's board concluded that formal action under section 23 of the Act (failing NHS foundation trusts) was necessary. Minutes of the meeting are publicly available on Monitor's website at <a href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk">www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/3">Section 10 of the Act requires Monitor to publish a copy of any notice made under section 23 on the register of NHSFTs, which is publicly available on Monitor's website. This is the first and only occasion, to date, on which Monitor has exercised its powers under section 23 of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/4">A close working relationship is required at all levels between Monitor and the Department to ensure that both parties can effectively perform their statutory functions to ensure that the NHS continues to deliver a high and improving quality of service to the public.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/5">A memorandum of understanding was signed in September 2004, which sets out how this relationship works in practice, while at the same time safeguarding Monitor's independence. It includes an undertaking that Monitor and the Department will keep each other promptly and regularly informed about all developments and issues in which the other party may have an interest, and to ensure that the other party is given adequate warning of, and sufficient information about, any planned public announcements which might be considered to affect the interests of the other party. A copy of the memorandum is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/6">In keeping with the principles set out in the memorandum of understanding between them, Monitor advised the Department of its board's decision in early October.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.6/1">The Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service's (NIBTS) policies and procedures for selection of blood donors are based on national guidelines produced and agreed by the four United Kingdom Blood Transfusion Services. NIBTS policy and practice for wheelchair users is consistent with these guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.6/2">Any donor may suffer adverse reactions to blood donation, which on occasions can be quite severe. Such reactions must be dealt with on a proper blood donation couch (not a wheelchair) so that they can be addressed safely. Donors must therefore not donate blood in their wheelchair, and be able to climb on and off the donation couch. If the underlying cause of disability in the case of a wheelchair user, or others, is not a contraindication, blood donation may be acceptable. However, certain causes of disability may preclude individuals from donating for reasons of safety to the recipient as well as the donor. Health and safety issues for staff normally preclude donors being physically lifted onto a donor couch. NIBTS provides wheelchair access at all its fixed (permanent) donation venues including the purpose designed BloodMobile and also at the vast majority of mobile donation sessions throughout the province.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.8/1">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) itself has no direct plans to assist with the upgrading of facilities for tourist traffic as this is the responsibility of Department of Regional Development (DRD) Roads Service and the local council.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.8/2">NITB does however consider the Greencastle-Magilligan Ferry as an important tourist link between Co. Donegal and Co. Londonderry. Magilligan lies within the area identified in the Ministerial Causeway and Glens Tourism Masterplan 2004&ndash;13 which NITB is currently assisting to implement. Two actions have been identified in the associated Action Plan that may have a direct effect on facilities for tourist traffic in the Magilligan area:</p>
	<p pid=".669W.8/3" class="indent">Upgrade existing and provide new coach parks to allow coach visitors access to key attractive settlements and their services.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.8/4" class="indent">Gateway towns and villages programme&mdash;enhancement programme for gateways e.g. Larne, Bally castle and Magilligan.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.8/5">NITB is also progressing the identification and development of a tourist trail along the A2 coastal route. It is anticipated that the trail will include Magilligan along the route.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.8/6">With regard to road infrastructure improvements, the DRD's Roads Service has advised that planning approval for the ferry was given on the basis that a number of infrastructure improvements were carried out along Point Road, which runs between the Seacoast Road and the ferry terminal. These improvements included the localised widening of the road at a number of locations, and the resurfacing of the road. This work was carried out by the applicant, Limavady borough council.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.8/7">Discussions are currently on-going with Limavady borough council with a view to providing directional/information signage for the ferry. Signage being considered includes the use of variable message signs on Point Road, which would provide information for ferry passengers, similar to that being used at the Strangford Ferry.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.0/1">Water conservation and the sustainable and long-term management of water resources is an objective of the Water Framework Directive. This Directive puts forward pricing as a means of achieving this objective and it requires that, by 2010, the price charged to water consumers for abstraction, water supply and collection and treatment of waste water reflects the true cost of the provision of the services. The proposed charging regime for water and sewerage services, which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-13">13 September</phrase>, has been developed in light of the Directive and the water pricing policies within it will require a contribution from households and other sectors towards the cost of the water and sewerage services they receive as an incentive to use water efficiently.</p>
