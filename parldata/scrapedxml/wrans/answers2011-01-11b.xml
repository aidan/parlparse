	<p pid="b.241W.0/1">It is the aim of the proposals on the modernisation of the coastguard that local geographical knowledge will be retained and improved principally in the new management structure of the coastguard rescue service. The coastguard rescue teams will continue to be the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's (MCA) dynamic link to local coastal communities. The existing centres, which manage many hundreds of miles of coastline, already are increasing use of technology such as global mapping and information services as well as satellite imagery. In the proposed modernised coastguard service the MCA would maximise and standardise such innovation, provide a 24/7 provision from within coastal communities and provide appropriate training. The MCA will also maintain its current strong working relationships with partner search and rescue organisations such as the RNLI, in which considerable local knowledge and expertise reside.</p>

	<p pid="b.245W.2/1">DEFRA has continued to maintain a comprehensive and risk based TB surveillance programme through on farm testing of cattle and inspection of cattle carcases at slaughterhouses. To minimise the risk of disease spread, movement restrictions are applied (on cattle herds) as soon as a TB affected animal is identified or a TB test becomes overdue. We are also continuing to fund a wide ranging research programme, which includes developing vaccines, improving diagnostic tests and increasing our understanding on how TB spreads.</p>

	<p pid="b.247W.2/2">We are able to calculate the gross environmental benefits of preventing waste for a range of materials. However, waste prevention covers a wide range of actions and measures.

	<p pid="b.248W.0/1">The UK can already share the proceeds of transnational financial crime with other countries without the need for further legislation. Asset sharing and repatriation following confiscation can be made administratively on a case by case basis guided, where relevant, by provision in international agreement. Article 14 of the UN convention against transnational organized crime and article 57 of the UN convention against corruption provide that confiscated money can be paid to other countries as compensation or restitution to the victims of such crimes. Where necessary, prosecutors and the courts can also explore alternative methods of transferring money if confiscation following conviction is not an option in any individual case.</p>

	<p pid="b.248W.9/1">A number of procedures carried out by police forces, forensic suppliers and the National Policing Improvement Agency's (NPIA) National DNA Database (NDNAD) Delivery Unit are in place to ensure that information is recorded as accurately as possible on the NDNAD. These procedures are designed to ensure that, as far as possible, errors are not included on the database in the first place, rather than rectifying them once the profile has been loaded. The procedures include checking the identity of a person from whom a DNA sample is taken against an identity established through fingerprinting.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.9/2">If any irregular record comes to the notice of the NDNAD Delivery Unit, the record is suspended on the database pending an investigation. The outcome of which is that the record may be re-instated unchanged, amended or deleted.</p>

	<p pid="b.248W.9/4">One area of the team's work is to routinely monitor newly-loaded profiles to identify two or more matching DNA profiles shown on different PNC records. The team liaises directly with police forces where replicates have been identified and supports them to resolve any issues. This allows the Police Service to merge and consolidate their information on the individuals who have previously provided incorrect information by updating the appropriate PNC records.</p>

	<p pid="b.251W.2/1">The international community, including the UK, recognised the results of the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections. But Hamas' subsequent actions in using force to oust its political rivals were far from democratic. Hamas' ideology of violence also directly undermines prospects for peace in the region. The Quartet has set out clearly that Hamas must renounce violence, recognise Israel and accept previously signed agreements. With our international partners, we will continue to call on Hamas to take immediate and concrete steps towards the Quartet principles and to release Gilad Shalit unconditionally.</p>
	<p pid="b.251W.2/2">We will also to continue to call on all parties in the region including Hamas to refrain from any activity that could undermine the search for a just and lasting settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.254W.5/1">We believe that the overall principles of the work capability assessment (WCA) are right, but that the specific system which we inherited developed by the previous Government contained flaws that risked undermining its effectiveness. We have therefore moved swiftly to put those right.</p>
	<p pid="b.254W.5/2">We welcome the first independent review of the WCA, led by Professor Malcolm Harrington. This was a thorough review that considered a substantial amount of evidence. Based on those fundings, Professor Harrington has come forward with a wide range of far reaching and challenging proposals which the Government fully supports.</p>
	<p pid="b.254W.5/3">We are committed to taking forward all of the review's recommendations so that we can make the WCA system fairer and more effective. The Government response to Professor Harrington's review sets out how and when we will implement the recommendations of the review, the majority of which will be in place in time for the national roll-out of the incapacity benefits reassessment programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.257W.8/2">DECC has projected the level of fuel poverty in England for 2009 and 2010 given known changes in the prices of energy and estimated changes in household incomes. In 2009, due to increasing energy prices in this period, the level of fuel poverty in England is predicted to be around 4.1 million households, falling slightly to 4.0 million households in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.258W.5/1">The United Kingdom relies on a well defined, independently regulated, competitive market to deliver the necessary energy infrastructure and competitive sources of energy. Market participants, rather than Government, are best placed to assess the complex range of factors affecting the profitability of storing and providing gas; and how these might evolve over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.258W.5/2">There are already sharp incentives on gas shippers to balance their positions across each day of this winter. The market has been working effectively to deliver sufficient supplies of gas to meet the country's needs. It has responded well, bringing forward sufficient supplies even in response to near record levels of demand during the cold spells earlier this winter. However, the Government are not complacent, and are seeking to refine the market framework through the measures contained in the Energy Bill 2010-11. A provision in the Bill will further improve gas security of supply by giving Ofgem a new power to amend the gas market's Uniform Network Code to sharpen commercial incentives on gas market participants to meet their contractual supply obligations and reduce the duration, likelihood or severity of a gas supply emergency. This will help underpin commercial demand for additional gas supply infrastructure such as storage and import facilities, as well as long-term contracts. Ofgem is now launching a &quot;Significant Code Review&quot; exercise to enhance gas market arrangements and believes that there is a reasonable prospect that the new power would enable it to implement these by the end of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.258W.5/3">Against that background the government has no plans to introduce further incentives to encourage the storage of gas over the course of winter 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.261W.5/1">The impact assessment conducted by the previous Government estimated the average annual cost to charities and not-for-profit organisations of the repeal of the current exemptions contained in s. 67 and 72(1B)(a) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to be &#163;18.7 million per year for the purchasing of Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) licences.

	<p pid="b.261W.5/3">The impact assessment figure of &#163;18.7 million was based on an estimated flat fee of &#163;81 per annum for each music user. However, following negotiations between PPL and the relevant sector, the majority of community buildings/village halls will pay &#163;40 per annum and the vast majority of charity shops will pay the lower rate &#163;54 per annum-this includes both the shop and back office.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.5/4">Following discussions with this Government, PPL has also agreed to give a year's grace and will not begin charging charities until <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.265W.2/1">The information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.2/2">Information on breaches of community sentences by individual offenders is recorded by probation trusts on their case management systems. It is used in the day-to-day management of offenders, including as a trigger to appropriate action in response to breach, for example through formal warnings or enforcement action, but the figures requested do not form part of trusts' routine reporting. Therefore to produce the figures requested would entail asking the 35 probation trusts to interrogate the case record of each offender supervised in the past three years and provide a report to the centre on the number of offenders with a breach recorded, the total number of breaches that have occurred in each case and the highest recorded against an individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.2/3">However, data are available on the reasons for termination of community orders and suspended sentence orders. These reasons include early termination for failure to comply with requirements or for conviction of a further offence. Figures for the years 2006 to 2009 are shown at Table 5.1 of the Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2009, published on the Ministry of Justice website:</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/omcs-2009-complete-210710a.pdf">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/omcs-2009-complete-210710a.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.265W.2/5">It should be noted that not all breaches of community sentences will result in early termination. In line with National Standards for the Management of Offenders 2007 an offender who fails to comply with the terms of his or her supervision in the community may be given one formal warning in any 12 month period on an order (and no more than two warnings within a 12 month period while on post-release licence) before breach or recall action becomes required. Furthermore, although the court which hears an allegation of breach relating to a community order may decide to revoke the order and replace it with an alternative community or custodial sentence, it may on the other hand decide that the order should continue with more onerous requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.2/6">In the recent Green Paper &quot;Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders&quot;<sup>(1)</sup> the Government stated that it is unacceptable that a quarter of offenders on community orders or on licence do not complete the sentence due to breaking the conditions of that order or licence. The Green Paper sets out in further detail our proposals for making community sentences more robust, rigorous and effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.284W.8/2">Children's homes and residential schools are overseen by the Department for Education. Regulation 17(1) of the Children's Homes Regulations 2001 provides that no measure of control, discipline or restraint which is excessive or unreasonable or contrary to paragraph (5) (which lists prohibited disciplinary measures) may be used at any time on a child accommodated in a children's home. Any use of the restraint techniques which have been banned in secure training centres are likely to be in breach of regulation 17(1).</p>

In particular, strongly recommending that neither of the restraint techniques known as &quot;nose distraction&quot; and &quot;double basket hold&quot; should be used.</p>
	<p pid="b.284W.8/4">All school staff members have a legal power to use reasonable force to prevent pupils committing a criminal offence; injuring themselves or others, or damaging property; and to maintain good order and discipline among pupils<sup>(1)</sup>. &quot;The use of force to control or restrain pupils-Guidance for schools in England&quot; was issued by the (then) Department for Children, Schools and Families in April 2010 to help school staff feel more confident about using force when it is right and necessary to do so. The guidance points out that a panel of experts identified that certain restraint techniques presented an unacceptable risk when used on children and young people. These techniques are the 'double seated embrace', 'the double basket hold' and the 'nose distraction technique'.</p>
	<p pid="b.284W.8/5">I have been informed by the Department of Health that there is no national list of either permitted or banned restraint techniques for use in NHS hospitals in England. But it is a requirement of regulations under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 that, where any form of control or restraint is used, the hospital provider must have suitable arrangements in place to protect service users against the risk of such control or restraint being unlawful or otherwise excessive.</p>

	<p pid="b.286W.6/3">The Government are committed to increasing the focus of children's centres on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged families in their communities. Local areas are best placed to assess their communities' needs and local demand for early education and care.</p>

However, local authorities remain responsible for ensuring that there is sufficient high-quality early education and care across the whole of their community, and many children's centres will continue to provide full day care depending on levels of demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.286W.6/5">We expect children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas to continue to provide high quality early education and care as part of their integrated support for families, including free nursery education for two, three, and four-year-olds and additional hours where there is demand. Centres should make sure that disadvantaged families get priority when these places are allocated.</p>

	<p pid="b.287W.2/2">The Department has not made an estimate of the total amount of money which could be saved by phasing out the requirement for Sure Start Children's Centres to offer full day care in deprived areas. Early education and care services in children's centres are intended to be self-sustaining from parental fees, Government funding for free nursery education for two, three and four-year-olds, and other local authority sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/3">In the past, children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas were required to provide full day care, i.e. 10 hours a day, five hours a week, for 48 weeks a year. However, the National Audit Office Memorandum for the Children's Schools and Families Committee, December 2009, suggested that in some areas, when demand for full day care is low, money intended for other Sure Start services-like family support and outreach to vulnerable families-is subsidising the provision of early education and care. By removing the requirement for children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas to provide full day care where there is no demand, we are enabling local authorities and children's centres to use their money more flexibly to intervene early and reach the most vulnerable families more effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.289W.2/1">Official estimates of the number and proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds not in education, employment or training (NEET) in England are published by the Department in a Statistical First Release (SFR) each June and can be found on the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid="b.289W.2/3">These estimates cannot be broken down below national level. However, Connexions Services collect information on the number and proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds NEET in each local authority area, which are published annually of the DFE website.</p>
	<p pid="b.289W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/16to19/participation/neet/a0064101/strategies-for-16-to-18-year-olds-not-in-education-employment-or-training-neet">http://www.education.gov.uk/16to19/participation/neet/a0064101/strategies-for-16-to-18-year-olds-not-in-education-employment-or-training-neet</a></p>
	<p pid="b.289W.2/5">Connexions figures for the London borough of Newham at the end of 2008 and 2009 are shown as follows. As the number of young people NEET varies widely throughout the academic year, comparisons can only be made with the same period each year and figures for the end of 2010 are not due to be published in April 2011. The Department for Education does not collect Connexions data at parliamentary constituency level.</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.3/3">The report shows that public service pensions have become more valuable, for example the value of a public service pension in 2003-04 is expected to be around a third higher than it would have been if life expectancy assumptions were the same as in 1955. The significant majority of the cost of these increases in value has fallen to local and national taxpayers.</p>

	<p pid="b.297W.2/4">As the Department develops its proposals for GP-led commissioning, it will continue to engage with clinicians, professional organisations and the public in order to inform them of their plans and utilise their expertise in implementing the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.297W.2/5">Going forward, one of the principal aims of GP commissioning is to make decisions more sensitive and responsive to the needs and wishes of patients and the public. Good communication and engagement with the public will be vital. The forthcoming Bill will place a duty on GP consortium and the NHS Commissioning Board to ensure that people who may receive a service are involved in its planning and development, and to promote and extend public and patient involvement and choice.</p>

	<p pid="b.300W.2/1">A robust financial analysis, including the estimated costs relating to implementation, is being undertaken as part of the option appraisal process. The Joint Committee of primary care trusts (JCPCT)<sup>(1)</sup>, the main decision-making body for the review, will take into consideration financial appraisal of the options when making its final decision on future options of configuration.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/2">The Secretary of State is aware of the findings of the review of paediatric cardiac surgery and clinical governance at the Oxford John Radcliffe Paediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/3">The independent review was commissioned by the South Central strategic health authority and has concluded that the four child deaths which led to the review being undertaken were not attributable to poor surgical practice. The children who died had complex conditions and were at a high risk for surgery. However, the findings raised a number of procedural and governance issues, which need to be addressed by the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust. It recommended the continued suspension of the service pending a decision on its future place within the national service by the NHS Safe and Sustainable review.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/4">The Department has received seven representations on the conduct of the review of paediatric cardiac surgery and clinical governance at the Oxford John Radcliffe Paediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit, including three pieces of correspondence from families of former patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/5">On the basis of information currently available, the Safe and Sustainable review team is likely to recommend to the JCPCT that the eventual options for reconfiguration that are put out for public consultation in 2011 do not include the paediatric cardiac surgery service at the Oxford John Radcliffe hospital. The review team have considered the outcome of an independent assessment of all paediatric cardiac surgery services in England in May and June 2010 by an expert panel chaired by Professor Sir Ian Kennedy.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/6">The purpose of the Safe and Sustainable assessment process was to assess the ability of the current paediatric cardiac surgery services to meet new standards in the future. The outcome of this assessment was that that service at the Oxford John Radcliffe hospital received the lowest ranking assessment of the current 11 centres, by a significant margin.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/7">The Safe and Sustainable review team undertook further work to determine whether the location of the Oxford John Radcliffe hospital could justify its inclusion in potential options on the grounds that this would improve overall access for children and families. This showed that, in the national context of a reduction in number of units, the inclusion of the John Radcliffe hospital unit in the potential options would not improve overall access for children and families.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/8">Not being included in options for consultation does not mean that the JCPCT has made any decision about the future of the service at the Oxford John Radcliffe hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/9">The review of paediatric cardiac surgery and clinical governance at the Oxford John Radcliffe paediatric cardiac surgery unit was conducted separately from the NHS Safe and Sustainable review, and did not form part of the Safe and Sustainable Review assessment process. The purpose of the Safe and Sustainable assessment process was to assess the ability of paediatric cardiac surgery services to meet new service standards in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/10">The JCPCT aims to agree recommendations for reconfiguration at a public meeting in the next few months. These recommendations will be published for a full public consultation in 2011. A final decision about the future of the service at the Oxford John Radcliffe hospital and the other current services will not be made until the outcome of the public consultation has been considered. Parents, national health service staff and the public will have the opportunity to make their views known during the consultation process, including on the future of the service at the Oxford John Radcliffe hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/11">It is currently planned that the consultation document will be published in February 2011, subject to the decision by the JCPCT.</p>
	<p pid="b.300W.2/12" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The JCPCT was established as part of the NHS Safe and Sustainable programme to develop the consultation document on behalf of PCTs and take decisions on issues, which are the subject of consultation</p>

In order to improve data quality, continual refinements have been made to the programme budgeting data calculation methodology since the first collection in 2003-04. The underlying data which support programme budgeting data are also subject to yearly changes. Caution is therefore advised when using programme budgeting data to draw conclusions on changes in PCT spending patterns between years.  3. Figures include expenditure across all sectors. Disease specific expenditures do not include expenditure on prevention, or costs associated with the time of general practitioners or other primary care professionals, but do include prescribing expenditure.  4. Data for subcategories such as chronic pain are expected to be less robust than data on main categories such as neurological conditions.</td> </tr>
