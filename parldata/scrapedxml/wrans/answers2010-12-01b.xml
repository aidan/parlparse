The following table shows the estimated number of salmon returning in each of the past five years, although such estimates have only been possible on the Hampshire Avon since 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.807W.2/12">The EA estimates the Conservation Limits (CLs) for salmon stocks in each of the 64 principal salmon rivers in England and Wales; including the Test, Itchen and Hampshire Avon. CLs are described as 'the minimum desirable spawning stock levels, below which stocks should not be allowed to fall'. The salmon stocks in the rivers Test, Itchen and Hampshire Avon were all below their CLs in 2009, and are classified as being 'At Risk' or 'Probably at Risk'. They are also expected to remain in one of these categories until at least 2014. There are no similar indicators of the status of other salmonid species.</p>
	<p pid="b.807W.2/13">Stocks may still be sustainable at levels below their CL, but they are at greater risk. The EA and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science are investigating the significance of impacts on salmon and will seek ways to manage the effects. An understanding of these key factors will be important in estimating the future potential of these southern chalk streams for all salmonid species.</p>

This includes &#163;3.7 billion for over three million adult training places funded through the Skills Funding Agency. In the 2011-12 financial year, &#163;605 million is earmarked for adult apprenticeships. Spend on adult apprenticeships will increase by up to &#163;250 million, relative to the previous Government, by the end of the spending review period, supporting an additional 75,000 people to start an apprenticeship by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.0/2">In support of the coalition Government's principle of greater freedom, &quot;Skills for Sustainable Growth and Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; set out the abolition of central targets and increased freedom and flexibility for further education colleges and training organisations to respond effectively to the needs of employers, learners and their communities. It will be for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.0/3">From the 2011/12 academic year, there will be a single adult skills budget, with earmarked delivery for apprenticeships. As part of its allocations process later this year, the Skills Funding Agency will set out a minimum expectation of apprenticeships delivery. Further Education colleges and training organisations will be able to use their single adult skills budget allocation to expand apprenticeships. However, any diversion of funding away from apprenticeships is to be agreed with the Agency.</p>

Due to data limitations, we are unable to say how many individuals were refused credit completely in the last six months. For instance, a borrower may have refused a credit card, but was able to secure an overdraft facility. In addition, the values in the table cannot be summed, to produce statistics on the proportion of the population refused credit. This is because some borrowers may have been rejected for more than one credit product. Certain credit products have been excluded such as payday loans and home credit, which are unlikely to be offered by banks and building societies.</td> </tr>

UKTI provides a broad range of support for British companies-from conferences and trade missions to support for trade fairs and exhibitions-and also oversees annual trade and economic talks with Bahrain aimed at prioritising opportunities and improving the environment for bilateral trade and investment. The most recent talks resulted in the signature of a bilateral Double Taxation Agreement in March 2010.</p>

UKTI organised scoping visits to Bahrain in the spring of 2010 focused on the creative industries and sports infrastructure sectors; and also organised a UK pavilion of 18 companies at the World Islamic Banking Conference in Manama in November. Regular events are organised by UKTI in the UK to raise awareness of opportunities in Bahrain, including a middle east road show in February and a financial services road show in September. UKTI also staged a 'Britain in the Region' event in Dubai in November aimed at encouraging British companies with regional headquarters in Dubai into other markets in the middle east, including Bahrain.</p>

	<p pid="b.837W.6/1">We have estimated an average annual benefit of between &#163;0.5 million and &#163;2.5 million. The monetised benefits reflect spending on films which would not have occurred without the treaty being in place. The range reflects a lower case scenario where one film is made every two years with &#163;1 million UK spend, and the upper case involves five films with &#163;1 million spend made every two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.837W.6/2">In addition, research indicates that film locations can get up to a 30% boost in bookings from fans visiting locations from their favourite film (e.g. the Harry Potter films have helped boost tourism in the Northumberland area by 16%). As well as clear tourism potential, there are cultural benefits to the UK of greater film diversity. Given that the film industry largely comprises Single Purpose Vehicles it is difficult to predict in advance how many businesses will make use of the treaty. We do not believe it will be significantly higher than projections, particularly in the first few years.</p>

	<p pid="b.839W.12/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.12/2">The Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 requires employers carrying on business in Great Britain to insure their liability to their employees for bodily injury or disease sustained in the course of their employment. This Act ensures that those with asbestos-related diseases can claim compensation against their Employers' Liability insurance, where the employer has been negligent in exposing them to asbestos while at work.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.12/3">However, a recent Court of Appeal case has considered how the wording of these Employers' Liability insurance policies affects civil compensation for mesothelioma sufferers and we had hoped that the judgment would have provided a general principle on how these policies should deal with their mesothelioma claims. The court decided that the policies should be interpreted based on the actual policy wording, which means that some sufferers may not be able to claim compensation if the insurance policy was worded in such a way that prevents a claim from being made. We expect this judgment to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.12/4">In February 2010 the previous Government published their consultation document, 'Accessing Compensation-Supporting people who need to trace Employers' Liability insurance', which set out proposals for people who need to find their Employers' Liability insurance policies in order to claim compensation. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-05">5 May 2010</phrase>. There were two proposals; firstly an Employers' Liability Tracing Office, that would manage a database of EL policies. Secondly, an Employers' Liability Insurance Bureau which would be a compensation fund of last resort for those individuals who are unable to trace EL insurance records, ensuring they are able to receive compensation for injuries or diseases sustained during the course of their employment. We are in active discussions with all stakeholders on how this situation can be addressed and we will publish our response to the consultation in due course.</p>

There is therefore no realistic prospect of securing agreement to the introduction of a new zero rate for repairs to historic church buildings. However, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport operates a scheme which makes grants equivalent to the VAT incurred in making repairs to listed buildings primarily used for worship. The Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will continue until 2014-15 with a fixed annual budget of &#163;12 million.</p>

There are currently provisions in place that impose legal requirements to identify, assess and make provision for these pre-school needs, for example through the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice and the Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework. We want to strengthen the system so that all children are ready to engage in learning when they start formal schooling. The Tickell review is considering how young children's early learning should best be supported and the forthcoming Green Paper on Special Educational Needs and Disability will consider how we can achieve better educational outcomes and life chances for children and young people with special educational needs from the early years through to transition to adult life and employment.</p>

	<p pid="b.858W.0/8" class="indent">Average collections and arrangements will be directly impacted by the average assessment value. The average assessment of Old Scheme cases is significantly lower than Current Scheme cases due to differences in policy between the schemes. The majority of cases in receipt of benefit on the Old Scheme are nil-assessed, whereas cases in receipt of benefit on the Current Scheme are given a weekly assessment of &#163;5.00. 29% of cases on the Current Scheme have an assessment between &#163;0.01 and &#163;5.00, which significantly reduces the average assessment value.</p>

	<p pid="b.863W.5/1">Assumptions and calculations on the estimated value of Work Programme contracts and indeed other contracts which will be let from the framework, were developed from information on the value of existing welfare to work programmes. These took into account the intention to radically simplify the array of existing employment programmes and deliver coherent, integrated support more capable of dealing with complex and overlapping barriers to work. Estimates were broad in order to provide transparency to the market and to ensure that the framework would be able to meet requirements to be the principal vehicle for sourcing all employment related support services for the full life of the framework, not just for DWP, but also for other eligible contracting authorities. Calculations also took into account the need to deliver greater value for money on future welfare to work contracts.</p>

We will therefore progress those of the Donaghy recommendations accepted by the previous Administration which we consider are supported by the available evidence. For example, consistent with recommendation eight of the Donaghy report, the Government have actively supported the new specification for &quot;pre-qualification&quot; criteria in the construction industry, introduced by the British Standards Institution in October and which has the potential to radically simplify the pre-qualification process for small firms tendering for construction work. Where, however, we lack firm evidence for particular recommendations-for example, that directors' health and safety duties need to be further strengthened-we do not propose to take further action at this time.</p>

	<p pid="b.867W.6/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about what assistance his Department plans to give to those living in remote rural areas to (a) access jobcentres to see what vacancies are available and (b) access the labour market in areas with poor local transport. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is committed to providing all customers, including those in rural areas, with the help they need to find work as quickly as possible. We do this through a combination of the largest network of offices within Government, which is used primarily to provide face-to-face advice and guidance at the outset of the claim and at key stages thereafter; and alternative means of service delivery such as telephony and the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/5" class="indent">In terms of plans to help those in remote areas access vacancies, everyone receives information, advice and guidance at the new claims interview about how to make best use of appropriate vacancy sources. As part of this, people receive information about the Directgov Internet Job Bank and Jobseeker Direct (the Jobcentre Plus telephony-based vacancy matching service), both of which provide remote, fast and easy access to thousands of jobs. As a further development, we have also launched a new application for the iPhone and Google Android systems, which offers people an innovative way to search for a job through their telephone handset.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/6" class="indent">Looking ahead and in transforming our labour market services still further, we aim to provide a much improved, more efficient automated service to help employers post and fill vacancies and jobseekers access available jobs. As part of this, the intention is to extend the current job search facility to include vacancies from employer websites and other job boards; and to create secure customer profiles, which will be used to automatically notify employers of suitable applicants and individuals of suitable jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/7" class="indent">In terms of helping people access the labour market in areas with poor local transport, Jobcentre Plus advisers will offer information, advice and guidance to claimants and provide access to measures such as the Travel to Interview Scheme to help with the cost of attending interviews. We also administer the Adviser Discretion Fund, which is used to help customers overcome small challenges preventing them from taking-up the offer of employment. In appropriate circumstances, the Fund can help with travel to work costs until receipt of first wages. All awards are at adviser discretion, taking into account individual customer circumstances and all awards must represent good value for taxpayer's money.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/8" class="indent">Following the coalition Government's announcement of a new, integrated work programme coupled with a more flexible Jobcentre Plus delivery model, we aim to build upon the discretionary funding currently available to give local managers the ability to tailor services to local and individual need. This could include the provision of more help to overcome travel costs and difficulties in appropriate locations.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/9" class="indent">Over and above the schemes administered directly by Jobcentre Plus, there are a number of agreements in place (nationally and locally) to provide people with discounted travel, for example, in England and Wales, we have an agreement with the Association of Train Operating Companies, which offers a 50% discount on rail travel for longer-term unemployed people. A similar scheme is in place with Scot Rail and while there is no UK wide discount scheme for bus travel, many local operators do offer discounted services to unemployed people.</p>

	<p pid="b.869W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what provisions are in place at Jobcentre Plus centres to assist jobseekers with hearing impairments and whether interpreters are provided at each such location. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/4" class="indent">In Jobcentre Plus we recognise the diverse range of customers we serve and we are fully committed to providing equal accessibility and availability of services to all customers. Customers arriving in a Jobcentre are met by a Customer Services Manager who identifies the reason for their visit and who is able to direct them appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/5" class="indent">When a deaf or hard of hearing customer arrives at an office the Customer Services Manager takes the customer to the Customer Service Support Leader who will communicate with them at a desk set up with a hearing loop facility, if this is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/6" class="indent">If the customer is profoundly deaf or cannot use a hearing aid, a member of staff who is British Sign Language (BSL) qualified will act as interpreter. If no qualified member of staff is available, we will arrange for a communicator, for example a BSL interpreter, lip speaker or deaf/blind interpreter as appropriate, to attend the office and book an appointment for the customer to return then.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/7" class="indent">If customers wish, they may bring their own interpreters. If a customer provides their own professional qualified interpreter, they can be reimbursed with reasonable travel costs. Customers often choose to bring friends and relatives to interpret.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/8" class="indent">If the customer attends the Jobcentre to look for work, touch screen Jobpoints are available in our offices to search for and access vacancies. Staff will support the customer in progressing any applications for work, for example, by making contact with the employer.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/9" class="indent">For customers with an appointment requiring an interpreter we currently have three contracted providers that provide BSL interpreters nationally.</p>

	<p pid="b.870W.2/1">We have no plans to increase the amount paid by way of support for mortgage interest, or to change the current standard interest rate for this group.</p>
	<p pid="b.870W.2/2">It was necessary for the Government to put support for mortgage interest on a more sustainable footing, and to better reflect mortgage costs, which is why we set the standard interest rate at a level equal to the Bank of England's published monthly average mortgage rate from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase>. The rate is currently 3.63%. The previous rate of 6.08% was too generous and resulted in the vast majority of people getting more than their eligible mortgage interest liability, which was unfair to taxpayers. The plans of the previous Government would have meant that the standard interest rate would have reverted to a formula-the Bank of England base rate plus 1.58%-which, at present, would produce a rate of 2.08% from January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.870W.2/3">There are other funding streams available to households with disabled residents, for example, Disabled Facilities Grants and the Mortgage Rescue Scheme.</p>

The Mortgage Rescue Scheme was introduced in 2009 to help people in priority need, including those who are vulnerable because of old age or a physical/mental impairment. The scheme involves a Housing Association taking on full or part ownership of the property being repossessed.</p>

In the Crown court, applications for prosecution costs start at &#163;350.00 and rise substantially depending on the seriousness, complexity and plea entered. Decisions to award prosecution costs are made by presiding magistrates or judges on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.879W.5/1">The Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 requires employers carrying on business in Great Britain to insure their liability to their employees for bodily injury or disease sustained in the course of their employment. This Act ensures that those with asbestos-related diseases can claim compensation against their employers' liability insurance, where the employer has been negligent in exposing them to asbestos while at work.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.5/2">However, a recent Court of Appeal case has considered how the wording of these employers' liability insurance policies affects civil compensation for mesothelioma sufferers and we had hoped that the judgment would have provided a general principle on how these policies should deal with their mesothelioma claims. The court decided that the policies should be interpreted based on the actual policy wording, which means that some sufferers may not be able to claim compensation if the insurance policy was worded in such a way that prevents a claim from being made. We expect this judgment to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.5/3">In February 2010 the previous Government published their consultation document, 'Accessing Compensation-Supporting people who need to trace employers' liability insurance', which set out proposals for people who need to find their employers' liability insurance policies in order to claim compensation. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-05">5 May 2010</phrase>. There were two proposals; firstly an Employers' Liability Tracing Office, that would manage a database of EL policies. Secondly, an Employers' Liability Insurance Bureau which would be a compensation fund of last resort for those individuals who are unable to trace EL insurance records, ensuring they are able to receive compensation for injuries or diseases sustained during the course of their employment. We are in active discussions with all stakeholders on how this situation can be addressed and we will publish our response to the consultation in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.889W.0/1">Basophobia, a fear of falling, is one of a large number of specific phobias that generally respond well to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) although it is important that physical health issues that might make someone more likely to fall, such as low blood pressure, are checked out before psychological treatment is started. CBT is now increasingly available on the national health service as a result of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme which began in 2008 and is about half-way through its nationwide roll-out. The Chancellor announced further funding in the spending review to complete this roll-out by 2014-15. These local psychological therapies services, which are delivered in primary care, are ideal for patients with specific phobias like basophobia because of the ease with which therapists can link with the patient's general practitioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/2">With regard to research into the condition, the usual practice of the Department's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is not to ring-fence funds for expenditure on particular topics: research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available.</p>

	<p pid="b.895W.6/1">The Department has not made an estimate of the likely average amount of time per week general practitioners (GPs) will allocate to running GP consortia.</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.6/2">A fundamental principle of the new commissioning arrangements will be that every GP practice will be a member of a consortium and contribute to its goals. However, our proposed model will mean that not all GPs have to be actively involved in every aspect of commissioning. Their predominant focus will continue to be on providing high quality primary care to their patients. It is likely to be a smaller group of primary care practitioners who will lead the consortium and play an active role in the clinical design of local services.</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.6/3">Consortiums are likely to carry out a number of commissioning activities themselves. In other cases, consortiums may choose to act collectively, adopting a lead commissioner arrangement. They may also choose to buy in support from external organisations, including local authorities and private and voluntary sector bodies, which might include analytical activity to profile and stratify healthcare needs, support for procurement of services, and contract monitoring.</p>

	<p pid="b.899W.8/1">This Government are determined to do all they can to support the health and adult social care providers reduce Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). From the outset, through the Coalition Agreement, this Government made clear that they expected the national health service to adopt a zero tolerance approach to all health care associated infections (HCAIs), including MRSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.8/2">In the revision of the 2010-11 Operating Framework published in June, it was made clear that the NHS should continue prioritising the achievement of the MRSA objective. The successful implementation of this objective will deliver both an overall reduction nationally and, importantly, will reduce variation by moving all organisations towards the performance of the best.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.8/3">At the same time, the revision of the Operating Framework confirmed that it expected and required the NHS to implement MRSA screening of all relevant emergency admissions by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.8/4">In terms of using the availability of data as a driver to supporting further reductions in MRSA, we have introduced weekly data publication of both MRSA blood stream infections and Clostridium difficile infections at hospital site level.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.8/5">We are also committed to ensuring that the NHS continue to have access to evidence based guidance in order that they can reduce the number of all HCAIs, including MRSA, through the implementation of effective infection prevention and control practices. This guidance is available on the Department of Health's &quot;Clean, Safe Care&quot; website.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.8/6">The Health and Social Care Act 2008 &quot;Code of Practice for health and adult social care on the Prevention and Control of Infections and related guidance&quot;, which the Care Quality Commission uses as a basis for assessing compliance with the registration requirement on cleanliness and infection control has been a driver for improvement in the hospital setting. The scope of the Code has already been extended to adult social care settings and will include primary care in due course so that we can ensure that all settings where patients receive care and treatment operate comparable infection prevention and control practices.</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.5/1">The spending review recognised the importance of social care to hundreds of thousands of adults of all ages, backgrounds and identities: supporting their independence and helping them to make full and active contributions to their communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.5/2">In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.5/3">We have achieved this by:</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.5/4" class="indent">The national health service transferring some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will rise to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15, and will promote improved joint working between the health and social care systems. Further details will be set out in the NHS Operating Framework 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.5/5" class="indent">Additional grant funding, rising to &#163;1 billion by 2014-15, will be made available for social care. This funding will be allocated in addition to the Department's existing social care grants, which will rise in line with inflation. Total grant funding from the Department for social care will reach &#163;2.4 billion by 2014-15. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding will go to authorities through the revenue support grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.5/6">This means that, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to care and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.5/7">A key priority for the Government is a radical devolution of power away from central Government, freeing local government from central control and empowering local people to take an active role in services. Decisions on spending at a local level must be considered in the context of local priorities, which are crafted by local authorities in response to the needs and wishes of the people they serve. Spending on social care will therefore be a decision for the relevant local authority, and it is not possible to provide a central estimate.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.5/1">Approval has been received recently from the Cabinet Office Efficiency and Reform Group for a further wave of the Act FAST Stroke awareness campaign to go ahead. The current intention is for the television adverts to run in March 2011, supported by distribution of other materials locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.5/2">The evaluation we commissioned from the advertising agency which was awarded the contract for developing the stroke awareness campaign, showed that the campaign successfully achieved a rapid change in behaviour: within a year, an estimated 9,864 more people reached hospital faster, 642 of whom were saved from death or serious disability by receiving thrombolysis. The evidence demonstrated that the campaign achieved a payback of &#163;3.16 for every &#163;1 spent. On this basis the agency submitted an entry to the 2010 Institute of Professional Advertisers Effectiveness Awards and, in November, achieved a Gold Award.</p>
