	<p pid="b.326W.6/1">The UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) records that 15,301 hectares of poppy crop was eradicated across Afghanistan in 2006, with 95.8 per cent. of the eradication occurring after January 2006. In 2007, some 7,112 hectares of poppy have been eradicated to date. No Afghan province has been covered by spraying. The Government of Afghanistan (GoA) decided, after wide consultation and internal discussion, against the use of ground-based and aerial spraying on opium poppy crops this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.6/2">No direct aid has been given to opium farmers who have had their fields eradicated as this would be contrary to the GoA policy. The policy of the Afghanistan Government is to target eradication on areas where alternative livelihoods already exist. Therefore only those farmers who have alternatives will experience poppy eradication. In support of the GoA's National Drug Control Strategy (NCDS), the UK is playing a major role in supporting the development of legal livelihood opportunities in Afghanistan. DFID's Livelihood Programme is worth &pound;150 million over three years, the majority of which is channelled through three National Priority Programmes which address the multiple constraints that prevent farmers from moving away from poppy cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.6/3">DFID's support for the National Rural Access Programme (NRAP) is helping to build essential infrastructure such as irrigation schemes, roads and bridges. This provides much needed infrastructure for economic development and also construction jobs for Afghans at the same time. DFID gave &pound;18 million in 2005-06 for this purpose. Nearly 9,500 km of roads have been built or repaired, as well as schools, health clinics and water schemes. So far the programme has generated over 15 million days of labour.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.6/4">DFID's support for the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) is helping local communities through elected community development councils (CDC's) identify what development is most needed in their areas and then receive grants to undertake the work. DFID is providing &pound;17 million to support NSP which has established over 16,000 CDCs across Afghanistan and funded over 22,000 projects in the areas of agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power supply, transport and water supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.6/5">DFID support to the Micro-Finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA) is helping Afghans to invest in income-generating activities and increase their savings. DFID is providing &pound;20 million over three years to help give small loans of around &pound;100 to the poor, including farmers, who cannot get credit from banks. So far, over &pound;90 million worth of loans have been given to over 230,000 Afghans including farmers, shopkeepers, tailors and builders.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.6/6">DFID has established a &pound;3 million Research in Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF) in Afghanistan for applied research into natural resource-based livelihoods. The programme is looking at improved forage and milk production, the introduction of legumes, vegetable crops and saffron, and the medicinal properties of mint as viable alternatives to poppy production for farmers. Mint and saffron are showing early signs of success. The export feasibility of grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms and eggplants is also being examined. This also includes natural products, and post-harvest processing and rural services.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.6/7">In addition, DFID funds the Development of Sustainable Agriculture Livelihoods Project in the Eastern Hazarajat (SALEH) which provides new and innovative ways for farmers to make a living in Eastern Hazarajat e.g. honey bee keeping and potato farming.</p>
	<p pid="b.326W.6/8">Afghan farmers often make their living through a combination of activities. These may change throughout the year, and include agriculture (crops and livestock); employment (migrant labour); remittances (from family members working away from home); and welfare (for vulnerable groups not able to work). DFID therefore supports a wide range of activities to help farmers move away from poppy cultivation and adopt alternative forms of livelihoods.</p>

	<p pid="b.328W.0/1">In 2005 DFID contributed &pound;3 million towards a USAID Agriculture Inputs Supply Programme worth $25 million. This programme helped poor and vulnerable farmers across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan gain improved access to subsidised agricultural inputs in order to increase their production of legal crops. The programme has distributed 40,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser and nearly 15,000 tonnes of seed (wheat, potato, onion and carrots) to 537,000 farmers in all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.0/2">DFID and USAID found the programme could be made sustainable into the longer-term by supporting input supplies and offering farmers access to credit. USAID now has an input supply programme and DFID is a major donor to the Micro-Finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA). This offers small loans to poor people, including farmers, who would otherwise not have access to credit. DFID is providing &pound;20 million to MISFA over a three year period.</p>

	<p pid="b.328W.3/10">DFID's programme in Afghanistan has gradually shifted from humanitarian assistance in the immediate post-conflict environment (&pound;44 million in 2001) to longer-term, sustainable development support to the Government of Afghanistan. We now focus on three key areas; building effective state institutions; improving economic management and the effectiveness with which the Afghan Government uses aid; and improving the livelihoods of rural people.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.3/11">This year DFID has is providing &pound;1 million for drought mitigation, to fund NGOs working with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) on water and sanitation projects in the most affected areas. DFID has also provided &pound;30,000 in food aid and other essential items for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Helmand. The UN has estimated that around 2,800 families have been displaced.

	<p pid="b.329W.9/1">The most recent reliable data available for water supplies in Iraq come from the Iraq living conditions survey carried out in 2004 by the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation and the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.329W.9/2">The 2004 UN survey found that in urban areas, 99 per cent. of households have access to safe drinking water (but for 33 per cent. the supply is unreliable). In rural areas, 6 per cent. of households have access to safe drinking water (but for 22 per cent. the supply is unreliable). Since 2003, donors (including DFID) have worked hard to restore supplies. As a result, the US Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) estimates that an additional 5.4 million Iraqis have improved access to drinking water.</p>
	<p pid="b.329W.9/3">IRMO estimate that electricity generation since July 2006 has fluctuated between 3,000 megawatts (MW) and 5,350 MW. The average for 2006 was 4,400 MW, just above the pre-2003 level. During the week of 1-<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March</phrase>, electricity availability averaged just under six hours per day in Baghdad, 12 hours in Basra and 16 hours in Nasiriyah.</p>
	<p pid="b.329W.9/4">Although 5,000 MW have been added to the national grid since 2003, electricity generation in Iraq is not meeting demand. This is due to several reasons: old and dilapidated infrastructure; a result of years of under-investment and mismanagement; shortage of fuel supplies; and sabotage of key facilities. Furthermore, demand has increased considerably to over 9,000 MW, with the influx of electrical goods such as refrigerators, televisions and air conditioning units.</p>

The proposed changes involve a cessation of on-site cover at weekends and Bank holidays.

One of the key aims is to provide training to help professionals identify and work with children with additional needs. Early identification and intervention is also central to the new statutory framework for children from birth to five, the Early Years Foundation Stage, which comes into force in September 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.347W.0/1">The School Meals Review Panel (SMRP) was established by DfES in May 2005 to advise on standards for school lunches. The SMRP's 'Turning the Tables - Transforming School Food' report, published in October 2005, set out their recommendations to Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/2">The SMRP's report recommended that new combined 'food' and 'nutrient' based standards were needed to bring about effective changes to school lunches and should replace the previous standards introduced in 2001. The report included references to the published scientific studies that were considered during the panel's deliberations. The full report can be viewed at:</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.schoolfoodtrust.org.uk/documents.asp?DocCatld=1">http://www.schoolfoodtrust.org.uk/documents.asp?DocCatld=1</a></p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/4">The first phase of the changes to school lunches began with the introduction, in September, of the Education (Nutritional Standards for School Lunches) (England) Regulations 2006. Schools will need to adhere to final 'food' and 'nutrient' based lunch standards by September 2008 (primary schools) and September 2009 (secondary schools). These will be set out in later regulations that will be laid before Parliament later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/5">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is an independent Government Department established to protect the public's health and consumer interests in relation to food. It advises DFES on scientific and technical aspects including food safety, nutrition and diet.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/6">Officials from the FSA acted as observers at SMRP meetings and provided technical advice to DfES on those issues that fell within its remit. This advice was broadly supportive of those aspects of the SMRP's recommendations that were within the FSA's remit and assisted with the formulation of the 2006 Regulations. The FSA's advice was provided in line with its nutrition policy, which is informed by considerations of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition and formerly the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/7">The Nutritional Standards for School Lunches introduced in September 2006 implemented all of the SMRP's 'food based' recommendations, with a minor amendment to acceptable drinks:</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/8" class="indent">A reduction to the amount of added sugar in milk based drinks from no more than 10 per cent. to no more than 5 per cent.;</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/9" class="indent">The addition of soya drinks enriched with calcium as an additional option.</p>

	<p pid="b.348W.4/1">At the EU spring summit on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March</phrase> member states, including the UK, agreed to set a minimum target for biofuels of 10 per cent. share of total petrol and diesel consumption to be introduced in a cost-efficient way in Europe by 2020 subject to a number of conditions. In particular, the target should be binding only if production of the biofuels is sustainable, second-generation biofuels become commercially available and the Fuel Quality Directive is amended to allow for adequate levels of blending.</p>
	<p pid="b.348W.4/2">These conditions are broadly consistent with the conditions the Government have proposed in relation to the future development of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) that is due to start in April 2008. A consultation on the long-term future of the RTFO is currently under way. The RTFO will require transport fuel suppliers to ensure that 5 per cent. of their total transport fuel sale comes from biofuels by 2010-11. The Government have made clear that they are committed to increasing the level of the RTFO beyond 5 per cent. provided that similar conditions around sustainability, technical feasibility and costs to consumers are met and that it represents an effective use of our biomass resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.3/1">From April 2006 to February 2007, small scale community projects received grant support through the Low Carbon Buildings programme Phase 1. Since February they have been signposted through Phase 2. The change is the result of high demand for grants from householders. In October 2006, we re-allocated funds from within the programme to increase funds available to householders from &pound;6.5 million to &pound;12.7 million. To facilitate that increase in householder funding, we also took the decision to move the majority of small scale community projects to Phase 2 of the Low Carbon Buildings programme from February 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.3/2">Phase 2, with a &pound;50 million budget announced in Budget 2006, supports projects in the public and not for profit sectors with the specific aim of driving down the cost of microgeneration technologies. Phase 2 has a significant budget, which should continue to provide excellent support to small scale community projects. The plan is to commit the majority of the budget between now and March 2008, however, some projects are likely to complete over the following years.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.3/3">Small scale community projects can also continue to apply to Phase 1 Stream 2 through to March 2009, although this is a competitive process more geared to larger projects.</p>

The report recommended that managers and teachers should monitor the incidences of ethnic and religion-based bullying and this area should explicitly be included within school policies. The research is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.deni.gov.uk/rb8_2002.pdf">www.deni.gov.uk/rb8_2002.pdf</a> I have also arranged for a copy to be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.368W.13/2">There are no proposals to make carbon monoxide (CO) alarms free of charge to pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.368W.13/3">However, all Fire and Rescue Services in England have discretion to extend their Home Fire Risk Checks for vulnerable households to provide a free CO alarm, in addition to installation of a free smoke alarm. Similar arrangements are being considered in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.368W.13/4">There are also other Government initiatives aimed at helping pensioners with gas and heating expenses. These include schemes such as WarmFront, Home Energy Efficiency and WarmDeal, which provide grants for the replacement or repair of heating systems to eligible people receiving certain benefits. In addition, the Priority Services Register enables pensioners to have a free annual gas safety check by their gas supplier.</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.2/1">The allocation of a national insurance number (NINO) is dependent upon satisfying certain employment and benefit-related criteria. Individuals who are employed, self-employed, in receipt of benefit, or the partner of a benefit claimant can be eligible for a NINO.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.2/2">A non-working Bulgarian or Romanian national would be allocated with a NINO in order to apply for a benefit subject to satisfying the relevant benefit entitlement criteria and identity requirements. There are limited circumstances in which benefit entitlement would arise. For example a highly skilled migrant who holds an EEA registration certificate annotated to say that they have unrestricted access to the UK labour market and who meets the normal conditions of entitlement for income-based jobseeker's allowance would have benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.2/3">A &quot;right to work&quot; condition was introduced into the NINO allocation and decision making process for employment-related applications. This was implemented in July 2006. Bulgarian and Romanian nationals who apply for a NINO for the purposes of self-employment will need to provide proof of their right to work in the UK, their self-employment status, and their identity before a NINO would be allocated.</p>

	<p pid="b.375W.2/1">Any successful bid for a Pathways to Work contract will need to address the needs of all customers, taking into account the range of different health conditions and disabilities, on a tailored and flexible basis. We have no plans to set Pathways to Work contractors targets for particular disability groups. The Pathways approach to employment support is designed to treat each customer as an individual rather than as a member of a particular group or sub-group. Targets based on condition would frustrate this approach and ignore the fact that customers often have multiple health problems and barriers to work.</p>

However, early findings from the independent research conducted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (Early quantitative evidence on the impact of the Pathways to Work pilots, DWP Research Report No. 354), shows for all participants a 9.5 per cent. increase in the proportion of people who are employed 10 and a half months after claiming incapacity benefit. For participants over the age of 45, the increase in the proportion of people who are employed 10 and a half months after claiming incapacity benefit was 12 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.377W.2/4">Our internal analysis has found that in terms of the net impact of Pathways to Work, those with a mental health or behavioural disorder have fared as well as other customers in terms of off-flows from benefit. One-to-one research with personal advisers and practitioners has found many examples of incapacity benefit customers helped by our Condition Management Pathways in Pathways areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.377W.5/1">The UK has a full reciprocal social security agreement with the United States covering a range of contributory social security benefits for people moving between the countries, including provision allowing annual UK state pension uprating increases to be paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.377W.5/2">The arrangement with Canada is very limited in scope and does not allow annual UK state pension uprating increases. The arrangement, which was first entered into in 1959, helps only persons coming to the UK from Canada. For retirement pension purposes, it allows former residents of Canada to qualify for an enhanced amount of UK basic state pension by treating periods of residence in Canada as periods when UK national insurance contributions had been paid, provided the person has resided in the UK for 10 years following arrival or return here. There is no corresponding arrangement that would help a person going from the UK to Canada to qualify for either UK or Canadian benefits on taking up residence there.</p>
	<p pid="b.377W.5/3">An agreement between the UK and the USA, which was concluded in 1969, allowed future annual uprating increases that became payable after its coming into force to be paid to UK pensioners living in the USA. Talks were subsequently held with Canada about a possible similar agreement. However, Canadian legislation prevented payment of Canadian old age security pension (COASP) under reciprocal agreements with other countries, ruling out the scope for reciprocity in the export of pensions. Although this legislation was amended in 1977 to allow COASP to be paid outside Canada, UK Ministers at that time decided, in line with the UK's general policy on frozen pensions, that insufficient resources were available for increasing the rates of UK pension payable in Canada. The arrangement between the UK and Canada was updated at the time, to reflect the developments in Canadian legislation, but the changes to it were limited to ensuring that there was no double concurrent provision of both countries' pensions for former Canadian residents living in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.382W.9/1">The UK and the EU take every opportunity in the UN Human Rights Council and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, to express our continuing concerns about Belarus's human rights record. The UN Special Rapporteur on Belarus presented a report to the Human Rights Council in September 2006. The EU spoke in the council's dialogue with the Rapporteur, expressing concern about the further weakening of the independence of the judiciary, intimidation of civil society activists, detention of political prisoners, and the situation of minority groups in Belarus. We will continue to use dialogues with the Special Rapporteur on Belarus, and other relevant UN Special Rapporteurs, to register our concerns and press for improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.382W.9/2">In November 2006, EU members co-sponsored a resolution on Belarus in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. It was duly adopted there and subsequently in the plenary session of the General Assembly. The resolution expressed deep concern at the deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus, including Belarus's failure to co-operate with the UN human rights mechanisms; its failure to conduct free and fair elections, including the detention and arrest of political and civil society activists; and persistent reports of harassment and closure of non-governmental organisations, national minority groups, independent media outlets, religious groups, opposition political parties and independent trade unions.</p>

European Union Foreign Ministers decided in January to implement the measures broadly. We hope that these sanctions, and any further measures introduced as a result of discussions currently under way in the Security Council, will persuade Iran to suspend its enrichment-related, reprocessing and heavy water related activities which will permit a resumption of negotiations. There are signs that UN sanctions are beginning to influence the internal debate within Iran.</p>

	<p pid="b.387W.3/1">The Local Government White Paper (LGWP), published in October 2006, highlighted the multiplicity of community consultation and engagement strategies in local authorities, including the Statement of Community Involvement for Local Development Frameworks. It concluded that in order to secure co-ordinated consultation and engagement across local authority activity we want the local authority and its partners to have the flexibility to draw up more comprehensive engagement strategies. We plan to issue guidance on these comprehensive strategies in autumn 2007 for consultation, to be published in spring 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.388W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.3/2">Any costs to businesses arising from these Regulations were taken into account in the assessment of the overall costs of implementing the new duty for service providers that came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>. This duty requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments to physical features of their premises in order to improve access for disabled people to their services.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.3/3">The only costs that are likely to occur are where a service provider in leased premises is required to seek consent for an alteration to the premises. These are expected to be minimal. Other provisions in the Regulations set out circumstances in which a service provider is not required to make, or therefore incur the cost of, reasonable adjustments to a physical feature.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.3/4">There will be no costs to regulators, since there is no regulator responsible for enforcing the reasonable adjustment duties of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Enforcement is by the individual disabled person who considers that he or she has been discriminated against by a service provider who fails to make a reasonable adjustment.</p>

	<p pid="b.393W.8/3">The Home Office continues to explore opportunities to further increase the amount of renewable electricity acquired from renewable sources both with suppliers and through self generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.393W.8/4">The Department has recently agreed a strategy that will enable us to address the remaining SOGE energy targets which require improvements in energy efficiency, reduction in carbon emissions and offsetting those emissions that cannot be reduced. Our central sustainable development policy team will shortly begin work on action plans to meet the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.393W.8/5" class="indent">increased Combined Heat and Power (CHP) uptake via central energy procurement initiatives and within new builds and major refurbishment projects</p>
	<p pid="b.393W.8/6" class="indent">introducing pilot schemes as a first step towards a fully fledged carbon neutrality strategy for the office estate</p>
	<p pid="b.393W.8/7" class="indent">participation in the OGC benchmarking scheme for the office estate which, among other aspects, looks at energy performance and will inform the setting of improvement targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.393W.8/8">These initiatives will be supported by more reliable data systems that will be realised through our new shared service operations, as well as by procurement initiatives and funding for energy efficiency programmes to reduce emissions and for carbon offset projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.394W.2/2">The Crime Reduction website promotes positive crime reduction messages from a broad range of organisations&mdash;governmental and non-governmental&mdash;both from within the UK and overseas and is aimed at practitioners working to reduce criminal activity. The Respect website, which replaced the Together website in October 2006, aims to inform a broader range of practitioners about dealing with antisocial behaviour by tackling the underlying causes, how to intervene early where problems occur and how to work closely with local communities to effect sustainable improvements. Both websites have been designed to meet the different information needs of these two audiences and are not aimed at providing information for the public generally. We have no plans to merge these sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.2/3">The annual cost for the technical support of the Crime Reduction site for 2006 is &pound;113, 307. The accumulated costs for the Respect website for 2006-07 are &pound;73,000. There are no associated running costs with the Together website as it is hosted by the Home Office and is no longer updated. Visitors to the site are signposted to the Respect website.</p>

	<p pid="b.398W.5/1">The Contract Supplementary Hours scheme was first introduced in April 2001 to overcome staff recruitment and retention difficulties in the South East which were affecting the Prison Service's ability to deliver decent prisoner regimes. The scheme was extended across the Prison Service from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-30">30 April 2002</phrase> to provide operational flexibility and arrangements were formalised through Prison Service Instruction 26/2003 in June 2003. The scheme can be activated locally by individual Governors when staff vacancies occur in order to maintain regime delivery. Participation on the scheme is entirely voluntary.</p>

	<p pid="b.398W.8/1">Since 2001, the Prison Service has had in place a system of local pay allowance specifically targeting areas where recruitment and retention difficulties have been identified. In addition the &quot;headstart&quot; scheme allows Governors in areas where retention and recruitment is particularly demanding to appoint new staff on an enhanced level of basic pay at a point above the standard entry level. These measures, together with changes to recruitment procedures, have enabled the public sector Prison Service to increase prison officer recruitment from under 500 new staff in 2001 to over 1,700 new staff in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.408W.12/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how much and what proportion of disposable income was paid on average in (a) direct taxes, (b) indirect taxes by (i) working age households with dependent children, (ii) working age households without dependent children and (iii) pensioner households, broken down by income decile in each of the last three years. (126508)</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/4" class="indent">Estimates of the proportion of income paid in both direct and indirect taxes appear in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS), which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. The analysis for 2005/06 will be published on the National Statistics website on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-17">17 May 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/5" class="indent">The tables below show the amount of direct and indirect taxes paid by each of the three different types of household. They also show the average payment of direct and indirect taxes as a proportion of income. However, since disposable income is that received after the payment of direct taxes, the proportion of disposable income paid in direct taxes is zero by definition. So only indirect taxes are shown as a proportion of disposable income. To enable a comparison, both direct and indirect taxes have been shown as a proportion of gross income.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/6" class="indent">Figures have been provided for the last three years, and they have been taken from (or calculated from) figures appearing in the three most recent 'effects of taxes and benefits' articles, those for 2002/03, 2003/04, and 2004/05. The figures for non-retired households with children have been taken from Table 21, the figures for non-retired households without children from Table 20, and the figures for retired households from Table 18. Retired households are those where the income of retired household members accounts for more than half of the household gross income.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/7" class="indent">Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, intermediate taxes (see background notes), and a number of smaller items such as television licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/8" class="indent">When comparing estimates over these three years, it should be remembered that the estimates are based on a sample, and that there is some uncertainty around the estimates. While there will have been some changes in the taxes paid by households over this period, the underlying changes are difficult to distinguish from the movements arising from sampling error, especially in the figures for decile groups. Given this, these figures are best interpreted as indicating the average level of tax payments over this three year period, rather than interpreting them as measuring how the tax burden has changed over these three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/9" class="indent">There was a change to the way that tax credits were treated from 2003/04 onwards. Up until 2002/03 tax credits were treated as cash benefits. From 2003/04, they are classified as negative income tax, but only to the extent that income tax less tax credits, remains greater than or equal to zero for each family. So for households paying relatively little or no income tax, tax credit payments were still regarded either partially or wholly, as cash benefits. Based on figures for 2003/04, the effect of this change was to reduce the overall estimate of direct taxes as a proportion of gross income for all households, by 0.3%.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/10" class="indent">Indirect taxes, when expressed as a proportion of either gross or disposable income appears particularly high for the bottom income decile, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. Estimates of indirect taxes are estimated based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. This is especially true for the bottom income decile where average measured income is significantly lower than average expenditure. For these households, indirect taxes (which reflect expenditure) are not being met solely from current income, and so indirect taxes are very high when expressed as a proportion of either gross or disposable income.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.12/11" class="indent">There are a number of plausible reasons why for some households, expenditure might exceed income. Households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower decile in particular includes some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received because of timing differences.</p>

The EIB, of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a Governor, has established a dedicated unit taking forward the initiative. Already, a number of instruments have been advanced including, for example, the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) and an increased contribution to the TENs Investment Facility.

	<p pid="b.414W.11/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary questions about asking (1) the current proportion of each strategic health authority's resident population; and (2) the projected population size, and proportion of the population, of each strategic health authority in 2010, 2020 and 2030, aged (a) over state pension age (b) 65 or over, (c) 75 or over, (d) 85 or over, (e) 95 or over, (f) 100 or over. (126551 and 126609)</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.11/4" class="indent">Table 1 shows the proportion of each strategic health authority's resident population aged over state pension age, 65 or over, 75 or over, 85 or over and 90 or over. These data are calculated from the estimates of the population at mid-2005 and are the latest available. They are not available for the age groups 95 or over and 100 or over.</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.11/5" class="indent">Tables 2a, 2b and 2c show the projected population size of each strategic health authority, as well as. the projected population size and the projected proportion of the population that are aged over state pension age, 65 or over, 75 or over and 85 or over, for the years 2010, 2020 and 2029 respectively. These data are from the sub-national population projections based on the mid-2004 population estimates. These projections only run for 25 years and are therefore only available to 2029. They are not available for the age groups 95 or over and 100 or over.</p>

These will help SMEs develop transnational business activities and help them find compatible business partners in the North West Europe region. Small and medium-sized enterprises from the UK have not yet had the opportunity to benefit from the STIMUTRAN-SME project as the TMCs have not yet commenced operations, but will do so shortly.</p>

Outputs for other areas, including parliamentary constituencies, will continue to be released as long as they are required. These will be created either from the source data or via best fitting or estimation from the core units.

Risks to health and how to avoid them,&quot; distributed early in 2006 to all general practitioners surgeries in England, which provides information on the symptoms of CO poisoning, ways in which to prevent poisoning and the contact details of organisations and other Government Departments involved with the prevention of CO poisoning. This leaflet has been endorsed by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Heating Equipment Testing and Approval Scheme, the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI), the national voluntary organisation CO-Gas Safety, the Solid Fuel Association, and the national health service, and includes the CORGI emergency helpline. The leaflet, which is available in the Library, is also available free, from the Department's publication stores and on the Department's website at:</p>

However, migration is taken account of within the population base used for revenue allocations. The population base is a combination of Office for National Statistics (ONS) populations and general practitioners lists. ONS add asylum seekers to their population estimates using data provided by the Home Office. All removal centres have primary healthcare provision on site. National health service services are only used, therefore, when detainees cannot be treated within the on-site Home Office funded primary care services.</p>

It sets out clear guidance to the national health service on how to reduce waiting times and how to provide the additional 300,000 pathways that are needed in the run-up to December 2008 to make a maximum wait of 18 weeks from referral to treatment possible for all audiology referrals. It aims to mitigate the risk to 18-week delivery and create a sustainable service model for audiology for the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.433W.5/2">The most complex audiology cases will be covered by the target of treatment within 18 weeks of referral by December 2008. And the remaining routine adult hearing loss cases should be assessed within six weeks by March 2008, in line with the diagnostic waiting time milestone on which local commissioning plans are based. It is also good practice for the subsequent hearing aid fitting to be carried out soon after or at the same time as assessment.</p>

However, the Healthcare Commission conducts an annual health check of national health service organisations and since 2005-06 has been using participation in national clinical audits as part of the health check for NHS trusts. The Healthcare Commission is currently considering whether to include measurement not only of participation in audits, but also of data completeness and quality in its annual health check.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.11/2">The Department is currently developing a cancer reform strategy. In developing the strategy, the Department is specifically looking at how to strengthen commissioning of cancer services and how to improve the information available on clinical outcomes. Discussions are under way on improving clinical outcomes data including the use of comparative information such as that provided through the NCASP audits. We expect to publish the cancer reform strategy by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.441W.3/1">The spine is the colloquial name given to the national database of key information about patients' health and care which forms the core of the NHS care records service, and which, from later this year, will begin to hold summary care records. Detailed patient records are created, and can be held electronically, in a variety of national health service organisations, depending on where patients have received treatment. They are accessed locally, and will not, unlike summary records, be uploaded on to the spine.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/2">It will be open to individuals to choose not to have a summary care record through discussion with their general practitioner (GP). General practices will be responsible for entering care records on the system, and by the time the summary care record is introduced in local areas general practitioners will have been provided with guidance on what they need to do to respond to requests. GPs will be advised to record and act on patient preferences.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/3">We believe that holding summary care records on the spine will deliver very significant benefits for safety and the efficient management of NHS services, improving healthcare outcomes for millions whilst preventing thousands of unnecessary deaths. Inevitably patients whose record was not held on the spine, and who might need to be treated in the absence of knowledge of the information they contain, would not receive the same quality of care as others.</p>

	<p pid="b.447W.8/1">The Department does not hold data which link treatment to disease. Because of the number of different diagnostic and treatment episodes a patient with osteoporosis and any concurrent condition may undergo, the Department cannot record spending on an individual illness or condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.8/2">The capital provision of &pound;17 million to improve national health service capacity in dual X-ray absorptiometer (DXA) scanning provision in the diagnosis of osteoporosis has been included in strategic health authorities' (SHA) strategic capital allocation and is not ring-fenced. Whilst the Department does not monitor how SHA strategic capital is spent, it has been clear in its expectations that this funding is spent exclusively on DXA provision. In May 2006, the national director for older people, Professor Ian Philp, wrote to SHAs to highlight the importance of DXA scanning in delivering the relevant elements of the national service framework for older people.</p>
