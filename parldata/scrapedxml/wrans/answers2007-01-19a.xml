In order to cap, the Secretary of State must decide if an authority's budget requirement is excessive; she would do this by determining capping principles.

	<p pid="a.1349W.6/1">Planning Policy Statement 3&mdash;Housing requires local authorities to set targets in local plans for the amount of affordable housing to be delivered in their area. These targets should reflect current and future levels of need, the new definition of affordable housing, and the viability of land for housing in their area, including likely levels of grant and developer contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.6/2">Local authorities are required to submit annual monitoring reports (AMRs) to the Secretary of State through Government offices. These report the extent to which policies, including affordable housing policies, in local development documents are being successfully implemented. Where appropriate, AMRs should set out the actions that authorities will take to address any underperformance. The Housing Corporation also monitors the delivery of the majority of affordable homes, which are funded by social housing grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.6/3">There are checks within the planning system to ensure local planning authorities (LPAs) meet affordable housing targets. If they fail to propose an acceptable target in their plans, the Secretary of State may call in a plan or direct them to modify the target. In terms of delivering the target, PPS3 requires LPAs to develop implementation strategies in their plans. The Secretary of Sate my also call in planning applications where they raise issues of wider strategic importance or represent a departure from the plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356W.0/3">The &pound;100,000 additional provision for the East of England Development Agency is funding for the Essex Green Grid environmental projects which were not completed in the previous financial year. The Essex Green Grid is a strategy for developing the urban and rural environment through the linking of green spaces via environmental improvements, greenways, cycle routes etc.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356W.0/5">An increase of &pound;274,000 was made to the Department's annual budget for right to buy revaluations, reflecting a rise in the charge made by the Valuation Office Agency for revaluations requested by tenants. However, the number of right to buy applications has since fallen significantly and fewer tenants have therefore requested revaluations. As a consequence, it is unlikely that the additional &pound;274,000 will now be required for reimbursement payments to the agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356W.0/7">The &pound;7.7 million for mapping and data services is expenditure on the Pan-Government Agreement, a collective purchasing agreement to provide geographic information to central Government. The expenditure represents other Departments' share of the cost of the agreement and is fully offset by income from them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356W.0/9">The transfer of &pound;1,160,000 relates to the costs of functions which transferred from the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to the new Deputy Prime Minister's Office in the machinery of government changes of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May 2006</phrase>.</p>

The settlement increased the defence budget by &pound;747 million across the CSR98 period, which in real terms represented a reduction of 2.4 per cent.

	<p pid="a.1367W.5/2">Careful assessment has concluded that it is unlikely over the life of the next generation of submarines there will be any radical technological breakthrough that might diminish materially the current advantages of the submarine over anti-submarine systems. Provided we continue to invest in suitable research and development on effective counter-measures, we believe the risks to the submarines operating under the surface on patrol will remain manageable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1371W.5/1">The armed forces recognise that a degree of separation from home and family is an accepted part of service life and take this into account when calculating harmony, a manpower planning tool used to define force structures. The services report against two guidelines: an individual harmony guideline which stipulates the maximum length of separated service that an individual should serve within any given period, and defined tour intervals to determine the frequency with which formed units (an infantry battalion, for example) should deploy on operations. Both measures are important because, at times, personnel deploy with units other than their own to fill gaps. Due to different operating patterns, guidelines for the three services vary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/2">Army harmony guidelines are that individuals should not exceed 415 days of separated service in any period of 30 months. At unit level, tour intervals should be no less than 24 months. Royal Navy harmony guidelines are that no individual should exceed 660 days of separated service in a three year rolling period. Over a similar time span, ships or other units should not be deployed for more than 60 per cent. of their time. Royal Air Force harmony guidelines are that no more than 2.5 per cent. of individual personnel should serve more than 140 days of detached duty in any period of 12 months, while unit tour intervals should not be less than 16 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1376W.0/1">Local authorities working with their partners in children's trusts are responsible for the overall delivery of the Sure Start children's centres programme in England. They are responsible for planning, securing value for money and ensuring overall quality in children's centres. We are encouraging them to involve private, voluntary and independent organisations both in managing children's centres and as service providers. Information on how many children's centres are managed by public sector organisations, voluntary sector, independent and other providers is not collected centrally. A survey of early children's centres shows around 58 per cent. of child care provision in children's centres is provided by the private, voluntary and independent sector, and around 82 per cent. of children's centres have contracts with voluntary sector organisations for delivering services. Responsibility for children's centres in Wales lies with the Welsh Assembly.</p>

External contributors can be used where they add to the drug education programme a dimension that the teacher alone cannot deliver.

	<p pid="a.1379W.0/2">The Revenue Support Grant (RSG) for local authorities, as distributed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, is an un-hypothecated block grant. It is therefore not possible to identify amounts within the RSG provided for a particular purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.1387W.2/2">The consultation on the Care Matters Green Paper is ongoing and it is therefore too early to provide useful information about the representations received on this issue. Once the consultation period has ended a summary of responses will be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.2/3">Gross expenditure by local authorities on looked after children was: &pound;1,932,732k in 2004-05 (the latest available year); &pound;1,765,279k in 2003-04; and &pound;1,567,589k in 2002-03. In 1996-97 the expenditure was &pound;964,999k.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.2/4">The figures relate to expenditure by local authorities on local after children and reported on return EXP1. Local authorities use a number of sources of funding to pay for looked after children services including the Revenue Support Grant, Council tax, Uniform Business rates and charges. Information on the level of funding by voluntary and charitable sources or other independent sources is not collected centrally.</p>

The total funding figures only run to 2005-06 because we cannot provide a consistent time series beyond that year as the introduction of the Dedicated School Grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. The 2004-05 and 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EPS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the DSG which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.<br/> 2. Dedicated School Grant (DSG) has a different coverage to EFS: EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions whereas DSG only covers the schools block. LEA block items are still funded through Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG's) Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means that we have a break in our time series as the two sets of data are not comparable; an alternative time series is currently under development.<br/> 3. To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, we have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. There are other grants that support the schools budget, these are not included in the provided DSG figures as some of these grant figures are not yet available.<br/> 4. These figures are in cash terms and include the pensions transfer.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1393W.0/1">I have received no representations relating to the National Audit Office's report on Sure Start Children's Centres. I welcome the report's confirmation that children's centres are successfully improving services for families with young children and that families value children's centres services. We have already addressed the report's main recommendations through issuing revised practice, planning and performance management guidance for local authorities and centres. In addition &quot;Together for Children&quot;, the consortium appointed to support local authorities during the children's centre roll-out, have produced a toolkit which features advice and case studies on reaching families at greatest risk of social exclusion. We continue to consider what further action is needed to address other issues raised in the report.</p>

From those expressions of interest, 47 schools were originally selected to become pathfinders, but the number of schools involved in the programme has since increased to 71.</p>

However, this is a school driven policy, and outside of the pathfinder and early adopter programmes schools do not have to &quot;apply&quot; to acquire a trust. It will be for the governing body of a school to decide whether or not it wishes to acquire trust status, which organisations will make up the school's trust, and to consult local stakeholders on its proposals.</p>

They are due to come into force in early summer 2007 alongside regulations&mdash;which are currently out for consultation&mdash;that will implement these provisions. Until that point, no school is able to acquire a trust under the provisions of the 2006 Act. We expect to see the first trust schools, as defined by the provisions of the 2006 Act, operating from the autumn term 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.1399W.3/1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in 1999 that the total climate change impact of aviation is between two and four times greater than that of its CO2 emissions alone. More recent research in 2000 by the European Commission's TRADEOFF project suggested that the total climate change impact of aviation up to 2000 was 1.9 times greater than its CO2 impact alone. This is known as the radiative forcing index. The non-CO2 effect is caused by some of the other emissions released by aircraft, including nitrous oxides, particulates and water vapour, and their specific effects at altitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.3/2">For the purposes of the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund, DEFRA has decided to recognise the more recent TRADEOFF work and use a multiplier of two when calculating the climate impacts of aviation, to reflect the most recent and robust scientific evidence currently available. This decision will be kept under review as further scientific evidence becomes available. DEFRA's recommendations were developed in collaboration with DfT and have been adopted by other Government Departments through their participation in the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.3/3">The multiplier is designed to attempt to capture the non-CO2 effects that aviation has on average and does not imply a precise radiative forcing relationship on a flight by flight basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1400W.6/1">The Environment Agency (EA) has been working as the lead organisation for the development of the Ashford Integrated Water Management Strategy.

	<p pid="a.1401W.2/2">With regard to the EA's statutory obligations, various regulatory duties require close multi-agency working on emergency planning issues, for example, the Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations and the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. The latter requires Category 1 Partners (which include the EA, local authorities and the emergency services) to share information on emergency planning and response. This liaison is primarily undertaken through Local Resilience Forums.</p>

	<p pid="a.1401W.5/1">There is a control framework for the shipment of waste to and from the UK. However, where non-hazardous waste (such as separated recyclables) are exported, they are generally subject only to commercial controls, not to the prior notification and consent procedures which apply to exports of hazardous waste. Therefore, they are not notified to anyone.

	<p pid="a.1409W.6/1">Uganda's human rights record improved after President Museveni came to power in 1986. It has a reasonably free media, though this freedom is occasionally curtailed when the Ugandan Government perceives a conflict with national interest. Uganda also has active civil society organisations. Rule of law problems remain, including poor policing and questionable activities by security agencies such as allegations of illegal detention, torture and politically motivated harassment. The worst cases of human rights abuse occur in northern Uganda where the general public has not been provided with adequate protection from the Lord's Resistance Army rebels or the military.</p>

A number of factors may affect levels of patient charge income, including the annual number of units of dental activity commissioned by PCTs, the time needed for new dental services to be commissioned and come into operation, the timeliness of the reports submitted by dentists on completed courses of treatment, changes in the mix of charge-paying and charge exempt patients treated, and the incidence of certain charge-free courses of treatment for patients who would normally pay charges.

	<p pid="a.1414W.0/1">Food Standard Agency (FSA) officials have met with the Better Regulation Executive and Small Business Service to discuss options for assessing the economic impact of the setting of maximum permitted levels of nutrients under the terms of the Food Supplements Directive. A series of questions are being prepared in order to obtain relevant information from industry to complete the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.0/2">No letters from individual consumers to FSA officials have been received expressing concerns about the setting of maximum permitted levels of nutrients in food supplements. However over 300 letters have been received from small companies and employees from a health food company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.0/3">FSA officials are seeking legal advice on the use of a system of advisory statements under the terms of the Food Supplements Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.0/4">The FSA developed the policy for a system of advisory statements following the publication of the results of risk assessment of vitamins and minerals by the expert group on vitamins and Minerals (EVM) in 2003. The majority of food supplement products on the United Kingdom market in 2003, contained amounts of vitamins and minerals that were well below the safe upper levels set by the EVM. However, a small number of products contained levels of vitamins and minerals which were higher than the safe upper level set by the EVM, in single dose form, which could cause adverse effects in some individuals if taken on a regular basis. In consultation with industry representatives from the Council for Responsible Nutrition, Health Food Manufacturer's Association and the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, a number of advisory statements were agreed in May 2004 to be included on labels, which provide information on the potential adverse effects for these products.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.0/5">The use of advisory statements approach has been discussed in bilateral meetings between FSA officials, the European Commission and other member states. Further bilateral meetings are planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.0/6">FSA officials met with the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-08">8 November 2006</phrase> to discuss the UK Government's response to the Commission's discussion document on setting levels of vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.0/7">The Commission welcomed the UK response and indicated that the work by the EVM on setting safe upper levels for on a scientific basis would be a key factor in developing proposals. A timeline for developing proposals has not yet been agreed by the Commission. Working group discussions between member states may begin in late spring with proposals not expected to be brought forward before the end of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.1415W.3/1">The Department has undertaken a number of activities to promote equality issues in the national health service, including the forthcoming gender equality duty, and particularly to support the NHS meet its responsibilities under the gender duty. The Department's strategy for promoting gender equality in the NHS is to set action on gender issues within the overall framework for planning and delivering the Department's and NHS' priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/2">The Department has worked closely with NHS organisations to prepare them for the gender duty when it comes into force in April this year. A detailed programme of work is in place to ensure the implementation of the gender duty across the whole health sector. The programme includes the measures set out as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/3">The Department is currently developing a gender equality duty guide to assist the NHS meet the duties of the gender duty legislation and will be published at the end of January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/4">This guide will be available to all NHS organisations and will be accessible on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/5">We are working with inspectorate bodies and the Equal Opportunities Commission to ensure that gender equality issues are integrated into inspection arrangements and sector specific guidance provided to help the health sector promote gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/6">We are working in partnership with key stakeholders such as the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Women and Equality Unit of the Department for Communities and Local Government, NHS Employers and the Men's Health Forum (MHF) to take forward work on the gender equality duty. A conference was organised for the NHS in November 2006 aimed at creating and enhancing awareness of the meaning of gender and its relevance to health, increasing understanding of the general and specific duties of the gender duty, providing information and guidance on the implementation of the specific duties</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/7">The Department's equality and human rights group is leading a project aimed at supporting the equalities agenda through the development of single equality schemes in the NHS. The project has been set up in anticipation of possible further duties in relation to age, religion and belief and sexual orientation and plans to encourage work to pull together the different equality strands without compromising any of the individual elements in a cross cutting and coherent fashion. Project leads provide support in terms of expertise in the field of equalities legislation, facilitating partnerships and joined up working, research, sharing of good practice and producing guidance. Project leads also provide specific guidance on the gender and disability duties. The organisations involved are committed to producing a single equality scheme and will collectively produce learning that identifies the different steps required to meet both current and likely duties which will be meaningful to the host of diverse organisations within the NHS. Development and outcomes from all the programmes outlined above will be shared and disseminated throughout the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/8">We have published &quot;Promoting Equality and Human Rights in the NHS&mdash;a Guide for Board Members&quot; aimed at helping non-executive board members take forward the issues of equality and human rights with regard to patients and the work force. The guide outlines the legislative framework and the principles that underpin equality and human rights. It demonstrates the business case for promoting and delivering equality and human rights, and includes a set of prompts for boards to take stock of how fairly their organisations treat their patients and work force. The guide incorporates current and imminent legislation and includes all board members.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/9">The pacesetters programme headed by the equality and human rights group. This programme places equality including gender equality at the heart of NHS business, organisational objectives and core values, impacting upon future health planning, performance management and delivery. The group is working with up to five strategic health authorities to deliver equality and diversity improvements and innovations resulting in:</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/10" class="indent">patient and user involvement in the design and delivery of services;</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/11" class="indent">reduced health inequalities for patients and service users; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/12" class="indent">working environments that are fair and free of discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.3/13">The participating SHAs launched their local involvement in the programme in November 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1423W.9/5">With the British High Commissioner, DFID is seeking meetings with the Chief Adviser and other Advisers of the new Caretaker Government to offer further technical and financial support for actions that will ensure a free and fair election. If this is accepted, we will prioritise this in the months ahead. In addition, our ongoing support for a programme to monitor and prevent political violence in Bangladesh will continue during the state of emergency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1430W.5/1">Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) records show that, during the year ending March 2006, proceedings in respect of 61,616 defendants were discontinued or withdrawn at court because the evidential test contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors was not satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.1430W.5/2">Guidance to crown prosecutors on whether to proceed with a prosecution is contained in the code and all cases are reviewed in accordance with it. A prosecution can only proceed if both of the tests in the code are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1430W.5/3">Firstly, a crown prosecutor must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. This is an objective test which means that a jury or bench of magistrates or judge hearing a case alone, properly directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged.</p>
	<p pid="a.1430W.5/4">If the case passes the evidential test, the crown prosecutor then has to consider whether a prosecution is required in the public interest. A prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1430W.5/5">The review of a case is a continuing process, and crown prosecutors must take account of any changes in circumstances. This may mean that a case is discontinued or withdrawn at court if there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction or if it is not in the public interest to continue.</p>

	<p pid="a.1431W.9/1">As companies are not required to report decisions to relocate to other EU member states, it is not possible to produce an estimate of this sort. However, the UK remains the top destination in Europe for inward investment, with 8,019 projects over the last 10 years, creating 430,843 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431W.9/2">We know of 305 inward investments into the UK from other EU member states in 2005-06 of which 140 were helped by the inward investment network of UKTI, RDAs and devolved Administrations. The network seeks out knowledge driven inward investment and makes the strong case to them for the UK as a place to do business. It offers tailored assistance to potential inward investors, for example to find technology partners, skilled staff and suitable sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.1435W.8/15">The Government have an objective of reducing road deaths and serious injuries (KSIs) by 40 per cent. (50 per cent. for children) by the year 2010. A mix of engineering, enforcement and education measures are used to help meet these targets, of which the THINK! road safety campaign and the Highways Agency's driver information programmes forms part. Safety also features in the Driving Standard Agency's ongoing education programmes such as Pass Plus and Arrive Alive. We are on course to meet the 2010 target of a 40 per cent. reduction in KSIs overall, and it is predicted that we will exceed the 50 per cent. reduction among children. The 2005 road casualty figures indicate that the number of people killed or seriously injured in 2005 was 33 per cent. below the 1994-98 average and 49 per cent. for children.</p>

	<p pid="a.1438W.0/1">The Government want the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review to be informed by wide public debate on the long- term challenges facing the UK. Across Government the public are being engaged on issues related to the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR).</p>
	<p pid="a.1438W.0/2">As part of its analytical work on the long-term challenges facing the UK in the coming decade, and through a series of detailed policy reviews, the Government have already undertaken extensive consultation with third sector organisations, service users, front-line professionals, businesses, think-tanks and academics, amongst others. These reviews will continue in the run-up to the CSR to engage the public on cross-cutting issues, from how to achieve a world-class skills base to how to ensure all children have the chance to make the most of their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438W.0/3">Through the recently published 'Long-term opportunities and challenges for the UK' document, the pre- Budget report and accompanying leaflet and the HM Treasury website, the Government have also invited the public to send in their views on the long-term challenges facing the UK and how Government, citizens, businesses and communities should respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438W.0/4">In addition to these consultation exercises the Cabinet has set up ministerial working groups in six key areas: energy and the environment; public services; the economy; crime, justice and cohesion; foreign policy and the role of the state. These groups are collectively considering the future opportunities and challenges for policy in these areas and will engage the public in parts of the process. For example, 100 representative members of the public will be consulted in a &quot;deliberative forum&quot; and attend a day-long public services &quot;summit&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438W.0/5">The development of new public service agreements (PSAs) for the CSR period will translate the conclusions of this work into a new set of priority outcomes for Government. In developing published delivery agreements, which underpin these PSAs, Departments will consult front-line professionals, service users and stakeholders on the most effective ways to incentivise successful delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438W.0/6">The engagement being undertaken to inform the CSR cuts across a broad spectrum of Government business, involving staff from across the Treasury and other Departments, and is being delivered through a wide array of channels. It is not possible to separate out the specific budget number of events, number of staff or proportion of staff time involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1440W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the estimate is of the average per capita public expenditure on each income decile group in each year since 1997-98. (115524)</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.5/4" class="indent">Estimates of cash benefits and benefits in kind received by households are provided in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at <a href="http://wvvw.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://wvvw.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. Through measuring household receipts of benefits, this analysis shows how government expenditure on cash benefits and benefits in kind are allocated to different types of households, and in particular households in different income decile groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.5/5" class="indent">The results in the article are presented for households rather than on a per capita basis. However, the table below shows average per capita receipts of cash benefits and benefits in kind for each income decile group. A more detailed breakdown by different types of benefit appears in the annual article (although presented as household averages, rather than per capita).</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.5/6" class="indent">Cash benefits include things like Income Support, Child Benefit, Incapacity Benefit, and the state Retirement Pension. The estimates of benefits in kind reflect the value of education and health services provided by the state to households, and also include housing and travel subsidies. Together these items constitute approximately 55 per cent of total government expenditure. They are the parts of government expenditure which can be directly allocated to households. Other types of expenditure such as on defence cannot be allocated except on the assumption that all households benefit equally.</p>

	<p pid="a.1442W.2/1">No dividends were received by, or expected to be paid to, the Exchequer from water companies in England and Wales. The dividend paid by water companies in England and Wales is determined by companies within the framework of water regulation in England and Wales. The operation of the water industry in Scotland is a devolved matter for the Scottish Executive and in Northern Ireland is a matter for Northern Ireland Ministers, within the framework of the UK public expenditure system.</p>
