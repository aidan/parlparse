	<p pid=".2224W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".2224W.2/2">In relation to the G8 summit, the Government used 246 vehicles. These included 20 cars, 47 people carriers, three articulated lorries, 21, 7.5 tonne trucks, six vans and 149 coaches. The cars used, broken down by make and model, were five Jaguar XJ, nine Volvo S80, one Peugeot 607, one Vauxhall Omega Elite, and four Mercedes E-Class. The people carriers used, broken down by make and model, were 31 Ford Galaxy carriers, two Volvo seven seaters, seven Chrysler Grand Voyagers, two Volkswagen Caravelles, three Mercedes V Class, one Volkswagen Sharan, and one Vauxhall Viano. To provide information on vehicle makes and model of the coaches, trucks and vans used would incur disproportionate cost, but the break down in size of the coaches used was 118, 49-seater coaches, 10, 70-seater coaches, 20, 16-seater coaches, and one 38-seater coach.</p>
	<p pid=".2224W.2/3">We went to great efforts, beyond those previously undertaken in Government, to make the G8 as environmentally sustainable as possible. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) investigated using a wide range of low emissions technologies and as a result as many vehicles as possible used an advanced low emission form of diesel. Every effort was made to limit journeys and ensure that the maximum number of passengers were transported at one time. In addition, the FCO looked into the possibility of using environmentally friendly vehicles such as the Toyota Prius and the hydrogen-fuelled bus owned by London buses. Unfortunately, due to various logistical constraints this did not prove possible. The hydrogen-fuelled bus has a very limited mileage and can only be refuelled in London. Therefore, to transport it to Scotland for use during the Summit would not have proved sustainable or environmentally friendly. The FCO were offered the use of Toyota Prius cars as part of a sponsorship package. Unfortunately this offer did not prove to be financially viable to the FCO, as the FCO would have been required to supply both drivers or insurance, as well as transporting the vehicles to Scotland, at considerable cost.</p>
	<p pid=".2224W.2/4">In other areas too, the FCO implemented a range of measures aimed at minimising the environmental impacts of the Summit. These included using local or Fairtrade. produce, drawing up a &quot;Supplier Code of Conduct&quot; for contractors to ensure they shared our commitment to demonstrating the highest standard of environmental and social accountability, and as much as possible pursuing the 3 Rs policy&mdash;Reduce, Recycle, Reuse. The FCO encouraged and facilitated recycling at the Gleneagles summit and worked closely with the local council to ensure that the contents were disposed of correctly.</p>
	<p pid=".2224W.2/5">These efforts continue. Currently, the G8 Climate Change Unit in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is in the process of calculating the level of carbon emissions attributable to the UK's presidency of the G8 that could not be eliminated. They will offset these by investing in small-scale Clean Development Mechanism projects, with strong sustainable development benefits, located in Africa.</p>

	<p pid=".2225W.2/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) went to great efforts, beyond those previously undertaken in Government, to make the G8 as environmentally sustainable as possible. However, given the intensity of the workload experienced by the UK delegation in the run and up to and during the summit itself, the FCO needed to balance the issue of sustainability against the organisational requirements of the event. In the majority of cases this meant UK officials travelling to Gleneagles in the shortest time possible.</p>
	<p pid=".2225W.2/3">153 UK officials travelled to and from Scotland by aeroplane. One UK official travelled to and from Scotland by train. Three Ministers, my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn), and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Lord Triesman of Tottenham), also travelled to Scotland by aeroplane. They travelled to and from the Gleneagles Hotel by a combination of helicopters and cars. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary travelled to and from the Gleneagles Hotel by helicopter in order to chair the meeting while the Prime Minister returned to London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".2225W.2/4">The FCO examined other ways to minimise the environmental impacts caused by delegates' travel. 144 UK officials travelled to and from the airports of arrival and departure to the Gleneagles Hotel by high occupancy vehicles including coach or people carrier. Only a small number of these officials accompanied delegations on their helicopter transfers during the summit. Nine UK officials accompanied the</p>

	<p pid=".2226W.3/1">Debt relief is provided to enable countries to make faster progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. It is essential therefore that the resources made available by the relief are used for poverty reduction. In providing debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the UK abides by the standards agreed internationally. Under these standards, countries must demonstrate a sustained commitment to poverty reduction and macroeconomic stability as part of an International Monetary Fund programme, Macroeconomic stability is critical to provide a foundation for growth, avoid adverse effects of inflation on the poor and to protect Government expenditure that benefits the poor. The debt stock cancellation recently proposed by the G8 would also use these standards.</p>

	<p pid=".2226W.6/1">The UK Government's principal support to the Government of Belize (GoB) has been relief on its aid debts under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative. This relief is provided to GoB on basis of its progress in controlling corruption and improving governance, economic management and poverty reduction. It also serves as a tool to encourage greater civil society participation in the GoB's policy. The UK Government is also providing a Strategic Fund for the GoB (&pound;200,000 per year) to help improve its ability to undertake governance reforms, develop medium term economic plans and identify ways to reduce poverty. The Small Grants Scheme, and other programme funds for Belize, provides a further &pound;35,000 a year that can be used for projects with civil society.</p>
	<p pid=".2226W.6/2">Although Belize is not specifically a major transit country for drugs destined for the UK, we do continue to help combat drug trafficking on a regional basis within Central America and the Caribbean. As part of CARICOM (the Caribbean Community), Belize benefits from the recently agreed UK/CARICOM co-operation plan that encompasses work on border security, intelligence and information sharing, maritime co-operation and a human resource development strategy. This partnership assists Caribbean states to combat drug trafficking. The UK also funds the training of Belizean officials on regional and UK drug specific training courses.</p>

	<p pid=".2227W.6/2">DFID is funding financial sector development programmes, including microfinance, in 25 countries. Four new financial sector programmes are currently being designed in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. DFID also funds international agencies that actively support microfinance and financial sector development, such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".2227W.6/3">DFID supports the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), which is increasing its regional presence in support of good practice microfinance. In the Middle East and North Africa, the CGAP is expanding its training programmes in microfinance and sharing its expertise to develop good practice in the region.</p>
	<p pid=".2227W.6/4">The European Union (EU) is launching a new initiative to develop its support to microfinance in Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP). DFID will contribute 12.7 per cent. of the &euro;15 million European Development Fund. 71 countries, most of them low income countries, should be able to benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".2227W.6/5">DFID is a principal supporter of the multi-donor global Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative, which provides technical assistance in all areas of financial sector development. FIRST is developing a strategy to increase its coverage of low income countries.</p>
	<p pid=".2227W.6/6">DFID is contributing &pound;3 million to a new International Financial Corporation (IFC) facility. This facility (Private Enterprise Partnership for the Middle East and North Africa) supports financial institutions engaged in micro-enterprises and in small and medium-sized enterprise development. The Partnership has staff on the ground in the region, notably in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, the West Bank and Gaza and Yemen. It has approved seven major technical assistance programmes that will benefit 13 countries in the region.</p>
	<p pid=".2227W.6/7">DFID is working with the World Bank and others to improve data on access to financial services in developing countries, including through microfinance, and plans to conduct financial access surveys in a number of African countries. This data will be important for the design of more effective policies and programmes to extend microfinance and develop financial systems.</p>
	<p pid=".2227W.6/8">The United Nations have declared 2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. The impact of microfinance is greatest when poor people have access to a wide range of financial services (savings, credit, insurance and transfer payments) that they use to invest in health, education, nutrition, businesses and other opportunities and protect themselves against shocks faced by the households and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid=".2227W.6/9">Remittances are a critical and growing source of income for many millions of poor people. DFID is developing programmes of remittance activities with a number of developing countries, including Bangladesh, Ghana and Nigeria. We are also supporting the expansion of the <a href="http://www.sendmoneyhome.orgwebsitethatprovidesinformationtodiasporaintheUK">www.sendmoneyhome.org website that provides information to diaspora in the UK</a> wishing to send remittances.</p>

	<p pid=".2228W.2/2">During 2004&ndash;05, DFID funded over &pound;30 million directly to microfinance or financial sector development programmes. DFID also funded microfinance and financial sector development through multi-sectoral programmes and indirectly through its support to international agencies. Multi-sectoral programmes may include a component on financial sector development as part of a range of activities to promote private sector development for example, or as part of a wider programme to improve rural livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid=".2228W.2/3">A number of the international agencies that DFID supports are active in promoting microfinance and financial sector development. The World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and several regional development banks all provide significant funding or technical assistance in these areas. This is indirect DFID support however, for which we do not have the necessary level of disaggregation of figures to provide an estimate of the total going towards microfinance and financial sector development.</p>
	<p pid=".2228W.2/4">We are not able to give exact figures for 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07. DFID's departmental report presents an indicative budget for what it plans to spend over the next three years, but this is not broken down into specific sectors. Spending is also affected by the pace of implementation of existing programmes and initiation of new programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".2228W.2/5">DFID views access to financial services, and stable and secure financial systems, as important to achieving the millennium development goals.</p>

	<p pid=".2229W.5/1">The G8 expressed support at the Gleneagles summit for Mr. James Wolfensohn, Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement, to stimulate a global financial contribution of up to $3 billion per year over the coming three years. The expectation is that most of this will be delivered in 2006 and beyond. It will come from public and private sources and will assist the Palestinian economic regeneration and governance reform following Israeli disengagement from Gaza and parts of the northern West Bank. International financial support will depend on the Palestinian Authority (PA) providing a credible financial plan for development, with guarantees of fiscal prudence and transparency. The UK is working closely with Mr. Wolfensohn and the PA to help develop their plans and to ensure that our assistance is targeted at the highest priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".2230W.2/1">DFID recognises the importance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank being transparent and accountable to parliaments in developing countries. Clearly, such accountability needs to be at the heart of their relationship.</p>
	<p pid=".2230W.2/2">The main means by which parliaments should engage with the World Bank and the IMF activities is through the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. This is a national strategy for development that sets the agenda, which donors, including the World Bank, should follow in each country.</p>
	<p pid=".2230W.2/3">It is true that, in the past, parliamentary engagement in the PRS process has often been weak. However, over the past two years, DFID country offices have begun to support stronger engagement by parliamentarians in the PRS process. We are providing active support for parliamentary engagement in Malawi and Tanzania, where an independent Monitoring Group was established to oversee the joint commitments made around the PRS.</p>
	<p pid=".2230W.2/4">In Board meetings, DFID encourages the World Bank and the IMF to engage with parliaments as much as possible. We also actively push for them to make more of their documents public and will continue to pursue this both at board meetings and in discussions with staff. In fact, in March this year a new World Bank disclosure policy was approved which, among other things, makes board minutes public. The Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes. The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS. Since it began in 1996, it has held workshops in a range of countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Indonesia and Uganda to raise awareness among parliamentarians.</p>
	<p pid=".2230W.2/5">The World Bank Institute have also supported the African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption (APNAC) and the Global Organization of Parliamentarians against Corruption (GOPAC) to encourage parliamentary scrutiny and action against corruption.</p>
	<p pid=".2230W.2/6">Outside the PRS, the main means of oversight is the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank, This provides opportunities for parliaments to scrutinise the World Bank and engage more deeply in development policy issues. The independent Network has some 450 members from over 90 countries and facilitates direct dialogue between parliamentarians and the World Bank to achieve greater transparency of policies and practices.</p>

	<p pid=".2232W.3/1">The DFID-funded Nepal Safer Motherhood Project operated in nine of the 75 districts of Nepal from March 1997 until September 2004. The project was implemented in partnership with the Department of Health Services, and the Ministry of Health, with a total budget of &pound;5.8 million. The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in Nepal is estimated at 539 per 100,000 live births, according to a 1996 survey. Given the methodological difficulties in measuring MMR, levels of skilled attendance at birth and Emergency Obstetric Care are taken as proxies for MMR. The project completion data revealed that within the project supported districts there was an increase in skilled attendance at birth from 3.05 per cent. (1997&ndash;98 Nepal fiscal year July to June) to 17.81 per cent. (2003&ndash;04). In addition there was an average annual increase of 1.3 per cent. in met need for accessing Emergency Obstetric Care, thus demonstrating that lives had been saved.</p>
	<p pid=".2232W.3/2">An evaluation completed in November 2004 assessed the project as having contributed to a national increased percentage of deliveries by skilled attendants from a 1997&ndash;98 baseline of 3.6 per cent. to 18.3 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04. Similarly, the project had contributed to a national increase in Emergency Obstetric Care from a baseline survey of 5 per cent. in 2000 to 14.8 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".2232W.3/3">Building on this success, DFID has contributed &pound;20 million to help the Government of Nepal implement its Safer Motherhood Programme. This programme aims to extend quality services to all 75 districts over the period 2004 to 2009. The conflict in Nepal makes it harder to deliver programmes effectively, but health services do continue to function and it should still be possible to reduce MMR further through the programme.</p>

	<p pid=".2233W.2/1">DFID is currently providing &pound;40 million annually to Sierra Leone. Our assistance is provided through a ten year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL), which includes benchmarks for progress on reform. These benchmarks are agreed between the UK and the Government of Sierra Leone on an annual basis and progress is reviewed regularly, They cover areas such as action on corruption, and sound financial management. These reforms aim to increase the effectiveness of our aid by strengthening systems of transparency and accountability. The MOU has been key to achieving progress on a range of issues, including establishment of the Office of Auditor General as an independent agency outside the civil service; successful completion of Sierra Leone's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and strengthening the power of the Anti-Corruption Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".2233W.2/2">Progress against the benchmarks is also a factor in determining the level and timing of our budget support, which we provide directly to the Government of Sierra Leone. Before we provide budget support, DFID insists upon a detailed fiduciary risk assessment (FRA) every three years, which includes an evaluation of the risk of corruption. In the interim, an annual statement of progress should be made to demonstrate the ongoing management of fiduciary risk and to meet audit discharge requirements. We have just completed a new FRA assessment for our programme of budget support to the country. At the project level we have rigorous auditing processes, and independent reviews of activities are conducted throughout the project cycle.</p>

This includes a contribution of approximately $150 million from the US to build and maintain accommodation and offices for the AU staff, and almost $150 million from Canada, which has been used, inter alia, to provide helicopters. The UK has allocated approximately $60 million, much of which has been used to provide vehicles. Other G8 members have also provided assistance, including for communications equipment. G8 members have also seconded logisticians and military planners to assist the AU, and have provided airlift to get troops and equipment into Darfur. The European Commission has provided $93 million of support through the Africa Peace Facility. This has been used to fund catering, fuel, some medical costs, and to pay per diems.</p>

To ensure compliance, the civil service is currently quality proofing its terms and conditions in this area to raise the retirement age of its employees, including the senior civil service, to 65. Those areas of the civil service which consider that they need to maintain a retirement age below 65 will only be able to do so if they can objectively justify this by reference to particular circumstances. It is anticipated, however, that this will be a negligible figure against the total number of permanent civil servants which, at <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, was 523,580 (full-time equivalents).</p>

	<p pid=".2245W.2/1">As the Central Authority for the operation of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, the Lord Chancellor from time to time receives representations from interested parties and an open dialogue is maintained. The cost of an application for the return of a child is often a matter of concern to parents. In most countries no payment for legal proceedings is required for applications made under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Central Authority for the Convention provides information regarding legal costs in specific countries. There is no charge for the services provided by the Central Authority, including the translation of documents necessary to an application under the Convention. In countries where legal aid is not generally available efforts are made by the receiving Central Authority, in cases of financial need, to provide legal representation for applicants either at a reduced rate or free of charge.</p>

The unit can be contacted by telephone, fax and e-mail and routinely provides advice to parents on all aspects of the Hague Convention and whether it can be applied to a particular case.

	<p pid=".2248W.6/1">It is not possible to identify individual grants of legal aid to Travellers and Gypsies in most categories of law because the Legal Services Commission (LSC) does not collect data about the ethnic group or lifestyle of recipients of legal aid. The LSC collects figures for legal aid for Travellers where the category of law or action arises out of their Traveller status.</p>
	<p pid=".2248W.6/2">The Community Law Partnership has held a contract with the LSC to provide publicly funded services since January 2000. It has held a contract with the LSC since April 2002 to provide telephone advice to Gypsies and Travellers on housing matters, including eviction and planning enforcement actions. Its grants for this financial year and previous years have been as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".2248W.6/14">The Ormiston Children and Families Trust and the Fenland Citizens Advice Bureau has received a Partnership Initiative Budget grant to pilot the provision of information and advice services on social welfare law specifically to Gypsies and Travellers in Cambridgeshire. LSC funding amounted to &pound;5,050 in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;21,700 in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;9,000 so far in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".2248W.6/15">Legal representation at planning applications and appeals is generally outside the scope of legal aid. However, since April 2000, funding can be made available in exceptional cases under section 6(8)<i>(b)</i> of the Access to Justice Act 1999, when the relevant criteria are satisfied, for example, where the case concerns the applicant's home. This protects the applicant's fundamental rights and ensures a fair hearing. It is not possible to give a precise figure for total costs but, since April 2000, the LSC has spent the following amounts (excluding legal help costs) on planning applications in relation to Traveller encampments.</p>

	<p pid=".2255W.10/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has considered the issue of making the effects of section 723B retrospective and has concluded that it is not feasible to do so. This decision was not reached on the basis of the additional administrative cost of doing so. The main reason was that once information has been entered on the public record at Companies House it is disseminated widely, not only to individual members of the public but also through large commercial business information providers. Therefore, even if it were possible for Companies House to expunge the historical information successfully, it would still be in the public domain and available from a wide range of sources.</p>

	<p pid=".2259W.6/1">The County of Northamptonshire still has a dominant manufacturing base with footwear, plastics, perfumes and toiletries over-represented against national averages. The Wellingborough East (WEAST) development and Milton Keynes South Midlands sub-regional strategy will improve infrastructure in the Wellingborough district in order to attract business and industry and help indigenous businesses grow. However, like manufacturing businesses throughout the East Midlands and the UK, Northamptonshire businesses are facing severe competition from overseas. As the pace of technological change speeds up and new industrial economies develop, the future of the manufacturing sector within the region must be based on the recognition that innovation is key to regional competitive success. That involves the continuous introduction of new and differentiated products and services.</p>

More new capacity has been constructed in the last few years than in the previous decade, and a significant amount is currently in the pipeline.

	<p pid=".2271W.5/1">Research in November 2004 by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) on the impact of wind farms on house prices shows that it is too early to say categorically what effects, if any, wind farms have on house prices. This is inline with a separate study on house prices and wind farms conducted for the British Wind Energy Association by chartered surveyors, Knight Frank.</p>
	<p pid=".2271W.5/2">Both surveys found that the perception that wind farms may impact on house prices is fuelled largely by misunderstandings about wind farms and the 'fear factor' arising at the prospect of them being constructed in proximity to homes. While a planning application for a wind farm may have a marginal effect on prices, the RICS survey found evidence that prices begin to recover after any initial dip when wind farms have been up and running for two years. This suggests that they become more accepted, as communities grow used to them.</p>

	<p pid=".2275W.6/2">The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme does not involve the percentage assessment of disabling conditions. Compensation is paid according to a tariff with 15 levels of award for injuries of differing severity. With regard to hearing loss, a permanent bilateral loss of between 50 and 75dB, averaged over 1, 2 and 3kHz, attracts a lump sum award at tariff level 13 (&pound;5,250), if there is mild or no tinnitus. A lump sum award at tariff level 11 (&pound;11,000) is paid if there is severe tinnitus. Level 11 awards also attract a continuing guaranteed income payment. Hearing loss of less than 50dB does not attract compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".2275W.6/3">The 50dB threshold for compensation is the same used for the war pension scheme, where the rules of the scheme prescribe that a loss of between 50 and 53dB, averaged over 1, 2 and 3kHz, shall be assessed at 20 per cent. It is also used for the assessment of industrial deafness under the civilian Industrial Injuries Benefit Scheme. The independent Industrial Injuries Advisory Council confirmed the appropriateness of the threshold in industrial injuries in November 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".2275W.6/4">The evidence used to determine the degree of disablement due to service-related hearing loss under the war pension scheme is taken from audiometric tests conducted on or about the date of termination of service. Where no such tests were conducted the assessment is on the basis of the earliest available evidence. Assessment on the basis of later evidence would inevitably include hearing loss arising after service and therefore not due to service: a war pension assessment can include only disablement that is due to service.</p>

	<p pid=".2276W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence is committed to evidence-based policy and decision making. Current accepted scientific understanding is that permanent hearing loss due to noise exposure does not improve or worsen after removal from the noise. Hearing loss may subsequently worsen due to age and other causes, but there is no evidence that the worsening is caused or increased by prior noise exposure where that exposure has ceased.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has appealed the High Court decision of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase> that the birthlink criteria used to determine the eligibility of civilian internees under the ex-gratia payment scheme for former Far East Prisoner of War and Civilian Internees resulted in unlawful indirect race discrimination. It was these birthlink criteria that Mrs Elias did not meet. Until the legal proceedings have been concluded and a lawful basis for the civilian element of the scheme established, the initial decision that Mrs Elias was ineligible for a &pound;10,000 award remains the subject of review. I wish to see a proper resolution of the case quickly, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has agreed that the appeal is appropriate for expedition in the Court of Appeal lists given the advanced age of the claimant herself and of other former internees who have a direct interest in the outcome of the case.</p>

	<p pid=".2281W.2/2">There has been no 100 per cent. reliable and accurate assessment of casualties in Iraq over the last two years. Estimates vary according to the methods used. Reliance on media reporting used in the Iraq Body Count (IBC) Report cannot give an entirely accurate portrayal of civilian casualties in Iraq. We believe the Iraqi Government is best-placed to monitor the deaths of its civilians, and the latest statistics from the Iraqi Ministry of Health were given by my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Lord Triesman of Tottenham) in reply to the noble Lord, Lord Garden on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-06-08.67W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 67W</phrase>, and we understand that these figures were used in the IBC Report. The casualty figures indicated in the UN Living Conditions Survey appear broadly in line with those in the IBC Report. The UK Government response to <i>The Lancet</i> survey is given in my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-17">17 November 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-11-17.92WS"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 92&ndash;95WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".2281W.2/3">These counts have had no effect on casualty counts used by UK forces as UK military reporting is conducted as part of standard military procedure and is not an attempt to carry out a comprehensive survey of civilian casualties. Detailed operational information for our coalition partners is a matter for their own authorities to answer.</p>

	<p pid=".2284W.5/2">The Department seeks to deliver high quality products and services to our armed forces using the most appropriate procurement technique while ensuring that value for money is obtained for the taxpayer. PPP's as defined by HMT form part of the Departments overall procurement strategy to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid=".2284W.5/3">Existing PPP contracts are delivering value for money services to the Department and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. To date the Department has committed to 53 PPP (PFI) contracts. These have resulted in &pound;4.5 billion of private sector capital investment in defence. We have a further 12 PPP projects in procurement that will bring up to a further &pound;6 billion of private sector capital investment in to defence if they all lead to contracts being placed.</p>
	<p pid=".2284W.5/4">The procurement tool used for procurement programmes or individual purchases, irrespective of their type, will be judged by the specific circumstances surrounding each procurement. For this reason the MoD does not place any dogma on the use of PPP, including PFI.</p>
	<p pid=".2284W.5/5">PPP and PFI specifically, will be considered for all procurements where substantial investment is needed, but PPP will not be pursued unless it can be demonstrated to deliver better value for money than other procurement techniques. For example, the Department has adopted HM Treasury's Value for Money Assessment Guidance to test from an early stage in the procurement that PFI is the appropriate procurement tool to deliver the prevailing requirement.</p>

	<p pid=".2289W.0/1">We did not prescribe bilingual application forms in the Licensing Act 2003 regulations as we had concerns about practical issues, including the ability of non-Welsh speakers being able to engage in the process if applications were made in Welsh. However, following discussions with the Welsh Language Board, we have been reassured that requirements under Welsh language schemes protect the interests of Welsh and English speakers alike. On that basis, we are looking to prescribe the forms as soon as possible, although this will not be before the <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">6 August</phrase> date for converting existing alcohol licences. I have made it clear that, in the meantime, I have no policy objection if licensing authorities in Wales wish to make forms available in Welsh or bilingually, and to accept them in Welsh under their Welsh language schemes. This approach has the support of the Welsh Language Board and I understand that Welsh authorities are issuing and accepting Welsh forms.</p>

	<p pid=".2292W.8/1">My Department has made no specific assessment of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on garden centres which sell small amounts of alcohol. However, Regulatory Impact Assessments were provided to Parliament with the Bill and the fees regulations, which considered the impact of the 2003 Act more broadly, including on small businesses. These are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".2292W.8/2">Fees were set which recognised the various sizes of businesses engaged in licensable activities. However, Ministers agreed to establish an Independent Fees Panel to review the impact of the fees. This has now been established under the chairmanship of Sir Les Elton. We expect the panel to consider a range of business concerns about the fees regime and draw on evidence and expertise provided during the course of the review process, including the issue where the premises to be licensed only forms a small part of a larger hereditament and does not, itself, have a separate rateable value.</p>

	<p pid=".2299W.2/1">Animal fairs, like any other legal trade fora, can provide an opportunity for illegal transactions to take place. We have not assessed whether such fairs encourage the illegal trade and prosecution statistics do not identify which, if any, illegal trade cases have arisen from this type of event.</p>

	<p pid=".2301W.5/2">The decision of the 30th Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee on the impact of climate change is set out as follows. The UK will play an active part in realising this decision through support to an expert working group.</p>
	<p pid=".2301W.5/3" class="indent">The World Heritage Committee,</p>

	<p pid=".2301W.5/5" class="indent">Recognising the work being undertaken within the framework of the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), and the need for a proper co-ordination of such work with the activities under the convention,</p>

	<p pid=".2301W.5/8" class="indent">Further notes that the impacts of climate change are affecting many and are likely to affect many more World Heritage properties, both natural and cultural in the years to come;</p>
	<p pid=".2301W.5/9" class="indent">Encourages all States Parties to seriously consider the potential impacts of climate change within their management planning, in particular with monitoring, and risk preparedness strategies, and to take early action in response to these potential impacts.</p>
	<p pid=".2301W.5/10" class="indent">Requests the World Heritage Centre in collaboration with the advisory bodies, interested states parties and petitioners, to establish a broad working group of experts to a) review the nature and scale of the risks posed to World Heritage properties arising specifically from climate change; and b) jointly develop a strategy to assist state parties to implement appropriate management responses;</p>

	<p pid=".2301W.5/13" class="indent">Strongly encourages states parties and the advisory bodies to use the network of World Heritage properties to highlight the threats posed by climate change to natural and cultural heritage, start identifying the properties under most serious threats, and also use the network to demonstrate management actions that need to be taken to meet such threats, both within the properties and in their wider context;</p>
	<p pid=".2301W.5/14" class="indent">Also encourages UNESCO to do its utmost to ensure that the results about climate change affecting the World Heritage sites reach the public at large, in order to mobilise political support for activities against climate change and to safeguard in this way the livelihood of the poorest people of our planet.</p>

	<p pid=".2303W.0/1">Assessments of the change of carbon dioxide emission have been made throughout the drafting and negotiation of the G8 Gleneagles Plan of Action on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development. Although it is very difficult to quantify the impacts of the package as a whole our assessment of the final Plan of Action suggests that if implemented fully, with full participation from all the countries involved, those measures that can be more easily quantified will deliver annual savings of around 550 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2010&mdash;approximately equivalent to the emissions of the UK. By 2030 this is expected to rise to 4,500 MTCO2e&mdash;this is equivalent to around 19 per cent. of current global emissions.</p>

	<p pid=".2306W.2/1">A number of steps are currently being taken to reduce carbon emissions from the road transport sector. These include improvements to average new car fuel efficiency through the voluntary agreements between the European Commission and the automotive industry, complemented by changes to vehicle taxation, and support for low carbon fuels such as biofuels. In the area of fuel efficiency alone, new cars in the UK are now emitting some 10 per cent. less carbon dioxide per kilometre on average than in 1995. Policy measures in the transport sector alone are forecast to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 4.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".2306W.2/2">Fuel efficiency labels, similar to those currently displayed on fridges and other white goods, have been developed by the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership (LowCVP) in an effort to provide information to car buyers on how they can save money and help the environment. All 42 car brands in the UK have signed up to the introduction of the voluntary labelling scheme, and the label is due to be in all UK car showrooms by <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September</phrase>. As well as highlighting the fuel efficiency of every new car on sale, the labels also contain information on how much motorists can expect to pay in fuel bills in a typical year for a particular car, and whether the car qualifies for a reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty.</p>
	<p pid=".2306W.2/3">The Climate Change Programme (CCP) published in 2000, is currently being reviewed by the Government. The CCP review is looking at how existing policies in all sectors are performing and the range of policies that might be put in place for the future. Evaluation of existing policies is almost completed and appraisal of possible new measures is currently under way. Responses to consultation along with outcome of analytical work will feed into the revised programme due to be published by the end of the year.</p>

In the light of current IT and land registration delays, the contingency arrangements we have put in place&mdash;extension of the closing date for applications and prioritisation of registration requests submitted to the Rural Payments Agency&mdash;should help ensure that as many farmers as possible can benefit from the <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August</phrase> start date.

The 1998&ndash;99 Environment Agency's National Waste Production Survey (NWPS) of 20,000 businesses in England and Wales, estimated it that 2.59 million tonnes of food waste were produced of which 25 per cent. was sent to landfill.</p>
	<p pid=".2310W.5/2">However these figures only relate to that fraction of the waste that is definitely food. A considerable amount of food waste is also likely to be contained within the general and biodegradable category which amounted to around 12.8 million tonnes, of which a third went to landfill. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) estimate that the amount of food waste produced by the hotel and restaurant sector alone, for example, could be as high as 3 million tonnes per year.</p>
	<p pid=".2310W.5/3">In 2003&ndash;04 households in England produced 25.4 million tonnes of waste, it is estimated that some 9 per cent. or around 2.4 million tonnes of this is compostable kitchen waste, including food waste. About 72 per cent. of household waste goes to landfill.</p>

	<p pid=".2311W.5/1">I am answering on the basis that the question is being asked in the context of BSE and the livestock feed provided to cattle.</p>
	<p pid=".2311W.5/2">The steps being taken are two-fold. Firstly, there are measures applied to ensure that all potentially BSE-infective material, including the carcasses of suspect animals, is effectively separated and disposed of, and is not therefore available for any use. But more directly, there are comprehensive and stringent feed controls which regulate the use of all animal protein products in the diets of all farmed animals, not just cattle. The controls now apply equally across the EU, banning animal proteins, with a few exceptions, from farmed animal feed.</p>
	<p pid=".2311W.5/3">The State Veterinary Service in Great Britain carries out a comprehensive programme of monitoring to ensure compliance with the feed ban. Calculated against Great Britain's level of compound feed production, the yearly level of monitoring recommended in EU legislation is to undertake a minimum of 940 inspections and to take 1,882 feed samples. The State Veterinary Service carried out 2,295 inspections and took 17,239 samples under the National Feed Audit during 2004&mdash;i.e. nearly 2.5 times more than the recommended minimum number of inspections, and over nine times more than the recommended minimum number of samples. Monitoring over the years has always indicated a high level of compliance with the feed ban, and this is reflected in the continuing reduction of the incidence of BSE in cattle.</p>
	<p pid=".2311W.5/4">The Department also keeps the efficacy of the feed ban under continuous review. An independent review by Professor William Hill FRS, of the University of Edinburgh, was requested by Defra and published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>. The review examined the possible reasons for the cases of BSE occurring since the reinforced feed ban in 1996, together with the control measures being applied by the Government. The review's conclusions re-confirmed the elimination of feed-borne sources to be the key to the eradication of BSE, and recommended that risk-based controls and monitoring should be maintained on animals and feed.</p>
	<p pid=".2311W.5/5">Professor Hill's review is available on Defra's internet site on the BSE home-page under &quot;Latest developments&quot; at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.htm</a></p>

	<p pid=".2313W.0/1">The meeting with WaterVoice South West dealt with a number of concerns and issues and there were two specific follow up actions. First, we agreed that the affordability pilot study in the South West should be subject to peer review to help ensure its conclusions are robust and intellectually rigorous. Since the meeting, WaterVoice and other organisations have been working with DEFRA to finalise the specification for the work. Second, I invited WaterVoice's views on DEFRA's review of tariff structures and I am pleased that they were able to participate in the first meeting and are now helping shape the scope and programme of work.</p>

	<p pid=".2315W.2/1">Research carried out in the UK provides evidence that goats are susceptible to both BSE and scrapie and naturally occurring scrapie has been recorded in goats in Great Britain. As in sheep, the clinical appearance of these two conditions in goats cannot be distinguished. Control measures to protect public health from BSE are therefore directed at the eradication of all Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) diseases from sheep and goats within the EU. Research on sheep in the UK and Europe has shown certain PrP genotypes to be more resistant to TSE infection. This is the basis of the national scrapie plan in which selective breeding is used to establish sheep flocks with more resistant genotypes. Studies on goats have shown considerable variability in PrP genotypes but there is no currently available evidence that resistant genotypes exist which can be promoted through genetic selection. Control of TSE disease, and thus any potential for the presence of BSE, in goat herds is based on the culling of herds in which scrapie is found to exist.</p>
	<p pid=".2315W.2/2">As there are very few cases of goat TSE reported in the UK, it has not been possible to carry out scientific epidemiological studies on the spread of TSEs in goats. Research is being done in European countries with much larger goat populations than the UK, notably in Cyprus where there is an ongoing TSE epidemic. DEFRA is monitoring this work to see if it has any implications for the UK goat population. Following the recently reported case of BSE in a goat in France the EU has announced a research call to investigate the topic of &quot;BSE infectivity in milk, milk products and meat derived from goats&quot;. DEFRA will also monitor the progress of this proposed research.</p>
	<p pid=".2315W.2/3">The current whole-herd slaughter policy in herds where there is a confirmed case of a TSE in a goat is a requirement of European Community legislation (Regulation 999/2001). When drafting this legislation the commission took into consideration the opinion of their Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) on the safe sourcing of small ruminant (sheep and goat) material (4&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-04-05">5 April 2002</phrase>). Because genotyping and removal of susceptible animals is not an option in goats, it was felt that the only way to protect consumers from the theoretical risk of BSE in goats was a whole goat herd cull policy. The commission are currently reviewing their TSE eradication policy for small ruminants.</p>

The guidance is built around the degree to which non-agricultural use impedes or is inconsistent with normal farming activities. Having considered representations from interested parties, the guidance will now be updated to move paragliding and hang gliding to the list of generally permitted activities. This means that these activities may take place on an unrestricted number of days on land used in support of claims for payment under the SPS in 2005.

	<p pid=".2322W.2/1">The south-west does have the highest bills in England and Wales, but like other companies, water companies must meet their costs, including those of environmental standards. Ultimately, those costs have to be met by their customers. Ofwat sets an upper limit on customer prices, but there is a strong and visible link between what the company spends and the customers who fund that through their bills.</p>
	<p pid=".2322W.2/2">Measures to change the difference in water bills between regions would involve shifting some of the burden either onto national taxpayers or onto water customers in other parts of the country. There are no plans to subsidise South West Water's investment in this way. Any such measures would overturn the present legislative and regulatory framework&mdash;a system that has delivered impressive efficiency savings that have been passed on to customers.</p>
	<p pid=".2322W.2/3">There are vulnerable customers throughout the country, not only in the south-west, and we must consider their costs and the way in which any changes in the current charging system would apply to them.</p>

	<p pid=".2326W.3/1">The stock of child care places has increased by over 537,000 places nationally since 1999. This benefits all working parents.</p>
	<p pid=".2326W.3/2">The Government are also making significant contributions to help parents access affordable child care through tax credits. The child care element of the working tax credit enables parents to claim up to 70 per cent. of their child care costs to a maximum cost of &pound;175 per week for one child and &pound;300 per week for two or more children. From April 2006 the 70 per cent. maximum will increase to 80 per cent. making child care more affordable.</p>
	<p pid=".2326W.3/3">In addition to tax credits, we have introduced free nursery education for all three and four-year-olds for 33 weeks per year. From April 2006, this free entitlement will be extended to 38 weeks per year and from 2007, the weekly entitlement will extend from 12.5 hours per week to 15 hours and parents will be able to use this flexibly over three days. This increase will again make child care more accessible and affordable to parents.</p>
	<p pid=".2326W.3/4">Our recently announced Ten Year Strategy also included details of a Transformation Fund of &pound;125 million a year which will be used to raise the quality and sustainability of affordable child care provision, ensuring value for money and without compromising affordability for parents.</p>
	<p pid=".2326W.3/5">Our strategy also announced that the Department, together with the Greater London Authority will pilot a range of approaches aimed at improving the accessibility and affordability of good quality child care for parents on lower incomes. The first of these pilots is due to commence towards the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid=".2327W.8/1">Aimhigher is funded to help widen participation in higher education (HE) and increase the number of young people who have the abilities and aspirations to benefit from it. The objectives are:</p>
	<p pid=".2327W.8/2" class="indent">to raise aspirations and motivation to enter HE among young people in schools, further education and workplace learning, who are from under-represented groups;</p>
	<p pid=".2327W.8/3" class="indent">to raise the attainment of potential HE students who are from under-represented groups, so that they gain the academic or vocational qualifications and learning skills that will enable them to enter HE;</p>

	<p pid=".2327W.8/5" class="indent">to raise students' aspirations to enter HE and to apply to the institution and/or course best able to match their abilities;</p>
	<p pid=".2327W.8/6" class="indent">to improve the attainment, aspirations, motivation and self-esteem of gifted and talented young people aged 14&ndash;19; and the quality of identification, provision and support for those students in schools and colleges.</p>

	<p pid=".2327W.8/8">Recent evaluation of the early stages of the former Excellence Challenge programme, which funded activities now typically funded through Aimhigher, has reported measurable improvements in attainment and aspirations. It shows that:</p>
	<p pid=".2327W.8/9" class="indent">The programme has led to improved pre-16 attainment: pupils exposed to the programme are on average 4.6 percentage points more likely to attain a level 4 or above in Key Stage 3 Maths.</p>
	<p pid=".2327W.8/10" class="indent">At Year 11, those who have been exposed to the programme are on average likely to increase their total GCSE score by 2.5 points, which corresponds to an increase of between 2 and 3 grades in one GCSE.</p>
	<p pid=".2327W.8/11" class="indent">Exposure to the programme improves pupils' aspirations. The proportion exposed to the scheme and reporting that they intend to remain in full-time education until at least the age of 20 is 3.9 percentage points higher than it would be in the absence of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".2327W.8/12" class="indent">Targeting two groups, (Gifted and Talented, and Widening Participation) has been effective.

	<p pid=".2330W.5/2">These are matters for the Office of Standards in Education (Ofsted). David Bell, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector for Schools will write to the hon. Gentleman and a copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Bell to Mr. Tim Loughton, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-22">22 July 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary questions concerning childminders have been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/5" class="indent">You asked:</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/6" class="indent">(i) how many complaints against childminders investigated by Ofsted have subsequently turned out to be vexatious in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/7" class="indent">(ii) how many investigations against childminders have been undertaken by Ofsted in each of the last five years; and how many resulted in action.</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/8" class="indent">In relation to the first question, Ofsted does not record the number of vexatious complaints made against childminders. Ofsted's role is to help to secure better education and care through effective inspection and regulation. Ofsted looks into complaints which suggest that childminders and day care providers are not meeting the government's National Standards.</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/9" class="indent">Ofsted's first concern is with the welfare of the children in the provider's care. When Ofsted has investigated a complaint it records the outcome of the investigation. This could be the action the provider or Ofsted had to take to bring about compliance with the Standards or that Ofsted found the provider to be meeting the National Standards. Ofsted reports either outcome to parents and in its regular inspection reports. It does not record or report whether a complaint was vexatious. It may be, of course, that even if a complaint was vexatious it could still lead Ofsted to identify some areas for improvement in the childminder's practice and so have a positive impact on the children concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/10" class="indent">However, Ofsted does recognise that providers will have concerns about having a number of complaints recorded against their names, even if Ofsted on inspection found that National Standards were being met. For that reason, where it appears that a number of complaints could have been made by the same source and they all resulted in a finding that the Standards were being met, they are not reported on in inspection reports individually.</p>
	<p pid=".2330W.5/11" class="indent">Ofsted recognises the concern childminders may feel about this issue and is looking at its practice to see if it can handle complaints in a more transparent and effective way. The government has just consulted on a new duty to be placed on providers to investigate and report on complaints. It may be that Ofsted will be able to change its complaints procedures and recording in the light of this. It will work with provider organisations to make sure it does this as well as it can.</p>

All applicants have been informed of the position.</p>

	<p pid=".2341W.0/1">The Department for Education and Skills commitment not to discriminate unfairly on any grounds is set out clearly in our recently revised equality and diversity policy, which recognises that everyone should have an equal opportunity to meet their aspirations, realise their full potential and improve their life chances. Making this policy a reality is our opportunity to contribute to delivery of both economic prosperity and the development of a fair and inclusive society.</p>
	<p pid=".2341W.0/2">Equality and diversity is the responsibility of everyone in the Department and many teams take actions within existing budgets, in the normal course of business. It is therefore not possible to establish specific costs for each separate activity. Over and above this there are a small number of teams within DfES who have specific responsibility for championing and promoting equality and diversity, their budgets amounting to some &pound;18.5 million over the last five years (this is 0.02 per cent. of the total education budget). In addition further corporate awareness raising or training initiatives in this period have cost in excess of &pound;0.5 million and publication of our revised Race Equality Scheme was at a cost of &pound;5,000k.</p>

	<p pid=".2341W.3/1">The DfES recognises the significant role of voluntary sector and community organisations in supporting schools and local authorities (LAs) to deliver extended services. They will be key to the successful delivery of extended services and local authorities and schools will need to draw on their provision and expertise. Initial guidance for schools and LAs on partnership working with voluntary sector providers is available through the Extended Schools prospectus, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June 2005</phrase>. Also a &quot;Know How&quot; leaflet entitled, &quot;Involving and Working with the Voluntary and Community Sectors&quot;, available through the Extended Schools website (<a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools">www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools</a>), offers practical guidance and information on partnership working, engaging with voluntary and community organisations and useful contacts.</p>
	<p pid=".2341W.3/2">The NRT (National Remodelling Team) and ContinYou will be supporting local authorities in developing their extended services and in doing so will support them in brokering partnerships with the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid=".2341W.3/3">There are many voluntary and community sector organisations that schools will know through their existing contacts and other partnership working, such as through Education Improvement Partnerships (formerly know as Foundation Partnerships). Local authorities, through established contacts, can provide advice about wider groups, agencies and services and neighbourhood&mdash;level initiatives that are willing to working in partnership to develop extended services.</p>

	<p pid=".2342W.2/1">We are keen to learn from the experiences of other countries in developing policy and programmes and make regular assessments of what is happening in key comparator countries such as Finland. The Department has carefully assessed the OFSTED study &quot;The education of six year olds in England, Denmark and Finland&quot; and the OECD review of Early Childhood and Early Care (ECEC) which includes Finland. We have learnt from these international studies and the Department's own Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) study that supporting children's early personal, social and emotional development and helping children to develop a positive attitude to learning in a holistic approach is crucial to future success.</p>
	<p pid=".2342W.2/2">The Department is taking forward a significant programme of work to support children's holistic development in all early years settings. The widely welcomed Birth to Three Matters and Foundation Stage set out the key principles that enable children to develop the key skills and positive attitude needed for all future learning. As we set out in our Childcare Bill Consultation we will be developing the Early Learning Development and Learning Framework that will ensure that young children are able to access the same high quality experience regardless of the type of setting they attend. The Framework will support practitioners in creating stimulating, inclusive, caring and learning environments so that all children have the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>

	<p pid=".2345W.5/1">The information requested can be provided only at disproportionate cost, however the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) estimate that in 2003&ndash;04, the latest period for which data are currently available, further education (FE) colleges received approximately &pound;47 million for the education of asylum seekers and their dependants. Information for earlier years is not readily available. Asylum seekers and their dependants are eligible for FE if they are supported by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) or receive similar (usually local authority) support. Asylum seekers not receiving NASS or similar support are not eligible for publicly funded FE.</p>
	<p pid=".2345W.5/2">In the first quarter of 2005, the number of asylum applications was 22 per cent. lower than the same period in 2004, and 69 per cent. lower than the fourth quarter of 2002. This fall in intake follows the introduction of a range of measures by the Government to reduce the number of unfounded asylum claims. We are continuing to introduce measures that will reduce the number of unfounded claims still further and increase removals of failed asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".2345W.5/3">The Department does not keep separate records on the number of children of those in the immigration and asylum system who are being educated at school. Nor do data produced by the Higher Education Statistics Agency separately identify individuals and their families in the immigration and asylum system studying in higher education courses. It is not therefore possible to estimate costs for these areas of education.</p>

Provisional matched administrative data shows that 49.2 per cent. of 19-year-olds in 2004 in England had attained at least level 2 by age 16 increasing to 67.0 per cent. by age 19. This equates to around 110,000 additional learners attaining at least level 2 between age 16 and 19. Around 3,000 of these additional learners achieved in the Essex Learning and Skills Council (LSC) area. Figures are currently not available for respondents with no qualifications or below local LSC area. This is the first year for which we have matched data to age 19, hence time series data are not available.</p>

	<p pid=".2368W.9/1">The Department does not have information on what the funding gap is between school sixth forms and further education colleges in the <i>(a)</i> Carlisle and <i>(b)</i> Penrith and the Border constituencies specifically.</p>
	<p pid=".2368W.9/2">The current funding gap between school sixth forms and further education colleges has arisen due to a number of reasons including the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act and the removal of the incorporated FE sector funding systems from local authority control. This resulted in a divergence from local authority systems and funding differences. These differences were made more apparent when all post 16 funding became the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".2368W.9/3">Government have shown their commitment to Further Education (FE) through the unprecedented investment they are now making. Total funding for FE will increase by over &pound;1 billion in 2005/06 compared to 2002/03&mdash;a 25 per cent. cash increase.</p>
	<p pid=".2368W.9/4">The Government acknowledges that, despite this significant investment in FE and a narrowing of the difference between funding rates, there remains a funding gap between school sixth forms and colleges. We must be clear that continuing progress on narrowing the gap will not be easy and will depend on the resources available. However, as signalled in the Minister of State for Schools and 14&ndash;19 Learning's statement to the House of Commons <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> we intend to explore the scope for addressing the technical anomalies between the school sixth form and further education funding systems. We aim to announce decisions on the way forward in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".2371W.5/1">Arranging provision for children with special educational needs (SEN) is a matter for schools and local education authorities (LEAS), within the framework set out in the Education Act 1996 and taking account of statutory guidance, such as the SEN Code of Practice. More broadly, LEAs have statutory duties to provide sufficient schools and to keep their arrangements for SEN under review.</p>
	<p pid=".2371W.5/2">Under the Learning and Skills Act 2000 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) must have regard to the needs of people with learning difficulties and or disabilities. The LSC is aware of the need to secure sufficient quantity, and appropriate quality, of provision for this group of learners and has commissioned an independent review of the planning and funding of provision. The review is due to report in September, following which there will be a wide consultation on the implementation of its recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".2372W.0/2">The majority of funding for schools&mdash;mainstream and special&mdash;is provided by central Government through local authority (LA) formula spending shares, with LAs providing the rest through the council tax.</p>
	<p pid=".2372W.0/3">Funding is distributed to schools on the basis of funding formulae devised by LAs, which calculate the budget share for each of their schools. It is for each LA to devise and revise its own school funding formula, taking account of local needs and circumstances. For special schools, including schools for pupils with moderate learning difficulties, most funding is place-led, with the number of places agreed with the LA. The cost of planned places will depend on the complexity of the learning needs the schools have to address. LAs should review the number of planned places and their funding levels each year, in partnership with their special schools.</p>

	<p pid=".2373W.5/1">Last year we worked with a sample of LEAs and schools to assess the costs of implementing PPA time. It was as a result of that work that the minimum funding guarantee for the current year was set at 5 per cent. for primary and nursery schools and 4 per cent. for secondary and special schools. The funding settlement was welcomed by members of the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group&mdash;the signatories to the national agreement on work force reform. It is the view of all members of the group that there is enough money in the system for all schools to implement this reform in full.</p>

In autumn 2005 the Government expect to set the guarantee for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 at a level covering anticipated average cost pressures on schools in each year, including the full year costs of implementing work force reform, subject to a final assessment of those pressures.</p>

	<p pid=".2374W.2/1">The Government currently have no plans to issue guidance on the amount of time per day that children aged five to 15 should watch television. We are aware of some studies which have found links between excessive television watching and obesity, disruptive behaviour, and poor educational performance in children. Parents are best placed to regulate their children's television viewing and to ensure that they lead a balanced, healthy lifestyle. To achieve that objective, the Government are working to increase the information available to parents. Through, for example, Extended Schools; our Youth Green Paper proposals; the Healthy Schools Standard; school sports and PE within the curriculum; and volunteering and mentoring in schools linked to PSHE within the curriculum, we are also working to increase the opportunities available for children and young people to participate in a range of constructive activities as an alternative to watching television.</p>

But for a number of reasons, it is not possible to say exactly what effect this will have on the HEIPR: the HEIPR only covers students entering HE by age 30, and excludes those with prior HE experience; part-time students contribute to HEIPR, but these are excluded from the UCAS figures; and it is final acceptances, not applicants, which are important.</p>

	<p pid=".2380W.0/1">Climate change levy is assessed on UK industry as a whole and it is not feasible to make an assessment of its impact on every business sector or individual company. The CCL was introduced with offsetting tax cuts for business which included a 0.3 percentage point reduction in employers' national insurance contributions introduced at the same time as the levy in April 2001, support for energy efficiency through enhanced capital allowances and the setting up of the Carbon Trust.</p>
	<p pid=".2380W.0/2">The Government published an independent evaluation by Cambridge Econometrics of the climate change levy at Budget 2005 (available from the House of Commons Library or the HMRC website.<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a>). This showed that climate change levy is expected to deliver significant annual carbon dioxide savings of over 3.5 million tonnes of carbon in 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".2380W.0/3">No specific assessment has been made of the effects of the levy on individual companies' investment decisions or energy intensity levels.</p>
	<p pid=".2380W.0/4">Businesses in sectors that sign climate change agreements committing them to meet energy efficiency targets receive an 80 per cent. reduction in the levy. Eligibility is currently dependent on a sector being covered by the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations, although in Budget 2004 the Government announced plans to extend eligibility, subject to state aid approval to their proposals. Under the existing arrangements, climate change agreements were drawn up with relevant trade bodies before the levy was introduced in 2001. Six manufacturers have signed the New Rubber Tyre Manufacturing Sector's umbrella agreement and therefore receive the 80 per cent. discount. However, there has been no other formal application process under the current eligibility criteria, and therefore no details of successful or unsuccessful applicants in any sectors.</p>

	<p pid=".2380W.3/1">The hon. Gentleman had asked how much the Department has spent on organising or sponsoring conferences in each of the last five years. The Treasury's accounting system did not, until <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, treat conferences organised or sponsored by the Department as a separate category of expenditure. To provide the information requested, it would therefore have been necessary to review the transactions in each of the accounts to which conference costs might have been posted (for example the account for rent, for hire of conference premises; the accounts for travel and subsistence; the account for catering) and determine (by reference to invoices if necessary) which of those transactions were for hosted or sponsored conferences. There are many thousands of transactions each year and collating the information for any one financial year would have exceeded the &pound;600 threshold for disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".2380W.3/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, the Treasury has an account specifically for the direct non-staff costs of conferences organised or sponsored by the Department, so it will be possible to provide that information for future years.</p>

	<p pid=".2386W.2/1">Postage costs for tax credits were around &pound;3 million for 1999&ndash;2000; &pound;5 million for 2001&ndash;02; &pound;9 million, for 2002&ndash;03; &pound;10.5 million, for 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;14 million for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".2386W.2/2">The costs for 1999&ndash;2000 relate to the costs of sending information to working families' tax credit (WFTC) and disabled person's tax credit (DPTC) applicants. This was a much smaller population that for child tax credit (CTC) and working tax credit (WTC) and the fixed nature of WFTC and DPTC awards meant that fewer communications were necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".2386W.2/3">During 2002&ndash;03 recipients of WFTC, DPTC and children's tax credit were sent claim packs in readiness for the introduction for CTC and WTC in April 2003. From 2004&ndash;05 renewals packs were sent to all CTC and WTC claimants, then each claimant would have received award notice as the previous year's award was finalised and the new award set up. So, the number of items each claimant needed to receive in the second year was more than in the first year.</p>

Half of the sum CIL is deemed to spend in the Republic of Ireland comes from light dues levied on shipping at UK ports, but no amount is allocated in advance for this contribution.

Prior to that, we have no record of UK visas funding separate activities promoting equality and diversity.

	<p pid=".2405W.2/1">As part of their better regulation efforts, the European Commission is reviewing over 200 legislative proposals with a view to their possible withdrawal or modification. They include proposals for which no impact assessment was carried out; on which substantial progress has not been made for some time; or where new scientific evidence, market developments or social change justify a review. We fully support this initiative and have suggested two specific proposals that could be considered in this review:</p>
	<p pid=".2405W.2/2" class="indent">Draft directives on the safety of nuclear installations and on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste; and</p>
	<p pid=".2405W.2/3" class="indent">Draft directive 2003/0246 on Access to Justice.</p>
	<p pid=".2405W.2/4">In both cases, we judge that appropriate EU and/or national measures already exist. The memorandum submitted to the Commission on these directives has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".2411W.6/1">Aside from informal qualitative consultations used to inform the planning of public diplomacy campaigns overseas and outreach activities within the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and its agencies have centrally commissioned only one opinion research survey during this period. The details of this study are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".2411W.6/2" class="indent">Date: October 2004</p>
	<p pid=".2411W.6/3" class="indent">Subject: India pre-campaign survey</p>
	<p pid=".2411W.6/4" class="indent">Detail: This opinion survey aimed to benchmark attitudes towards, and associations with, the UK among educated, urban 18 to 35-year-old Indians in advance of a major public diplomacy initiative in India.</p>
	<p pid=".2411W.6/5" class="indent">Contractor: Synovate India</p>
	<p pid=".2411W.6/6" class="indent">Cost: &pound;4,850</p>
	<p pid=".2411W.6/7">The results of this piece of research will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".2411W.6/8">In addition to the survey listed above, the FCO's posts overseas will occasionally commission survey research locally. However, a comprehensive list of these studies is not kept centrally, and could be compiled only over a much longer timescale, and at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".2413W.5/2">I regret that the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> contained an error. The correct answer should read as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/3">In September 2005 the UN Millennium Review Summit will address recommendations on reform of the UN system put forward by the UN Secretary- General in his report &quot;In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, Security and Human Rights for All&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/4">The Government welcome these proposals and hope to build on them at the summit. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, in his meetings with the UN Secretary-General, has highlighted the importance that the UK attaches to improved governance at the UN.</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/5">The UK has identified four areas of governance where we would like to see specific actions taken:</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/6" class="indent">Accountability&mdash;oversight capacity within the UN must be strengthened, and its independence and authority enhanced.</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/7" class="indent">Professionalism and modernisation&mdash;there must be transparent, competence based recruitment throughout the UN system and the introduction of modern human resources practices.</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/8" class="indent">Efficiency&mdash;activity at the UN should be rationalised, modernised and streamlined to reduce duplication and to focus on priority areas.</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/9" class="indent">Flexibility&mdash;in return for the measures mentioned above, the Secretary-General should be provided with the authority and flexibility to manage resources and to redeploy them according to need.</p>
	<p pid=".2413W.5/10">In addition, we want to see a Security Council that reflects today's world and the contributions of the UN's members to its objectives. The UK therefore supports the expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent membership.</p>

	<p pid=".2419W.2/1">Land Use Consultants were awarded a contract in January 2004 to produce good practice guidance for planning and tourism. The contract comprised three core objectives: to identify and recommend the scope of good practice guidance; to identify and articulate good practice in a variety of contexts; and to draft the guidance. The fixed price for the contract, had all the work been undertaken by Land Use Consultants, was &pound;93,255 excluding VAT. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Land Use Consultants agreed in early 2005 that it would be better, given the level of planning policy expertise resting within ODPM, for some of the work to be completed in-house. Around 40 per cent. of the total contract price was paid to Land Use Consultants.</p>

This is as a result of the ongoing transfer of council-owned stock to housing associations. It has been noted (in the 2001 census and in most household surveys&mdash;including the labour force survey) that households living in dwellings where there has been a change of ownership have a tendency to continue to report that they rent from the council rather than a housing association for some time after the transfer.</p>

This is because changes to the allocation legislation (Part 6 of the Housing Act 1996) introduced by the Homelessness Act 2002 removed the power for local authorities to implement blanket exclusions of certain categories of applicant. All applicants are eligible for an allocation of accommodation, with the exception of certain persons from abroad, and those whom the authority decide to treat as ineligible as a result of serious unacceptable behaviour. However, local authorities may take into account any local connection which exists between the applicant and the local authority district in determining priority for an allocation.</p>

	<p pid=".2433W.5/1">The effectiveness of the competent person scheme operated by the Oil Firing Technical Association for the Petroleum Industry Ltd.

	<p pid=".2451W.0/1">NI Departments hold information in respect of working days lost due to psychiatric/psychological illnesses. However, it is not currently possible to determine precisely if these absences have been caused by, or made worse by work-related stress. Therefore, the information set out as follows reflects only those cases where work-related stress was specifically reported on either self-certificates or on medical certificates. Information on costs is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate costs. Work is under way to develop a coding system that will more accurately record work-related illnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".2451W.0/2">A range of corporate measures has been introduced to help tackle stress including the promotion of work life balance, healthy lifestyle programmes and a Workplace Health Improvement Programme. Departments have also produced guidance for staff and managers on how to identify and manage work-related stress and complimented by training and awareness seminars. Managers also have the support of the Occupational Health Service (OHS), including the provision of Psychiatric nursing services, a comprehensive Welfare service and Employee Support Programmes (EAP). These programmes and support mechanisms take a more holistic view of staff health and well-being, including stress. While we can identify the overall cost of the provision of services, such as the OHS, Welfare and EAPs, any costing information, specific to work-related stress, is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".2451W.0/3">A major workforce health survey is currently underway with over 30,000 Northern Ireland civil servants invited to complete a health questionnaire. The survey contains a substantial section on stress, and seeks to identify where work may have been a contributory factor. The stress questions have been based on the Health and Safety Executive's Stress Management Standards.</p>

Until now the standard unit of presenting local statistical information has been the Electoral Ward (Wards). However, in Northern Ireland, Wards vary greatly in population size (Census 2001), from fewer than 800 residents to more than 9,000. This is not ideal for regional and local comparisons. SOAs have been created on a ward-by-ward basis taking into account measures of population size and mutual proximity. SOAs may constitute a whole ward, or part of a ward, and aim to provide standard areas of geography with a population between a lower threshold of 1,300 and an upper threshold of 2800.</p>

	<p pid=".2461W.8/1">Sick absence statistics for the Northern Ireland Departments are analysed by financial year as opposed to calendar year. The information set out at table 1 as follows represents the total number of days lost due to sickness absence in each of the 11 Departments of the NI Administration, their agencies and the NIO for the period 2003&ndash;04. The information relating to non-departmental public bodies is not available centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The 2004&ndash;05 figures for NI Departments and NIO are currently being processed and are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid=".2461W.8/2">The information set out at table 2 represents the total number of days lost due to sickness in the NI Prison Service for the period 2003&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".2461W.8/3">The &quot;Working days lost per staff year&quot; approach is based on Cabinet Office recommendation. This approach replaced &quot;working days lost per person&quot; which can misrepresent the absence rate in organisations which have a high proportion of part-time staff and/or high levels of staff turnover.</p>
	<p pid=".2461W.8/4">Published statistics for Northern Ireland Departments for the financial years 2000&ndash;01 to 2003&ndash;04 are accessible on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dfpni.gov.uk/publications">www.dfpni.gov.uk/publications</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".2468W.2/3">Information about carer's allowance is made available to carers via a wide variety of outlets&mdash;social security offices, Jobcentre Plus offices, Welfare Benefits offices, on-line at DWP websites and through various helplines. In addition, through its network of pension centres and its local service, the Pension Service considers the needs of all its customers and encourages them to take up the range of benefits, including carer's allowance, to which they may be entitled.</p>

You also asked, how often checks have been made on the accuracy of the Child Support Agency's checking teams.</p>
	<p pid=".2469W.2/5" class="indent">The Agency's Secretary of State target for new scheme cases is &quot;that accuracy on the last decision for all maintenance calculations checked to be correct to the nearest penny in at least 90% of cases.&quot; For 2004/2005, the Agency reported 75% accuracy for new scheme cases and for 2005/2006, the year to date total for new scheme cases has increased to 82%.</p>
	<p pid=".2469W.2/6" class="indent">For old scheme cases, the Agency's internal target is &quot;that accuracy on the last decision for all maintenance calculations checked to be correct to the nearest penny in at least 82% of cases.&quot; For 2004/2005, the Agency reported 78% accuracy for old scheme cases and for 2005/2006, the year to date total for old scheme cases is 77%.</p>
	<p pid=".2469W.2/7" class="indent">The accuracy rate of child support assessments is determined by checks carried out by the Monitoring and Guidance Unit (MAGU). This unit was established as an independent body to monitor quality independent from the Agency. MAGU was audited by the Internal Assurance Service last year following their assessment of the 2003/2004 accuracy rate. As part of this validation process, 26 cases were selected at random per business unit (156 in total for the Agency). Internal Assurance Service concluded that they agreed with MAGU's findings, confirming the validity of their results. I am satisfied that the monitoring of cases undertaken by MAGU forms an appropriate independent assurance; their accuracy rate is therefore not checked on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid=".2469W.2/8" class="indent">Business units carry out a number of local checks, including accuracy, debt adjustment and closure. They are provided with a quota for each of these checks to determine the number to be done. These checks are not validated by MAGU. They provide the business with an assurance that these types of cases are being actioned correctly and that any incorrect practices can be addressed at a local level.</p>

	<p pid=".2470W.0/6" class="indent">Last year the Agency undertook 37,895 checks on the old scheme cases and 23,226 checks on new scheme cases.</p>

	<p pid=".2471W.2/2">Payments could have been erroneously paid to the person with care instead of to the Secretary of State when the Child Support Agency believes the person with care is off benefit but they are actually on benefit. If the person with care fails to report receipt of this payment as an income, there would be an overpayment of benefit and this would have to be recovered. Child Support Agency do not hold records on how often this occurs or the amounts that are involved for this category of overpayment.</p>
	<p pid=".2471W.2/3">All overpayments of benefit are recovered via our debt management organisation. To be able to answer the question our records would have to be able to identify erroneous payments of maintenance as an overpayment cause. Unfortunately our systems do not capture data on this specific cause&mdash;they would be included in all records of overpayments caused by income.</p>

	<p pid=".2471W.5/6" class="indent">In the period April 2003 to March 2004 the total turnover was 15% and between April 2004 to March 2005 17%. For the purpose of this response turnover has been taken to include all staff who joined or left the Agency in this period. Between April 2003 and March 2005 3398 full time equivalent staff left the Agency and 2290 full time equivalent staff were recruited. These figures include temporary staff.</p>
	<p pid=".2471W.5/7" class="indent">All staff in the Agency have an annual entitlement to leave and are expected to use that entitlement over the course of the year. All staff should therefore have taken leave between April 2003 and March 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".2471W.5/8" class="indent">I hope this answer is useful.</p>

	<p pid=".2472W.5/4" class="indent">Under the child support scheme that existed prior to March 2003, a parent with care was required to authorise the Secretary of State to pursue maintenance from the non-resident parent. Under the new scheme, where an application is made by a parent with care for Income Support or income based Jobseekers Allowance, this is also treated as an application for child maintenance. The parent with care is then required to supply the details of the non-resident parent. However, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that if they were to be required to comply there would be a risk to them or to any of their children living with them of harm or undue distress as a result, no further action will be taken. If there are no such grounds, withholding information can lead to a loss of benefit under a Reduced Benefit Direction.</p>

Eurostat's rate of over three-day injury includes those injuries defined in the UK as 'major' injuries. When GB's over three-day and major injury rates are combined, the rate is 1018.7.</p>

	<p pid=".2480W.6/3" class="indent">The Disability Rights Commission Act 1999 established the Disability Rights Commission to work towards the elimination of discrimination against disabled people; promote equalisation of opportunities for disabled people; encourage good practice in the treatment of disabled people, and review the working of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (including section 2). In particular, the Disability Rights Commission issues Codes of Practice for the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The Code of Practice on Employment and Occupation came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> by virtue of SI No 2302 of 2004, Disability Discrimination Codes of Practice (Employment and Occupation, and Trade Organisations and Qualifications Bodies) Appointed Day Order 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".2480W.6/5" class="indent">Sections 15, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 23 of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 remain in force.

In exercising their functions, the Teacher Training Agency shall have regard to the requirements of ,people who are disabled for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (section 1(4) of the Education Act 1994).</p>
	<p pid=".2480W.6/7" class="indent">Ancillary to the above provisions, the Learning and Skills Council are required, when exercising their functions (which include the provision of proper facilities for education and training taking into account, among others matters, the education and training required in different sections of employment for employees and potential employees, sections 2 and 3 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000) to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity between people who are disabled and those who are not, by virtue of section 14(1 )<i>(c)</i> of the Learning and Skills Act 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".2484W.5/2">The Families and Children Study collects a wealth of information. Because of the quantity of variables on the dataset it is not practical to include all of these in the annual reports. Judgments are made about which information is most relevant to the Government Departments sponsoring the study. The report &quot;Family life in Britain: findings from the 2003 Families and Children Study&quot;, which is available in the Library, describes families as either lone parent or couple families as this is consistent with how DWP clients are segmented in welfare-to-work programmes and the benefit system.

	<p pid=".2485W.9/1">We have been working with the Home Office to identify areas where the identity cards scheme could provide business benefits. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. friend, the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the identity cards scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational.</p>
	<p pid=".2485W.9/2">The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the identity cards scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".2485W.9/3">We have conducted a high level assessment of the number of card readers that will be required by the Department. Our initial estimate is that in the region of 4,500 readers may be required. The Home Office currently estimate the cost of a card reader would fall within the range of &pound;250&mdash;&pound;750 depending on their level of sophistication and performance.</p>
	<p pid=".2485W.9/4">Detailed work is being undertaken on how the Department will make use of checking the biometric identities of individuals. This will become clearer following further definition of the identity card scheme and DWP business requirements for interaction with the scheme are fully known. However the use of the biometric identity card will facilitate the verification of customer identity and improve customer service. From a counter fraud perspective the production of a biometric identity card will stop an individual registering a claim to benefit in more than one identity.</p>

	<p pid=".2487W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Lesley Strathie to Dr. Lynne Jones, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-30">30 August 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".2487W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning what the average cost of processing a claim for Income Support using the Customer Management System (CMS) is; what the cost was <i>(a)</i> prior to the introduction of CMS and <i>(b)</i> where the system has yet to be introduced. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".2487W.2/4" class="indent">In answer to the first part of your question, the implementation of CMS is being progressed on an office-by-office basis along with various other new initiatives. Unit cost data is generated at this level but you will appreciate that this is not the only change impacting on districts over this period of time. You will also appreciate that the significant changes in processing necessitated by CMS mean that some costs are now incurred in different parts of the business. Due to these complexities work to correctly evaluate the impact of CMS implementation has not as yet been completed and I am not currently in a position to provide this data.</p>
	<p pid=".2487W.2/5" class="indent">However, as part of the original business case, a work study exercise was performed on the part of the Income Support claim process affected by CMS. This identified that pre-CMS, the average cost of this part of the process was &pound;17.40. After CMS is introduced the average cost is expected to fall to &pound;15.09, representing an average saving per claim of &pound;2.31. Jobcentre Plus processes approximately 900,000 new Income Support claims per annum. This would imply an annual saving in the region of &pound;2 million, but this does not take into account all the other benefits arising from more efficient management of customer information.</p>
	<p pid=".2487W.2/6" class="indent">Nevertheless, when CMS has been fully rolled out across Jobcentre Plus we will be able to compare costs before and after implementation. We are currently intending to perform a full post-implementation evaluation in Spring 2006 when more detailed unit cost information will be available. However, as other initiatives are being implemented in Jobcentre Plus, changes in unit costs may not necessarily be directly attributable to CMS introduction.</p>
	<p pid=".2487W.2/7" class="indent">Regarding the second part of your question, up to the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July 2005</phrase>, CMS had been introduced in 24 contact centres and 437 Jobcentre Plus offices around the country, and has yet to be introduced in approximately 62% of the network.</p>
	<p pid=".2487W.2/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".2488W.5/4" class="indent">I am aware that the Secretary of State for Wales and the First Minister have discussed the effect of the Efficiency Review on Civil Service jobs in Wales on a number of occasions.</p>

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Lesley Strathie as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. As she is currently on leave I am responding on her behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".2489W.2/4" class="indent">Firstly, I must re-affirm Jobcentre Plus' commitment to providing a fully bi-lingual service to our customers in Wales. Although we will be changing the way we deliver some of our services, it is not envisaged that these changes will have an adverse effect upon our Welsh Language service.</p>
	<p pid=".2489W.2/5" class="indent">The provision of an effective Welsh Language service is no longer dependent upon the existence of a large number of public facing offices. We are conducting more of our business by telephone or on-line. Where it is necessary to see a customer in person this is generally done by appointment, allowing enough time to arrange for a suitably skilled member of staff to conduct the interview in the customer's language of choice.</p>
	<p pid=".2489W.2/6" class="indent">You will no doubt recall that David Anderson, the former Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, wrote to you in September last year, in response to your earlier question about our Welsh Language service. In his letter, Mr Anderson outlined the steps we were taking to safeguard this service, which included our plans for a new Contact Centre in Bangor, North Wales and I am now in a position to confirm that our Bangor site will open in April 2006, providing employment opportunities for up to 330 staff.</p>
	<p pid=".2489W.2/7" class="indent">Whilst I am unable to say specifically how many of our Welsh speaking staff, or for that matter their English speaking colleagues, will be affected by the changes in the way we deliver our services, the availability of Welsh speakers, amongst both our existing workforce and, more generally, the local population, was a key influencing factor when deciding to locate to Bangor. We envisage that a minimum of 50 staff, at this site, will be engaged full-time, in providing a dedicated Welsh Language service to our customers.</p>
	<p pid=".2489W.2/8" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus also has a long-standing commitment to encourage and support existing members of staff wishing to learn Welsh or improve their ability to speak Welsh in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".2489W.2/9" class="indent">I am confident that the commitments we have entered into in the Department's Welsh Language Scheme, along with our significant investment in Bangor, will mean that Jobcentre Plus is well placed to provide a robust Welsh Language service for many years to come.</p>

	<p pid=".2491W.2/1">The information requested is not available. This is because any figures are snapshots of claimants at a given time.

	<p pid=".2491W.2/2">However I am able to give you information on the monthly average of people receiving jobseekers allowance (JSA) and a month by month breakdown.

	<p pid=".2494W.0/1">The information is not available in the format requested. There were 770,000 pensioner households (952,000 individuals) receiving the guarantee element of pension credit only at March 2005. Income is brought fully into account in these cases, although they are not subject to separate benefit withdrawal of council tax benefit or housing benefit (CTB/HB). There were an additional 1,346,000 pensioner households (1,554,000 individuals) receiving both the guarantee and savings credit elements of pension credit at March 2005.

As a result of pension credit, this 60 per cent. no longer face MDRs of 100 per cent. In addition, at May 1997 there were 630,000 pensioner households (820,000 individuals) with incomes above guarantee element levels, but receiving both tapered HB and tapered CTB.

	<p pid=".2499W.2/1">This is an important area for partnership between DWP and the three Departments&mdash;the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, HM Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry&mdash;with responsibility for the regional economic performance PSA target. DWP has given its support to the objectives of the REP PSA and is represented on the steering group that co-ordinates government activity aimed at meeting the target.</p>
	<p pid=".2499W.2/2">Over 90 per cent. of local authorities in Great Britain have an employment rate above the EU average. Low employment is concentrated in a relatively small number of areas across the country, particularly in our major cities, some former industrial areas and some coastal towns, including Hartlepool.</p>
	<p pid=".2499W.2/3">DWP's PSA targets support the Government's wider agenda by aiming to raise employment rates, especially for groups and areas of the country that currently lag behind the national average. Central to achieving this is the work of Jobcentre Plus and programmes such as new deal, which concentrate resources on areas with concentrations of long-term unemployment and economic inactivity. In addition there are locally focused programmes such as action teams that provide additional support in particularly disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid=".2499W.2/4">Initiatives such as the Northern Way complement this approach by providing further help and support on top of existing welfare to work policies. The Northern Way has recognised the importance of tackling the number of people on incapacity benefits. The last year has seen the numbers on these benefits nationally fall for the first time in several decades, partly through the success of Jobcentre Plus, the new deal and pathways to work. Although the improvement has been concentrated in the areas with the highest rates of benefit receipt, parts of the north-east and other regions continue to have disproportionate numbers claiming incapacity benefits.</p>

As a result of that review we will be trialling an Adult Learning Option from autumn 2006 in two or three Jobcentre Plus districts in England. The pilot will test the effectiveness of providing financial support for adult Jobcentre Plus customers whose current qualification is below Level 2 to enable them to take up a first full Level 2 qualification through Learning and Skills Council funded provision. Study will be full-time for those taking up the option. At the same time, for those on Jobseekers Allowance who do not take up the learning option, the benefit rules will be strengthened to ensure that any learning is genuinely part-time and does not interfere with job search activity.</p>

	<p pid=".2502W.9/1">For today's women pensioners, pension credit has made a significant contribution to tackling the legacy of pension inequality. For younger women, the state second pension, improving opportunities for women in the workplace and the increasing options for pension flexibility have all contributed to ensuring more equal pension rights for future female pensioners. The proportion of women who are now accruing significant second-tier state pensions is similar to that of men.</p>
	<p pid=".2502W.9/2">We want to continue to make progress. Fair outcomes for women and carers is one of our principles for pension reform and will be one of the key factors on which proposals for reform will be judged. To help develop our thinking, we will be holding an event later this year to discuss how to make the pensions system work well for women. Prior to this event, we will publish our analysis of the pension position of women to enable evidence-based discussion.</p>

	<p pid=".2504W.6/1">Rights to a state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) pension inherited from a deceased spouse, including rights derived from contracted-out employment prior to <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-06">6 April 1997</phrase>, are included in the surviving spouses state pension forecasts where the Department is informed of the person's marital status.</p>
	<p pid=".2504W.6/2">A number of factors, including contracting-out, determine the extent to which state SERPS pension can be inherited. Leaflet SERPSL1 provides general information on inheritance of a SERPS pension and points out that there is an interaction with any contracted-out occupational pension provision accrued prior to 1997. More detailed information is available in leaflet NP46: a guide to State Pensions. We keep the content of our leaflets under review to ensure that the information is accurate.</p>
	<p pid=".2504W.6/3">Information on the total number of people receiving an inherited SERPS pension and whether the deceased spouse, from whose contributions the pension is derived, was contracted-out of SERPS is not available as it is not possible to separately identify the inherited element of a SERPS pension where the recipient is also entitled to a SERPS pension in their own right. Such information as is available is below and relates solely to people whose only entitlement to a SERPS pension is derived from their deceased spouse's contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".2504W.6/4">At <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>, around 639,200 recipients of category B state pension had potential entitlement to an inherited SERPS pension before any adjustment in respect of their deceased's spouse's contracted-out employment was applied. An adjustment was applied in 366,800 cases. Following the adjustment, 1,000 had no entitlement to an inherited SERPS pension and 365,800 had entitlement to a reduced inherited SERPS pension.</p>

The Government response to the Home Affairs Select Committee published in June 2005 addressed this point after it had been raised during the Committee's inquiry into antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".2514W.8/2">The Government explained that mediation can form an important part of a tiered approach to tackling antisocial behaviour. However we would not wish to advocate one single response approach as this might not be applicable to all local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".2514W.8/3">Mediation also forms part of our advice to practitioners on the preventative and support measures as part of the TOGETHER campaign.</p>

	<p pid=".2517W.5/1">As indicated in my earlier response to the hon. Member of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-07-18.1495W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1495W</phrase>, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and associated Codes of Practice require that persons detained in a police station who appear to be mentally vulnerable must be given special consideration as summarised in Code C, Annex E. In cases of those people detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983, an approved social worker and registered medical practitioner must be called to interview and examine the detainee. The police station is not the most suitable place to detain people suffering from mental disorder and it is not always possible in that environment to ensure that people suffering from mental disorder are identified and given suitable attention.</p>
	<p pid=".2517W.5/2">These issues are exacerbated at the point of arrest. In cases of arrest which are not pre-planned, the ability to make use of someone from social services is impractical. The circumstances of the arrest and any considered risk must be notified to the custody officer on arrival at the police station. In cases of a planned arrest, it is an operational decision for the chief officer of the force concerned how best that should be carried out and any other personnel who should accompany the arresting officer.</p>

	<p pid=".2523W.6/1">As a general rule, individuals with limited leave to remain in the UK are not entitled to certain income-related benefits, including disability living allowance and severe disablement allowance, because they are funded entirely out of revenue from general taxation and entitlement does not require payment of national insurance contributions. The rationale behind this is that those who have not established their right to remain permanently in the UK should not have welfare provision on the same basis as those whose citizenship or status here gives them an entitlement to benefits when in need. This is reflected in the immigration rules.</p>
	<p pid=".2523W.6/2">All those admitted to the UK for a temporary purpose are required under the rules to be able to maintain and accommodate themselves and any dependants without recourse to a defined list of public funds.

	<p pid=".2524W.5/1">The systematic capture of passenger information in advance of travel is at the heart of our multi-agency e-Borders programme, which will create a modernised and secure border for the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".2524W.5/2">As part of the work which led to the development of the e-Borders vision, a significant amount of research was carried out by the Immigration Service into the potential benefits that the receipt of passenger information in advance of travel could bring in improving both the effectiveness and efficiency of border control. As part of that work a comprehensive study was carried out in 2002 by an external contractor, which concluded that there were substantial benefits, including in the area of enhanced border security, to be gained from an Advance Passenger Processing system with advance passenger information at its core.</p>
	<p pid=".2524W.5/3">Many other countries have introduced, or are seeking to introduce, systems which aim to exploit the benefits of advance passenger information and the development of the e-Borders concept owes much to the research we have conducted into other countries' practical experience in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".2524W.5/4">The border agencies are already using passenger information to varying degrees and day to day experience demonstrates the benefits that having such data in advance of travel can bring. Moving forward with the e-Borders programme, project Semaphore, the pilot test bed project for the wider programme, is currently giving us the opportunity to learn more about the practical use of advance passenger information the receipt of which, even on the restricted number of routes involved so far, is already providing tangible operational benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".2527W.8/1">The Government are determined to do everything they can to protect children from the insidious use of the internet by paedophiles.</p>
	<p pid=".2527W.8/2">We have established the Task Force on Child Protection on the internet which includes representatives of the industry, the police, children's charities, MPs from the main parties and others, as a forum where ideas to protect children and promote safe use of the internet can be discussed and developed. Among the many initiatives to come out of the task force's work, the Home Office has run four public awareness campaigns to reinforce the basic safety messages to parents and children, has developed various models of good practice including access to content through mobile phones, and is close to finalising documents covering moderated chat and search services. The industry has worked, through the Internet Watch Foundation, to virtually eliminate hosting of illegal images of child abuse by UK companies and a number of providers have developed solutions to block access to material hosted overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".2527W.8/3">The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, made grooming a child, both offline and online, an offence, punishable by up to 10 years in jail. We have increased the maximum sentences for possession and distribution of indecent images of children (offences for possession from six months to five years and for production and distribution offences from three years' imprisonment to 10 years).</p>
	<p pid=".2527W.8/4">We also announced in April that we will set up a new Centre for Child Protection on the internet to support the police and child protection agencies. The centre will target paedophiles using the internet to distribute illegal images and &quot;groom&quot; children, and aims to reduce the harm caused to children, families and the wider community by child abuse facilitated by misuse of the internet. The centre will also include the Secretariat to the Virtual Global Taskforce, an international alliance of law enforcement agencies seeking to share lessons learned from investigations into on-line child abuse around the world.</p>
	<p pid=".2527W.8/5">This is an international issue and we continue to take a lead within international fora in tackling this problem, for example through the G8 where Ministers have recently committed to the development of an international database of child abuse images, and through initiatives such as a joint EU Presidency/Virtual Global Taskforce Conference to be held on 14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November</phrase> in Belfast.</p>

	<p pid=".2528W.5/1">Community penalties can be an effective alternative to short term custodial sentences. The actual reconviction rate within two years for adults commencing an order in 2001 was 51 per cent., 1 per cent. lower than the predicted reconviction rate.</p>
	<p pid=".2528W.5/2">Community penalties also display a high compliance rate. Figures for May 2005 show that the compliance rate is 74 per cent. Community penalties allow offenders to maintain employment, education and family links, all factors which are important in reducing the risk of reoffending, whilst punishing the offender and delivering interventions to address offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".2528W.5/3">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changes the structure of community sentences by providing a single order made up of one or more requirements. This allows the court greater flexibility in tailoring the sentence to the offence and the offender in each case, enabling a greater prospect of effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid=".2538W.0/1">The available information is given in the tables. Data at Basic Command Unit level is only available from 1999&ndash;2000. It is estimated that the effect of the introduction nationally of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 was a 23 per cent. increase in recorded violence against the person in its first year. This will also have impacted on detection rates. The introduction of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in May 2004 resulted in substantial changes to the sexual offences. This means that figures for 2004&ndash;05 are not comparable with those for previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".2539W.5/3">Following the introduction of the NCRS, the National Crime Recording Steering Group (NCRSG) has met regularly to review the Counting Rules. The steering group includes members of Research Development and Statistics and the Police Standards Unit of the Home Office, force crime registrars and statistics officers, and representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The Counting Rules are up-dated annually to reflect decisions taken by the NCRSG, changes in legislation and changes to improve clarity and ensure consistency in recording by police forces. In addition, rigorous audit procedures are in place to further ensure a consistent approach across all the police forces in England and Wales. The Counting Rules can be found on the main Home Office website at wvw.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/countrules.html.</p>

In addition, organisations in the United Kingdom including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals (RSPCA) have also undertaken studies, which have looked at the links between serious animal abuse and family violence. These studies suggest that there may be some links between the serious abuse of animals and family violence, including the abuse of children. Although they are of interest it should be noted that most of these studies involve small sample sizes, many of the populations studied are non-representative and no control or comparison groups have been incorporated into the research design. The findings from these studies should, therefore, be treated with a degree of caution.</p>

	<p pid=".2545W.8/1">Crime statistics used for monitoring overall crime trends, such as recorded crime and the British Crime Survey, do not contain information about the drug habits of individual offenders.

	<p pid=".2545W.8/2">The crimes committed by drug users are frequently acquisitive crimes committed to obtain money to buy drugs. Between 2001&ndash;02 and 2004&ndash;05 there has been a 14 per cent. reduction in these crimes overall. This includes a 23 per cent. decrease in burglary, a 27 per cent. reduction in robbery and an 8 per cent. reduction in shoplifting over this time period.</p>
	<p pid=".2545W.8/3">The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involved interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, provides an insight into the proportion of crimes that are drug related. In the study carried out between 1999 and 2001 at 16 custody suites in high crime areas across England and Wales, 38 per cent. of all arrestees included in the survey tested positive for opiates such as heroin, and cocaine/crack. However, the proportion testing positive was higher among those arrested for acquisitive offences: 57 per cent. for those arrested for burglary, 60 per cent. for those arrested for robbery; and 66 per cent. for those arrested for shoplifting.</p>

	<p pid=".2549W.2/2">The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involved interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, included questions on carrying guns. A paper based on the data has been published by T. H. Bennett and K. Holloway, &quot;Possession and use of illegal guns among criminals in England and Wales&quot; (Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, Vol 43, No three, pp 237&ndash;252). The Home Office has also conducted an Arrestee Survey which may highlight this issue. The results of this survey will be published later this year. There have also been discussions in the context of the Home Secretary's round table on gun crime, which has looked at possible links and appropriate interventions.</p>
	<p pid=".2549W.2/3">This research is used to inform policy and legislative proposals. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill includes a number of measures designed to further tighten the firearms legislation, including a ban on the manufacture, import or sale of realistic imitation firearms, an increase from a maximum of six to 12 months sentence for carrying an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, and an increase in the minimum age for possession of an air weapon to 18. The Bill also includes a new offence of using another person to look after, hide or transport a dangerous weapon. These measures complement existing legislation and demonstrate our determination to tackle gun crime.</p>

Mobile users are likely to be charged based upon their mobile tariff. 0800 numbers may not be accessed from overseas and an alternative 020 geographic number is therefore being provided primarily for the use of overseas callers. This number is also available to UK customers, including those using mobile phones who may find the charges lower than the standard rate for 0800.</p>

	<p pid=".2553W.5/1">The draft Framework Decision on the European Enforcement Order and the transfer of sentenced persons between member states of the European Union is at the early stages of negotiation and is subject to a UK Parliamentary scrutiny reservation. The draft Framework Decision is intended to speed up and simplify the existing arrangements for the transfer of prisoners between member states of the EU. It is also intended to facilitate the return of prisoners extradited in accordance with Article 5(3) of the Council Framework Decision of <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-13">13 June 2000</phrase> on the European Arrest Warrant, where surrender of own nationals or residents was subject to a condition that the person would be returned in order to serve any sentence imposed.</p>
	<p pid=".2553W.5/2">Article 7 of the draft Framework Decision proposes a list of generic offences for which dual criminality would not be required in order to execute a European Enforcement Order. The restriction on the application of dual criminality has been accepted by the Government as a necessary element of the mutual recognition arrangements which are to form the basis for judicial co-operation within the EU. The proposed list of offences corresponds to that in the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant and in the Council Framework Decision of <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-22">22 July 2003</phrase> on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".2553W.5/3">The draft Framework Decision does not require prisoners to consent to the transfer, although they must be given an opportunity to express their opinion. Prisoners do not have a right of appeal under the proposed Framework Decision. However, prisoners in the United Kingdom will be able to seek judicial review of any decision made, for which they may be granted publicly funded legal aid.</p>
	<p pid=".2553W.5/4">Prisoners transferred under the draft Framework Decision will be subject to the same prison regime as any other prisoner sentenced in the executing state.</p>
	<p pid=".2553W.5/5">It is likely that the National Offender Management Service will be designated as the central authority for England and Wales.

	<p pid=".2555W.3/1">Explosives trace detection systems based Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) have been in use for many years. In recent years they have been widely deployed at UK airports. The Home Office Scientific Development Branch (formerly the Police Scientific Development Branch) routinely tests new trace detection systems and gives advice on their performance to customers such as the police service and Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid=".2555W.3/2">The test methods used are agreed with the customers and kept under review to ensure they are relevant to the currently perceived terrorist threat. The equipment is supplied by manufacturers free of charge for the trials period.</p>
	<p pid=".2555W.3/3">Unfortunately, since the testing of IMS systems is done as part of a larger programme of evaluation of search and detection equipment it is not possible to say specifically how much it costs each year.</p>

	<p pid=".2563W.2/1">The methodology used to calculate the Identity Card Scheme's financial and economic benefits is based on the Treasury's &quot;Green Book: Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government&quot; guidelines. This outlines how public sector proposals should be appraised before significant funds are committed.</p>
	<p pid=".2563W.2/2">In addition, our estimates have been developed based on input from stakeholders based on a consistent set of assumptions. Associated costs, potential dis-benefits and risks are accounted for and updated regularly using best information available at the time. In the course of conducting our benefits research, the following organisations have been consulted:</p>
	<p pid=".2563W.2/3" class="indent">Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), Driving Standards Authority, Office of e-Envoy, Department for Education and Skills (DfES), Confederation of British Industry, Department of Health (DoH), the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), Royal Mail, Post Office, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Department for Work and Pensions (DWPO, Bichard Projects involving CRB and DfES, Criminal Justice Information Technology (CJIT), UK Passport Service (UKPS), UK Visas, Board of Airline Representatives, British Air Transport Association, Office of National Statistics (ONS), Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), E-Borders Programme, Department for Transport (DfT), the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), Newham Council, Greenwich Council, Hammersmith and Fulham Council, Telecommunications UK Fraud Forum (TUFF), British Bankers Association, Association of Payment Clearance Services (APACS), Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance, Financial Services Authority(FSA).</p>
	<p pid=".2563W.2/4">In addition, a consultation group of 35 employers were engaged through HMRC to discuss benefits relating to payroll and human resource management for the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".2563W.2/5">In the calculation of the benefits overview, no voluntary organisations have been involved to date. However, we are engaging a range of voluntary organisations with regard to requirements definition of the identity card scheme as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".2563W.2/6">Finally, members of the scheme's principal users group (PUG) and private sector user groups (PSUG) were either involved or informed of this work. The membership of these groups is as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".2563W.2/11">While exploratory work started in 2003, in-depth work on the calculations involved in the benefits overview commenced in July 2004. The work behind the benefits overview was conducted as part of the overall work of the identity cards programme team, not as a specific research project, and cannot be separately quantified.</p>

	<p pid=".2568W.3/1">The Government have always taken the view that all legislation must be robust enough to deal with offences whether they are committed on or off line. To this end there is a variety of legislation which deals with offences which can be commissioned utilising computer systems and networks, but which contain no specific reference to use of the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".2568W.3/2">Initiatives and programmes under discussion on which the Home Office leads on this issue include: educating computer users about the risks of fraud committed using the internet through advice on the Home Office website on avoiding internet fraud; we have published jointly with APACS (the Association of Payment Clearing Services) a leaflet on card safety which includes a section on using cards safely over the internet; the Home Office has also created and maintains the &quot;e-tailing&quot; mini site <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/etailing00.htm">www.crimereduction.gov.uk/etailing00.htm</a>, which provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves specifically when using the internet; and finally the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet seeks to protect children using the internet, and from abuse fuelled by criminal misuse of new technologies, and promote safe use of the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".2568W.3/3">In respect of legislation under discussion being developed by the Home Office, the Government and the opposition are working together to develop three new offences that could relate to terrorists' use of the internet. These are: (1) Indirect incitement&mdash;covering any method of making a message available to the public which is intended to encourage others to engage in terrorist activities, while not directly calling upon them to do so; (2) Training in terrorist methods and techniques, and in making or using hazardous substances for terrorist purposes. This offence could be used if individuals take advantage of the internet to carry out such training; (3) Acts preparatory. This would target individuals and groups involved in preparing, instigating or conspiring to commit an act of terrorism. Where the internet is used in this process, such improper use could be targeted. In all three cases, intent to cause or facilitate terrorist activities would have to be proved.</p>
	<p pid=".2568W.3/4">In addition, the Fraud Bill is seeking to ensure that use of computers or the internet to commit or facilitate fraud is criminalised in legislation, the Identity Cards Bill includes an offence of tampering with the National Identity Register including the unauthorised modification of its contents by electronic means, and Government will seek to make amendments to the Computer Misuse Act 1990 when parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid=".2568W.3/5">Within the EU the Safer Internet Programme is designed to complement legislative approaches to combating illegal and harmful material on the internet, by stimulating and supporting self-help and self-regulatory approaches. The original &euro;38.3 million programme between 1999 and 2004: financed projects to create a safer environment via a European network of hot-lines to report illegal content; encouraged self-regulation and codes of conduct; developed filtering and rating systems; and encouraged awareness actions. The new programme, Safer Internet Plus, will run from 2005 to 2008 and has a &euro;45 million budget. The proposed Safer Internet Plus programme aims to both build on its predecessor's achievements and meet new threats.</p>

	<p pid=".2570W.2/2">These events will provide an opportunity to raise the profile of diversion schemes for mentally disordered offenders, identify good practice, and promote a co-ordinated approach to planning and delivery of services. Each diversion scheme will need to meet the needs of the community that it serves, ensuring that offenders coming before the courts have their mental health or other needs assessed at the earliest opportunity, informing sentencing decisions, and facilitating access to health or social care interventions at the right time.</p>

	<p pid=".2579W.8/1">The UK wishes to co-operate as closely as possible with EU partners on asylum and immigration measures despite our position outside Schengen. It would be hard to defend the UK adopting lower biometric standards and a less secure passport design than the rest of our European colleagues, particularly given our resolve with our European partners to strengthen security and border controls following the Madrid bombings. The UKPS Corporate and Business Plan, published in April, noted the likelihood of incorporating fingerprints in UK passports by the end of the decade.</p>
	<p pid=".2579W.8/2">Once Schengen passports contain fingerprints, British passports without fingerprints would move from being amongst the most secure in the world to being one of the weaker links and therefore a more attractive target for forgery and fraudulent applications. The inclusion of fingerprints would strengthen the link between the passport and the holder, would make the document more difficult to forge and would reduce very significantly the risk of duplicate identities on the passport database. Fingerprints are more accurate in identifying fraudulent multiple applications than facial image.</p>
	<p pid=".2579W.8/3">Having the two biometrics, facial image and fingerprint, would increase certainty of identification and help address the situation where one biometric fails to validate the identity. It would facilitate the strengthening of UK border controls for passport holders returning to the UK and hence our national security. Incorporating fingerprints in UK passports would also mean that UK passport holders will not be inconvenienced should other countries further tighten their border controls and would allow British passport holders to benefit from potential future entry control systems in the UK and overseas (e.g. as already being rolled out in Hong Kong).</p>
	<p pid=".2579W.8/4">Once European countries have moved to include fingerprints in passports, if the UK does not follow suit there is every chance our passport holders would be inconvenienced when travelling into Schengen countries especially from outside Europe and be subject to delays and additional questions at border controls.</p>

	<p pid=".2591W.2/2">The information is set out in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".2591W.2/3">Government funding for police authorities is chiefly allocated using a funding formula that distributes resources on the basis of relative need and resources. A damping mechanism subsequently applied to protect all authorities against financial instability ensures all authorities receive an increase in grant at least equal to the &quot;floor&quot; level on a like-for-like basis year-on-year. Grant floors will remain an integral part of the finance system.</p>
	<p pid=".2591W.2/4">Between 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06, every police authority received the amount of grant to which it was entitled under annual Police Grant Reports and Local Government Finance Reports.</p>
	<p pid=".2591W.2/5">The funding formula is currently being reviewed to ensure it continues to provide a robust and fair distribution of grant. A 12 week consultation period on options for formula change began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July</phrase> and will last until <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October</phrase>.

	<p pid=".2596W.2/1">The Home Office's &pound;30 million a year Rural Policing Fund has been specifically introduced to increase the visibility and accessibility of the police in rural areas. 31 police authorities with the most widespread populations benefit from this additional funding. Police authorities who are in receipt of money from this fund may spend it as they see fit. This may involve recruiting additional officers for rural areas or spending the money on other innovative ways to tackle crime and the fear of crime. Examples of existing good practice include the use of mobile police stations or the deployment of community beat officers to patrol clusters of villages or neighbourhoods. Forces are also using dedicated parish or neighbourhood special constables.</p>
	<p pid=".2596W.2/2">A number of police forces have introduced community support officers (CSOs) in rural areas since their introduction in 2002. CSOs help to tackle crime and disorder and provide public reassurance in the communities where they work. The Home Office is also involved in a &quot;Blue Light&quot; pilot for community support officers which aims to create a community focused, multi-functional role for these officers in some rural villages.</p>

Reducing the number of such tragic incidents is a key priority, and an unprecedented amount of work is being done in this area. A broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention strategy is in place. This balances specific measures for those judged most at risk with broader approaches for prisoners generally.</p>

The investigation was conducted in three prisons (Brixton, Feltham and Parc), identified by the Prison Service and Her Majesty's Chief Inspectorate of Prisons. Its findings were accepted in full by the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/2">As a result of the Investigation, the Prison Service is working closely with the CRE to ensure that race equality is managed more effectively across all of the Service's functions, activities and core business requirements. A joint action plan was produced: &quot;Implementing Race Equality in Prisons: A Shared Agenda for Change&quot; which represented a milestone for race relations in the service. The plan forms the basis of a long-term strategy for the Prison Service and will ensure that all establishments fully comply with the legal requirements of the Race Rations (Amendment) Act 2000 and embed the lessons learned from the CRE investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/3">The Prison Service is developing robust measures to identify matters of concern and how to address them, focusing in particular on:</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/4" class="indent">monitoring information through quarterly questionnaires and impact assessments;</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/5" class="indent">development of key performance targets on race equality for staff and prisoners;</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/6" class="indent">training on impact assessments and diversity issues across the estate; and</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/7" class="indent">prisoner intervention strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/8">Over the last 12 months, the Race and Equalities Action Group has revised the Prison Service Race Equality Scheme, which sets out how the service will meet its general statutory duty under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination, promote equality of opportunity, and promote good relations between people of different racial groups during 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".2603W.5/9">Over the next three years, establishments and policy leads will be undertaking impact assessments of all functions, policies and activities within the Prison Service. These assessments will provide evidenced analysis of whether there is the potential for adverse impact or whether there has been actual adverse impact on any racial group. Where there is such evidence, establishments and policy leads will consider what changes need to be made, and make the changes.</p>

	<p pid=".2605W.5/1">As currently drafted, it is believed that the impact of the Services Directive on the regulation of private security providers who are based in other EU member states will be minimal. This is because the provisions of the Directive on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (currently being considered by the European Parliament) which deal with the fitness to practice in a regulated profession are exempt from the country of origin principle found in the Services Directive.

The information given on the number of offenders does not identify level of risk or supervision received and consequently, the ratio of Offenders: Operational Staff should be indicative only and not used as a definitive measure of workload.</p>

	<p pid=".2606W.5/1">The National Probation Service has in place a recruitment strategy with staff recruitment targets for the service as a whole for the financial year 2006&ndash;07 and beyond. These are established by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) finance directorate and relate to the forward business plans of NOMS and the National Probation Directorate (NPD). For 2006&ndash;07 they are as follows: This national strategy will impact on the individual local recruitment strategies of the London Probation Area and the areas in the South East of England through the allocation of resources for staffing as part of the annual budget setting process. This budget setting process has yet to impact upon the areas, but for planning purposes each area is working with their own local planning assumptions and targets. It is, however, difficult at this early stage in the budgeting process to be precise about the detail of local recruitment strategies, and some areas are awaiting further funding information before finalising their plans.</p>

The Department of Work and Pensions has completed its work of the employers' compulsory liability insurance; the Office of Fair Trading has published a second review into liability insurance; and the Department of Constitutional Affairs has set up a ministerial steering group with a civil service action group to address the so-called &quot;compensation culture&quot;, following the work of the better regulation task force.</p>

This is a 12-month programme of work funded through the ChangeUp programme. The objectives are to enhance and disseminate good practice and to contribute to wider debates on risk and insurance. Detailed recommendations are expected in early 2006 following research and consultation with stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid=".2610W.11/1">In recent years the Government have strengthened the criminal penalties for offences such as incitement to racial hatred and for racially or religiously aggravated assault and criminal damage. As part of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 the Government created new racially-aggravated offences which make available to the courts higher maximum penalties where there is evidence of racial hostility surrounding the offence. The offences include assaults, criminal damage and harassment.</p>
	<p pid=".2610W.11/2">In July 2003 the Crown Prosecution Service set out in a Policy Statement a commitment to prosecute racist and religious crime fairly, firmly and robustly.

	<p pid=".2624W.2/119">The statistics of court proceedings are based on returns made by the police to the Home Office's Data Collection Group. Although these include offences where there has been no police involvement such as those prosecutions instigated by Government Departments (in this case the DVLA) and private organisations and individuals, the reporting of these types of offences is known to be incomplete. Moreover, it is thought that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings, in particular those relating to motoring offences and to TV licence evasion, may also be less than complete; the extent of under-reporting may vary from year to year and this could be responsible in part for the annual variations.</p>

	<p pid=".2628W.0/13">In the case of Opportunities for Volunteering, Volunteering England act as national agent for the Department for Health, allocating funding to local projects subject to suitable business cases being made.</p>

	<p pid=".2628W.0/17" class="italic">(c) Futurebuilders</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/18" class="italic"> Funding</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/19">The Futurebuilders initiative began in 2003. Latest figures (<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-30">30 April 2005</phrase>) show that to date investments have been made totalling 24 million. The Home Office is Futurebuilders sole funder.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/20" class="italic">Targets and progress</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/21">Futurebuilders has a target to invest in up to 250 schemes, with a minimum of 225, operating in or across the five public service delivery areas of health and social care, crime, community cohesion, education and learning and support for children and young people. Latest figures (<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-30">30 April 2005</phrase>) show that 51 organisations have been funded.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/22" class="italic">(d) ChangeUp</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/23" class="italic">Funding</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/24">The ChangeUp programme began in 2003 and 10 million was spent on the programme between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05. The Home Office is ChangeUp's sole funder.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/25" class="italic">Targets and progress</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/26">ChangeUp investment is focused on achieving the high level outcomes of the ChangeUp framework:</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/27" class="indent">a highly skilled workforce, performance improvement, more effective use of ICT, strengthened governance, improved volunteer support and more diverse and effective income generation within the voluntary and community sector (VCS)</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/28" class="indent">support for frontline organisations which is available nationwide, structured for maximum efficiency, offering excellent provision which is accessible to all while reflecting and promoting diversity, and is sustainable funded</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/29">Partnerships of VCS organisations have been successfully developed at local, regional and national level to implement ChangeUp and investment is beginning to be made at all these levels in line with achieving the objectives. It is too early for a full evaluation of this activity.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/30" class="italic">(e) The Active Community Unit</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/31" class="italic">Funding</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/32">Between 2000&ndash;01 and 2004&ndash;05 &pound;336 million has been spent by the Home Office Active Community Unit. It is important to note that this figure includes funding to Volunteering England, the Institute of Volunteering Research, Futurebuilders, ChangeUp, Community Service Volunteers, the Experience Corps and the Youth Action Network. It should also be noted that the Active Community Unit is now part of the wider Home Office Active Communities Directorate, which also includes the Charities Unit and the Volunteering and Charitable Giving Unit.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/33" class="italic">Targets and progress: SR2002 PSA8</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/34">The Active Communities Directorate is responsible for the Government's Public Service Agreement target, agreed as part of Spending Review 2002, to increase voluntary and community sector activity, including increasing community participation, by 5 per cent. by 2006. Achievement of this PSA target is dependent on the measurement of two activities: (i) community participation and (ii) voluntary and community sector activity.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/35">&quot;Community participation&quot; is measured by the Home Office Citizenship Survey and is defined as involvement in civic participation, informal or formal volunteering at least once a month in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/36">The 5 per cent. PSA target would require an increase of 0.9 million people on the 2001 baseline figure of 18.8 million by 2006. The Home Office Citizenship Survey 2003 shows that between 2001 and 2003, the percentage of people in England who had participated at least once a month in one or more of the three core activities increased from 48 per cent. to 51 per cent. In numerical terms, this represents an increase of more than 1.5 million, well in excess of the 0.9 million target for 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/37">&quot;Voluntary and community sector activity&quot;, specifically the contribution of the voluntary and community sector to the delivery of public services, is measured by the State of the Sector Panel Survey. The Panel consists of more than 5000 members that together reflect the diversity of the voluntary and community sector in England.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/38">Baseline information was collected for financial year 2002&ndash;03 and progress towards the PSA target will be measured between this year and 2005/06 by the Voluntary and Community Sector Activity Index. The survey for the baseline year has been completed and revised data will be available in April 2005. The survey for 2003&ndash;04 is currently in the field and data will be available in late autumn 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/39" class="italic">Targets and progress: SR2004 PSA6</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/40">The Active Communities Directorate is also responsible for the Government's Public Service Agreement target, agreed as part of Spending Review 2004, to increase voluntary and community engagement, especially amongst those at risk of social exclusion. The target has two elements: (i) increasing voluntary activity by individuals at risk of social exclusion and (ii) increasing the capacity and contribution of the voluntary and community sector to deliver more public services.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/41">&quot;Voluntary activity by individuals at risk of social exclusion&quot; is measured by the Home Office Citizenship Survey and is defined as involvement in informal or formal volunteering at least once a month in the last 12 months by people with no qualifications, people from black and minority ethnic communities and people with disabilities or limiting long-term illnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/42">'The capacity and contribution of the voluntary and community sector to deliver more public services' is measured in the same way that &quot;voluntary and community sector activity&quot; is for SR2002 PSA8.</p>

	<p pid=".2628W.0/69">The Experience Corps was established as a company limited by guarantee, funded by but separate from the Home Office in 2001. The Home Office provided approximately &pound;20 million (&pound;5.5 million/&pound;7.2 million/&pound;7.2 million) between 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/70" class="italic">Targets and progress</p>
	<p pid=".2628W.0/71">The organisations key target was to recruit 250,000 new volunteers in the three years of their funding. As at December 2003 the organisation stated that they had recruited over 153,000 volunteers, an evaluation in March 2003 revealed concerns surrounding the Experience Corps volunteer recruitment figures, specifically how many of these volunteers became actively engaged in volunteering activities.</p>

	<p pid=".2633W.2/2">The Experience Corps (TEC) was established in 2001 and received approximately &pound;20 million from the Home Office between 2001&ndash;02 and 2003&ndash;04 as part of a &pound;300 million injection of funding into the voluntary sector under the Government's Active Community Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".2633W.2/3">TEC's key target was to recruit 250,000 new volunteers over the age of 50. As at December 2003 TEC reported that it had recruited over 153,000 volunteers although an evaluation earlier that year raised concerns about the organisation's recruitment figures.</p>
	<p pid=".2633W.2/4">TEC currently has over 493,000 opportunities and 230,000 members, including 60,000 from ethnic minority communities. Its team of dedicated &quot;animators&quot; covers every region of England and has formed relationships with over 1,000 organisations across the country.</p>

The Prison Service has set &quot;good practice&quot; and &quot;typical&quot; benchmarks for establishments with and without laundries. Based on these, water targets are set for each prison. 40 establishments currently exceed the &quot;typical&quot; benchmark and therefore offer opportunities for significant water savings. Performance is monitored and governors are required to report any increase in consumption greater than 2.5 per cent. on a 12 month moving average and establishments are asked for a report stating the reasons for the increase and what they have done to rectify the situation. Individual targets have been set for laboratories based on Watermark benchmarking data and they are required to monitor and report usage on an annual basis.</p>

	<p pid=".2640W.0/1">In 2003, the Department set up the lung cancer and mesothelioma advisory group (LCMAG) to work closely with the voluntary sector and patient and professional groups in order to support the development and delivery of high quality services for lung cancer patients.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/2">In 2004, a mesothelioma sub-group was set up to advise LCMAG specifically on the requirements for a good clinical service for mesothelioma, and on priorities for research. The work of this sub-group is still progressing.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/3">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has not produced guidance on the most effective treatments for mesothelioma, but is appraising the use of pemetrexed disodium for the treatment of mesothelioma. The appraisal is expected to be issued in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/4">It is possible for all national health service doctors to currently prescribe pemetrexed disodium for patients if the primary care trust (PCT) or NHS trust agrees to supply it at NHS expense and the doctor retains clinical responsibility for the patient while prescribing pemetrexed disodium. It has been made clear that trusts should not refuse to fund a drug on the grounds that guidance is not available when the product is licensed. In those circumstances, they are expected to make their own assessment of available evidence before deciding how and if to fund the drug locally.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/5">The national cancer research network, established and funded by the Department, is currently providing NHS infrastructure support for five mesothelioma studies. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/6" class="indent">A trial of chemotherapy for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/7" class="indent">A population based case-control study of mesothelioma and lung cancer in relation to occupation in British men and women under the age of 60.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/8" class="indent">A pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of performing a randomised trial comparing extra-pleural pneumonectomy (EPP) against no EPP surgery within the context of trimodality therapy (chemotherapy, surgery, post-operative radiotherapy).</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/9" class="indent">A prospective randomised controlled trial of video-assisted thoracoscopic cytoreductive pleurectomy compared to talc pleurodesis in patients with suspected or proven malignant mesothelioma.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/10" class="indent">A palliative care centred study examining whether nebulised furosemide improves severe breathlessness in patients with lung cancer, including mesothelioma.</p>
	<p pid=".2640W.0/11">Over 75 per cent. of the Department's total expenditure on health research is devolved to and managed by NHS organisations. Details of individual projects, including a number concerned with the treatment and care of people with mesothelioma, can be found on the national research register at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/research">www.dh.gov.uk/research</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".2642W.0/1">All ambulance staff in the country are now covered by the new &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; pay system. &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; replaces existing Whitley Council arrangements for ambulance staff and is open to ambulance staff on local contracts who wish to transfer to the new terms and conditions. All national health service organisations are working to implement the new system by September 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".2642W.0/2">Under the new system, pay is determined through application of the NHS job evaluation scheme, which is a structured method of comparing job weight in order to allocate jobs within the pay structure.

	<p pid=".2642W.0/3">In order to assist the NHS with the job evaluation process, a number of common NHS jobs have been evaluated nationally and a process agreed by which local jobs can be matched to them where appropriate. These include a number of ambulance service jobs.</p>

	<p pid=".2651W.5/1">In April 2003, the national health service security management service (NHS SMS) was created and assumed policy and operational responsibility for the management of security in the national health service, including work to tackle violence against NHS staff. In November 2003 the NHS SMS introduced a comprehensive range of measures to tackle incidences of violence against NHS staff, both proactively and reactively. These included:</p>
	<p pid=".2651W.5/2" class="indent">New concise, consistent legally-based definitions for staff to report physical and non-physical assaults.</p>
	<p pid=".2651W.5/3" class="indent">A new, streamlined national reporting system for reporting and recording of physical assaults, which has the capacity to track cases from report to conclusion, allowing for intervention where necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".2651W.5/4" class="indent">A requirement for health bodies to nominate a security management director, a member of the executive board, to bear overall responsibility for security management work with particular responsibilities on tackling violence; representation for security management work at the executive board level is to ensure that responsibilities are taken seriously at the highest level.</p>
	<p pid=".2651W.5/5" class="indent">The creation of the NHS SMS legal protection unit to provide health bodies with cost effective advice on a wide range of sanctions that can be pursued, and to work with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to increase the rate of prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid=".2651W.5/6" class="indent">From April 2004, the largest-ever training programme in the United Kingdom for frontline NHS staff and professionals, designed to equip staff with the necessary skills to be able to identify and de-escalate potentially violent situations from occurring in the first place; from returns made by health bodies for the last financial year, 2004&ndash;05, it is estimated that around 85,000 frontline staff have received training in the new national syllabus.</p>
	<p pid=".2651W.5/7" class="indent">Training for the new role of local security management specialist (LSMS) began in June 2004, with the first set accredited in October 2004. LSMSs will have specialist professional skills and expertise to investigate incidents of assaults in support of the police and the CPS to ensure that sanctions are applied against alleged offenders, where appropriate. The NHS SMS plans to have a trained and accredited LSMS in place in each health body by summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".2657W.0/1">The Health Protection Agency's (HPA) radiation protection division has a statutory responsibility to advise on health risks from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). The HPA comprehensively reviewed the relevant science in 2004 and recommended not only the adoption of new guidelines on EMF exposure but also that the Government &quot;consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot; in relation to power frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields. The HPA provided a considered response to the recent publication by Dr Draper, placing it in the context of the current knowledge of such issues. It noted that the majority of raised magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines. The HPA's response is available on its web site at</p>
	<p pid=".2657W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/pressreleases/2005/050603childhoodcancervoltage.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press releases/2005/050603 childhood cancer voltage.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".2657W.0/3">The Draper study, which was funded directly by the Department, is also being considered by the stakeholder advisor/group ELF electromagnetic fields (SAGE), which was set up in response to the HPA advice published in 2004. SAGE has been constituted in order to make practical recommendations for precautionary measures in respect of EMF exposure&mdash;available at <a href="http://www.rkpartnership.co.uk/sage">www.rkpartnership.co.uk/sage</a>. Information about SAGE's membership can be found on the web site. It includes charities, clinicians, the electricity industry, market regulators, specialists and public concern groups as well as officials from Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".2657W.0/4">In addition to funding its own research programme, the Department and the Health and Safety Executive support the World Health Organization's (WHO) electromagnetic fields project. The HPA undertakes EMF research and is a WHO collaborating institution. The WHO is due to review the health risks from power frequency fields later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".2658W.8/3">The Anaerobe Reference Laboratory has provided a typing service to hospitals in England for over 10 years.

The mandatory surveillance programme for clostridium difficile, in place since 2004, has been typing clostridium difficile to provide information on the prevalence of clostridium difficile types.</p>

	<p pid=".2659W.5/2">Data on cases of clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea by hospital from 2000 is not available. However, data by trust is being collected under the mandatory surveillance scheme and the first year's data will be published in August.</p>
	<p pid=".2659W.5/3">In the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), deaths involving enterocolitis due to C. difficile can all be identified from the code A04.7. Enterocolitis is the commonest illness caused by C. difficile infection. For causes other than enterocolitis that are also known to be associated with C. difficile, it is not possible to identify from ICD codes alone the number of deaths where C. difficile actually contributed to the death. For this reason, the only routinely available mortality statistics on C. difficile are those where it was associated with enterocolitis. The Office for National Statistics is working with the Health Protection Agency on a special study to identify the total number of deaths where C. difficile was mentioned on the death certificate. Until this study has been completed, the number of deaths in particular hospitals will not be available centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".2664W.0/1">The provisions of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 will lead to the major changes needed to achieve the most radical reform of dentistry since 1948. This will result in a more locally focussed service for individuals. Among the major changes which will improve access is a new contract for dentists, which will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".2664W.0/2">The new contract, which is based on personal dental service (PDS) pilots, will encourage a more preventive and health promotion focus. There is also a programme to recruit the equivalent of 1,000 dentists by the end of October 2005, leading to some two million individuals being able to access treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".2664W.0/3">Morecambe Bay Primary Care Trust (PCT), which includes the Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency, has been working towards converting as many practices locally to PDS. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>, there were 61 dental practices in the PCT area of which 21, or 34 per cent., had open PDS contracts. Similarly, as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>, the PCT was providing personal dental services to 44,675 patients. The figure for <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-31">31 May 2004</phrase> was 4,226.</p>
	<p pid=".2664W.0/4">The PCT has received over &pound;316,000 in dental access funding, which has been used to support local practices to improve their premises and to expand. It is anticipated that this initiative will result in an additional 6,000 dental places.</p>
	<p pid=".2664W.0/5">In addition to the PCTs efforts to increase the PDS contracts locally, it has been active in the Department's international recruitment campaign. As a result, three dentists have recently been recruited from Poland and have joined practices in the South Lakes and Barrow areas of the PCT. A dentist has also been recruited from Portugal to work in the local area. The principal dentist in Barrow has also agreed to the Barrow practice accepting patients from across the whole Morecambe Bay area. These extra recruits are expected to provide a further 5,000 dental places over the next 12 months. The PCT is also targeting dentists who live in the area but who are not known to be working in more local dental practices.</p>
	<p pid=".2664W.0/6">Morecambe Bay PCT is also supporting a range of training opportunities as part of a longer-term approach to increasing numbers of clinicians working locally. This includes placements for dental students and dental therapists. During the past year, 50 final year dental students from the Liverpool dental school spent four weeks working in Morecambe Bay. Additionally, eight dental therapists have started a two-and-a-half-year course at Lancaster and a further eight are due to start in September 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".2665W.2/2">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, national health service orthodontic care, in general dental practice, will be provided under either general dental services contracts or personal dental services agreements. Commissioning these services locally will lead to resources targeted on those who will benefit most; improved quality of outcomes and reduced treatment times; reduced waiting times for assessment and treatment and greater efficiency in the consultant-led orthodontic services.</p>

	<p pid=".2665W.8/1">The guidance, issued in October 2004, from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on patient recall states that patients should have dental examinations at clinically appropriate periods normally between three and 24 months.</p>
	<p pid=".2665W.8/2">Under the current general dental service (CDS) dentists are paid an item of service fee for each treatment. These are set out in the Statement of Dental Remuneration, copies of which are available in the Library. Dentists should already be recalling their patients at clinically appropriate intervals. There has never been an expectation under the GDS that patients should be re-called for examinations at six-monthly periods, although a dentist will not normally be allowed to claim for more than one examination undertaken within any six-month period. Following the NICE guidance, dentists are now able to claim for more frequent examinations for those few patients where it is clinically necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".2666W.5/1">The most radical reform of national health service dentistry since 1948 is under way with Government and the NHS working hard to develop a modernised, high quality primary dental service. This reform programme is specifically designed to retain dentists within the NHS, by the development of a new contract for dentists to be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, based on personal dental services (PDS) pilots that encourage a more preventative and oral health promotion focus. This and the other dental reforms have been supported by an unprecedented level of Government investment, which is set to increase by over 19 per cent. over two years&mdash;2005&ndash;06 over 2003&ndash;04&mdash;resulting in an extra spend of over &pound;250 million a year in primary care dentistry. Specific funding initiatives have included:</p>
	<p pid=".2666W.5/2" class="indent">&pound;50 million distributed to primary care trusts (PCTs) in 2004&ndash;05 for practice improvements to enhance access, quality and choice for patients.</p>
	<p pid=".2666W.5/3" class="indent">&pound;9 million to support the work of the NHS dentistry support team with the hardest pressed PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".2666W.5/4" class="indent">&pound;30 million to ensure that dentistry information technology is integrated with the NHS-wide systems being developed through the national programme for IT.</p>
	<p pid=".2666W.5/5" class="indent">&pound;80 million capital investment over four years to support the increase of 25 per cent. in dental school undergraduate places from October 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".2666W.5/6">The number of primary care dentists has increased from 16,700 in 1997 to 20,192 at the end of May 2005. They are working from some 9,000 practice addresses. Included in the 20,192 total are over 6,000 dentists who are now providing PDS in over 2,200 practice addresses. There are 210 practices, in 26 sites, which are field-testing a variety of approaches to improve the quality of patient care and dentists' working lives. Overall, dentists provided 32 million courses of NHS treatment, including 2.8 million in the PDS, in 2004&ndash;05, compared with 24.6 million in 1996&ndash;97.</p>

	<p pid=".2668W.5/34">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/35">1. Registration rates (i.e. the percentage of the population registered with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist according to the postcode of the dental surgery (not the patient's address). So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/36">2. The registration rates use population estimates for the primary care trust (PCT) areas for the nearest year for which data are available. Figures for 1997&ndash;2000 have been calculated from 2001 population data. Figures for 2004 and 2005 have been calculated from 2003 population data as this is the most up to date available.</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/37">3. The number of registrations are based on a snapshot of the registration database taken at the end of March each year (September for 1995 and 1996) and subsequent retrospective notifications of changes to registrations have not been included.</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/38">4. Some double counting may occur in the totals when a patient has been newly registered with a dentist in PCT A, but not yet de-registered from a dentist in PCT B.</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/39">5. The changes in the registration period from two years to 15 months under the General Dental Services from <phrase class="date" code="1996-09-01">1 September 1996</phrase> affected the registration number from December 1997 onwards, so the 1997 figures are not comparable with later figures.</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/40">6. Most PDS schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of fifteen months, so the figures for PDS scheme; are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under GDS.</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/41">7. Some PDS schemes do not have any registrations, e.g. dental access centres and their patients will not therefore be included in these figures.</p>
	<p pid=".2668W.5/42">8. There are a small number of unallocated registrations.</p>

	<p pid=".2669W.5/2">The main element of primary care dentistry is currently the demand led general dental service (GDS), where expenditure is not predetermined by specific local allocations or budgets. Expenditure on the GDS in West Kent in 2005&ndash;06 will be dependent upon the activity levels of individual national health service dentists and the numbers and types of treatment required by NHS patients. Under the Government's dental reform programme, full local commissioning of dental services by primary care trusts (PCTs) and a new dental contract to replace the present item-of-service payment system will commence in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".2669W.5/3">Funding levels for community and hospital dental services are already determined at local level, to be met from PCTs' individual unified budget allocations, but details of such budget plans are not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".2669W.5/4">As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, there were 43 NHS dentists in Sevenoaks parliamentary constituency. This information was provided by the Dental Practice Board and relates to dentists whose practice address postcode is within the constituency boundary.</p>
	<p pid=".2669W.5/5">In 2004&ndash;05, the Department allocated &pound;1.53 million to the Kent and Medway Strategic Health Authority (SHA) to improve access, choice and quality in NHS dentistry. Out of this sum, South West Kent PCT received &pound;128,147. I am advised by Kent and Medway SHA that South West Kent PCT has developed a dental action plan, setting out actions to improve access to dentistry locally and that two personal dental service practices went live in April 2005. I am also advised that the PCT has secured the potential for 5,750 additional registrations through the dental action plan to date.</p>

	<p pid=".2674W.0/1">Very few dentists work on a purely private basis. Most provide a mixture of national health service and private services. Under the proposed banded system of dental charges, patients are entitled to a range of dental treatments within any charge band.

	<p pid=".2675W.0/1">The proposed changes to national health service dentistry, as announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>, would create a new system for the residents of Portsmouth, as for the rest of the country, which would reduce the maximum cost of NHS dental treatment by more than half while maintaining the existing exemptions for children under 18, new mothers and those on income related benefits. These exemptions cover 25 per cent, of all adult treatments provided by the NHS. They would move from 400 individual charges to three price bands, thereby creating a simpler pricing structure and ensure that patients know how much they are being charged and what treatment they will receive for their money on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".2675W.0/2">In Portsmouth, primary care trusts (PCTs) are already working to make the best use of our initiatives such as the personal dental services (PDS) initiative. For example, within Portsmouth city teaching PCT, four practices have moved over to a PDS contract since December 2004. These four practices have secured access to NHS dentistry for 30,645 patients, which is an increase of 6,557 patients.</p>

	<p pid=".2683W.14/1">The Department is fully committed to the equality and diversity agenda and has policies and processes in place to ensure that there is no unfair discrimination on any grounds. The equality and human rights group, formerly the equality strategy group, was established in 2002 to develop policy and support and promote equality and diversity within the Department and the national health service. It had a central programme budget of &pound;1.3 million in 2002&ndash;03, &pound;1.1 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;1.12 million in 2004&ndash;05. A major focus of the group's work is to support action that builds equality and diversity into the design and delivery of all health and social care programmes and into the capacity of the health and social care workforce to provide individually appropriate services. The promotion of equality and diversity has therefore become an integral component within many wider policy initiatives, such that it is not possible to disaggregate spending.</p>

This has resulted in the submission of over 500 dossiers and the trade manufacturers associations have confirmed that the list of substances for which derogation has been given include the majority of substances used by the supplements industry.

	<p pid=".2687W.5/1">The European Commission Food Supplements Directive contains lists of vitamins and minerals permitted for use in food supplements. For those not listed in the annexes of the Directive, dossiers of safety information need to be submitted for assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). If EFSA is unable to issue a positive opinion on the safety of the substance in question, then these will not be permitted in food supplements. EFSA has until 2009 to complete its assessment of dossiers.</p>
	<p pid=".2687W.5/2">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has received over 500 dossiers and the industry has confirmed that this includes the majority of substances used in food supplements.

	<p pid=".2687W.5/3">The directive includes provisions for setting maximum permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in due course.

	<p pid=".2687W.5/4">The FSA has provided &pound;20,000 to the food supplements industry to pay an independent consultant employed by the industry to collate the information necessary for submitting dossiers. This funding was matched by the industry.</p>

	<p pid=".2689W.2/1">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 establishes a bespoke insolvency and dissolution regime for national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs), which is based on insolvency rules for companies but with specific modifications applied to safeguard staff and assets required to deliver essential NHS services.</p>
	<p pid=".2689W.2/2">The Act gives Monitor, the statutory name of which is the Independent Regulator of NHS foundation trusts, powers of intervention if a NHSFT is significantly breaching, or has significantly breached its terms of authorisation or any enactment. In most cases, intervention should avert the failure of an NHSFT for financial reasons. However if an NHSFT does fail financially and Monitor considers that the essential NHS services of the NHSFT are at risk, then it may recommend that the NHSFT is dissolved.</p>
	<p pid=".2689W.2/3">The Secretary of State is able to dissolve a NHSFT in certain specified circumstances, based on a judgement by Monitor that further exercise of its statutory powers will not secure the provision of the essential NHS services that the body is required to provide under its terms of authorisation. Under such circumstances, the Secretary of State would have the power to transfer the assets, rights and liabilities of the NHSFT to another health service body, which may include another NHSFT, or to herself. It is our intention to lay secondary legislation detailing the failure regime later this year. Section 27 of the Act also sets out the circumstances under which an NHSFT might merge with another.</p>

Instead, member states will have one year to submit to the European Commission a list of health claims, accompanied by references to relevant scientific justification. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) will contact organisations and other interested parties about the process of drawing up a list of such claims. On receipt of the national lists, the Commission will consult the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before drawing up a Community list of permitted claims. This is to be subject to a vote in the Commission's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>

The user of such a claim will be required to submit a range of information, as outlined in the proposed Regulation, which will be assessed by EFSA. The proposed Regulation also requires EFSA to produce detailed guidance to assist applicants. This is expected to cover the type and quantity of information applicants will be required to produce. EFSA will have six months to review this information and to provide an opinion on the acceptability of the claim. The proposed Regulation provides for the EFSA opinion to be published and for comments to be made to the Commission by the applicant within 30 days.</p>

	<p pid=".2697W.7/1">The Government encourages the increased consumption and awareness of the importance of eating more fruit and vegetables through a number of initiatives and programmes. These include the five-a-day programme, which combines a range of community, advertising and media initiatives, and the school fruit and vegetable scheme, which provides nearly two million children aged four to six with a free piece of fruit or vegetable every school day. In November 2005, we expect to start phase one of the healthy start scheme, which will also encourage fruit and vegetable consumption among pre-school age children.</p>

It is for the applicant to establish suitable methodologies for control of their product and to present these in the application dossier.</p>
	<p pid=".2700W.6/3">In the case of products to be registered under the Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products, we anticipate that many will be multi-component and that ensuring reproducibility of the products will be challenging.</p>

	<p pid=".2702W.3/1">Candidates seeking appointment as members of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) are expected to be able to demonstrate that they will be able to discharge their duties in accordance with the seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. Additionally, they will be expected to have expertise in an area that the HFEA needs in order to fully discharge its duties. The particular expertise sought at any given time will depend largely on that provided by existing members and that lost by outgoing members. It may be, for example, expertise in financial management, or assisted reproduction law, or patient involvement or embryology, depending on the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".2702W.3/2">The chair of the HFEA consults the Department on the expertise needed in new members. References are sought for all candidates to be interviewed for appointment. Ministers also seek the views of their colleagues in the devolved administrations before making an appointment.</p>
	<p pid=".2702W.3/3">Paragraph 5(2) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 states that a person shall not be appointed as a member of the HFEA for more than three years at a time. In accordance with the code of practice of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, members are permitted to serve a second three year term if their performance has been satisfactory and their area of expertise is still needed on the HFEA board. Members may serve on the board for a maximum of ten years, but to be appointed for a third term they must enter an open competition for appointment on the same basis as new candidates. A list of current members and their duration of appointment is shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".2704W.3/17">1. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, a patient is to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels his/her operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday, then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.</p>
	<p pid=".2704W.3/18">2. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.</p>
	<p pid=".2704W.3/19">3. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.</p>

	<p pid=".2718W.2/1">Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment (TUPE) or TUPE-like (under Cabinet Office guidelines) principles were applied to those situations in which discreet undertakings are transferring to other organisations. This is in line with best practice on the application of TUPE. Approximately 30 NHSU staff are transferring to other organisations with transferring NHSU programmes. It is planned that the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement will be the residual body for the NHSU and that around 100 NHSU staff will therefore transfer to the institute to finalise the closure of NHSU or while they continue to seek alternative employment opportunities pending the end of their redundancy notice period. Staff in this group have been served notice of redundancy, and if alternative employment is not obtained, will be made redundant on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".2718W.2/2">In order to promote innovation and best practice in the delivery of services, the institute will have regard to the training and development of national health service staff, as set out in the establishment order. This activity will include pooling knowledge about how staff learn best and applying this to the learning gaps identified by the institute's priority programmes. The institute will employ a director to lead this work and will help local organisations build capacity in this area. The provision of learning opportunities for NHS staff, to which the Government remain committed, is the responsibility of other organisations both within and outside the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".2718W.2/3">The unions were represented on the advisory board, which oversaw the development of the policy and plans for the institute, and were closely involved in the process of deciding where TUPE should apply. It was not considered necessary to consult the unions directly on the wording of the statutory functions. The establishment order which includes the statutory functions was approved by Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".2719W.2/1">The key themes and principles of the national service framework (NSF) for older people remain extant. It was always envisaged that such a significant and far-reaching programme of action would take 10 years to realise fully.</p>
	<p pid=".2719W.2/2">The action milestone dates set out in the NSF have now been passed. In addition, new policy initiatives pertinent to the development of older people's service have been and are being developed. Further, since &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, local health and social care organisations now have greater flexibility in commissioning and providing services. In recognition of these changes since the launch of the NSF in 2001, Ian Philp, national director responsible for older people's services at the Department, will, in the autumn, present a &quot;Next steps&quot; document, suggesting how the significant momentum that has been generated since the launch of the NSF can be maintained.</p>

The &quot;Note for Guidance on Non-clinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/286/95)&quot; provides guidance as to what safety tests are required before a medicinal product enters the different stages of a clinical trial program. These safety tests in animals are needed to establish the safety and toxicological profile of a medicinal product before it is used in man. As a result of these tests, a large number of potential medicinal products never make it to use in man because their toxicological profile is unacceptable. These tests serve an essential role in the development of medicines. Therefore, we will not make it our policy to end the requirement for safety testing in animals.</p>

	<p pid=".2723W.2/1">The strategy document, &quot;Developing NHS Direct&quot;, predicted that NHS Direct could be in the position to handle 16 million calls by December 2006. This was based on the assumption that NHS Direct might handle 100 per cent. of general practitioner out-of-hours calls by that stage. Primary care trusts now have the choice as to whether they commission NHS Direct to handle GP out-of-hours services or use local providers. On this basis, it is currently forecast that NHS Direct will be handling fewer calls in 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".2724W.0/3">A customer reference group was set up in November 2004. This group consisted of procurement leads from the trusts listed in the response.</p>
	<p pid=".2724W.0/4">The customer reference group allows the commercial directorate to give updates on the process, and allows procurement leads to ask questions. The nature of the debate is by necessity very general. However, members were solicited for their views on the current service and these findings have helped to inform the market testing process.</p>
	<p pid=".2724W.0/5">It was decided that a smaller group had to be established which could be party to more commercially sensitive information. This group, the supply chain and procurement panel (SCPP), first met in April 2005. Membership was drawn from major supply confederations and the new collaborative procurement hubs. All of these organisations are also part of the customer reference group.</p>
	<p pid=".2724W.0/6">Both groups continue to meet, but the level of engagement is much deeper with the SCPP.</p>

	<p pid=".2746W.3/1">No one in need of immediately necessary care will ever be refused treatment. However, under the provisions of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended, overseas visitors may be required to pay for any national health service hospital treatment provided, if they are not covered by any of the exemptions from charges also set out in the regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".2746W.3/2">NHS trusts are required to establish whether a patient is a chargeable overseas visitor and if so to make and recover a charge for any NHS hospital treatment provided. Where treatment is not urgent, trusts are encouraged to obtain a deposit equal to the estimated cost of treatment before treatment begins. Immediately necessary treatment must be provided without delay, with charging issues resolved later.</p>

It is the responsibility of the strategic health authorities (SHAs) to deliver both overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure each and every body achieves financial balance. However, there is a degree of flexibility in how this is managed at a local level.

	<p pid=".2751W.2/1">Thanks to the work of the prostate cancer advisory group (PCAG) we now have, for the first time, a definitive set of key messages for the general public about the prostate, including prostate cancer.

	<p pid=".2751W.2/2">A pilot communications programme using the key messages has been developed by the public awareness working group of PCAG and is expected to start in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".2751W.2/3">For health professionals, in April 2000, we published referral guidelines for suspected cancer, to help general practitioners identify those patients who are most likely to have cancer and who therefore require urgent assessment by a specialist. The guidelines included a section on prostate cancer. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) reviewed this guidance and published an update version in June 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".2751W.2/4">The prostate cancer risk management programme has produced a booklet, &quot;The PSA test and prostate cancer: Information for primary care&quot;. This booklet provides GPs with an easy reference source on prostate cancer, from risk factors to treatment. The booklet was produced after consultation with GPs, primary care cancer leads and an expert advisory group.</p>
	<p pid=".2751W.2/5">In September 2002, NICE published guidance on urological cancers, including prostate cancer. This guidance covers all aspects of cancer care for urological cancer patients and is aimed at helping all of those involved in planning, commissioning, organising and providing cancer services to ensure high quality services.</p>
	<p pid=".2751W.2/6">We have also provided funding for the following organisations to increase public awareness of prostate cancer:</p>
	<p pid=".2751W.2/7" class="indent">In 2004, we provided &pound;30,000 to the Men's Health Forum to help fund its publication, the &quot;Men and Cancer&quot; manual.</p>

	<p pid=".2751W.2/9" class="indent">We are providing &pound;105,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to improve awareness of the risks and symptoms of prostate cancer in African and Afro-Caribbean men in Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".2751W.2/10" class="indent">We are working with the voluntary sector to develop a national prostate cancer website and have provided &pound;100,000 of funding. It is expected that the website will be launched in autumn 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".2755W.5/1">The United Kingdom Government have sufficient smallpox vaccine to mount a mass vaccination campaign of the whole population. The optimum number of vaccines needs to be sufficient to vaccinate all those in the population for whom vaccination is not contra-indicated and we have sufficient vaccine for this.</p>
	<p pid=".2755W.5/2">There are three different vaccines with shelf-life dependent upon the date of manufacture. Upon expiry of shelf-life, these vaccines are subject to a programme of testing and have been found to meet standards of potency and stability and remain suitable for use beyond their stated shelf-life. There are no plans to replace existing vaccine stocks subject to them meeting current standards of use.</p>

	<p pid=".2758W.6/1">The Department recognised the importance of developing better stroke services by including specific milestones, targets and actions in the national service framework (NSF) for older people, launched in March 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".2758W.6/2">The NSF for coronary heart disease (CHD), published in March 2000, sets the agenda for the modernisation of CHD services over a 10 year period. The NSF sets 12 standards for improved prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation and goals to secure fair access to high quality services.</p>
	<p pid=".2758W.6/3">Following the Government's decision to devolve most central funding to local primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities, the balance of power has further shifted by moving away from a central target-based focus, to allow PCTs to devise local strategies to meet the specific needs and demands in their own area. The Healthcare Commission produces an annual star ratings report of performance for national health service trusts in England to assess progress against existing targets and to promote improvement in the quality of health care. Its recently published 2004&ndash;05 report included an indicator on stroke.</p>
	<p pid=".2758W.6/4">With the considerable improvements that have been made in cardiac care, coupled with an ageing population, stroke is expected to form a greater contribution to the vascular disease burden in the future. In recognition of this, the Department has convened an expert advisory vascular programme board to oversee work on stroke and co-ordinate work across the common elements of vascular diseases&mdash;CHD, stroke, diabetes and renal.</p>

	<p pid=".2759W.11/1">Compensation for pain and suffering following unsuccessful operations is available where clinical negligence is proved to have occurred. However, the fact that an operation has been unsuccessful does not imply that the healthcare professionals concerned have failed in their duty of care towards the patient. Patients are advised pre-operatively of the possible consequences of operations and sign a consent form to say that they have been alerted to potential risks during and following surgery.</p>
	<p pid=".2759W.11/2">Claims for clinical negligence incurred by national health service bodies are managed by the NHS Litigation Authority, which is a special health authority set up by the Secretary of State for Health. The authority administers the current clinical negligence scheme for trusts, set up under Section 21 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. For a claim to be successful, the claimant must show that he/she is owed a duty of care, that the duty was breached and that the breach caused or contributed materially to the injury for which he/she is claiming compensation.</p>

The targets were subsequently incorporated into the &quot;Improving Working Lives&quot; standard, launched in October 2000, which all acute, mental health and ambulance trusts were required to put into practice by April 2003.

The SMS has begun a programme of work to identify the nature, scale and extent of violence against NHS staff.

	<p pid=".2763W.2/56">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".2763W.2/57">1. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
	<p pid=".2763W.2/58">2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".2763W.2/59">3. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.</p>
	<p pid=".2763W.2/60">4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data&mdash;(i.e. the data is un-grossed).</p>
	<p pid=".2763W.2/61">5. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>
