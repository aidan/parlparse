	<p pid=".879W.3/1">We consulted nationally on smoking in taxis in 1999&ndash;2000. In March 2001, we announced that while we recognised the merits of banning smoking in taxis, we did not consider that the case was sufficiently strong to make a commitment to legislate when parliamentary time permitted. This was because we were satisfied that the present voluntary approach whereby taxi or private hire vehicle drivers have the choice of asking passengers not to smoke for the most part worked satisfactorily.</p>

They did so because they were not satisfied that Connex had introduced agreed changes to their financial monitoring and reporting arrangements designed to ensure that the substantial public subsidy they had received was being properly used. The SRA will run the service under their 'operator of last resort' powers, but have emphasised that they will do so for only as long as is necessary to appoint a new private sector operator.

	<p pid=".881W.2/1">The &quot;Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom&mdash;South East&quot; consultation document (Table 7.3) does not give estimates for London alone. In the consultation document it is estimated that in 2030 the population living within the 57dBA Leq noise contour would be 332,000 if a third runway were constructed (which would include parts of Berkshire, London, South Bucks and Surrey), compared with 278,000 if no runway were built. The 332,000 figure includes people living in areas that would be affected by air traffic using the third runway who would experience increased noise levels compared with today, as well as people in other areas affected by traffic using the existing runways (also within the 57dBA Leq noise contour) who would experience reduced noise levels. For comparison, the figure for the resident population living in the same noise contour in 2000 given in the consultation document was 307,000. This had fallen to 258,300 by 2002.</p>

Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has received no representations on the operation of the new flexible working law which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-06">6 April</phrase> this year. We are committed to commence a review of the impact of the law in three years' time, and in collaboration with key stakeholders, we are currently putting in place a monitoring strategy for gathering ongoing evidence as to how the new law is working in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.2/2">We understand that the Acas Arbitration Scheme conciliators have been approached for advice on two occasions, the first of which led to the withdrawal of the claim by the employee and the second identified that no breach of procedure had taken place. One claim for unfair dismissal relating to the flexible working legislation was registered with the Employment Tribunal Service in May and this is currently in the initial stage of the process.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.2/3">Help and advice is available to employers as well as employees. Those who want to speak to an adviser about any aspect of the law, including practical advice on how to apply the law can call the Acas helpline on 08457 47 47 47. Advisers have been specifically trained on the working parents laws. Detailed guidance, including forms based on best practice, is also available on our website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/workingparents">www.dti.gov.uk/workingparents</a> and also in hard copy. This emphasises that it is in both parties' interests to seek to resolve disputes as far as possible within the workplace and that employment tribunals should be treated as a last resort.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.2/1">The Government would like to see a fair and sustainable solution to Iraq's debt problems. We believe the best way to achieve that is through a full assessment by the IMF and the World Bank of Iraq's needs, resources, and obligations, leading to a shared agreement on debt by the Paris Club of official creditors, and comparable treatment by other creditors. The UK is not expecting any payments from Iraq in the near future. The states recognized as occupying powers under unified command are aware of these claims on Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.5/2">A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of the Landfill Directive in England and Wales was published with the Second Consultation Paper on Implementation of Council Directive (199/31/EC) on the Landfill of Waste. This is available on the Defra website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a>). A base case was established and various policy mixes were costed against that base case. The additional costs of the policy mixes that reflect the levels of recycling, composting and recovery needed to meet the waste strategy targets amounted to a range of between &pound;3.4 billion and &pound;7.7 billion (net present value) over the 20 year period 2000&ndash;20.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.5/3">The RIA recognised that many of the potential benefits cannot be quantified but believes that a number will be of local significance where they result in a reduced impact of existing landfills. These benefits relate principally to reducing health and environmental risks and by promoting more sustainable options such as waste minimisation, re-use and recycling.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.5/4">The RIA also draws attention to benefits from investment in treatment technologies and rising landfill standards that could result in new economic and employment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.5/5">As was also recognised by the Strategy Unit Report &quot;Waste Not, Want Not&quot;, there are economic opportunities to be realised from improving the way that waste streams are managed. For example, less wasteful product design and manufacturing processes will translate directly into cost savings for business. New waste technologies and services can also provide new markets for UK businesses and generate significant revenue. If local authorities are to meet their recycling and landfill targets, for example, investment will be needed in alternative recycling/treatment facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".892W.5/2">All decisions within the WTO are already taken on the basis of consensus. That means that if any one of the WTO's 146 members opposes any proposed change it cannot be implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".892W.5/3">The UK played a major part in pushing for changes to the way WTO negotiations were conducted after the Seattle Ministerial Conference in 1999. The UK also supports greater external transparency for the organisation, and important steps to achieving this have been taken through the earlier release of documents.</p>
	<p pid=".892W.5/4">We recognise that developing countries may need assistance in order to be able to participate more effectively in the WTO-based system. The UK has therefore committed &pound;45 million for trade-related technical assistance and capacity building initiatives since 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".892W.5/5">The UK also recognises that not all WTO members can implement all WTO rules now. This is why we support an approach to the current round of trade negotiations which recognises that WTO members are at very different stages of development and have different capacities to implement WTO rules. To help countries to manage their commitments under the WTO, we are pressing for Special and Differential Treatment provisions within the WTO Agreements to be real and binding, and for any new WTO rules to reflect countries' implementation capacities.</p>

	<p pid=".894W.2/1">The International Adult Literacy Survey in 1996 suggested that in Great Britain <sup>1</sup> there are 3.8 million men (21 per cent.) and 4.1million women (22 per cent.) between the ages of 16 and 65 who performed at the lowest level in literacy and 3.2 million men (18 per cent.) and 5.2 million women (29 per cent.) who performed at the lowest level in numeracy.

The level thresholds are the range of marks needed to achieve a particular level in the National Curriculum tests.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.5/17">The test development processes used by QCA include trials of written questions that are improved and finalised before administration. The pre-testing establishes comparability across key stages and across years.

	<p pid=".896W.5/18">The confirmation of the final level thresholds takes the form of a meeting chaired by QCA and attended by representatives from the test development agencies, chief markers, QCA officers, researchers and statisticians, representatives from professional associations and independent academics and observers.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.5/19">The Government are satisfied that the quality control procedures in place for test development and level setting are thorough and rigorous. In July 1999, an Independent Scrutiny Panel, chaired by Jim Rose, considered QCA's arrangements for setting and maintaining the standards of the Key Stage Two English and mathematics tests. The Rose Review report validated the development procedures and confirmed that the test data from Key Stage Two was a reliable measure of pupil attainment.</p>

	<p pid=".897W.2/16">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is responsible for the development and administration of the National Curriculum tests on behalf of the Secretary of State. There is a process in place, the level setting exercise, to ensure standards are maintained year on year. The level thresholds are the range of marks needed to achieve a particular level in the National Curriculum tests.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.2/17">The test development processes used by QCA include trials of written questions that are improved and finalised before administration. The pre-testing establishes comparability across key stages and across years. The technical information collected by these stages is considered alongside other evidence in order to set levels that are consistent from year to year.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.2/18">The confirmation of the final level thresholds takes the form of a meeting chaired by QCA and attended by representatives from the test development agencies, chief markers, QCA officers, researchers and statisticians, representatives from professional associations and independent academics and observers.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.2/19">The Government are satisfied that the quality control procedures in place for test development and level setting are thorough and rigorous. In July 1999, an Independent Scrutiny Panel, chaired by Jim Rose, considered QCA's arrangements for setting and maintaining the standards of the Key Stage 2 English and mathematics tests. The Rose Review report validated the development procedures and confirmed that the test data from Key Stage 2 were a reliable measure of pupil attainment.</p>

The 2002 draft CHP Strategy anticipated that micro-CHP may provide 400MW towards achievement of the Government's target of 10,000 MW of installed Good Quality CHP by 2010, but the exact amount of installed capacity will depend on a wide range of variables.</p>

	<p pid=".902W.0/1">the nature and quantities of radioactive waste that may be discharged from any site are controlled by the Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. In November 1999, Ministers asked the Environment Agency to carry out a full-scale review of all radioactive discharges from the Sellafield site, and to report on technetium-99 in advance of the main review. The Agency's proposed decisions were published in August 2002 and are currently under consideration by the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and for Health. The Agency proposed no increases in discharge limits above the current limits and reductions to eight out of 10 of the aerial and half the liquid discharge limits.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/2">There are no statutory limits for technetium-99 in food. The Food Standards Agency estimates the radiation dose that a consumer would receive from consuming affected food and compares that estimate to the dose received from natural sources and the statutory dose limit of 1mSv/year from all man-made sources of radioactivity other than medical exposure. Assessments carried out by both the Environment Agency and the Food Standards Agency for the EA's review of Tc-99 indicated that, at the current discharge limit, the annual radiation dose from Tc-99 to the group of people most exposed to liquid discharges from the Sellafield site (i.e. local seafood consumers) is of the order of 0.02&ndash;0.03 mSv/year. Concerns would be raised if the technetium-99 present in food added significantly to the background dose or caused doses to approach the dose limit.</p>

	<p pid=".906W.0/1">The targets we have set under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) help us to understand the progress we are making towards the global target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The lead partners for the species and habitat action plans and the local partnerships reported on progress with their plans at the end of 2002 and the results have now been analysed. The emerging findings were reported to the first annual conference of the UK Biodiversity Partnership held in Perth on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-21">21 May 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/2">The analysis shows mixed progress. There are some very good signs of progress for some species and habitats including the otter, the dormouse, bittern, reedbeds and cereal field margins. Others, such as limestone pavements, and the natterjack toad are more disappointing, and one species of lichen appears to have disappeared from its last remaining site as a result of air pollution.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/3">Overall we believe that the targeted, partnership approach adopted by the UKBAP structure is working, albeit in some cases more slowly than we had hoped. Full details can be found on the UKBAP web site at <a href="http://ukbap.org.uk">http://ukbap.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/4">'Working with the Grain of Nature&mdash;A biodiversity strategy for England' published in October 2002 sets out the measures we are taking in England to implement the UKBAP. The strategy aims to ensure that the implications for biodiversity are considered as an integral part of other key policies, such as agriculture, water, forestry, urban and marine, and as part of people's everyday lives. A set of biodiversity indicators for the strategy will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/5">The strategy also recognises the importance of partnership working for biodiversity at the local and regional level. Since 1995 around 100 local biodiversity partnerships have been established throughout England and are helping to deliver national and local biodiversity targets and objectives. Local wildlife sites provide important wildlife refuges, link different habitats and help to maintain biodiversity as a whole. They are an important mechanism available to local biodiversity partnerships.</p>

	<p pid=".907W.8/1">The UK contributes to the EC budget as a whole and not to the CAP specifically. The costs of extending the CAP to the new member states have been limited by respect for the Berlin expenditure ceilings for enlargement-related expenditure for the period 2004 to 2006. The Copenhagen European Council agreed 40.85 billion euros (1999 prices) over 2004&ndash;06 for the 10 new member states, well within the enlargement-related ceiling set by the 1999 Berlin European Council for sixs potential members. Of this, a total of 9.8 billion euros was agreed for agriculture.</p>
	<p pid=".907W.8/2">For the period 2007&ndash;13, the Brussels European Council in October 2002 set ceilings for CAP market support and direct payments. The Commission estimate that for the new member states, direct payments and market support will cost 6.3 billion euros in 2013. However, such expenditure for the EU 25 has been limited in nominal terms to annual growth of 1 per cent. per year from 2006. This is an important constraint on market distorting subsidies. It means that, notwithstanding accession, the cost of CAP direct support should fall in real terms. Rural development ceilings have yet to be determined for the years 2007 onwards.</p>

EU Member States have recently reached political agreement on an environmental liability directive that will cover the deliberate release of GMOs and contained use of microbiological GMOs in respect of damage to European protected species and natural habitat types. In this context, the relevant biotechnology company may be held liable for damage caused by one of its products. We will consider how the directive is to be implemented in the UK when the details have been finalised.</p>

The system is controlled by the state veterinary service and enforced by local authorities. The aim of the Regulations is to minimise the burdens on the composting industry while safeguarding animal and public health. Like all facilities involved with managing waste, large scale composting plants also require a waste management licence from the Environment Agency. Building new plants would require planning permission. These requirements do not in themselves create barriers, but allow facilities to be judged against environmental standards and local development plans.</p>

This will operate at both a national level, raising the general public's awareness of waste issues and the benefits of recycling, and at a local level, to support both local authority recycling (linked to ROTATE) and issue specific programmes relating to waste minimisation initiatives as outlined.</p>
	<p pid=".913W.2/4">In addition, the Animal By-products Regulations 2003 come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July</phrase> and the current ban on composting kitchen waste will then be lifted and replaced by a registration/licensing system of facilities that wish to take part in this activity. We would expect the amount of waste that is composted or used in biogas production to increase once the ban on composting kitchen waste is lifted.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.0/2">There have been large and sustained reductions in discharges of the most radiologically significant radionuclides in the last 25 years, particularly those resulting from reprocessing nuclear fuel, such that current discharges from that sector are currently just 1 per cent. of their peak levels in the 1970s. The Government are committed to achieving further reductions in discharges by 2020 in order to implement the OSPAR Strategy with regard to Radioactive Substances, which was agreed by Ministers at Sintra in 1998. A UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges, 2001&ndash;20, was published in July 2002, which sets out how we shall achieve these further reductions and includes broad projections for future discharges from each sector of the nuclear industry. Key milestones are the cessation of Magnox fuel and uranium hexafluoride production at Springfields by 2006 and the end of Magnox fuel reprocessing at Sellafield by around 2012. The document is in the Library and is available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/radioactivity/discharge/strategy/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/radioactivity/discharge/strategy/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.0/3">Detailed information on radioactive discharges and environmental concentrations, by type of radionuclide and location, can be found in the annual publication, Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE), produced jointly by the Food Standards Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

	<p pid=".916W.5/1">Out of a total of 2,324,960 potential calendar working days for staff in Defra 21,854 were lost during 2002 due to staff sickness with mental health problems. These figures include the Veterinary Medicines Directorate and Pesticides Safety Directorate Agencies. Responsibility for sickness absence within the Central Science Laboratory Agency, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, the Rural Payments Agency and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science Agency has been delegated to the Agency Chief Executives and I have asked them to reply direct.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Professor Mike Roberts to Mr. Paul Marsden, dated May 2003</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has asked me to reply, with respect to the Central Science Laboratory, to your question concerning how many sick days were lost by CSL due to staff mental health problems in the last year.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/4" class="indent">In the calendar year 2002, CSL lost a total of 684 work days for reasons that could justifiably be classified as 'mental health'.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/5" class="indent">CSL has been successful in managing sickness absence through innovations such as recruiting a dedicated Occupational Health professional, running regular health awareness campaigns and carrying out all-staff health surveys. This has contributed to CSL achieving the Civil Service sickness absence target of 7.2 days per employee a year early.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/6" class="indent">CSL remains closely aware of it's legal duty to provide a safe working environment for all it's employees and is committed both to operating best practice in this area and to meeting the targets set out in the 'Revitalising Health &amp; Safety' initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".916W.5/10" class="indent">VLA is committed to the effective management of sickness absence and to meeting its Service Delivery Agreement for reducing sickness absence by the end of 2003. We are also committed to reducing the number of working days lost from work-related injury and ill health, in response to the government's Revitalising Health and Safety initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".916W.5/21" class="indent">I have been asked to respond directly to your three recent Parliamentary Questions concerning mental health issues.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/22" class="indent">I will address your first two questions together:</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/23" class="indent">Question: To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, how many of his staff have taken sick leave due to mental health problems in the last year.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/24" class="indent">Question: To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, how many sick days were lost over the last year by his Department through staff mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/25" class="indent">Information on the number of staff who have taken sick leave due to mental health reasons and how many days were lost over the last year through staff mental health problems is not available for the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/26" class="indent">RPA is a relatively new organisation formed in October 2001. As such we are still developing a computerised Personnel System to provide sickness absence data of the kind requested. Specific information on numbers of staff absent and days lost due to mental health problems over the last year could only be obtained at disproportionate administrative cost and time.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/27" class="indent">Turning to your third question:</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/28" class="indent">Question: To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, how many of his staff retired on medical grounds due to mental health problems in the last year.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/29" class="indent">Two members of staff from the RPA retired on medical grounds due to mental health problems in the last year.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/30" class="indent">RPA is committed to managing sickness absence effectively and to meeting internal performance targets for reducing sickness absence for 2003&ndash;04. We have developed a sickness absence management policy and procedures that includes a revised strategy for managing long term sickness absence, for implementation from May 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.5/31" class="indent">RPA also acts responsibly to the legal obligation to provide a safe working environment for employees and is committed to meeting targets for reducing the number of working days lost generally due to work related injuries and illness, arising from the Government's Revitalising Health and Safety initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.2/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> The UK has already taken steps to assess the impacts of mercury in a range of environmental compartments. We contributed to the production of WHO Air Quality Guidelines for Europe, and have adopted the same statutory limit for drinking water as the WHO drinking water guideline value. The WHO drinking water guideline is currently being revised and we will consider what, if any, reassessment would be required in light of changes made. An assessment of health impacts from mercury contaminated soils has been undertaken and two reports &quot;Collation of toxicological data and intake values for humans&mdash;Mercury&quot; and &quot;Soil Guideline Values for inorganic mercury contamination&quot; were published last year. Both are available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defraweb/environment/landliability/pubs.htm">www.defraweb/environment/landliability/pubs.htm</a>. Dietary exposure to mercury is mainly in the form of methylmercury in fish and is assessed against international guidelines for methylmercury. The Food Standards Agency issues advice to consumers to limit consumption of certain species offish, so that exposure is within these guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/3"><i>(b)</i> My Department issued a consultation on an assessment by the Environment Agency's Local Authority Unit on mercury emissions from crematoria on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-07">7 May</phrase> with comments requested by <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-07">7 August</phrase>. A copy is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defraweb/corporate/consult/crematoria/consultation.pdf">www.defraweb/corporate/consult/crematoria/consultation.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/4">Work is continuing in this area. A global assessment of mercury was published by the United Nations Environment Programme earlier this year and an action plan is being developed. In addition, the European Commission propose to develop a Strategy on Mercury in 2004 to protect human health and the environment from the release of mercury. This work is expected to reassess the health impacts of mercury and the UK will contribute to the development of this Strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".920W.8/16">The Environment Agency has and continues to undertake a number of studies into the environmental impact of OP (and synthetic pyrethroid) sheep dips. The Agency undertakes chemical and biological monitoring of rivers covering the main sheep rearing areas and reports the findings, including failures of Environmental Quality Standards, on its website, <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk">www.environment-agency.gov.uk</a>. A study into the impact of sheep dip disposal on terrestrial invertebrate life and possible knock-on effects to insect-feeding birds has been completed recently and will be published shortly. In addition, there is on-going research into the environmental fate of disposed sheep dip and its potential impacts on surface and ground waters.</p>

	<p pid=".923W.5/2">Following a 1998 European study (the first EUROHAZCON study&mdash;Dolk, H <i>et al</i>; www.lshtm.ac/eeu/research.hmtl) that reported a higher rate of non-chromosomal anomalies among people living near hazardous waste sites, the Government commissioned a programme of work on health effects of landfill sites including a much more extensive national study by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (Elliott, P <i>et al</i>; <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/p396.htm">www.imperial.ac.uk/p396.htm</a>). This was published in the summer of 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".923W.5/3">The SAHSU study looked at the rates of all birth defects (chromosomal and non-chromosomal) and found only a slightly higher rate (1 per cent.) in populations living near landfill sites and a 7 per cent. higher rate near hazardous waste sites. The Government's expert advisory committee, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, noted that this excess risk was small and could be accounted for by factors other than the landfill sites. The study has not shown, or, indeed, could show, a causal link between landfill sites and birth defects.</p>
	<p pid=".923W.5/4">However, the Government recognised that, in the light of the findings of these various studies, more research was needed on the health impacts of landfill sites. As a result, Defra, the Environment Agency and the Department of Health have a considerable amount of research either planned or already under way. Among the projects planned is one related specifically to emissions from hazardous waste sites.</p>
	<p pid=".923W.5/5">Also, the Government have commissioned a review of the environmental and health effects of all waste disposal, and management options. They aim to report on the findings of this review later in the year. The review will provide a rational side-by-side comparison of the impacts of different waste management options, which will inform Government policy, and assist local authorities and other relevant bodies in making waste management decisions.</p>

In 2000, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) found that, without NDYP, the level of long-term youth unemployment would have been twice as high as it actually was. Independent evaluation evidence also confirms the overwhelmingly positive impact of NDLP in helping lone parents into work and suggests that the programme more than doubles the employment chances of participants.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking for a break down of council tax as a percentage of gross income in England in 2001&ndash;02 by <i>(a)</i> female-headed households and <i>(b)</i> male-headed households consistent with estimates given in my previous answer of 10th June for households in Great Britain. (124370)</p>
	<p pid=".928W.8/4" class="indent">Estimates for council taxes and income are based on the analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&ndash;02&quot; produced by the Office for National Statistics and published on the National Statistics website on April 11th 2003, and in Economic Trends in the May 2003 edition. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons library. This includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. Sample sizes are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given by quintiles of income distribution and not by decile.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.8/5" class="indent">The Household Reference Person is identified during the interview and is defined as the member of the household who:</p>
	<p pid=".928W.8/6" class="indent">a. owns the household accommodation, or</p>
	<p pid=".928W.8/7" class="indent">b. is legally responsible for the rent of the accommodation, or</p>

Some 25 per cent. of this represents additional cash expenditure incurred by the Department because of inflation. The remaining 75 per cent. represents 'non-cash' cost of capital charges incurred by the Defence Procurement Agency as a result of the delayed transfer of asset balances to the RAF.

	<p pid=".934W.5/1">The United Kingdom has given an undertaking, as a signatory to a 4-nation memorandum of understanding, to acquire 232 Typhoon aircraft out of a total production of 620. Our commitment to the programme remains unchanged, although&mdash;in common with all other elements of the defence programme&mdash;Typhoon is kept under constant review. The delivery of aircraft to the Royal Air Force has now begun and will continue through to the middle of the next decade. The aircraft was designed, to be multi-role; this has not changed. When it becomes available for operational deployment in the second half of this decade, it will be configured primarily to conduct air defence missions but will also have a limited ground attack capability. Typhoon's ground attack capability will be augmented through an incremental enhancement programme.</p>

	<p pid=".940W.2/1">Since 2000 the Royal Navy has continued to perform the role recognised in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review by contributing to the security of the United Kingdom, her overseas territories and citizens world-wide; by helping to maintain international peace and security and supporting the Government's foreign policy aims and UK overseas trade; and by assisting the UK in discharging her international responsibilities as a leading member of the UN, the Commonwealth, NATO, and EU.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.2/2">This requires a powerful and well-balanced maritime force, capable of rapid deployment and sustained joint and/or combined operations of an expeditionary nature wherever the UK's national and international interests demand. Since the SDR, the emphasis is moving from large-scale open-ocean warfare to expeditionary power projection operations in conjunction with the other two services, with a premium placed on versatility and deployability.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.2/3">Significant progress is being made in the Royal Navy to achieve the aims of the SDR. This includes the ongoing programme to replace the Invincible class aircraft carriers with two larger, more capable vessels. In addition, support to amphibious forces has been strengthened by the delivery of six RoRo vessels, and by the introduction into service over the next three years of the two landing platforms dock (replacement) ships, and four landing ships dock (auxiliary)&mdash;the latter offering greatly improved capability and lift capacity. The type 45 destroyers will begin to replace the capability currently provided by the type 42 class from late 2007 onwards and, with the principal anti-air missile system (PAAMS), will provide an enhanced specialist anti-air warfare capability. The first three new astute class nuclear powered submarines are on order and will succeed the Swiftsure and Trafalgar classes to provide a greatly enhanced capability to the Royal Navy.</p>

	<p pid=".944W.5/2">The UKSI is the name given to a network of centres and a central team of experts that helps the country's top sportsmen and women to win medals in major tournaments like the Olympics and the World Athletics Championships. It provides much needed world class facilities and a higher standard of co-ordinated support services to high performance athletes than the UK has ever had before.</p>
	<p pid=".944W.5/3">The Institute is made up of four Home Country Sports Institutes in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, along with a central services team, which is part of UK Sport, based in London. The funding provided to the Home Country Institutes is a matter for the Devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid=".944W.5/4">Funding by DCMS to support the UKSI is found from both the exchequer and the lottery. UK Sport expends exchequer funding, while Sport England use their Lottery funds. The level of expenditure is for these organisations to determine. Details of their expenditure on the UKSI is shown in the following table:</p>

In progressing this objective the Department supported Diversity 21 as a means of examining cultural diversity with a view to promoting deeper understanding and to represent this diversity as a sign of strength in our society. Diversity 21 provided the means of promoting cultural diversity work already happening; identifying and delivery of new projects aimed at stimulating the imagination and exploring diversity in an open, creative and accessible way; and providing a cultural diversity grant funding scheme. Since April 2001 the Department has supported a schedule of exhibitions on language, faith and history in Northern Ireland and the wider Commonwealth, to a number of organisations and community groups throughout the Province; a programme of workshops on the different drums of Northern Ireland; and Intercom 21&mdash;a contemporary music project which used music as a means of exploring diversity.

	<p pid=".948W.2/1">Because of the considerable number of contracts let annually by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the information for each year dating back to 1997 could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, all contractors have money withheld, pending the making good of defects. In any given year, this amounts to an average of &pound;1.2 million.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.2/2">The Housing Executive is currently withholding some &pound;1.3 million, pending the satisfactory completion of 221 contracts. The gross value of these contracts is around &pound;89 million. The Housing Executive is also currently involved in six legal disputes, to a gross value of some &pound;480,000, with contractors who have disputed, among other things, that their work is substandard.</p>

	<p pid=".950W.8/1">I understand from the Chief Executive of the South Eastern Education and Library Board that meetings have taken place between the school, the Board, Ards borough council officials and local representatives about the sports/recreation area at Movilla High School.</p>
	<p pid=".950W.8/2">Steps have been taken in the past to improve the fencing of the site in order to deter vandalism, but these have proved ineffective. The Board has, therefore, commissioned a study to examine the feasibility of moving the fencing back from the existing perimeter and, in partnership with the council, to provide some facilities for public use around the perimeter of the area. These proposals will be considered as part of the Board's minor works programme for the next financial year.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.2/4">Underlying these targets are a number of measures specific to the Crown Prosecution Service, which demonstrate the contribution of the service to the criminal justice system as a whole and govern the performance of its 42 areas. The targets for 2003&ndash;06 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/5" class="italic">Narrowing the justice gap</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/6" class="indent">To reduce by 5 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04 the proportion of unsuccessful outcomes in defendant cases in both the magistrates courts and the Crown court. Further targets are to be agreed for 2004&ndash;06;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/7" class="indent">To increase the number of recorded offences brought to justice for which the offender was a persistent offender at the point of charge;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/8" class="indent">To reduce by 27 per cent. the proportion of ineffective trials in the magistrates courts and in the Crown court; and</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/9" class="indent">To introduce an agreed shadow charging scheme in partnership with the police in all areas between March 2003 and December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/10" class="italic">Improving Public Confidence</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/11" class="indent">To ensure, year on year, that at least 95 per cent. of initial and continuing review decisions comply with the Code for Crown Prosecutors;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/12" class="indent">To increase by five percentage points current CPS compliance with its primary and secondary disclosure responsibilities;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/13" class="indent">To maintain year on year the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders at or below seventy one days; and</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/14" class="indent">To increase year on year the number of areas that have regular engagement with groups that support victims of domestic violence and with minority ethnic communities.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/15" class="italic">Value for money</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/16" class="indent">Specific measures in support of this target are under development.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/17" class="italic">Other measures</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/18">In addition, the service has a number of targets which are not directly related to the Public Service Agreement, as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/19" class="indent">The Crown Prosecution Service is committed, along with its criminal justice partners, to delivery of agreed timeliness targets from charge or laying of information to completion for a range of cases in both the magistrates courts and the Crown court;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/20" class="indent">Subject to the successful rollout of the Compass case tracking system, all Crown Prosecution Service areas to input data providing the capacity to report on the progress and outcome of cases involving allegations of domestic violence, racially and religiously motivated offences, homophobic crime, rape and child abuse;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/21" class="indent">To reply to 95 per cent. of complaints within 10 days of receipt and to 95 per cent. of inquiries from Members of Parliament within 15 days; and</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/22" class="indent">Additional measures are under development related to the timeliness and quality of direct communication with victims.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/23">Targets are determined by the Crown Prosecution Service Board, which comprises the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief Executive, Chief Crown Prosecutors representing the 42 areas, Headquarters Directors and non-executive Directors.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/24">Performance is reported on a quarterly basis to the newly created Business Development Directorate, which has responsibility for monitoring progress towards targets both at local and national level, and for raising with the 42 areas both matters of concern and aspects of good practice which emerge from the resulting record of delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/25" class="italic">Serious Fraud Office</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/26">The Serious Fraud Office does not have any agencies or non-departmental bodies. Current performance targets are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/27" class="indent">a caseload of 110 active cases (including appeals) within allocated resources;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/28" class="indent">a long-run average investigation time of 16.5 months;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/29" class="indent">a long-run average prosecution stage length of 14.5 months.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/30">Performance targets are agreed by Ministers and officials, and subject to monitoring by the Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Ministers and officials.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/31" class="italic">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/32">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate has clear objectives set out in its Strategic and Business Plan 2003&ndash;06 which is available on their website at <a href="http://www.hmcpsi.gov.uk">www.hmcpsi.gov.uk</a>. The objectives of HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate support the Government's overarching objectives for the criminal justice system and the linked Public Service targets.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/33">However, no separate performance targets have been developed for HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/34">The Plan is approved by the Attorney-General and progress is monitored by the Attorney-General's Advisory Board.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/35" class="italic">Treasury Solicitor's Department</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/36">The Treasury Solicitor's Department is required to meet the following performance targets:</p>

	<p pid=".960W.2/44" class="indent">(f) to achieve a level of ill-health retirements by 2005 consistent with or better than the best quartile target of 3.72 retirements per 1,000 employees;</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/45" class="indent">(g) to pay all undisputed invoices in accordance with terms or within 30 days.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/46">Targets (a) to (d) were agreed between the Department, the Attorney-General and HM Treasury as part of the Department's Spending Review 2002 settlement. Targets (e) to (g) were set centrally by Ministers for all Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/47">Achievement against all targets is monitored by the Department's Board and the Attorney-General; and reported to Parliament and the Public in the Law Officer's spring Departmental Report and the Treasury Solicitor's Department's Annual Report.</p>

The loss of entitlement to attendance allowance in these circumstances follows the normal social security benefit rules to prevent duplicate provision from public funds for the same purpose (following the same principle, receipt of free nursing care, irrespective of the setting in which it is provided, does not affect the payment of attendance allowance). Information is not routinely collected about the precise period covered by the loss of entitlement to payments in individual cases, or about the weekly amount paid before that loss of entitlement, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".983W.2/1">The FCO first received allegations against BAE Systems in January 2000. These, and earlier allegations to other Government Departments, were passed to the MOD Police and Metropolitan Police. The latter confirmed that they found insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations. In 1999, routine examinations by the South African Auditor General resulted in allegations of irregularities in the procurement process. Subsequent investigations by South Africa's Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and by a specially-convened Joint Investigating Team drawn from three expert bodies, concluded that the primary contracts&mdash;including those involving BAE Systems&mdash;were sound. The investigations did conclude that there were irregularities inherent in some of the subcontracting procedures, but not those involving BAE Systems.</p>

UK Commanders in Iraq have been instructed to secure possible chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear hazards, with the aim of making their areas of operations safe for military forces and civilians, and to provide support, as appropriate, to efforts to investigate sites which may be related to programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction. Details of deployments of other coalition personnel are a matter for their respective Governments.</p>

	<p pid=".994W.6/1">Local housing authorities have a responsibility to produce a housing strategy which sets out plans to address the range of housing needs in their area. This includes all groups with special needs where the strategy must link into the provision of associated support services.

	<p pid=".994W.6/2">The Housing Corporation through the Approved Development Programme (ADP) provides specially adapted housing and support for the disabled. The Housing Corporation through its National Investment Strategy sets out the priorities against which registered social landlords should bid for resources for the ADP.

Funding for the ADP has risen to &pound;1.5 billion in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;500 million more than in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".994W.6/3">Local housing authorities have a statutory duty to offer Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs) to all eligible applicants who require adaptations to help them live independently in their own homes. The grant is available to disabled homeowners and tenants in both the private and social rented sector, and is subject to a means test. The Government meet 60 per cent. of the total local authority expenditure incurred on DFGs through the payment of specified capital grant. The budget for this grant for English authorities in 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;99 million compared with &pound;56 million in 1997&ndash;98, an increase of more than 75 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".994W.6/4">In addition, the Supporting People programme provides a strategic framework for commissioning and funding the support services that people need to help them to live independently in their accommodation. Local authorities (county councils in the case of two tier administrations) will be developing Supporting People strategies setting out how they will meet the needs of people in their areas for housing-related support over the next five years. These will consider the needs of all client groups, including people with physical and sensory disabilities, and learning disabilities.</p>

The requirement to provide treatment and care on the basis of clinical need, and not age alone, applies equally to the treatment of breast cancer. Since the publication of the NSF in March 2001, significant progress has been made in starting to tackle age discrimination and there is a now a wider appreciation and awareness across health and social care of age discrimination as an issue.</p>

Since then, primary care trusts and councils, in consultation with a range of local interests, have been implementing the guidance. All localities reviewed their progress during the summer of 2002 and reported to their strategic health authorities. Where appropriate, information from these reports was shared with the Social Services Inspectorate (further progress reports for 2003 are being finalised).</p>

Final implementation is planned for April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1013W.2/1">The NHS Plan committed us to opening over 100 new hospital schemes in total between 2000 and 2010. Currently, there are 114 hospital schemes counting towards the 100 target, of which 104 will be built under the Private Finance Initiative. Of the 104, 32 are now operational, of which 31 are general and one community. A further 17 are under construction, of which 13 are general and four community. Within the 104, there are another five planned community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.2/2">The NHS Plan also set out plans for the modernisation of primary healthcare. 42 national health service local investment finance trust sites are being developed, which will bring in over &pound;1 billion of investment. Much of this investment will provide community hospital services, for example, day case surgery, diagnostic services, oncology and physiotherapy.</p>

	<p pid=".1013W.5/1">We have not received any specific representations on the consumption of salt by children.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.5/2">In 2001, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) agreed to consider the issue of salt and health, at the request of the Food Standards Agency and the Chief Medical Officer for Wales. In response to SACN's call for submissions, the Co-op, Safeway, British Retail Consortium (BRC), the Food and Drink Federation (PDF) and the Salt Manufacturers Association (SMA) acknowledged that there was a need to assess salt in childhood and/or provide guidance. Submissions are on the SACN website (sacn.gov.uk).</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.5/3">The draft SACN report on salt and health underwent a period of consultation at the end of 2002. Responses are posted on the SACN website. All responses to the consultation were fully considered by the SACN salt sub-group. The minority of organisations who queried the basis of the salt targets for children did so on the extent of the evidence available and the methods used by the sub-group to establish salt targets for children. The sub-group's deliberations are minuted on the SACN website.</p>
