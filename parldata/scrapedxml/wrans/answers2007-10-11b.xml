	<p pid="b.692W.9/1">The Gloucestershire tri-service centre will continue to house staff from all three emergency services and support tri-service working after the fire and rescue service control is moved to the South West regional control centre.. The Government are committed to creating a new national network of nine resilient regional control centres which will enhance the ability of the Fire and Rescue Service to respond to major incidents and natural disasters in a co-ordinated, efficient and effective manner, which will better protect the public. The new regional control centres will however build on the valuable lessons learnt on joint working from the tri-service pilots, including the recent experience of dealing with flooding in Gloucestershire.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.2/1">During the last five years, the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) in Pirbright was inspected by DEFRA in November 2003, August 2004, September 2005 and December 2006. Inspections were carried out by senior DEFRA veterinarians with specialist knowledge of laboratory containment, exotic animal diseases and the requirements for licensing laboratories under the Specified Animal Pathogens Order (SAPO) 1998. The inspections were designed to provide an overview of general biosecurity, and to focus on new or refurbished areas, particular areas where changes are proposed or areas where particular biosecurity issues had been identified. Where any particular biosecurity issues were identified, the laboratory was required to submit action plans addressing the issues identified and, once they were agreed, implement them. These action plans addressed minor issues including management and personnel, site security, ventilation, waste handling, storage of pathogens and documentation. The progress of these plans was closely monitored. No major biosecurity issues were identified during the inspections.</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.2/2">At IAH Compton, DEFRA works with other enforcement authorities and liaison with these authorities ensures that DEFRA is aware of any significant issues. We are aware that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has undertaken two inspections at IAH Compton this year, one of which resulted in an improvement notice for the ventilation system. Reports from inspections at Compton, undertaken by DEFRA during the last five years, are not held centrally. I have asked officials to gather the information and I will write to the hon. Member when it is available. I will also arrange for a copy of the letter to be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.2/3">DEFRA was not notified of any issues in relation to flooding at either site which resulted in the deliberate or accidental release of hazardous waste. A HSE-led investigation into potential breaches of biosecurity at Pirbright following the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Surrey, included an assessment of the potential role of flooding in the release of the live virus. This report is available from the DEFRA website and the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.707W.9/1">In 2005 the food additives tested were flavourings, colorants and plant extracts. In 2006 they included dietary supplements, stabilisers, sweeteners, colorants and flavouring agents. All of the work in both years was conducted to fulfil regulatory requirements. Changes from year to year depend on the requirements of industry and the regulators concerned with the safety of the products. All the &quot;other foodstuff&quot; testing in 2005 and 2006 was conducted to fulfil regulatory safety requirements mainly for marine biotoxins testing. Part of the increase in procedures in 2006 involved validation of a non-animal alternative for pre-screening for marine biotoxins testing as a result of which it is likely that live animal use for these purposes will begin to fall in 2007.</p>

Officials from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform played an active role in the response by the Telecoms industry to the flooding during the summer. I followed the situation closely and met representatives of the telecommunications industry and some of the businesses affected by the floods. One of the key objectives of the telecoms industry response was to maintain the 999 service and the availability of the service to the public was not seriously affected by the conditions. The situation did lead to increased demand on the service and the emergency services were pressed in handling this increased number of calls.</p>

	<p pid="b.709W.0/1">The number of profiles relating to individuals added to the database each month for all police forces since its foundation in 1995 is shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.709W.0/2">A certain number of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). At present the replication rate is 13.7 per cent., i.e. the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.7 per cent. fewer than the number of profiles. However, as the replication rate has varied over time, an exact figure for the number of people who have been added to the database in each month since 1995 cannot be given.</p>
	<p pid="b.709W.0/3">The National DNA Database records the DNA profile for a particular individual. It does not hold data on arrest and criminal records. This information is held on the Police National Computer. To produce figures for the category of offence in relation to which the DNA sample was taken would require cross-searching of PNC and the NDNAD, which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.709W.0/4">For the same reason, it is not possible to give precise figures for the stage in the criminal justice system at which someone had a DNA sample taken. However, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, the police have the power to take DNA and fingerprints from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and detained in a police station, and retain them indefinitely; and taking a DNA sample is now a normal part of handling of arrested persons in the custody suite. So it is expected that in most cases the sample would have been taken when the person was being dealt with in the custody suite after arrest.</p>

	<p pid="b.712W.2/1">It is understood that this question refers to the number of samples taken from crime scenes added to the National DNA Database, since a separate question has been asked on the number of people added. The number of crime scene samples added each month for all police forces since the foundation of the Database in 1995 is shown in the attached table. Crime scene samples are not normally retained on the Database once the crime from which they were taken has been solved. Therefore the number of such samples currently on the database is less than the total number that have been loaded since 1995.</p>

	<p pid="b.716W.2/2">The purpose of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is to hold a record of a person's DNA which can be matched against DNA taken from crime scenes. The database can also match DNA taken from different crime scenes. The police do not have direct access to the records on the database, and receive reports on people on it only if their DNA matches DNA from a crime scene. This is true both for those convicted of a crime and those not convicted. Matches between two apparently different individuals may also occur. The usual reason is that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests).</p>
	<p pid="b.716W.2/3">There may be an innocent explanation for someone's presence at a crime scene, so a match report is simply a piece of intelligence leading to further inquiries. If a match between DNA from a crime scene and DNA from an individual is found, a report of the match is sent to the police forces which loaded the crime scene data and the individual data, to make further inquiries.</p>

	<p pid="b.721W.3/1">DFID and the FCO have raised concerns about the transparency of the review of mineral concessions with the relevant DRC authorities on numerous occasions. My colleague, Baroness Vadera, raised the mining review with the Vice-Minister of Mines during her recent visit to Kinshasa, and underlined the importance of transparency. We are not directly involved in the work of the DRC Government Commission which is undertaking the mining review, but fully recognise its importance for the future of the minerals sector. The review is vital for public confidence in DRC and investor confidence globally. While we believe that it is for the DRC Government to decide who should be involved in the review process, we will continue to use our channels with government, the private sector and civil society to push for the commission to carry out its work in the most transparent way possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.729W.13/3">A proposal from the European Commission for new, and stricter, exhaust emission standards for lorries and buses is expected towards the end of this year or in the early part of the next.

	<p pid="b.729W.13/4">While the retrofitting of particulate filters on cars is seldom feasible, because it is precluded by space constraints and can require reprogramming the engine management system, the retrofitting of particulate filters to heavy duty vehicles is sometimes possible. The Government encourage retrofitting existing lorries and buses with technologies designed to reduce particulate emissions through the Reduced Pollution Certificate schemes. These schemes offer operators of heavy duty vehicles a reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty for vehicles modified to meet stricter emission standards.</p>

In the intervening period over half (0.6 million) of these individuals have moved out of employment or have left the country, while 1.4 million foreign nationals are recorded as in employment having arrived in the UK. Accounting for these flows into and out of the UK, the total number of foreign nationals in employment in the year to the second quarter of 2007 is 1.9 million, a rise of 0.8 million since 1997.

The tribunal has an inquisitorial function and appellants we encouraged to attend and to present their case, which may include any written or oral evidence from those who may support their appeal such as medical practitioners. There is nothing in the tribunal rules that would exclude an appellant's general practitioner from attending such an appeal hearing.</p>

	<p pid="b.742W.15/1">The structure of the scheme, which provides an annual lump sum payment, is not appropriate for the needs of terminally ill people. Entitlement is based on a person's circumstances in a qualifying week which is the third full week in September. The process to establish entitlement then takes a further six weeks and payments are made in November and December. This ensures that older people are confident that they will be able to afford the heating that they use in the coldest part of the year. The extra heating needs of terminally ill people can arise at any time of year, not just in the winter months. Help is available for terminally ill people through the care and mobility components in disability living allowance and the disability premiums in the income- related benefits which have a substantially higher annual value and are spread over a 52 week period.</p>
	<p pid="b.742W.15/2">People who are terminally ill can receive the highest rate of the care component of disability living allowance without having to serve the three months qualifying period and the benefit is usually paid within 10 days from the time the claim is received. Most people who qualify for the highest rate disability living allowance care component under these special rules also qualify for the highest rate disability living allowance mobility component. Also, where a disability premium is paid in an income related benefit, a cold weather payment is payable in periods of very cold weather. Together, these payments are designed to meet the extra costs, including heating, of terminally ill people.</p>
	<p pid="b.742W.15/3">The annual cost of extending winter fuel payments to people aged under 60 receiving disability living allowance under the special rules related to a terminal illness is estimated at approximately &pound;6 million.</p>
