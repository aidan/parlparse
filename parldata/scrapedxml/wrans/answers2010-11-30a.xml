	<p pid="a.651W.5/1">Yes. Micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) is a recognised technology under Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP) and the Code for Sustainable Homes (the Code.). When micro-CHP schemes are fuelled by liquid petroleum gas, they contribute to performance towards attaining sustainability in a home. SAP 2009 includes generic emissions factors for different variants of liquid petroleum gas. Appendix N of SAP considers micro-CHP as an alternative to a conventional domestic boiler. Micro-CHP can contribute to meeting the Code standards, specifically under &quot;Ene 1: Dwelling Emission rate and Ene 7: Low and Zero Carbon Technologies&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.8/1">The aim of the New Homes Bonus is to provide a powerful, simple, transparent and permanent means of incentivising local authorities to increase their housing supply. The consultation stage impact assessment makes an estimate of the potential supply impact, based on a number of possible behavioural responses of local authorities. This can be viewed in the current consultation available on the Department for Communities and Local Government Website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.651W.8/3">Almost &#163;1 billion will be set aside for the New Homes Bonus over the spending review period, including nearly &#163;200 million in year one and we have made it clear that funding beyond these levels will come from formula grant which will match fund the additional council tax raised for new homes and properties brought back into use, for the following six years, with an additional amount for affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.8/4">Under the consultation proposals we are also incentivising local authorities to bring empty homes back into use, by removing them from the council tax base calculations. This also means the authorities demolishing homes classified as empty homes would not be penalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.8/5">The Government are giving communities and neighbourhoods new rights, powers and tools that they could use to drive forward local regeneration and growth, enhancing their ability to benefit from the New Homes Bonus. We are giving local communities and councils greater control over what happens locally, and greater ability to secure and channel public resources, and to attract private and social investment. In addition, the recently established Regional Growth Fund (&#163;1.4 billion over three years), the European Regional Development Fund, and the continuation of Regional Development Agencies and the Homes and Community Agency committed schemes will support local regeneration and growth.</p>

As part of the Government's commitment to supporting sustainable travel, and to simplify funding for local authorities, I have announced the creation of a Local Sustainable Transport Fund worth &#163;560 million. This will challenge local transport authorities outside London to develop packages of measures that support economic growth and reduce carbon, in their communities as well as, tackling congestion, delivering cleaner environments, improved safety and increased levels of physical activity. A proportion of the fund will be allocated to provide continued funding for Bikeability. For the remainder of the funding, we will invite local authorities to develop packages of low cost, high value measures which best meet their local needs and effectively address local issues. Measures could include encouraging walking and cycling, such as those demonstrated in the Cycling Towns and Cities and the &quot;Finding New Solutions&quot; projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.662W.2/1">The UK Government strongly support the inclusion of an ambitious but realistic long-term target in the proposed EU new van CO2 regulation. The UK's opening negotiating position was 135g/km in 2022, as our analysis shows that this represents the best approach to deliver significant but cost-effective CO2 savings from vans. However, the UK Government understand that all other member states are negotiating for a 2020 target. Negotiations on this target are ongoing, but it will necessarily be less ambitious than a 2022 target.</p>

	<p pid="a.662W.5/1">In 2008, the Department for Transport commissioned research to assess the scope of the transport sector to switch to electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The report concluded that, on a whole-life basis and based on the UK's existing national grid mix, electric vehicles have the potential to offer emissions reductions in the order of 40% and that these benefits would improve with decarbonisation of the UK power mix.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/2">The report also found that, among the organisations consulted, a consensus view of a trend toward the electrification of the automobile existed, although there remained an uncertainty as to timings, and proportions of technologies likely to be employed (which include electric, plug-in hybrid, hydrogen fuel cell and diesel electric hybrids). This view is consistent with the consensus industry view as set out in the New Automotive Innovation and Growth Team's 2009 'Independent Report on the Future of the Automotive Industry in the UK'.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/3">Notwithstanding the uncertainties around market development, the research commissioned by the Department suggested that, under a mid-range scenario, by 2020 as many as 800,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars could be on the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.5/4">From January 2011, a number of manufacturers will be bringing electric vehicles capable of motorway speeds and ranges of up to 100 miles to the mass market and we therefore expect sales of electric, and shortly thereafter, plug-in hybrid vehicles, to increase. The industry-consensus view suggests that the introduction of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to the general market could start to be seen from the latter part of this decade.</p>

We also proposed that the criteria would be applied to CHP as well as to co-firing or dedicated biomass power plants. The Government response to the consultation is due to be published shortly.</p>

Approximately 3,000 of these generators were registered for the Renewables Obligation.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.2/2">The figure of 5,000 generators is an estimate based on the number of installations that have received grants from the following programmes: Clear Skies, Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 1, Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 2 and the Major PV Demonstration Programme. This figure is probably an underestimate since it does not include generators that did not receive grants under these schemes.</p>

This will help inform a decision on whether we should grandfather them under the renewables obligation. Analysis of these data is under way and the work will feed into the ongoing banding review. The timing of decisions is now being considered and a timeline will be issued shortly. DECC officials intend to write to those concerned shortly to clarify the timing on decisions to be taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.694W.2/3">In particular, regular meetings with industry contacts are held to take forward product roadmaps, and the environmental milestones contained therein, which are owned by the UK's beef and sheep meat, dairy, and pigmeat sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.694W.2/5">Additionally, I have assured the House of the willingness of either the Secretary of State or myself to participate in a stakeholder-convened conference to examine the current state of sustainability in our livestock industry should a suitable event be organised in 2011.</p>

Keepers have responsibility for the health and welfare of their animals and abandoning pet pigs would be a breach of these responsibilities. Whilst the guidance will be helpful to those contemplating keeping pigs, or already with pigs as pets, it is very clearly the responsibility the pig keeper to ensure pigs are not abandoned and for those selling pigs as pets to ensure the new owner is aware of these responsibilities prior to purchase. There are many industry and other groups able to provide advice to those who find they are no longer able to care for a pig and it is important that keepers seek advice on options open to them. Local authorities and the RSPCA already have working practices to deal with stray animals.</p>

	<p pid="a.696W.8/1">One of the Government's priorities is to support and develop British farming and encourage sustainable food production. To achieve this they need to be seen to lead by example and encourage sustainable food procurement by central Government Departments and the wider public sector. In support of this the Government have made a commitment to source food, subject to no overall increase in costs, meeting British or equivalent standards of production.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.8/2">We know that some Departments are already buying a high proportion of food that meets British or equivalent standards of production and therefore it should be possible for others to do the same. DEFRA will be working to help all Departments achieve this goal through guidance and learning from best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.8/3">The Government are also developing criteria for Government Buying Standards for food, covering sustainability of food and catering operations as well as nutrition, which will be mandatory for central Government Departments and will be promoted to the wider public sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.702W.0/1">ECGD does not allocate a &quot;budget&quot; for defaults under its guarantees and insurance policies. However, ECGD does make forecasts of potential expenditure by way of claims payments to banks in respect of loans made by them to overseas borrowers to finance export contracts; claims arise under ECGD's guarantees to the lending banks where the borrower has defaulted on loan repayments. ECGD normally pays claims under defaulted guaranteed loans as amounts fall due to be repaid over the remaining life of the loan repayment period. For 2010-11, ECGD forecast &#163;22 million of claims to be paid on loan repayment defaults by borrowers. Of this, &#163;18.2 million is to cover first time defaults during 2010-11; none have materialised to date. The remainder relates to the payment of claims expected to be paid in 2010-11 in respect of loans already in default in previous financial years.</p>

ECGD provides guarantees for loans made available by banks to finance export transactions under its Buyer Credit Facility (BCF) and Supplier Credit Financing Facility (SCF).</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.3/2">Under the BCF, ECGD does not keep a list of pre-approved banks but approves them on a case-by-case basis. In each case they must meet ECGD's minimum counterparty risk standard and, in the case of agent banks, demonstrate the capability to administer ECGD-backed export credit loans. In the last three years, 29 banks have acted as a lender and/or agent bank under the BCF. Under the SCF, ECGD pre-approves banks and, subject to them meeting ECGD's minimum counterparty risk standard, issues them with a Master Guarantee Agreement (MGA). Currently, eight banks hold SCF MGAs.</p>

	<p pid="a.703W.6/1">No decisions have yet been made, but the funding for technology and innovation centres is about making choices and backing a few opportunities to scale. This means developing some of the existing RDA funded centres which are excellent and establishing a limited number of new centres in the context of the Technology Strategy Board's overall programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.703W.6/2">The Technology Strategy Board will publish a strategy and implementation plan for Technology and Innovation Centres by April 2011, and have created a network of these centres by April 2012 as highlighted in the BIS business plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.706W.8/1">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2006 already encourage the re-use and recycling of refrigerated display cabinets and other white electrical goods. The regulations place obligations on the producers and business end-users of a wide range of waste electrical equipment, including refrigerated display cabinets and white electrical goods. These include the financing of the separate collection, subsequent treatment, re-use, recovery, recycling and environmentally sound disposal of such equipment when it becomes waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.8/2">Currently 96% of civic amenity sites across the UK collect large household appliances and 98% collect cooling equipment containing refrigerants from householders. The Code of Practice for collection of WEEE from these designated collection facilities encourages Producer Compliance Schemes (PCSs) to work with re-use organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.8/3">The WEEE regulations include specific provisions to encourage, where appropriate, the reuse of whole alliances including a requirement for PCSs, as part of the approval process, to set out how they propose to prioritise the reuse of whole appliances in their operational plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.728W.11/1">Tackling bullying is a top priority for the Government and we are supportive of any initiative that helps reduce the suffering of children and young people at the hands of bullies. The Deputy Prime Minister met the organisers following the March and promised to consider carefully the campaigner's calls for a review of bullying guidance across Government. In addition, Ministers in the Department have agreed to meet the organisers to discuss the items raised during the campaign.</p>

To these costs should be added the costs of electronic publishing and indexing; the former cannot readily be separately identified; the latter are estimated to be in the region of &#163;65,000 annually.

Any change in the number of written questions tabled directly affects such costs. The remaining costs are broadly fixed and will not fluctuate according to the number of questions, although staffing levels and some staff-related costs, such as additional hours payments and late night transport costs, may alter if there is a significant change in the volume of questions.</p>

Band A does not attract a subsidy, in band B schools can claim 50% of costs, up to a maximum of &#163;650, and in band C 75% of costs, up to a maximum of &#163;1,250. The full details of the scheme, including a list of which band each constituency falls into, can be found on the Education Service website.</p>
	<p pid="a.732W.3/2">The following table provides the amount the House of Commons spent in individual constituencies where schools claimed under the transport subsidy scheme in the financial year 2009-10 (the first year of the scheme) and the current financial year up to July 2010. The cost listed is 70% of the overall subsidy paid as the cost of the scheme is shared with the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.732W.3/3">For the 2009-10 financial year data the constituency boundaries are before the 2010 changes. The financial year 2010-11 data incorporate the 2010 boundary changes.</p>

This would account for the entirety of DFID's budget not allocated to loans and promissory notes.</p>
	<p pid="a.735W.3/2">Detailed information on awards in relation to these grants is not available without incurring disproportionate cost. However, we can provide details on resource spend for 2009-10 of &#163;5,281 million and forecast resource spend for 2010-11 of &#163;5,817 million. Both these figures exclude loans and promissory notes and include administration costs, in accordance with OECD DAC guidelines. Forecast resource spend for 2011-12 is not yet available.</p>

These demonstrate that some progress has been made, such as aligning the UN closer to national frameworks and priorities. However, Delivering as One needs to go further to improve the effectiveness of the work of UN agencies in developing countries. The Multilateral Aid Review will assess how effective UN agencies are in working together, this will report in early 2011. An independent evaluation of Delivering as One is due for completion in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.5/1">Ministers have had no recent discussions. The British High Commission in Colombo is in close contact with the Government of Sri Lanka. Officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) recently visited the country to assess the situation and review the impact of our remaining humanitarian projects, which target internally displaced persons (IDPs).</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/2">The IDP situation in Sri Lanka has significantly improved with more than 270,000 displaced people released or returned to their homes and approximately 22,000 people remaining in camps. The UK's &#163;13.5 million emergency humanitarian programme, which began in 2008, has provided water and sanitation, healthcare, shelter, cash grants and livelihoods recovery for displaced and returning families. This funding will be completed at the end of the current financial year after which we will continue funding for demining, to help enable those persons still displaced to return home. DFID has not provided aid, other than humanitarian assistance, to Sri Lanka since 2006, when the country graduated to middle income status.</p>

Medical support to deployed operations is absolutely vital and there is no question of British forces deploying on military operations without the appropriate medical support.</p>
	<p pid="a.741W.6/2">Where a particular specialty is in short supply within the Defence Medical Services to support deployed operations, a flexible manning approach is used drawing upon regular personnel, reserves and allied forces and on occasions a limited number of civilian contractors are deployed to support operations and to backfill positions in the United Kingdom to allow uniformed personnel to deploy.</p>
	<p pid="a.741W.6/3">The total number of personnel required by the DMS is neither calculated nor held by rank; therefore shortfall is shown by specialty, with the trained strength (as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>) split into 'officer ranks' and 'other ranks'.</p>

	<p pid="a.745W.5/1">As set out in the strategic defence and security review White Paper I have initiated a review of force generation including tour lengths and harmony guidelines. The review will consider a wide range of factors including the impact on the morale and long-term sustainability of the armed forces and the implications of tour length on operational effectiveness, derived from continuity and sustainability. The Defence Reform Unit alongside the single Service Chiefs will ensure that we are being as efficient and effective as possible. I have asked that the review reports to me by July 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.749W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence has considered a range of options and concluded that the most cost effective is for the nine aircraft to be disposed of following recovery of equipment and systems that can be used elsewhere. Discussions are continuing with BAE Systems on the detail of the disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.749W.0/2">The MOD made estimates of cost savings accrued from measures considered in the Strategic Defence and Security Review for the purposes of formulating policy. Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. In the case of the Nimrod MRA4 we estimate that around &#163;2 billion will be saved over the next 10 years, by not bringing the aircraft into service. Release of further detail may prejudice the MOD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. The MOD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed savings or updated estimated in-service cost figures at this time.</p>

This funding provides standard secondary care services to service personnel; however, their primary care services and non-standard secondary care services are funded by the Ministry of Defence through Defence Medical Services.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.8/2">In October, the Government announced that health funding will grow by &#163;10.6 billion during this spending review for the years 2011-12 to 2014-15. All patients, including serving personnel, will benefit from the increased funding for health set out in the spending review and from the White Paper reforms. PCT allocations post 2010-11 will be announced in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.8/3">As part of its capital settlement, the Department will also contribute over the spending review period to the capital costs of two health initiatives led by the Ministry of Defence to support health care for the armed forces by providing a medical training establishment and new mental health facilities.</p>

Such information could assist adversaries in identifying vulnerabilities and circumventing security controls, thereby exposing the UK to greater risk from attacks. The Security Service estimates that at least 20 foreign intelligence services are operating to some degree against UK interests. The low cost, global reach and largely anonymous nature of cyberspace makes it an attractive domain for use by people, organisations or states seeking to use it for malicious purposes. Perpetrators can include terrorist organisations, organised criminal groups, as well as those engaged in state-led espionage and warfare.</p>

The National Offender Management service transferred under a MoG change to the Ministry of Justice's payroll in 2008, so are not included in the Home Office figures after that date. Two NDPBs have been created since April 2005: the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in April 2006, and the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) in March 2008. The Home Office currently has nine agencies and NDPBs. Information provided by these bodies has been included in this answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.2/2">The Government have no intention of reviewing the remit of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The processes and function of the ACMD are currently being reviewed by Sir David Omand in line with Cabinet Office guidelines. The purpose of the review is to consider whether the ACMD is discharging its function that it was set up to deliver within the existing legislation. Sir David Omand's review is expected to conclude early in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.2/3">The ACMD has provided successive governments with advice that has informed and shaped the UK's drug policy over the last four decades and continues to provide high quality, independent and expert advice that challenges Government in this complex area of public policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.2/4">The Home Office has been working closely with other Government Departments to develop and publish a new drug strategy in December 2010. During the six-week drug strategy consultation period a number of responses were received from UK embassies and commissions overseas, details of which will be included in a short consultation summary document for publication in December 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.2/5">No formal assessment has been made of EU or wider international drugs policy in connection with the drafting of the new strategy, due to the inherent differences between the UK and other countries in terms of criminal justice systems, legislation and patterns of drug use. However we have drawn on the experiences of our EU and international contacts to develop the most appropriate response to UK drugs issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.2/6">The Government also work closely with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) to supply information for the creation of the EMCDDA annual report on the state of the drugs problem in Europe. This report benchmarks European countries on a range of drug related indicators and is used to inform the ongoing development of UK drug policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.2/7">The Government have no intention of reviewing the drug classification system established by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The criminal justice system expects-and the Government must provide-a stable and enduring system. It continues to serve this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.2/8">The ACMD did not make any recommendations for changes to the drugs classification system and has published its response to the Drug Strategy Consultation (2010) on its website. It is available at:</p>

At a difficult time our aim has been to ensure that the maximum amount of funding is spent at the front line, rather than on bureaucracy. We had regular discussions with those arm's length bodies during the spending review and those discussions continue. We are confident that in cutting administration in order to limit cuts to the front line, arts organisations across the country, including those in the West Midlands, will continue to thrive.</p>

	<p pid="a.784W.0/1">The Government have set out a clear ambition that digital will increasingly be the primary channel for delivery of public information and transactional services. This is part of our overall plan to inject more choice, control and personalisation into public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.0/2">Our aim is for Government services to be digital by default, making online the preferred channel for Government services. This marks a decisive move away from a neutral 'multi-channel' approach to one where we actively encourage people to switch to digital channels and put compelling incentives in place to support this, with digital technology driving better services and lower costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.0/3">However, no one will be excluded from services because they cannot use or access the internet. Assisted digital support will be provided so that, although there is a strong expectation that those that are able to will use digital channels, those who cannot will always be able to access services.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.0/4">A first wave of services have been announced which will move towards digital as their primary channel with timetables established for each service as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.0/5" class="indent">On Student Finance for Higher Education in England, there will be an expectation from 2011 that initial applications by students are made online. Paper forms will no longer be printed or available to readily download from Directgov.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.0/6" class="indent">For jobseeker's allowance, Jobcentre Plus will introduce a strong expectation that new jobseekers allowance applicants should apply online-with the aim that 80% of claims will be made online by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.0/7" class="indent">For businesses, Companies House plan to mandate digital only filing of the vast majority of filing services including incorporation, accounts and annual returns by 2013, subject to a full impact assessment and the timely passage of the necessary secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.0/8" class="indent">HMRC are putting together a package of measures that will make it easier and quicker for businesses to deal with the tax authorities using online services as the norm. For example, from August 2012 the online channel will be the mandatory way to register for VAT, with other channels being closed or consolidated, and from 2013 it will become mandatory for business customers to tell us online when they start their business activity for the purposes of self-assessment and corporation tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.784W.3/3">We are publishing a Green Paper shortly which will ask civil society organisations and commissioners how the commissioning process can be improved in order to increase the role of charities, social enterprise, mutuals and co-operatives in public service delivery.

His review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-23">23 November</phrase>, found that the WCA is the right process, but that improvements could be made. The review set out a substantial series of recommendations which the Government fully accepted on the same day. As a result we will:</p>

	<p pid="a.790W.3/5" class="indent">Make the WCA a more compassionate process.</p>
	<p pid="a.790W.3/6">In addition to the independent reviews, the Department also carried out a Department-led review which was published in March 2010. This review consulted closely with medical and other experts and disability organisations and made a series of recommendations for improving the WCA. We intend to introduce these changes in spring 2011, ahead of the reassessment of incapacity benefits claimants.</p>

	<p pid="a.794W.2/2">Most of the proposed changes to housing benefit affect people in the private rented sector whose housing benefit is assessed under the local housing allowance. Housing benefit for those who live in hostels and in supported accommodation within the social and voluntary sector is not normally assessed under local housing allowance rules and is unlikely to be affected by these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/3">Other changes to housing benefit that impact on both the private and social rented sectors such as increases to non-dependant deductions and restricting benefit where occupants are living in accommodation that is larger than they need are also unlikely to affect people in women's aid projects. The change that may have an effect is the 10% reduction in housing benefit where a person has been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for over twelve months. This change takes affect from April 2013. We shall publish an impact assessment on the proposed measure to accompany the relevant legislation when introduced in Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.5/1">One of the reasons for the introduction of the standard interest rate in 1995 was that the actual interest rates met under the previous system were sometimes excessive. The policy intention is not that support for mortgage interest should meet high interest rates. It is important that only reasonable costs are met, in order to protect the tax payer.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.5/2">When the amount provided through benefit is less than the lender's rate charged on the loan, the responsibility lies with the claimant, working together with the lender, to meet any shortfall in payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.5/3">The Government will continue to explore with mortgage lenders the scope for them to &quot;freeze&quot; benefit claimants' mortgage accounts and apply a standard interest rate for a fixed period. In the meantime, the Government will continue to work closely with lenders and debt advice agencies to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort, and expects to see lenders continuing to offer support and forbearance to their customers who are struggling with their mortgage.</p>
