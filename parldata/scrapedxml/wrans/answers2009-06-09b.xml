	<p pid="b.785W.3/2">Allowances have included the additional costs allowance (now personal additional accommodation expenditure), office costs allowance (renamed the incidental expenses provision and then administrative and office expenditure), travel allowances and the communications allowance (now communications expenditure). Each allowance has been put in place to assist Members in carrying out their parliamentary duties and was approved by Resolution of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.785W.7/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.785W.7/2">We have not specifically sought to estimate the number of vacancies with local authorities relating to flood risk. DEFRA, in association with the Local Government Association, conducted a survey of all local authorities in autumn 2008 to make an initial assessment of existing local authority capacity and expertise. The survey revealed some encouraging evidence of existing levels of capacity that could be built upon and also identified that this was not a consistent picture across all authorities. The survey also confirmed that additional capacity would be required to take on proposed new duties from the Pitt Review and that recruitment difficulties and the availability particularly of technical skills would need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.785W.7/3">The survey asked local authorities how easy it was for them to recruit the technical staff they needed. 59 per cent. said this did not apply or they did not know, which could be interpreted as meaning that they were not recruiting or had not tried recently. 27 per cent. reported having some difficultly. The main reasons given for recruitment difficulties were a lack of suitably qualified applicants (77.8 per cent. of authorities had experienced difficulties), applicants lacking relevant experience (68.1 per cent.), and inadequate pay (63.9 per cent.). Other commonly cited reasons were competition from private sector employers (47.2 per cent.), competition from other local authorities (44.4 per cent.) and competition from other public sector employers (31.9 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.785W.7/4">The findings of the survey together with three workshops with local authorities have informed work on developing capacity for local authorities on flood risk management. DEFRA is currently undertaking a scoping study on broad local authority capacity building options and this will report in July 2009. We are also working closely with the Environment Agency, Local Government Association and relevant sector skills councils to develop skills availability in the wider market place and links to education.</p>

Lags in time between conviction and sentencing mean that the numbers convicted and sentenced in a year will not always match. Offenders aged under 18 at the time of the offence are not eligible for the five-year mandatory minimum, while the table shows offenders aged over 18 at the point of sentence they may have been under 18 when the offence was committed in which case the five-year minimum would not have been applicable.</p>

	<p pid="b.795W.5/2">The ICR's current remit is wide ranging and includes the ability to investigate complaints about any error made by the Land Registry, whether procedural or substantive. As set out in my previous answer, the exception to this is where a complainant refers to a decision on land registration not related to maladministration, such as delay or loss, where the decision can only be considered judicially. For example, where an error created a substantive right for a third party, such as an incorrect name being entered as a registered proprietor of a property leading to the individual named becoming the legal owner of the property, this would require alteration of the register by either the Court or the Registrar, exercising the powers conferred on them by schedule 4 of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

Four of these vessels are 16 m coastal survey vessels focussing on environmental monitoring. The other vessels are smaller, ranging in size from 5-12 m, with duties differing across fisheries enforcement, flood defence inspections and harbour duties as well as environmental monitoring. The EA also hired eight vessels for data collection activities for Flood and Coastal Risk Management and marine monitoring in 2008-09 some of which is expected to continue in 2009-10. The marine vessel fleet has been subject to a detailed review over the last two years. The outcome of the review will lead to a rationalisation of this fleet from 41 to 25 vessels over the next three years to improve efficiency and increase utilisation of the remaining assets.</p>

	<p pid="b.825W.8/2">Since the publication of the Government's Legacy Action Plan in June 2008, there has been significant progress on delivering our aims for a lasting community sport legacy from the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.8/3">In December 2008 Sport England announced &pound;480 million of funding over the next four years to national governing bodies of sport to help deliver their outcome of 1 million more people playing sport regularly, as part of our legacy aim to get 2 million people more active.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.8/4">Sport England have also announced several new streams of lottery funding, including a &pound;10 million themed round aimed at boosting sport participation in rural communities, and a &pound;5 million Innovation Fund seeking new ways of getting people playing more sport&mdash;as part of a further investment of up to &pound;220 million over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.8/5">The Government are investing at least &pound;780 million over 2008 to 2011 to develop sport opportunities for all young people through our PE and Sport Strategy for Young People. 90 per cent. of pupils now do two hours of high quality PE and school sport, and with delivery partners the Youth Sport Trust and Sport England, we are mapping provision of the five-hour offer in every School Sport Partnership area. Over the past year, we have rolled out a number of new programmes to get more young people doing sport: Sport Unlimited is a &pound;36 million initiative which, by 2010-11, aims to give 900,000 more 11 to 19-year-olds opportunities to take part in sports that interest them most outside of school; we now have a new network of school sport coaches; a network of 226 competition managers are increasing competition between schools; and we have delivered 250 new multi-sport clubs for young disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.8/6">As set out in the Legacy Action Plan, a ministerial sports legacy board has been set up and met earlier this year. It brings together, for the first time, all those who have a role to play in delivering the sports legacy across the UK&mdash;the UK Government, the Devolved Administrations, Sport England, UK Sport, the Youth Sport Trust, London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and others. The group will enable all of us to work together to maximise the opportunity which the Olympics and Paralympics provides to deliver a world leading sporting nation and get more children, young people and adults participating regularly in sport.</p>

These events have covered a broad range of issues including how to engage young people in our plans for 2012; the means by which we can secure a positive legacy from the games; our plans for using volunteers on the 2012 programme; how we maximise access to and legacy from the games for disabled people; how we overcome challenges in relation to construction of the Olympic Park; as well as the use of new media and technology and legacy of the International Broadcast Centre/Main Press Centre.

	<p pid="b.834W.2/3">Of the ODA's staff 136 are working on project management. This includes work on legacy planning. Every project in the programme is considered with legacy in mind, ensuring that legacy requirements are incorporated in design briefs, specifications and business planning. This approach is designed to ensure that the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games will be the catalyst for the regeneration, but it also means that staff are not attributed specifically to legacy planning.</p>

	<p pid="b.842W.5/1">In the 10 years from 1997, total public spending increased by 43 per cent. in real terms, compared to 14 per cent. in the previous decade. Such high levels of investment, coupled with reforms, have enabled the Government to achieve major improvements across frontline public services. The Government are committed to increasing investment in important public service priorities over the coming years, alongside delivering more efficient and effective public services and cutting down on waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.5/2">Departmental allocations plan for 2010-11 were set out in Budget 2009. Departmental allocations plan beyond 2010-11 will be decided at the next spending review. Over 2011-12 to 2013-14, public sector current expenditure is set to grow at an average of 0.7 per cent. in real terms, and public sector net investment will move to 1.25 per cent. of GDP in 2013-14.</p>

	<p pid="b.845W.6/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and those acting on its behalf have a strict statutory duty of confidentiality and information is only passed to third parties by HMRC for the purposes permitted by law. The Department is currently carrying out a small-scale six-month trial to test the use of private debt collection agencies (DCAs).

	<p pid="b.852W.5/1">This Department has not made any estimate of changes in the number of jobs in the brewing and public house sector in the last 12 months. The Department is aware that recent research undertaken within the brewing and public house sector indicates that employment in the beer and pub trade has been declining since 2006. We are working to restore greater confidence in our economy as a whole which should in itself help sectors such as this.

	<p pid="b.852W.8/1">The community-led physical regeneration projects shown in the following tables are national schemes comprising hundreds of individual grant awards. The cost of collecting data on each grant would incur disproportionate cost. Therefore, the projects have been grouped under broad titles such as &quot;Single Regeneration Budget&quot; or &quot;Market Town Initiative&quot; alongside their annual expenditure<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.8/2" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> A number of schemes (e.g. SRB) ran for a finite period, and had expenditure profiles that matched the commitments entered into at the outset of the programme.

Redundant laptops are given to Computeraid who distribute equipment to various projects across developing countries. All donated laptops have the data erased prior to donation and DFID receives confirmation that the equipment will eventually be disposed of in line with the waste of electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE) guidelines. Approximately 90 per cent. of the redundant laptops were past the four year end of life recommendation.</p>
