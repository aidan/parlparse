	<p pid="b.720W.3/14" class="indent">&quot;I know that concern has been expressed in this House and elsewhere about the length and cost of some public inquiries. In particular, there are concerns about the cost of the Bloody Sunday inquiry&mdash;&pound;129.9 million to date, with a predicted final cost of &pound;155 million. I understand that unhappiness, but setting up that inquiry was the right thing to do, and I commend the work of Lord Saville and his team. Having been established, the inquiry must run its course if it is to be fair to individuals and if the truth is to emerge. We will, of course, take all reasonable steps to control costs in the inquiries that I have announced today, including capping legal costs where appropriate. We will ensure that the inquiries have the maximum powers, as well as aiming for better, quicker inquiries. Even so, these inquiries will inevitably mean the commitment of significant resources. The Government recognise people's desire to see public funds spent on delivering better public services and effective policing. I recognise public concern about further expenditure on inquiries into the past&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/15">Since the establishment of the Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson inquiries, the Government have worked with the inquiries to put in place a number of measures to ensure that, while they have the resources necessary to fulfil their task, costs are kept to a reasonable level. The specific steps that have been taken are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/16" class="indent">agreeing a management statement that includes a financial memorandum with the inquiries. The management statement sets out the broad framework under which any public funds are paid to the inquiries including the conditions under which public funds are paid and how the inquiry accounts for its expenditure. My officials hold regular formal meetings with the Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson inquiries to discuss their financial forecasts under the terms of these documents;</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/17" class="indent">letting the inquiries make use of the Northern Ireland Office procurement division and have access to other procurement expertise in order to ensure that value for money is secured;</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/18" class="indent">setting maximum hourly fees levels for publicly funded counsel and solicitors;</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/19" class="indent">introducing a general 40 hour weekly cap on fees;</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/20" class="indent">ensuring representation by counsel is limited only to interested parties or key witnesses whose evidence is in dispute;</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/21" class="indent">making sure the scope of the legal work that may be undertaken at the public expense is circumscribed by the respective inquiry costs protocol and that all bills in respect of publicly funded legal assistance are subject to monthly scrutiny by the inquiry solicitor who is required to authorise disbursements in excess of &pound;100.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/22">The chairmen of the Billy Wright Inquiry and the Robert Hamill Inquiry separately asked me to convert their statutory basis for their inquiries to the Inquiries Act 2005 under section 15 of that Act. One consequence of my decision to grant their request for conversion is that the framework for the award by the chairman of costs in relation to legal representation set out in section 40 of that Act applies. I know that both chairmen take seriously their responsibilities in this regard, and the provision in section 17(3) of the Act that:</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/23" class="indent">In making any decision as to the procedure or conduct of an inquiry, the chairman must act with fairness and with regard also to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost (whether to public funds or to witnesses or others).</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.3/24">In respect of the Billy Wright Inquiry I exercised my power on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October 2006</phrase> to make a notice of determination under section 40(4) of the Act and notified the House by means of a written statement, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-10-25.89"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 89-91WS</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.726W.2/1">The Road Safety Act 2006 increased the penalty for using a hand-held mobile phone while driving to three penalty points and discretionary disqualification on top of the existing fine of up to &pound;1,000 (&pound;2,500 in the case of the driver of a goods vehicle or a bus/coach). If a fixed penalty is accepted the penalty is three points and a &pound;60 fine. The new penalty came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>. If the police see poor driving and find a driver distracted by a call on a hands-free mobile phone, then they can prosecute the offence of not being in a position to have proper control of a vehicle. The same penalties apply. The police have stepped up their enforcement of these offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.726W.2/2">In addition, extensive publicity is being run as part of the Department's THINK! road safety campaign. The campaign to publicise the higher penalty was launched in January 2007, using a mix of television, press, radio and online advertising and which included a TV advertisement which features a new message aimed at those who call people who are driving.</p>

Anecdotal evidence indicates that a number of commercial kart tracks (there are around 100 such tracks in the UK) are offering their facilities for such use. However safety concerns mean the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU)&mdash;the national governing body for motorcycle sport&mdash;will not licence such tracks and therefore ascertaining how many offer such services is simply not possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.734W.2/1">The UK does not have a bilateral development assistance programme with Guinea-Bissau, though we have recently supported the Government to develop a security sector reform framework, and an NGO to conduct a demining assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.734W.2/2">The UK's imputed share of multilateral agency development assistance to Guinea-Bissau was &pound;2.517 million in 2005 (based on the UK's total funding for each multilateral and that multilateral's distribution of official development assistance and official aid each year). Agencies normally pool donor funding, so no breakdown of UK spending against individual projects is available.</p>

Official aid (OA) has the same concessional and qualitative features as ODA but covers aid to countries on Part 2 of the DAC list of recipients.

The Commission recognises, however, that many who work on the estate are unavoidably present for long periods, particularly when the House is sitting.

From that date smoking will, however, be permitted in four designated external areas: the Terrace, Commons Court (North West corner), North Terrace (between Portcullis House and Norman Shaw South), and in a designated area on the west side of Canon Row courtyard.

	<p pid="b.740W.5/1">DCMS has made no recent assessment of the merits of different forms of ownership of Channel 4. The Government believe Channel 4 plays a key role as a publicly owned broadcaster providing a distinctive contribution to public service broadcasting. The Government recognise Channel 4 is likely to face financial pressures in the future that may have implications for its ability to deliver fully its public service remit. We therefore welcome Ofcom's current review of Channel 4's financial prospects and will take a close interest in the outcome. In the meantime, we are considering the possible case for short term forms of assistance to Channel 4.</p>

	<p pid="b.741W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>, Ofcom published research by the Generics Group which examined the cost and power consumption implications of digital switchover for UK households. The report estimates that for those households that incur a cost as a result of switchover, the actual cost will depend on the equipment requiring conversion and the level of voluntary conversion carried out before switchover. Typical non-voluntary costs for TV and recorders in households containing an average collection of reception equipment are therefore estimated to range from &pound;26 to &pound;153.</p>

	<p pid="b.749W.3/2"><i> </i>The compensation threshold for &quot;hearing loss due to service&quot; applies only to bilateral noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss. It does not apply to other forms of hearing loss or injury, such as that caused by blast. The 50 dB threshold was introduced into the war pensions scheme in 1993 as part of a package of changes which focused benefits on the more severely disabled and is also common to the related Civilian Industrial Injuries Disablement Scheme. The same threshold is used for compensating for this condition in the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, which also focuses on the more severely injured. This approach is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts. There are no plans to review the threshold, although we remain open to consider new evidence that may arise.</p>

	<p pid="b.757W.0/1">The Inspection Team put 46 soldiers (11 per cent.) through their annual personal weapons test over the two days of the inspection, without prior notice and without the individual soldiers having a chance to practise. The team had no exact UK figures as comparators but used its collective military judgment and experience as the basis of their comment: &quot;Although low, this pass rate is consistent with other part time organizations in the UK&quot;. The team had some experience of serving with the TA and with the Home Service Part-Time element of the Royal Irish Regiment (and Ulster Defence Regiment before) as well as considerable experience with regular soldiers. It felt that a 70 per cent. &quot;first time&quot; pass rate was probably comparable to (but not quite as good as) that likely to be achieved by part-time British soldiers faced with an equivalent unrehearsed, no-notice test. It also noted that the pass rate would be improved by regular practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.762W.5/3">Rest and Recuperation (R and R) is also in addition to an individual's annual leave allowance and is taken in the course of an operational tour. It is a fixed period which includes travel time, and therefore the time spent at home could be diminished where delays occur in travelling. When appropriate, R and R can be extended at the discretion of the commanding officer if time has been lost due to travel delays; this decision will be made on the basis of the current operational tempo and the impact that such an extension might have. Records are not held of the impact delays have had on individuals' R and R, and the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.12/2">These products are increasingly being supplied with software controls for limiting volume which parents can set for their children under a security code.

	<p pid="b.765W.0/1">The main mechanism for reducing the cost of microgeneration equipment for households is through the Low Carbon Buildings Phase 1 capital grant programme. The 2007 Budget announced a further &pound;6 million to be added to the householder stream of this programme, bringing the total available to approximately &pound;18.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/2">We have also introduced legislation to make it easier for microgenerators to gain access to the monetary benefits of Renewable Obligation Certificates. And we are continuing to work with larger energy suppliers to ensure transparency of prices offered for exported electricity from microgenerators and to make technical changes that would help suppliers to cut administration costs and make it more cost-effective to offer export tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/3">The Communities and Local Government Department have recently published a consultation setting out plans to make it easier for householders to install microgeneration equipment without having to go through the planning process and incurring the associated costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.772W.6/1">As far as existing nuclear operators are concerned, the Nuclear Installations Act (which implements the UK's obligations under the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy and the supplementary Brussels Convention) channels liability for incidents to operators, requiring them to maintain insurance or other security to meet potential claims. But these Conventions have recently been revised, and Government are now considering how best to bring the amendments into UK law. The proposals for doing this, on which we anticipate consulting in due course, will have implications for both existing operators and any new owners or operators of nuclear plant.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.6/2">The environmental and safety regulators already recover the majority of costs in respect of nuclear regulation from operators. There are no proposals to change these existing cost recovery schemes. The HSE is proposing to introduce regulations to recover costs relating to design assessment. The Environment Agency will recover its costs for design assessment, if required, through an agreement with the requesting party under Section 37 of the Environment Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.6/3">The current consultation on &quot;The Future of Nuclear Power&quot; sets out that if Government conclude that nuclear has a role to play in the future UK energy mix, owners/operators of any new nuclear power stations would propose, develop, construct and operate any new plant and cover the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste management costs. There are no proposals to change the way in existing operators may fund research and development undertaken by Government departments, the NDA or CoRWM.</p>

	<p pid="b.773W.2/1">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is responsible for delivering safe, sustainable and publicly acceptable solutions to the challenge of nuclear clean-up and waste management.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.2/2">Radioactive waste needs to be treated (or 'conditioned') and packaged to make it safer for handling, storage and eventual disposal. The nuclear site licence holders (waste packagers) carry out the physical packaging of the waste and are responsible for the safety of their operations. They are required to demonstrate to the independent regulators that the risks to the public and the environment from these activities are reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.2/3">In support of their safety cases for packaging of radioactive waste, the waste packagers seek advice from the new Radioactive Waste Management Directorate (RWMD) of the NDA. This is done under a system known as the 'Letter of Compliance' process whereby the suitability of waste packages for eventual disposal is assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.2/4">It is the independent regulators who take decisions on the acceptability of waste conditioning and packaging safety cases submitted to them. Responsibility for securing the safety of the public and the environment rests with the independent regulators&mdash;the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the environment agencies (the Environment Agency, EA, in England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, SEPA, in Scotland).</p>

	<p pid="b.778W.2/1">The general policy is for academies to be post-16 providers in their own right to address low participation rates by adding to the diversity and quality of local provision. Where an academy proposal does not include post-16 provision, the Government would need to be assured that arrangements for post-16 students leaving the academy are comparable to those which could be provided by the academy itself. If, during the course of the consultation process that all academy projects are subject to, convincing arguments were put forward as to why the community would benefit more from an 11 to 16 than an 11 to 18 academy, this would of course be taken into account on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.783W.5/1">The Department for Education and Skills currently funds, through the Training and Development Agency for Schools, the Student Associates Scheme. The scheme's twin aims are to encourage undergraduates into teacher training and to use the undergraduates as role models for school pupils with a view to increasing participation into higher education. Undergraduates spend up to 15 days in a school working with individual pupils, groups and whole classes. The majority of placements are in secondary priority shortage subjects. In the academic year 2006/07, we expect that, of a total of 7,955 potential allocated places, approximately 1,390 will be mathematics placements. Provisional allocations for the academic year 2007/08 suggest that the mathematics figure will arise to around 1,415.</p>

However, it is likely that only a small number, mostly from the mixed economy group of colleges which currently provide 14 per cent. of all foundation degree provision, will be able to satisfy the criteria necessary to be awarded foundation degree-awarding powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.2/3">Guidance issued to applicants will specify that an institution will be expected to have at least four years' experience, immediately prior to the year of application, of delivering higher education programmes at a level equivalent to the foundation degree. An applicant institution will also undergo a rigorous process of assessment by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. The required standards will be high, and it is to be expected that only top-performing further education institutions with a strong track record of delivering foundation degree courses will be recommended to the Privy Council for the powers to award foundation degrees.</p>

	<p pid="b.791W.5/2"><i> </i>The Department does not collect data about the number of applications for headships. However, according to research undertaken by Howson<sup>(1)</sup>, while there has been a decline in the number of applications for headships in primary schools between 2004-05 and 2005-06, there has been an increase in the number of applications in secondary schools. In addition, the Department's official statistics show that since 1997, head teacher vacancies have remained low and fairly stable. Provisional figures for 2007 show a fall in the head teacher vacancy rate from 0.8 per cent. in January 2006 to 0.6 per cent. in January 2007. However, we know that some types of schools such as church schools, schools in London and some small schools in rural areas find it harder to recruit senior staff than others and also that more heads are reaching retirement age.</p>
	<p pid="b.791W.5/3">Our focus is therefore on ensuring that we have sufficient numbers of high quality school leaders now and coming through the system for the future. The Secretary of State asked the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) for advice on succession planning and on the back of this announce an additional &pound;10 million to support their work in this area. In preparing the advice, the NCSL have consulted widely with schools, school leaders, local authorities, dioceses, professional associations, and governor bodies. This included nine regional succession planning conferences, attended by over 500 school leaders and an ongoing Succession Planning Advisory Group with senior education representatives which meets regularly. The Department also commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct an independent study into school leadership, which reported in January.</p>

	<p pid="b.793W.0/2">The Further Education and Training Bill makes provision to streamline the non-executive structure of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) by removing the requirement to have local learning and skills councils (of which there are 47) and replacing them with new regional committees (to be known as regional councils, of which we intend there to be nine). It also removes the requirement to have an adult and young people's learning committee and reduces the minimum size of the LSC's national council. Overall the number of non-executives will reduce from around 750 to around 150.</p>
	<p pid="b.793W.0/3">The LSC has also been undergoing a restructuring exercise which will result in some 1,100 fewer staff posts across the whole of the organisation. This exercise is expected to be completed later this summer, and is important preparation for the LSC's role in implementing the reforms set out in the Further Education White Paper &quot;Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances&quot;, and for taking forward the skills challenges identified in the Leitch Report.</p>

	<p pid="b.798W.2/2">When deciding proposals to close a school the local authority must take account of statutory guidance issued by the Secretary of State. The guidance does not specify the weightings that decision-makers should apply to the various factors they take into account, but it makes clear that they must be satisfied that closing the school would contribute to raising the standard of provision locally and lead to improved attainment for children. The statutory guidance also includes a presumption against closing rural primary schools.

	<p pid="b.800W.5/1">The day-to-day responsibility for ensuring the standard of cleanliness of school toilet facilities lies with the school governors with, in general, the local authorities having an overarching responsibility. This is laid out within the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999, SI No.2 1999.</p>
	<p pid="b.800W.5/2">The guidance referred to in PQ 141078 is 'Standard Specifications, Layouts and Dimensions SSLD 3: Toilets in Schools'. This guidance has been developed to inform the building schools for the future (BSF) programme. It sets out standards of performance for toilet facilities and shows how they might be delivered through design examples. The aim of the SSLD series of specifications is to disseminate best practice and avoid &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; every time a school building is designed so that consistently high quality environments can be delivered, offering best whole-life value for money. The new guidelines also seek to address the issue of bullying in toilet blocks, helping ensure that cramped, dirty and vandalised toilets become a thing of the past. Toilets in BSF schools will no longer provide bullies with places that lend themselves all too readily to antisocial behaviours.</p>
	<p pid="b.800W.5/3">School building clients, their professional advisers, contractors and their supply chains will use the guidance at the early stages of a project's development whether for new build, extension or refurbishment.</p>
	<p pid="b.800W.5/4">The guidance was published on both the Department<sup>(1)</sup> and Partnerships for Schools' websites and local authorities will be informed through newsletters that the guidance exists. The guidance is being reflected in the BSF standard documentation. The published guidance applies to new toilet facilities only.</p>
	<p pid="b.800W.5/5">The Department has no plans to monitor improvements in provision of school toilets.</p>

	<p pid="b.801W.2/2">Discussions with head teachers and detailed research showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.2/3">Instead, the Department has successfully introduced an online ordering service where schools are able to either download or order paper based copies of publications including guidance. A regular fortnightly e-mail is sent to schools to inform them of new publications. In addition, Spectrum provides schools, head teachers and chairs of governors with a summary of all the latest resources, publications, guidance and regulations.

	<p pid="b.801W.5/3">Over the last year, DfES officials&mdash;in conjunction with the student loans company and local authorities&mdash;have investigated a number of cases of suspected fraud, including some involving the use of stolen birth certificates to create false identities, which resulted in successful prosecutions. Alongside this the NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service has estimated the fraud rate for student support at around 0.6 per cent. of applications in 2005/06. We will work to reduce it further, but it is appreciably lower than other similar systems which involve payments.</p>

	<p pid="b.802W.2/1">Building on school workforce remodelling and the reform of teachers' pay, we are working with social partners to deliver a new teacher professionalism in which all teachers are engaged in ongoing professional development that takes account of individual development needs, career aspirations and school's improvement priorities, along with national, regional and local priorities. Sustainable development can easily be incorporated into courses as part of a qualified teacher's professional development.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.2/2">The National College for School Leadership already covers learning on sustainable development on the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH) as part of 'Developing a Strategic Educational Vision for the School'. The NPQH will be a mandatory qualification for new head teachers from April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.2/3">Sustainable development is already a statutory part of the National Curriculum in citizenship, design and technology, geography and science. The current review of the secondary curriculum will mean that there is a sharper focus on sustainable development in these subjects. QCA will be developing supporting material to demonstrate how sustainable development can be taught across the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.2/4">Beacon school status was phased out in 2005 as part of a streamlining of existing programmes. The Government wants all schools to put sustainable development into practice and is encouraging them to do so through the current sustainable schools year of action. We value award schemes like Eco-schools and also local schemes such as Sandwell's Sustainable Schools Charter. DEFRA has provided &pound;65,000 this year to the Eco-schools programme. The Department has no plans to adopt an Eco-schools target but all schools are encouraged to be sustainable schools by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.2/5">We believe that school inspection should recognise where the efforts made to create sustainable schools are having a significant impact on a school's overall effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.2/6">As stated in 'Sustainable Schools for Pupils, Communities and the Environment&mdash;an action plan for the DfES', published in March 2007, we will be discussing with Ofsted how best to ensure that sustainable development is recognised during school inspections. The Department has developed a tool linked to the Ofsted self-evaluation form to enable schools to record and report their efforts on sustainable development. Sustainable Development is an important part of value for money in property management and as such should already be factored into inspectors' judgments.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.2/2">This specific information is not available. However, improving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is a priority for the Government. The commitment to improve CAMHS is backed up by significant additional funding, with over &pound;400 million in the four years to March 2007 made available to local authorities and the NHS. Over &pound;100 million has also been made available for 2007-08. An element of these funds will have been used on services for young people who have sexually abused and who need CAMHS.</p>

The framework will aim to use existing resources in a more coherent and consistent approach. A major focus is to build on and bring together what is known about the best practice and most effective treatment interventions so that practitioners at the local level can share these and define responsibilities more clearly.

The Department aims to deal with 97 per cent. of repayment claims within 15 days and has exceeded this target during April and May 2007. Average time, or separate information for retirement annuitants or senior citizens, is not available. Recent changes mean that most retirement annuitants will no longer need to make annual claims.</p>

	<p pid="b.831W.15/1">The Department is in regular contact, on a range of issues, with bodies that represent farmers.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.15/2">I am aware of the public concern over the trade in live calf exports. However, this is a lawful trade and European Union (EU) law must be observed. The United Kingdom (UK) cannot place a unilateral ban on the export of calves. The Government have consistently said that we prefer a trade in meat to the long distance transport of live animals to slaughter.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.15/3">Consequently, we are seeking to encourage the industry to develop alternative uses for calves other than live export, and welcome the joint initiative from Compassion in World Farming and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to bring together welfare groups, the dairy and beef industry and the retail sector to discuss this issue. They hosted an event last July which I attended.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.15/4">The industry has developed domestic veal rearing systems that satisfy robust welfare requirements, but the opportunities to sell the product in the UK are very limited while there remains strong commercial demand for veal calves on the continent. DEFRA recently commissioned a study to look at the economic drivers and potential for developing alternative markets to the export of veal calves. The report confirmed that the domestic market for home-produced veal is resistant to growth. It did, however, conclude that there are commercially attractive opportunities for rearing dairy calves for the growing domestic market for manufacturing beef. This is promising and DEFRA will continue to play its part in encouraging such alternative uses.</p>

	<p pid="b.833W.2/2"><i> </i>The Department works with other countries, through the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) toward the prevention of significant disturbance to cetaceans.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.2/3">The Department has implemented a comprehensive system of by-catch monitoring under the requirements of the EC Habitats Directive and Council Regulation 812/2004. In 2003, the UK was the first member state to publish a response strategy for the monitoring of small cetaceans by-catch. In December 2004, the UK banned pelagic pair trawling for bass by UK vessels within 12 miles off the south-west coast of England. The Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) regularly reports the results of its research on by-catch monitoring which covers all relevant UK fishery sectors, including the bass pair trawl fishery to the Department and has recently presented us with their 2006 findings. This report will be submitted to the European Commission and published on DEFRA's website in due course. The Commission evaluate all contributing member states' schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.2/4">The Department also provides funding for the Institute of Zoology and Natural History Museum Cetacean (and Turtle) Strandings Scheme, which monitors and investigates porpoise and dolphin strandings around the UK. This long-running DEFRA-funded contract showed a slight increase in strandings around the UK coast in 2006 compared to 2005. The latest report is scheduled to be published soon and will be available on DEFRA's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.2/5">The latter two schemes have been extended until 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.2/6">EU and DEFRA-funded SMRU work continues on by-catch mitigation measures in the bass pair trawl fishery. The final results will be presented to the European Commission in the next two to three months.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.2/7">The UK Government have also identified the potential benefits of acoustic devices such as pingers in reducing bycatch in fixed gear fisheries and argued successfully for these devices to be required in certain fisheries by EU legislation. Prior to enforcing the use of pingers under Council Regulation EC 8121 2004, the UK Government wants to ensure that those we recommend to be used are safe and cost effective for the industry and offer the maximum protection to porpoises.</p>

	<p pid="b.834W.6/1">The approved UK national allocation plan (NAP) for phase I (2005-07) of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is set to deliver carbon dioxide emissions savings of around 65 million tonnes (roughly 8 per cent.) below the projected business as usual emissions of the installations covered by the scheme during phase I. The rationale behind emission trading is to ensure that the emission reductions take place where the cost of the reduction is lowest thus lowering the overall costs of tackling climate change. The emissions reductions referred to above may not therefore all take place in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.834W.6/2">Comparing 2003 and 2005 emissions in the UK from incumbent installations in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme shows a reduction of around 10 million tones (Mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2). This equates to 4 per cent. However, a number of new installations commenced operation and entered the scheme in 2004 and 2005, emitting a total of around 5 Mt CO2 in 2005. Therefore, the net total reduction in emissions from UK installations (incumbent and new) in the EU ETS was approximately 5 Mt CO2 between 2003 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.834W.6/3">The 2006 EU ETS results in the UK show an increase in emissions from 2005 of 8.8 Mt CO2. This increase was due mainly to unusually high international gas prices leading to a switch to coal in electricity generation. It is difficult to assess what the level of emissions would have been if the scheme had not been in place, but they are likely to have been higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.834W.6/4">A study carried out last year estimated that emissions reductions (abatement) across the EU resulting from the implementation of EU ETS in 2005 could be somewhere in the region of 50 Mt CO2 to 200 Mt CO2. We are not aware of similar analysis for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.834W.6/5">The Government are committed to a strong and effective carbon market as a key factor in combating climate change. Phase I of the scheme is a learning phase and, for this reason, caution should be exercised when trying to draw conclusions from the results.</p>

	<p pid="b.839W.2/2">The UK Biomass Strategy and the recently published Waste Strategy for England 2007 set out the important contribution which anaerobic digestion can make to achieving these objectives. Waste Strategy for England 2007 identifies anaerobic digestion as the preferred technology for recovering energy from waste and outlines measures to promote its greater uptake. It particularly encourages local authorities and businesses to consider using anaerobic digestion to treat separately collected food waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.2/3">In the Energy White Paper, the Government announced that we would be consulting on the banding of the renewables obligation. Under these proposals, electricity produced by anaerobic digestion would receive two renewable obligation certificates per megawatt hours.</p>

	<p pid="b.842W.5/1">We monitor the situation in Chechnya and the wider north Caucasus regularly. Recent years have seen a gradual improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, resulting in the UN downgrading its security classification for Chechnya from Phase 5 to Phase 4 in August 2006. But the security situation in neighbouring Ingushetia and Dagestan is increasingly concerning.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.5/2">The death of Shamil Basayev in 2006 was followed by an amnesty under which over 500 rebel fighters were reported to have surrendered, creating the opportunity for a process of reconciliation that could underpin long-term security. Although the general security trend is positive and large-scale military action by federal troops has now ceased, low-intensity clashes with separatist groups continue to be reported.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.5/3">We believe that the best prospect for political stability in the republic is for the federal and local authorities to work together towards democratic accountability of government structures and to address the social and economic needs of the population.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.5/4">We remain concerned about reports of human rights abuses in the north Caucasus. There are reports of forced disappearances, torture and extra-judicial killing in the republic. We believe that security measures which do not respect international human rights law are counter-productive and that a long-term solution to the region's problems is only possible once an end has been put to human rights violations. It is important that President Kadyrov ensures that all government agencies operate within the law and that all security measures are combined with a full respect for human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.5/5">The situation in Chechnya and the wider north Caucasus remains an issue of importance in our continuing bilateral and EU discussions with Russia. With EU partners, we raised the latest developments in Chechnya with the Russian government at the EU-Russia Human Rights Consultations on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.5/6">The Government are also active in assisting development in the north Caucasus through individual projects supported by the global conflict prevention pool, our bilateral &pound;1 million north Caucasus education initiative, and the &euro;20 million technical aid to the Commonwealth of independent states special assistance programme, which was agreed under the UK's EU presidency in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.845W.2/1">After many years of hiding its nuclear programme from the world, Iran needs to satisfy the international community, and not just the UK, that its programme is for purely peaceful reasons. The generous and far-reaching proposals presented to Iran on behalf of the E3+3 (France, Germany, UK + China, Russia, US) by Dr. Javier Solana in June 2006 would give Iran everything it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power programme. These remain on the table and we stand ready to negotiate with Iran on the basis of these. But Iran first needs to suspend its enrichment-related activities, as repeatedly required by the UN Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, to gain the confidence of the international community.</p>
	<p pid="b.845W.2/2">We will not be satisfied that Iran's nuclear programme is for entirely peaceful purposes until Iran meets in full the requirements of the international community. These include Iran's obligations under UN Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737 and 1747, as well as the requirements under IAEA Board of Governors decisions and resolutions. In particular, as the Director-General of the IAEA has stated many times, unless Iran addresses the long outstanding verification issues, and implements the Additional Protocol which it has agreed with the agency, as well as essential transparency measures, the IAEA will not be able to fully reconstruct the history of Iran's nuclear programme and provide the international community with assurances about the exclusively peaceful nature of that programme. The Director-General has also stated that these required transparency measures would need to go further than the measures prescribed in the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol, given the 20 years of undeclared nuclear activities in Iran. In the Director-General's most recent report on Iran on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase>, he noted that the agency's level of knowledge of certain aspects of Iran's nuclear related activities had deteriorated over the past year.</p>

	<p pid="b.846W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.6/2">The international compact for Iraq (ICI) is an opportunity for the Government of Iraq to set out its economic and political priorities for the next five years, with the help of the United Nations and the international community. It will develop the key reforms necessary to enable Iraq to make the most of its own resources and build a strategy for longer-term growth. The focus will be to build a framework for Iraq's economic transformation and integration into the regional and global economy. Its scope will cover short-term and long-term economic goals to enable Iraq to become financially self-sufficient, in order to ensure economic development and sustainable growth. The UK is pleased that the Government of Iraq is tackling these important issues and we hope that regional and international partners will support their efforts.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.6/3">The Security context of the compact stresses the importance for the Government of Iraq to work with international partners to develop the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). Security assistance is provided to Iraq under the auspices of the multi-national force for Iraq. This force is in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government and is mandated by UN Security Council Resolutions 1546 and 1723 to develop stability and security in that country; 25 countries contribute to it, all with the common objectives of helping to provide security, training and mentoring to the Iraqi security forces until they are fully able to manage the security situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.6/4">Implementation of the compact priorities will be overseen by the compact secretariat which was established on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-28">28 May</phrase> in Baghdad. The secretariat will operate out of the Deputy Prime Ministers' Office and will be supported by a Steering Committee and a number of sector working groups. The secretariat will be responsible for coordinating, implementing and monitoring performance of the policies and reforms laid out in the joint monitoring matrix.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.6/5">The Government of Iraq plans to meet regularly with the international community to keep them updated on progress. They will produce monthly/quarterly reports on progress against indicators in the compact. Such reports will be passed for discussion to the Baghdad coordination group (BCG), which includes all participants in the Iraq compact based in country. There will also be regular meetings with donors as part of sector working group discussions.</p>

It would be premature to judge the success of the plan before all the additional US forces are in theatre.</p>

	<p pid="b.849W.2/1">The UK is committed to helping Lebanon to implement UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701. As part of this, we spent approximately 1 million to support the Lebanese security sector, including the Lebanese armed forces (LAF), last financial year (2006-07). This included providing 47 Land Rovers to the LAF to increase their mobility and their capacity to implement UNSCR 1701. Our current programme of assistance includes a security sector advisor, public order training and equipment and human rights training for the LAF. We plan to maintain our engagement with and support of the LAF going forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.850W.0/1">The UK is determined that those responsible for the assassination of Rafik Hariri should be brought to justice. In November 2006, with the UK's support, the then UN Secretary-General wrote to Prime Minister Siniora inviting the Lebanese Government to approve statutes for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. In the context of the political impasse in Lebanon this was not possible, and Prime Minister Siniora and the Lebanese parliamentary majority wrote to the UN Secretary-General asking him to explore alternative ways forward. We have since worked with Security Council partners to assist Lebanon in setting up the Tribunal. UN Security Council Resolution 1757, formally establishing the Tribunal, was successfully passed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-30">30 May</phrase>. We will work towards its full implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.853W.3/1">The security situation in Pakistan remains fragile. There is a high threat from terrorism and sectarian violence throughout the country. Internal security in the border provinces remains volatile, where there has been a series of recent attacks and suicide bombings targeted against both the authorities and the public. Since March, following the Government of Pakistan's decision to suspend the Chief Justice, there have also been frequent, sometimes violent, protests in major cities throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.858W.9/1">The models used to calculate the current prison population projections are described in Annex 2 of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 11/06, 'Prison population projections 2006-2013, England and Wales', published on the Home Office website in July 2006. There are five elements to the modelling. In the very short term (the first three months) the XI2-ARIMA method developed by the USA Census Bureau is used. This method is publicly available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.858W.9/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.census.gov/srd/www/xl2a/">www.census.gov/srd/www/xl2a/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.858W.9/3">In the short term (between four months and two years) the population is modelled by a stock-and-flow model. This is not publicly available as it links to Prison Service databases that cannot be published. In the longer term (between two and seven years) the Grove-Macleod model is used. This has been published in OR Insight Vol. 11 Issue 1, January-March 1998, pp. 3-9, 'Forecasting the prison population'. More detail is also available in Occasional Paper 80, 'Modelling crime and offending: recent developments in England and Wales' published on the Home Office website in 2003. The impacts of some changes in legislation and operational procedures are estimated using the Criminal Justice System Model and, if necessary, one-off bespoke calculations. The Criminal Justice System Model is owned by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform and is available to CJS practitioners but is not publicly available. Any one-off calculations are described in the aforementioned mentioned Home Office Statistical Bulletin.</p>

	<p pid="b.860W.6/1">Difficulties with catering deliveries cannot directly and definitively be attributed to the introduction of the shared service centre. As such there are no comprehensive central records that detail them exhaustively and compiling such a record would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
	<p pid="b.860W.6/2">The total cost of the shared service centre project is &pound;84.8 million. This excludes capital costs and ongoing running costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.860W.6/3">Purchasing from local suppliers on an ad hoc basis is a recognised and legitimate contingency measure when failures are experienced in the main supply chain for foodstuff. For example, recent difficulties getting the bulk supply of long-grain rice from North America has caused the Prison Service to purchase existing stocks from local suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.866W.5/1">In the United Kingdom, there are strict legal controls on the retail sale, supply and advertisement of medicinal products. Pharmacy medicines must be supplied from a registered pharmacy by, or under the supervision of, a pharmacist. These controls apply equally to medicines sold or supplied through internet transactions and mail order. If supply is made through a UK pharmacy-based internet transaction then there is currently no legal restriction of quantity, although a pharmacist would use their professional judgment whether or not to supply the quantity sought.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.5/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) monitors the online availability of medicines. UK based websites which are identified dealing in breach of medicines legislation are referred for appropriate enforcement action. Websites discovered operating illegally outside of the UK are referred to the relevant authority in the country concerned for appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.5/3">As precursors that can be used in the manufacture of illicit drugs, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are subject to the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and are scheduled as category 1 precursors under European legislation. Anyone who imports any quantity of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is required to obtain a license from the Home Office. The Home Office is currently preparing legislation, to supplement European Union regulation, which will impose criminal penalties for the importation of scheduled substances, including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, without a valid importation authorisation.</p>

This peer review process ensures that the validity of the research is confirmed.

The European Food Safety Authority has commenced a review of the safety of all food additives, starting with colours, and the FSA will inform the European Commission when the Southampton University research is published so the results can be considered as part of the EU review.</p>

In addition, newly developed qualifications in professional cookery contain a mandatory unit on healthier eating and special diets.

	<p pid="b.878W.5/1">Section 6 of the Health Act 2006 sets out a duty for any person who occupies or is concerned in the management of smokefree premises to make sure that no-smoking signs complying with the requirements of the new law are displayed. The new law will require virtually all enclosed workplaces and public places to be smokefree, including places of worship or listed buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/2">Through the Smokefree England communications campaign, the Department has made guidance available on the new legislation. The guidance makes specific reference to the display of no-smoking signs in heritage buildings within the frequently asked questions section. Guidance has been posted to employing businesses across England, and is also available from the Smokefree England information line on freephone 0800 169 169 7 or to download on the Smokefree England website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.smokefreeengland.co.uk">www.smokefreeengland.co.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/4">Local councils can also provide advice and support on the new law.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/5">Departmental officials have met representatives from the Church of England and the Churches Main Committee regarding smokefree legislation. Meetings have also been offered to other faith groups. A Smokefree England fact sheet on smokefree legislation and places of worship has also been produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/6">The Smokefree (Signs) Regulations 2007 set out requirements for the display of no-smoking signs in smokefree premises and vehicles. These regulations have been drafted in a way to afford maximum flexibility within the requirements in the Health Act 2006 for the display of no-smoking signs.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/7">No-smoking signs may be displayed in a way that fits the decor of premises, as long as the minimum requirements set out in the regulations are met. A sign will need to be displayed in a prominent position at each entrance to smokefree premises. However, it need not be permanently mounted on the building because, for example, the display of a sign on a moveable stand at each entrance would satisfy the legal requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/8">To support the implementation of smokefree legislation, the Department is making no-smoking signs that meet the legislative requirements freely available to businesses and organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.883W.11/3">In 1995 the Home Office Scientific Development Branch, in collaboration with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), developed a Police Operational Requirement (POR) for body armour. This requirement states that the protection provided by ballistic and stab resistant body armour must be sufficient to prevent the wearer from sustaining serious or permanent injury. To achieve this, five vital organs located within the torso must be protected: the heart, lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys.</p>
	<p pid="b.883W.11/4">The provision of police equipment is a matter for chief officers. However I have written to the forces which do not provide protective armour to police community officers to ask them to clarify the reasons for their decision, and I will let my hon.

	<p pid="b.896W.2/2"><i> </i>The Home Office has focused on raising public awareness of the new role of police community support officers (PCSOs) and neighbourhood policing teams, which are now being implemented across England and Wales. A successful national PCSO recruitment campaign in 2006 was designed not only to encourage applications but also to help explain the role of a PCSO. This campaign included television and radio adverts, poster campaigns and national and local press advertising.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.2/3">In addition, a six-part documentary series followed the work of PCSOs in Lancashire and the Thames Valley. The series ran between October and December 2006 on ITV (England) and achieved an average audience of 2.3 million rising to 3 million. All of this activity has raised the profile of PCSOs and the neighbourhood policing teams in which they serve. It has also supported the police service in their drive to increase PCSO numbers to 16,000 across England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.2/4">Neighbourhood policing teams will consist of police sergeants, constables and PCSOs, and may also comprise special constables, wardens, neighbourhood managers, housing managers, youth workers and other community partners, depending on the needs and priorities of the community that the team serves. In promoting neighbourhood policing teams the Home Office and the police service has celebrated the diverse and complementary nature of the various ranks and roles within these teams which join together to provide a visible and accessible service to the communities they serve.</p>

	<p pid="b.897W.0/1">The information requested about the average size of a pension lump sum is not held centrally. Under the Police Pension Scheme 1987 a lump sum is not paid out automatically but only where the officer chooses to convert (commute) part of his or her pension into a lump sum. The size of a lump sum depends on the officer's pensionable pay, his or her length of pensionable service, the proportion of pension that the officer chooses to commute, and the commutation factor to be applied to the surrendered portion of pension in order to convert it into a lump sum.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.0/2">The Police Pensions Regulations 1987 require that the lump sum be determined as the actuarial equivalent of the surrendered portion of the pension at the date of retirement, calculated from tables prepared by the Government Actuary. The commutation factors used for the 1987 Scheme are graduated according to the age and gender of the officer concerned in order to reflect the fact that, on average, women live longer than men and younger people have a longer remaining life expectancy than older people. Pension scheme actuarial factors are exempted from the legal requirements for sex and age equality.</p>
