	<p pid="d.3W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence does not maintain details on the cost to Defence of providing a postal service to operational theatres as the value varies according to the volume of mail presented.

	<p pid="d.3W.0/2">For illustrative reasons, the current full commercial cost of sending a 2 kg airmail packet to Iraq or Afghanistan via Royal Mail is &pound;20.72. If this cost is taken as being representative of the total cost of sending a 2 kg package to Iraq or Afghanistan then the Ministry of Defence was paying 69 per cent. prior to the introduction of the freepost service on <phrase class="date" code="">3 September</phrase>. The remaining 31 per cent. was paid by the consigner.

	<p pid="d.3W.3/1">The average unit tour intervals for the Infantry and those units of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps and the Army Medical Services which deploy as fully formed units, are 23.5, 20.8, 23.1 and 24.5 months respectively. This is calculated on the basis of the mean time between the start of the most recent deployment and the end of the previous deployment.</p>
	<p pid="d.3W.3/2">The Household Cavalry has only deployed as a unit twice since January 2003: Iraq (April 2004-October 2004) and Afghanistan (October 2007-April 2008). As such, its average unit tour interval and actual unit tour interval is 35 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.3W.3/3">The unit tour interval is a less relevant measure when applied to the Corps of Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. This is due to the frequency with which personnel move between formed units within these Corps (the personnel deployed with a unit will be substantially different from the personnel deployed with the same unit on a previous occasion). Consequently, unit tour interval data for these Corps is not routinely collated.</p>

	<p pid="d.4W.2/2">There is no international definition of a cluster munition, nor of the number of sub-munitions a weapon must carry in order to be classed as a cluster munition. An element of the UK's own understanding of a cluster munition is that a weapon should carry more than 10 sub-munitions in order to be classified a cluster munition.</p>

Among the key achievements in 2006-07 were: the introduction of theft-resistant number plates to help combat car cloning and car ID theft; and an increase in wheel clamping activities to tackle vehicle excise duty evasion. It is not possible to quantify this in terms of staff numbers.</p>

The Department is currently working closely with Network Rail and Stagecoach South West Trains (the train operating company) to finalise the design and costs associated with the partial conversion of Waterloo International potentially to accommodate some domestic passenger services. Works on site are expected to commence soon after the station transfers to the Department and will take several months to complete. Services are then expected to operate into and out of platform 20 of Waterloo International from the start of the timetable change date in December 2008.</p>

	<p pid="d.27W.2/1">The price of feed for the livestock sector is largely determined by world prices for cereals, oilseeds and other commodities. Recent price increases have been driven by a combination of factors, some of which are shorter term and introduce volatility into the market (e.g. adverse weather leading to lower production) and others of which are longer term trends (e.g. increasing use of cereals and oilseeds for food, feed and fuel uses). Current high prices, combined with policy changes such as the removal of the set-aside requirement for the 2008 harvest, will undoubtedly stimulate production and lead to a moderation of prices, but it may take a number of years to rebuild stocks to levels that markets are comfortable with. A fuller assessment can be found in our recent report &quot;Implications of rising agricultural commodity prices&quot; which can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="d.27W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/publications/monthly%20brief/Annex%201%20Food%20and%20farming%20brief%20-%20impact%20of%20high%20commodity%20prices.pdf">http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/publications/monthly%20brief/Annex%201%20Food%20and%20farming %20brief%20-%20impact%20of%20high%20commodity %20prices.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="d.27W.2/3">Projecting future commodity prices and hence the price of feed for the livestock sector is uncertain. A number of international organisations produce projections, including the OECD and the EU Commission, the latest of which are given as follows. However, it should be noted that these were compiled before the recent price increases.</p>

	<p pid="d.27W.5/2"><i> </i>I have received a number of representations from local authorities about the direct funding available from DEFRA to supplement the resources available to them under the Revenue Support Grant for work on animal health and welfare. The funding paid to local authorities under these arrangements, which started in 2002-03, has been as follows:</p>

This compares with an available budget of &pound;8.5 million, which reflects a degree of underspending in previous years. DEFRA has issued allocations within the limits of the funding available. Authorities claiming up to &pound;11,000 will receive the full amount of their bids. Other authorities have been told that their bids will be reduced by up to 12 per cent.</p>

The Government are seeking views on three possible implementation scenarios. Scenarios 1A and 1B simply aim to meet the minimum requirements of the rBWD, with all bathing waters achieving at least the 'sufficient' classification by 2015 (Scenario 1B makes use of a prediction and discounting system) and Scenario 2 explores the costs of going beyond the minimum rBWD requirements by aiming to increase the number of 'excellent' bathing waters in England and Wales.

	<p pid="d.36W.5/1">Information for 2006 is in Table 1. However, focusing on such an analysis can be misleading, as some of the quota stocks included are of little interest to inshore vessels. In addition, many of these vessels catch types of fish, such as crabs and scallops, which are not subject to quotas and they are thus not subject to the constraints on their activity that may be seen when targeting quota species. Figures for landings of non-quota stocks are included at the foot of the table and show that 20 per cent. of all landings by the UK 10 metre and under fleet are of quota stocks. In addition, the degree to which quota species are important for these vessels varies around the coast. Table 2 shows more detail for landings by 10 metre and under vessels administered from English ports, and shows that in some areas quota stocks make up a small proportion of the total value of fish landed by such vessels.</p>

	<p pid="d.40W.2/1">Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) derives from classical fisheries science which states that in the long-term there is an average maximum catch that can be obtained from a stock, without threatening its future viability. This is achieved by fishing at the MSY level (MSYL). This level varies with both the biology (growth and mortality rates) of the stock in question and the fishing practices (including mesh size) used to catch it. The MSY will also depend upon the productivity of the stock. For most of our stocks, the MSYL is at relatively low fishing mortality&mdash;typically much lower than exists at present.</p>
	<p pid="d.40W.2/2">Reducing effort to MSY levels implies smaller catches in the short-term, with potential impacts on profitability and the size of the fleet. In the longer-term, however, fishing at MSY levels should ensure greater profitability (catches-per-unit-effort would be higher), improved sustainability and a more robust stock.</p>
	<p pid="d.40W.2/3">Several stocks are currently at or around MSY and can therefore be the continued basis for sustainable fisheries; for example, haddock and saithe. However, we are seeking to develop a common understanding with stakeholders of how we can best approach the issue of long-term management and the role of MSY more generally. In particular, there are significant potential socio-economic consequences with such an approach and it is important to ensure that the UK fishing industry has a sustainable long-term future. We will need to consider carefully how best to achieve a successful balance between stock conservation and fishing opportunity and the appropriate time frame(s) for this process.</p>

It would also reduce competition contrary to UK public procurement policy that is designed to achieve value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="d.42W.8/2">One of the illustrative findings of this study is that a rise in the oil price from $50 (the average price seen in 2005) to $100 a barrel (which is just above current levels) would lead to an increase in household food expenditure of around &pound;3 billion. This equates to an increase of 4 per cent. within a total spend of &pound;79 billion, and presumes that all increased energy costs would be passed on to consumers. However, we might expect an increase in household expenditure of between roughly 5 per cent to 10 per cent. if all costs are passed on to consumers and secondary impacts are allowed for.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.8/3">To further help put the impact of increasing fuel costs into context, it can be noted that oil prices more than tripled in the five years to October 2007 to over $80 a barrel, whereas retail food prices increased by 12.6 per cent. over the same period.</p>

	<p pid="d.48W.2/1">Child benefit is awarded to the person with the main responsibility for a child. Parents may choose which of them will receive the payments, and if no agreement is reached, HM Revenue and Customs is responsible for determining entitlement, based on the facts in individual cases. There is no provision for splitting child benefit and child tax credit, although in families with two or more children, parents can agree to each claim in respect of different children.</p>
	<p pid="d.48W.2/2">To meet the Government's child poverty target, it is necessary to focus financial support in a way that enables the parent with main caring responsibilities to provide for the child's needs. The Government will continue to listen to parents and representative groups regarding the best way to support families with children.</p>

	<p pid="d.50W.9/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on employment for local areas from the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="d.50W.9/5" class="indent">The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16 to 64 for men, 16 to 59 for women) and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>

	<p pid="d.53W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on migrant workers in West Chelmsford constituency. (166240)</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on employment for local areas from the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/5" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers comes from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16 - 64 for men, 16 - 59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/6" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important to bear in mind that the annual LFS and APS is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/7" class="indent">The annual LFS and APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/8" class="indent">The table attached, shows the numbers of working age in employment who were not born in the UK and were resident in West Chelmsford, for the twelve month periods ending in February for 2003 and 2004 from the annual LFS, and for the twelve month periods ending in March 2005, March 2006 and December 2006 from the APS (the January to December 2006 APS dataset is the most recent for which information on country of birth is currently available).</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/9" class="indent">The table also shows the numbers of non-UK born persons in employment as percentages of all persons of working age in employment, in the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/10" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. In this case, the sample sizes are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over time.</p>

In total, just over &pound;28 million in arrears has been identified for workers by national minimum wage compliance teams.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.2/2">HMRC are now investigating a range of cases with a view to criminal prosecution. In August 2007 and October 2007 two employers were successfully prosecuted for obstruction and for neglecting to answer any question during minimum wage investigations.</p>

	<p pid="d.58W.5/1">HMRC consider local private and public sector employment statistics including growth or reduction over the last 10 years together with the economic impact of likely staff migration to new locations. These indicators are among a number of factors which were taken into account before the decision was taken to close the HM Revenue and Customs offices in Gilbridge house and Shackleton house, Sunderland but retain others in the area.</p>

	<p pid="d.65W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many people have (a) been diagnosed with and (b) died from throat cancer in (i) Jarrow constituency, (ii) South Tyneside, (iii) the North East and (iv) the UK in each year since 1997. (165401)</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.5/4" class="indent">'Throat cancer' is not a precise medical term. A number of different types of cancer can develop in the throat. Many patients and relatives use the term 'throat cancer' to mean cancer of the larynx (the voice box); or cancer of the thyroid gland (which is at the front of the base of the neck(; or cancer of the oesophagus (the food pipe). We assume that you sought information for one of these cancers.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.5/5" class="indent">The latest available figures for (a) newly diagnosed cases of cancer (incidence) for the United Kingdom are for the year 2004. Numbers of cases of laryngeal, thyroid and oesophageal cancer for the years 1997 to 2004 for (i) Jarrow Parliamentary Constituency, (ii) South Tyneside County District, (iii) North East Government Office Region and (iv) United Kingdom are given in Tables 1-3 below.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.5/6" class="indent">The latest available figures for (b) deaths are for the year 2006. Numbers of deaths from laryngeal, thyroid and oesophageal cancer for the years 1997 to 2006 for (i) Jarrow Parliamentary Constituency, (ii) South Tyneside County District, (iii) North East Government Office Region and (iv) United Kingdom are given in Tables 4-6 below.</p>

Friend, the Secretary of State will hold discussions with the chair of the new National Consumer Council on a wide range of consumer matters including any plans the council may have in relation to problems faced by small businesses in the postal and energy sectors.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.3/2">The Consumers Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 provides the new National Consumer Council with extensive powers to investigate complaints and the definition of &quot;consumer&quot; in the Act is sufficiently wide to incorporate small businesses. However the new National Consumer Council is an independent body and will consult on its priorities and how it intends to address the range of issues affecting consumers in its business plan.</p>

	<p pid="d.122W.5/2">By this date, the regulators had received four applications for Generic Design Assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.122W.5/3">Following assessment of the applications by the Government, all four were found to have met the criteria set down in the consultation document and as a result, the regulators (the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency) agreed to assess all four designs in the initial stage of the generic design assessment process. A press notice setting out the outcome of the Government's assessment of applications was released on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July 2007</phrase>.

	<p pid="d.133W.7/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your questions asking about the criteria used to assess eligibility for crisis loans, the process applicants must go through to prove their eligibility to crisis loans, what steps are being taken to ensure that the appeal process is accessible and easy to use, steps being taken to ensure those living in rural communities can easily access a crisis loan and whether those visiting Jobcentre Plus to access a crisis loan are offered an alternative to a telephone claim. These are things that fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/4" class="indent">The criteria used to assess eligibility for a crisis loan are that the applicant:</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/5" class="indent">has immediate short term needs in an emergency or as a consequence of a disaster;</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/6" class="indent">is 16 or over and has no other means or getting help; and</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/7" class="indent">shows that a crisis loan is the only way that serious damage to their own health or safety or that of their family can be avoided.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/8" class="indent">Applicants must prove their eligibility for a crisis loan by providing a Jobcentre Plus decision maker with sufficient information to determine their application. Our preferred method of taking this information is by telephone where the customer requires a loan for living expenses. However, those customers unable to use the telephone, or where money is being requested to buy an item or service, should submit a written application by post or in person. Irrespective of the method of application, applicants have to provide full details of their circumstances and the effect of the emergency or disaster. They must also give details of their financial situation including other possible sources of help.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/9" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is sensitive to the needs of those customers living in rural communities. Many Jobcentre Plus offices already offer a crisis loan application service by telephone and travel warrants can be provided to those customers who have no money to meet fares incurred in collecting their payment from a Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/10" class="indent">Customers who visit a Jobcentre Plus office are advised about the benefits of the telephone application process, including the availability of the free phone number. If this does not suit the customer, they can make a written crisis loan application.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/11" class="indent">The review process that applies to the discretionary social fund is straightforward and widely publicised in Jobcentre Plus leaflets, application forms and decision letters. To request a review of a decision, applicants need to write to Jobcentre Plus. A review is then conducted which normally involves an interview over the telephone. If after the review decision, they are still dissatisfied with the outcome of their application they can write to the Independent Review Service for a further review.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.7/12" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.134W.2/1">For the last full year for which headcount statistics are held (year ending <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-31">31 December 2006</phrase>), 41,187 (33.9 per cent.) of employees in the Department for Work and Pensions, and its Executive Agencies, worked part-time. Included within that figure are employees taking advantage of the various options available to employees to assist their work/life balance&mdash;term time working, compressed working weeks, job sharing, and home working, in addition to what is normally regarded as part-time working. We do not collect the figures for those who have applied to work part-time.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.2/2">The Department has in place a process which allows parents, adopters, guardians or foster carers of children under six years of age or of disabled children under the age of 18, and for carers of adults, to apply to work flexibly in line with legislation. It additionally accepts requests from any employee with over 26 weeks in the Department who wishes to apply to work a flexible working pattern. Any employee with over 26 weeks in the Department may apply to change working pattern twice a year.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.2/3">Flexible start and finish times are offered by all businesses within the Department, with the details of each scheme being tailored to their business requirements. Employees and their managers are thus able to accommodate informal arrangements where the needs of the Department and the individual can both be accommodated, without the need for recording a formal change to working pattern.</p>

	<p pid="d.145W.6/1">Most Communities and local government funding allocations are decided centrally rather than by Government offices. However Government office for the south-west has had responsibility for administering the &pound;169 million European Social Fund regional programme over the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.6/2">Due to the nature of the funding arrangements it is difficult to disaggregate amounts specifically for Bournemouth, because the funding is allocated on the basis of the boundaries used by Learning and Skills Council and Jobcentre Plus which for this area cover Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset. Some projects operate in just one area, some in all three local authority areas and some are regional. Government office has allocated &pound;13.4 million to projects operating across this area over the period. Of this amount &pound;6.4 million has been allocated directly by GOSW and a further &pound;7 million has been allocated to the area through the Learning and Skills Council and Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.145W.6/3">Specific information on the value of projects in Bournemouth could be provided but would require mapping the detail of individual projects. It would be too costly to obtain information at this level of detail.</p>

This represents a 38 per cent. increase on current spending. The funding will enable us to deliver 70,000 more affordable homes by 2010. We are also committed to providing 45,000 new affordable homes for rent by 2010-11 (a 50 per cent. increase) and 25,000 shared ownership and shared equity homes a year funded by the Housing Corporation. In addition, we will look to support additional shared ownership homes through public sector land and Local Housing Companies.</p>

Regional Housing Assemblies can focus resources where local need is greatest for example by prioritising key worker groups for assistance. We are currently waiting for the Regional Housing Board's recommendations on how investment should be spent over the next three years in the South East.</p>

	<p pid="d.149W.8/1">We do not know of any specific powers that could be used by local authorities to compel landowners to take steps to secure their land in order to prevent it from being used for antisocial and criminal purposes. However, there may be practical advice that local authorities can give to landowners whose land is at risk of being used for such activities. In addition, local authorities have powers under section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 to bring legal proceedings on behalf of local communities. Authorities may wish to seek advice from their lawyers as to whether there is any right of action in relation to unsecured land. It should be noted that proceedings under section 222 can be used to take out injunctions against antisocial behaviour and where an injunction is granted, the court may, under section 91 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, attach a power of arrest to such injunctions.</p>

	<p pid="d.153W.5/1">DFID recently funded a study by the Peace Dividend Trust entitled 'Afghanistan Compact Procurement Monitoring Project', the purpose of which was to measure the impact of international assistance to Afghanistan. It found that aid spent through the Government of Afghanistan's systems was four times more effective than funds spent through international companies or NGOs.

	<p pid="d.154W.9/1">DFID recognises that unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death and ill-health and believes that no woman should die or suffer as a result of unsafe abortion. A woman should have access to services and care that are safe, humane, accessible and respectful of her decision. She should also be able to access services for safely and effectively managing the complications arising from induced or spontaneous abortion. Lowering abortion related maternal deaths is a key way to reduce maternal mortality (Millennium Development Goal 5) given that nearly all deaths from unsafe abortion are preventable.</p>

	<p pid="d.155W.2/2">According to the European Commission all 18 countries will benefit from the transitional assistance for sugar, although the amount allocated to each country will vary. The amount allocated to each country is based on two criteria; the impact of the sugar reform on the sugar sector of the country concerned and the importance of the sugar sector to the economy. The countries were required to draw up a national sugar adaptation strategy to show how they will spend their allocation.</p>

	<p pid="d.155W.5/1">DFID has commissioned a number of independent studies looking at the impact of the reform of the European Union (EU) sugar market on the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries that export sugar to the EU. The studies show that the impact of the sugar reform will not fall uniformly on the sugar protocol countries. Some countries will benefit with the opportunity to increase the volume of their sugar export to the EU market under the duty free and quota free market access offer. In other countries sugar may not continue to be an economic industry. Indeed some ACP countries have already taken that decision and are withdrawing from sugar production. We have always been clear that such countries will require transitional assistance. It is not possible to estimate the size of the impact on the individual ACP countries. This will depend on other decisions that they make in response to the reform.</p>

	<p pid="d.156W.5/1">DFID is very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and among refugees in the wider region. Many Iraqis are denied adequate protection and access to basic services. There is a lack of reliable information about the situation. However, the UN estimates that over two million people are internally displaced, with a further two million displaced across the region, 80 per cent. of whom are in Syria and Jordan. UNHCR is investigating reports of increased refugee returns from Syria, and the reasons behind such returns. We await the outcome of this work.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.5/2">DFID is supporting the delivery of emergency relief and protection through contributions to internationally mandated humanitarian agencies.

In recent years, many of the fastest growing countries, in east Asia particularly, have opened up their borders to international trade. EPAs can increase access for developing country exports into European Union (EU) markets, which is one of their largest export markets. EPAs should also increase trading opportunities and collaboration with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) regions themselves and promote integration into the global economy.</p>

	<p pid="d.161W.2/1">I understand that you have already received a reply from the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Communities and Local Government on this question as the lead on cohesion matters. That reply sets out that the cross-government working group did not meet on the 15, but the meeting that took place was between the Parliamentary Under Secretary, his officials and representatives from key Jewish organizations. My officials did not participate in that meeting.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.2/2">I can assure you that my Department deplores any acts of racial or religious intolerance in higher education. We are committed to tackling any form of anti-Semitism and racial intolerance in general.

	<p pid="d.163W.2/2">The Burgess Group's final report on proposals for national credit arrangements was published in December 2006 and the Group's final report on measuring and recording student achievement was published in October 2007. The Burgess Group was an HE sector group and the recommendations are for implementation by the HE sector. Work on the credit recommendations is being taken forward by a sector-led Credit Issues Development Group. Universities UK and Guild HE are currently considering their response to the report on measuring and recording student achievement.</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.2/3">On recording achievement, I welcome the proposal to develop a Higher Education Achievement Report, to help present a more complete picture of a graduate's skills and knowledge than is captured solely in the overall degree classification. However, I believe progress can best be made by building on the current system, and certainly not by replacing degree classifications. The HE sector will need to consider carefully the best way to provide the additional information, while maintaining stability in the system.</p>

	<p pid="d.164W.10/1">In October, John Denham announced an ambitious listening programme which will put the voices of England's 2.3 million university students at the heart of Government. This new approach will ensure students are able to make their views and ideas heard through a range of mechanisms with Ministers responding to specific issues raised.</p>
	<p pid="d.164W.10/2">The student juries being run between now and Christmas are one element of the student listening programme. Costs for the five student juries, to be held in November and December 2007, have been budgeted at &pound;20,000 in total (excluding VAT). We will also pay participants' reasonable expenses.</p>

These will vary according to the course the student is undertaking, and whether or not the student is on a work placement or is attending another university. Higher education institutions participating in the European Commission's Erasmus scheme must have the Erasmus university charter, a document outlining an institution's responsibilities under Erasmus. The British Council, who manage Erasmus in the UK, issue an operational handbook outlining the rules higher education institutions need to abide by.</p>

The precise date on which we reach these targets will depend on the outcome of future spending reviews and on continuing to increase demand for higher education among people of all ages and backgrounds who would benefit from entering higher education.

	<p pid="d.168W.6/1">Older people are a hugely valued part of our society, contributing more and more in later life. Almost 8 million people over 50 work and age legislation means that age need no longer be a barrier to working, training or promotion. Our economic success is increasingly dependent on our older work force being as skilled and as productive as younger workers, but too many older workers do not have the basic literacy, numeracy and work place skills they need to succeed, and too few are engaging in education and training to change that.</p>
	<p pid="d.168W.6/2">Our strategy for World Class Skills sets bold targets and our reforms include supporting individuals, including older workers, into sustainable employment and progression in work and in skills. We are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all learners. Our targets cover workers and learners of all ages and our reforms balance skills and economic prosperity with fairness and inclusion. We will give greater ownership and choice to individuals over their training through skills accounts backed up by a new universal adult careers service that will provide free skills health checks for people of any age at key stages in working life.</p>
	<p pid="d.168W.6/3">We are also working with employers through Train to Gain and the Skills Pledge to meet skill needs and to ensure that all employees including older people have the basic skills, including literacy and numeracy and Level 2 skills (equivalent to five good GCSEs) needed to sustain and progress in employment. We are increasing funding for Train to Gain from &pound;440 million in 2007/08 to over &pound;900 million in 2010/11. We want to encourage all employers in England to make a Skills Pledge that is a specific promise that every eligible employee will be helped to gain basic skills and a full Level 2 qualification.</p>

	<p pid="d.169W.2/3">The Government make a contribution of &pound;3 million each year to the Union Learning Fund to help develop a focus on Skills for Life within Union Learning Fund projects and to help give Union Learning Representatives (ULRs) the skills to support literacy language and numeracy learners.</p>
	<p pid="d.169W.2/4">Our efforts to improve skills in the work force will be much more effective if they are delivered with the joint support of employers, learners and those, like trade unions, who can support learning. Through the Skills Pledge, we are encouraging employers to commit to addressing the skills needs of their employees and in particular, people with poor basic skills and without a full Level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="d.169W.2/5">We have a number of initiatives in place to encourage employers to address Skills for Life needs and to sign the Skills Pledge. In each case, we have encouraged partners to work with the TUC/Unionlearn to maximise the effectiveness of addressing skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.169W.2/6">We have been working with Business in the Community (BITC) to engage large, high profile employers since 2003. BITC have recruited over 30 senior business leaders as Employer Champions for Skills for Life and have worked with over 150 major companies including, DHL, SERCO and VT Shipbuilding.</p>
	<p pid="d.169W.2/7">Since 2004, BITC have run an annual Skills for Life Award recognising best practice in delivering Skills for Life programmes. Each of the award winners, and many of the runner up entrants, has delivered programmes in their organisation in partnership with relevant trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="d.169W.2/8">We are working with the Skills for Business network through Asset Skills as the lead Sector Skills Council on Skills for Life. Sector Skills Councils have a role in raising awareness of literacy, language and numeracy skills among the employers they represent, in supporting them in addressing needs within their footprint and in ensuring that qualifications reflect the literacy, language and numeracy requirements of their sectors. Asset skills has recently signed a joint agreement with unionlearn to support joint activity on Skills for Life.</p>
	<p pid="d.169W.2/9">Working with the Cabinet Office and Government Skills SSC, we want to raise basic skills levels across central Government and to influence the public sector more widely. Cabinet Office consults with the relevant unions on the approach to staff development across central Government and there are a number of examples where PCS has worked closely with central Government Departments on Skills for Life&mdash;for example with the Department for Work and Pensions and Inland Revenue.</p>

	<p pid="d.170W.2/2">In recent years, with the help of the Union Learning Fund (ULF), trade unions and their Union Learning Representatives have been really successful in working with employers to raise skill levels in the workplace. There are now over 18,000 trained Union Learning reps who have helped over 400,000 workers back into learning since ULF was introduced in 1988. Over 150,000 last year alone, many of whom were Skills for Life learners, those most in need of new skills who employers and training providers find it so difficult to reach.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.2/3">An evaluation of the Union Learning Fund (2001-05) which surveyed a range of employers involved in ULF, showed that almost two-thirds of those employers who responded had a learning agreement in place as a result of ULF and 75 per cent. reported an increase in Skills for Life learning.</p>

More than 70 per cent. of the employers engaged by skills brokers are classified as hard to reach (not IiP accredited and no recorded investment at a publicly funded training provider).

	<p pid="d.172W.3/1">The Skills Pledge is a voluntary public commitment by the leadership of a company or organisation to support all its employees to develop their basic skills including literacy and numeracy, and work towards relevant valuable qualifications to at least level 2 (equivalent to five good GCSEs). If companies or organisations want to go beyond this and extend the commitment to help staff gain wider skills and additional qualifications as well that is welcome. The Skills Pledge is open to all employers in England.</p>
	<p pid="d.172W.3/2">As at November 2007, the available information indicated that there were six companies or organisations in Oxfordshire which have signed the Skills Pledge. We do not collect separate information on companies or organisations.</p>

We do not collect information on travel to work areas. In the first year of its operation, there were a total of 853 learners funded through Train to Gain in the wards of Banbury and Oxford.

	<p pid="d.176W.6/1">The Home Office is responsible for the policy on antisocial behaviour. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 introduced special measures for witnesses in proceedings for antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs). These measures were introduced to address concerns about the protection of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The measures include screening witnesses from the defendants, giving evidence through video link or in private, and the use of video recorded evidence. This makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in the Crown and magistrates court during an ASBO hearing. Special dedicated antisocial behaviour response courts have been established in magistrates courts sitting in their civil capacity to ensure that witness issues are addressed. Local agencies have also developed efficient case management systems which includes working in partnership with key agencies to provide support to victims after court proceedings. In addition the Home Office has issued a good practice guide to practitioners on how best to support victims and witnesses of antisocial behaviour through the whole length of the witness pathway. A range of detailed guidance is set out on our website at:</p>

The Local Government User Satisfaction Survey (LGUSS) shows that the vast majority of local authorities in the West Midlands have seen a significant reduction in the levels of perception of antisocial behaviour in 2006-07 compared with 2003-04.

	<p pid="d.185W.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-30">30 August 2007</phrase>, the Home Office published Planning for a possible Influenza Pandemic&mdash;A framework for planners preparing to manage deaths, for consultation. This draft document provides guidance to local authority planners faced with the task of managing excess fatalities in the event of pandemic influenza. It was produced by the Home Office in consultation with a working group representing all the Departments involved in this task together with the Local Government Association, the Faith Communities Consultative Council and representatives of the funeral industry. Representatives of the devolved Administrations also attend the working group.</p>
	<p pid="d.185W.9/2">After the close of the consultation period on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November 2007</phrase>, we will consider the views of respondents and the need for any revisions to the document. The Departments with responsibility for processes such as medical certification of the cause of death; and burial and cremation certification will issue guidelines to their operational counterparts in light of the consultation. We will ensure that local authorities are informed of any changes and make revisions to the publication during the first quarter of 2008. It is not proposed that additional resources for managing excess deaths will be made available to local authorities during an influenza pandemic.</p>

	<p pid="d.186W.5/1">The Police National Missing Persons Bureau (PNMPB) currently use a Metropolitan Police Service system called Merlin to record and search records of missing persons. They also have access to PNC (Police National Computer) to carry out checks on missing/wanted persons and utilise open source facilities such as the internet and electoral roll for various searches. The PNMPB has responsibility for the UKMissingkids.com website and, therefore, has the requisite software to host this site.</p>

From this time, accessibility to technology and resources will be significantly enhanced. The NPIA is implementing Hermes as the database for the PNMPB. Hermes is a purpose built database developed and implemented in to the Missing People Charity through the Invest to Save Initiative in 2004-05. The shared technology between the bureau and the charity will facilitate effective transfer of data between the two organisations and collaborative efforts on research and analysis projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.186W.5/3">The PNMPB, under the NPIA, will also have access to, and be able to search, the PNC. In addition, the bureau will be able to triangulate reports of missing persons with serious offences and the activities of sexual and dangerous offenders by having direct access to ViSOR (Violent and Sex Offender Register), INI (IMPACT Nominal Index) and SCAS (Serious Crime Analysis Section) data. They will also be able to access the child homicide database CATCHEM (Central Analytical Team Collating Homicide Expertise and Management), the National Injuries Database, and liaise with the National DNA Database custodian&mdash;the NPIA.</p>

	<p pid="d.189W.2/2">Police forces, where such a Neighbourhood Policing team is fully in place, will aim to provide the names of individual neighbourhood policing team members together with their team contact details through written updates to the local community (such as local policing summaries) and individual police force websites. Police forces are also currently looking at other ways of conveying this information to the general public through a range of publicity material.</p>

The deployment of laser by specially trained police units who are not firearms officers, but who are facing similar threats of violence, is also being trialled in 10 police forces. The 12 month trial began on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.210W.5/2">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, discussed international co-ordination of reconstruction and development assistance with president Karzai during his visit to the UK in October. They discussed the Afghan National Development strategy (ANDS), due to be published in March 2008, and agreed that this strategy will encourage greater donor co-ordination. In addition, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development also discussed this issue with president Karzai and other representatives of the Government of Afghanistan during their visits to Afghanistan earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.210W.5/3">It is critical for Afghanistan's future development that the donor community co-ordinates its assistance in support of Afghan Government priorities. Co-ordination of international assistance and improved effectiveness of aid is a major objective of DFID's policy support to Afghanistan. This is why DFID Ministers and officials are regularly engaged in dialogue with the Government of Afghanistan on the development of the ANDS and the most appropriate way for the international community to support it. In recent weeks both the Afghan Minister of Education and the Deputy Minister of Finance have visited DFID and discussed this issue along with others.</p>

The October GAERC made clear the EU stood ready to review, amend or reinforce these measures and requested relevant bodies to elaborate further restrictive measures.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.2/2">The regulation which will follow the adoption of the Common Position will address a number of points related to the implementation of the sanctions, including direct and indirect sales of precious and semi-precious stones from Burma. This will be negotiated in the coming weeks. The UK will press for the strictest possible implementation of the agreed sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="d.220W.8/1">The political establishment in Iran is preparing for the next Majlis (parliamentary) elections on <phrase class="date" code="">14 March 2008</phrase>. Candidates will need to register by early January, and they will be vetted by the Guardian Council (who can veto candidates it considers contrary to the interests of the Islamic Republic) six to seven weeks before the election date. In the last round of parliamentary elections, the Guardian Council vetoed the candidacies of more than a third of the 8,000 candidates, most of whom were reformists, and 85 of who were incumbent MPs. We are concerned that this may happen again&mdash;the Guardian Council has appointed hardliners to the election monitoring panel and reformists appear to be being discouraged from standing.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.8/2">A key issue in the election is likely to be the economy, especially inflation, where estimates range from the official Iranian figures of around 12 per cent. to independent Iranian estimates of almost twice that. Within this, housing, foodstuffs and medicines have all been subject to above average price growth, making life harder for ordinary Iranians. Iran's increased isolation, and the possibility of further multilateral sanctions as a result of Iran's refusal to abide by its obligations on its nuclear programme, are also having an impact on international investment in and trade with Iran.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.8/3">We are concerned by the continued clampdown on internal opposition, which has been going on for several months but appears to be intensifying in the run up to the election campaign&mdash;including, most recently, the arrests of three women affiliated with the Campaign For Equality, which is seeking to end legislation which discriminates against women.

	<p pid="d.234W.5/1">We are informed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) that it produced the guidance for inspectors in June 2006. It is also available to service providers on the CSCI professionals website at:</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.csci.org.uk/professional/default.asp">www.csci.org.uk/professional/default.asp</a>x?page=7346&amp;key.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.5/3">The guidance was developed in collaboration with a dietician. It reflects best practice as advised by nutritional groups and includes the need for services to carry out nutritional screening on admission and on a periodic basis for those people at risk of malnutrition.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.5/4">CSCI inspects providers against national minimum standards (NMS), published by the Secretary of State under section 23(1) of the Care Standards Act 2000. These include:</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.5/5" class="indent">Standard 8&mdash;Healthcare, of which Standard 8.9 relates to nutritional care&mdash;&quot;nutritional screening is undertaken on admission and subsequently on a periodic basis, a record maintained of nutrition, including weight gain or loss, and appropriate action taken.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.5/6" class="indent">Standard 15&mdash;Meals and Mealtimes, includes a range of guidance to ensure that services provide people with a wholesome appealing balanced diet, at a time and place to suit the individual and that assistance when eating is offered as required.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.5/7">The &quot;State of Social Care&quot; report, published by CSCI in December 2006, indicates the level of achievement of the NMS by services for adults and older people since 2002-03 up to 2005-06. Copies of the report are available in the Library. Levels of achievement were given as percentages of services for younger adults and older people meeting or exceeding individual standards. These percentages are shown in the table, together with the most recent figures for the 2006-07 inspection year.</p>

	<p pid="d.234W.5/27">CSCI participated as a stakeholder, in collaboration with the Department of Health, in the development of the Nutrition Action Plan. As a stakeholder, CSCI has made a commitment that it will use the Annual Quality Assurance Assessment (AQAA) to ask all providers to confirm that they carry out nutritional screening for people at risk of malnutrition. Where evidence raises concern about nutrition and malnutrition, CSCI will ensure that this is fully explored during the next inspection of the service and will track through the AQAA, the assessment of individual person centred plans to make sure that where required, nutritional screening has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.5/28">CSCI will be meeting with Skills for Care on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November 2007</phrase> to discuss the competences required by inspectors on nutritional care. The outputs from this work will inform training requirements, which will be delivered to inspectors within CSCI's overall training programme.</p>

A record is only included once in each count, even if a procedure is mentioned in more than one operative procedure field of the record.

	<p pid="d.241W.8/1">The Department is committed to tackling gender inequalities within the health and social care sector by recognising the specific health needs of men and women. There has been increased awareness amongst healthcare professionals of the correlation between gender and health and its impact on access, quality of health care and medical treatment for men and women. The Department's commitment to create a patient-centred service which extends choice and is responsive to all patients and users, especially with regards to the gender perspective will ensure that any gender differences in treatment and access are eliminated.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.8/2">The Department commissioned the Men's Health Forum to work with five primary care trusts (PCTs) to develop a tool to assist PCTs in providing gender sensitive services. PCTs will be able to identify where changes can be made and how to approach the implementation of the gender duty. The results of this project&mdash;the &quot;Gender Equity Audit&quot; report was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-06">6 November 2006</phrase> at the Men's Health Forum Conference&mdash;Putting Gender on the NHS Agenda: Implementing the Gender Equality Duty in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.8/3">Research is currently being undertaken by the Department, on the different way men and women access health services and what difference this has on health outcomes. It is intended that the outcomes of this research will provide the evidence base to identify actions to take in tackling gender health inequalities. The research will target a range of national health service organisations, including PCTs, and will take account of overlapping inequality issues such as age, ethnicity, sexual orientation.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.8/4">The Department has produced and disseminated guidance for the NHS by developing &quot;Creating a Gender Equality Scheme: A practical guide for the NHS&quot; and &quot;10 Steps to Developing Your Single Equality Schemes&quot; web guidance. A series of regional and national events recently disseminated guidance on developing Single Equality Schemes that incorporate the requirements of the gender equality duty. A further series of local events are currently under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.8/5">The Department's Equality and Human Rights Group has established the Gender Equality Advisory Group to bring together key stakeholders in developing and prioritising gender actions which will inform the prioritisation of departmental policy and initiatives to provide ongoing support for the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="d.259W.0/2"><i> </i>It is for primary care trusts to monitor medicines use review service provision by community pharmacies and adjust individual community pharmacy remuneration according to that service provision. Therefore there are no plans to change the role of the Prescription Pricing Division (PPD) of the Business Services Authority.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.0/3">During the financial year April 2005 to March 2006, 25 pharmacies exceeded the limit of 250 on payments for medicines use reviews (MURs). In the financial year April 2006 to March 2007, 126 pharmacies exceeded the limit of 400. These figures do not take account of the pharmacies to whom the lower limit of 200 applied because they started providing the service mid year. In 2005-06 and 2006-07, the average number of MURs per pharmacy was 39 and 96 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.0/4">In the financial year 2005-06, excess payments to those pharmacies who exceeded the limit was &pound;42,218 (1,966 claims) and in the year 2006-07, the excess payment was &pound;67,650 (2,706 claims). These figures do not reflect any recovery of excess payments made by primary care trusts (PCTs) nor does it take account of the pharmacies to whom the lower limit of 200 applied because they started providing the service mid year. This is a matter for PCTs as they can locally commission and fund additional MURs above the national threshold.</p>

	<p pid="d.260W.8/3">By December 2008, national health service patients can expect a maximum wait of 18 weeks from general practitioner referral to the start of consultant-led treatment. Most patients will be treated much quicker than that, allowing them to return to work much more quickly where appropriate. Latest figures for patients who started their treatment in August 2007 show that seven out of 10 patients are already being treated in 18 weeks or less.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.8/4">The introduction of patient choice is increasing patients' ability to choose a provider that can treat them rapidly. The Hospital Travel Costs Scheme, part of the NHS Low Income Scheme, ensures that no one is denied access to the hospital of their choice because they cannot afford the cost of travel.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.8/5">Finally, practice-based commissioners have flexibility to use their resources to achieve longer-term budget savings and better patient outcomes by commissioning social care or preventative interventions. Such interventions could be focused on helping people to return to work.</p>

The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br/>  2. General practitioner (GP) practice staff (excluding practice nurses) includes direct patient care, administrative and clerical and other staff paid by GP practices, which are contracted by the PCT.<br/>  3.

	<p pid="d.266W.2/1">The safety of children and young people, including their protection from sex offenders, is a top priority. The Department for Children, Schools and Families is working with the Home Office and the Department of Health to introduce the toughest ever vetting and barring system, under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, for all those working with, or seeking to work with, children and vulnerable adults. This will incorporate a robust, independent and expert barring process and will provide a modern and improved vetting service for employers, including parents. Pending the implementation of this new vetting and barring service, we have strengthened existing arrangements in a number of ways. We have extended the range of offences which will result in automatic inclusion on List 99 to include cautions as well as convictions for sexual offences against children. We have strengthened and clarified the requirements for safe recruitment in schools and further education colleges and required better record keeping on recruitment checks from these institutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.266W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June 2007</phrase>, the Home Office published the Review of the Protection of Children from Sex Offenders.

	<p pid="d.271W.2/2">This year the Learning and Skills Council is introducing a &pound;5 million package of measures across London to ensure that Londoners are motivated into work or training and able to compete for London 2012 opportunities and good jobs beyond 2012. This package will improve skills and training opportunities for Londoners in four key sectors related to the London 2012 Olympic games and Paralympic games: sport, customer service, audio-visual and construction. Demand for skilled workers in these four sectors is forecast to increase in the run-up to 2012 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="d.271W.2/3">Specific measures include advanced apprenticeships in sporting excellence and apprenticeships in sports and leisure; bursaries towards UK coaching certificates; training for people on incapacity and health benefit to enable them to become construction trade A1 assessors; preparing local residents for construction apprenticeships at Kings Cross station; delivering new apprenticeships in customer service/ hospitality; co-funding the research and development of a new customer service 'gold standard' to raise the bar of customer services in London for the games; and increasing the number and quality of work-based learning programmes on offer in the audio-visual industry. Additionally, the LSC has invested in the LDA-led personal best programme, graduates of which will have the opportunity to be interviewed for the London 2012 volunteering programme; and has entered into a training partnership with the Olympic delivery authority, construction skills and the London Development Agency with the objective of ensuring National Skills Academy for Construction status for the whole Olympic site.</p>

	<p pid="d.271W.5/1">The Department focuses on reducing all unnecessary absences from schools, not just those which are unauthorised. Overall absence rates have been substantially lower than the 1996-97 rate of 7.23 per cent. in all but two of the last nine years for which full data are available. Partial data for 2006-07, which we placed in the Library of the House in October 2007, indicate that the downward tend is continuing.</p>
	<p pid="d.271W.5/2">There is no direct measure of truancy. Unauthorised absence is often used as a proxy for truancy, but it is an imperfect measure because it also includes lateness and some term time holidays. It is also well known that unauthorised absence tends to rise when schools take a tougher line on absence generally, as it has done in recent years, without necessarily reflecting any underlying increase in truancy. That is why my Department has moved away from focusing narrowly on rates of unauthorised absence.</p>
	<p pid="d.271W.5/3">We now know that a small minority of pupils account for large proportions of absence: in secondary schools, just 7 per cent. of pupils account for 62 per cent. of unauthorised absences and 32 per cent. of all absences. That is why we are now focusing our efforts on reducing persistent absence, which includes truancy, in schools where this problem is most acute. This is proving highly effective. Last year, our targeted challenge and support in 436 secondary schools helped to reduce the number of persistent absentees in those schools by over 20 per cent. We are continuing that focus on reducing persistent absence across all local authorities and their schools.</p>
