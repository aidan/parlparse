	<p pid="a.444W.5/1">Direct services between London and Lowestoft ceased operation in December 2010. This was part of a wider package of service changes which provided more seats across the Anglia network as a whole. The analysis carried out by the Department for Transport focused on the financial impact across the whole franchise. It did not carry out a specific analysis of the impact on Lowestoft.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/2">The Department for Transport does not intend to include a specific provision about through services between Lowestoft and London in the new long-term Greater Anglia franchise. Bidders will, however, be encouraged to develop timetable proposals which maximise the value of the franchise and the benefit for passengers. It is possible that these might include new journey opportunities should there be a case for doing so.</p>

	<p pid="a.450W.0/1">The primary purposes of the Royal Navy's deployment to the Caribbean (Atlantic Patrol Task (North)) are the promotion of UK interests in the region and the provision of security to UK Overseas Territories, including support to humanitarian operations and disaster relief. Counter-narcotic activities are carried out as operational commitments and resources allow and we will continue to provide this capability through the use of a Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) vessel enhanced with an additional naval party, a helicopter and law enforcement detachment.</p>

	<p pid="a.450W.3/1">The decision not to send a destroyer or frigate to the Caribbean region during 2011 was taken on the basis of available capability and not as a savings measure. The ship that had been identified for this task will be redeployed elsewhere and will, therefore, continue to incur operational costs. The financial implications are still being assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.3/2">For 2011, it is assessed that a destroyer or frigate is not required for the Atlantic Patrol Task (North) and that a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship, enhanced with a naval party, law enforcement detachment and helicopter during the core hurricane season, has the necessary capabilities to provide support to UK Overseas Territories in the Caribbean region. This will provide a permanent presence, able to respond to the full range of foreseeable contingencies, including disaster relief, and to contribute to counter narcotics where spare capacity allows. I am confident that this will enable the UK to meet its commitment to the region and, as such, no discussions with representatives of Caribbean nations are planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.3/3">We expect that the Royal Navy will continue to meet commitments in priority regions such as the north and south Atlantic, the Indian ocean, as well as in home waters. Maritime commitments are regularly reviewed and adjusted where necessary to reflect changing requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.462W.2/1">In the Welfare Reform Bill we will be introducing a claimant commitment, which will set out the responsibilities of benefit recipients, alongside a clear and robust set of sanctions. Claimants will therefore know what they are expected to do and the consequences of failing to meet those expectations. These changes will be introduced under the current benefit system and will continue to apply under universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/2">The proposed model of sanctions could lead to longer sanctions for some claimants, particularly claimants who have repeatedly failed to meet their responsibilities. For other claimants-those who fail to meet lower level requirements-sanctions could be shorter depending on how quickly they re-engage.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/3">The overall effect on benefit costs will depend on the response of claimants to the proposed sanctions system. If-as is hoped-claimants are encouraged to comply in the first place and re-engage more quickly where they do fail to meet their responsibilities, there are unlikely to be any savings in comparison with the current system as a result of more sanctions being imposed. However, there could be savings from people moving off benefit more quickly as a result of greater compliance with the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/4">This sort of behavioural response is difficult to predict with certainty. And at this stage it is not possible to quantify the impact of the behavioural impact of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.462W.2/5">Overall, we have estimated that universal credit will have a substantial positive impact on poverty and could lift as many as 350,000 children out of relative income poverty. This is a combined impact of all measurable universal credit factors, and does not identify the impact of the sanctions regime. This will help to meet the four 2020 income poverty targets in the Child Poverty Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.3/2">The completion and formal adoption of the airport noise action plans are the final elements that DEFRA needs to complete in order to fulfil completely its obligations under this phase of the implementation of the Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END). DEFRA officials have been working closely with their counterparts in the Department for Transport in reviewing the draft plans submitted by the airports. A number of final draft plans have now been received, and I anticipate that I will be in a position to adopt the first tranche of airport noise action plans in March. Following this, DEFRA officials expect that work on the other airport plans will be completed by early summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.6/2">The Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) required member states to submit summaries of all the adopted airport noise actions plans to the European Commission by January 2009. Given the possible risk of infraction, DEFRA officials have ensured that the Commission has been kept regularly informed of progress and of the timetable for completion of the process. The Commission has recognised that its timetable was very tight and, thus, the reasons for the delay. It is understood that some member states have yet to report any information on action plans. Furthermore, the devolved Administrations have completed their action plan reporting, and England has already reported summaries of the action plans for its agglomerations, major roads and major railways. As a result, our current assessment is that the risk of infraction proceedings is minimal. DEFRA is planning to report to the Commission in the early summer, following the adoption of the action plans for the 17 English airports.</p>

	<p pid="a.467W.8/1">Restrictions on the number of 'days at sea' fishermen may catch fish are in place under a number of management plans within EU waters. UK vessels are affected by restrictions in place for certain gear types in the western English Channel (ICES sub-area VIIe) under the multi-annual management plan for Western Channel sole; in the North Sea (ICES area IV) under the multi-annual plan for plaice and sole, and; in the North Sea (ICES area IV) and Eastern English Channel (ICES sub-area VIId), Irish Sea (ICES sub-area VIIa) and West of Scotland (ICES sub-areas VIa and Vb) under the long-term management plan for cod.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.8/2">Under each of these management plans, the number of days that may be spent at sea are revised annually according to the details of the management plan and linked to the state of the stocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.8/3">For the Western Channel, the number of days member states may allocate to individual vessels are detailed within the annual fishing opportunities regulation. The Government successfully argued that there should be no further cut to the number of days in 2011 as the conditions of the management plan, to reduce fishing mortality to the maximum sustainable yield level, have been met. For all other areas, there is a reduction in fishing effort required in line with provisions of the management plan. The Government are working with fishermen's representatives and other interested parties to implement these reductions in a way that provides sufficient time at sea for vessels to catch their quota, including additional time for more sustainable fishing activity, while ensuring that the UK remains within its EU limits.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.2/1">The impact of hydraulic fracturing on the water environment in England and Wales would be assessed on a site specific basis by the Environment Agency. This would happen via its role as a statutory consultee in the planning process, or as part of its consideration of the need for, and response to, an application for an environmental permit (under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010).

	<p pid="a.470W.2/1">The aim of the New Homes Bonus is to provide a powerful, simple, transparent and permanent means of incentivising local authorities to increase their housing supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.470W.2/2">The spending review has secured almost &#163;1 billion of funding to support the New Homes Bonus over the four year spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.470W.2/3">The consultation stage impact assessment published alongside the scheme consultation makes an estimate of the potential supply impact, but the relative financial position of an authority compared to others will depend on the final scheme design and the behavioural response of local authorities and their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.470W.2/4">We are giving communities and neighbourhoods new rights, powers and tools that they could use to drive forward local regeneration and growth, enhancing their ability to benefit from the New Homes Bonus. We are also giving local communities and councils greater control over what happens locally, and greater ability to secure and channel public resources, and to attract private and social investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.470W.2/5">The distribution and behavioural response of local authorities will largely determine the geographical spread but our analysis suggests a potential increase of 8-13% nationally. This represents a total of approximately 144,000 additional homes built over the initial 10 years. The impact assessment also provides an illustration of the impact by demand and attitude to growth. This can be found at</p>

	<p pid="a.470W.2/7">To disclose the retrospective modelling would be inappropriate. The modelling was done on the basis of retrospective housing supply data which cannot take account of future policy changes. In addition the Government have not yet made an announcement on the final scheme design. This will be made shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.470W.2/8">We have however, published a calculator alongside the consultation document where individual local authorities are given an indicative allocation for year 1 and can estimate future years funding from the New Homes Bonus scheme. This can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.470W.2/10">Under the consultation proposals we are also incentivising local authorities to bring empty homes back into use. This also means the authorities demolishing homes classified as long-term empty homes would not be penalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.472W.2/2"><i> </i>The matter raised is an operational one for the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which is accountable to Parliament rather than Ministers. Accordingly, my officials spoke to Ofcom, who advised that the &#163;2.7 million referred to was not spent on one consultancy, rather it was the total sum spent across 2009-10 on work provided by 31 different suppliers providing a range of services to Ofcom including research and specialist technical expertise on a range of projects as part of Ofcom's overall annual programme of work. The table sets out the suppliers used and total sums paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.2/3">According to Ofcom, information provided as part of its tendering process is commercially sensitive. Ofcom was therefore unable to provide a more detailed breakdown of the number of hours worked, staff provided and hour rate by each supplier since disclosure of this may compromise future tendering processes. A breakdown of the figure in question is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.474W.3/1">The White Paper 'Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS' describes the Government's vision to create a more autonomous and accountable national health service. Within this new commissioning architecture, responsibility for most commissioning is devolved to local general practitioner (GP) commissioning consortia, supported and held to account by an independent NHS Commissioning Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.3/2">'Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer', published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, discusses how commissioners can be supported to commission cancer services, including bowel cancer services, in the reformed national health service. A significant amount of cancer care is best commissioned for populations covering one and a half to two million and, where population size requirements mean that a single GP consortium is too small to commission a particular service, then GP consortia will wish to work collaboratively. GP consortia will be able to decide whether they wish to identify a lead consortium for commissioning more specialised cancer services or to do so through commissioning support organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.3/3">In addition, health and well-being boards in every upper-tier local authority will provide a mechanism for bringing together local NHS, public health and social care commissioners. This could provide a forum for the development of cross-cutting commissioning approaches to improve cancer services.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.3/4">The Department and the National Cancer Action Team have previously provided commissioners with a range of commissioning guidance and support, such as the Cancer Commissioning Toolkit and the Cancer Commissioning Guidance. Going forward, this guidance will be developed to reflect what works best in supporting pathfinder GP consortia. In 2011, we will also develop a cancer commissioning support pack to enable commissioners to access in one place the key information they will need to discharge their functions effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.3/5">Our strategy also makes clear the vital role that GPs have to play in achieving early diagnosis of cancer and it is therefore important they receive the necessary support to do this. We are providing &#163;450 million over the next four years that will give GPs direct access to a range of diagnostic tests to confirm or rule out cancer; support GPs to diagnose cancer; and fund the associated cancer treatments in secondary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.3/6">There is already information available for GPs about referral of patients with possible cancer symptoms, but we are looking at more ways to support GPs. Specifically on bowel cancer, we have commissioned Bowel Cancer UK to provide resource packs for all GPs in the two regions that are involved in campaigns to encourage earlier presentation of people with bowel cancer symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.3/7">Successful delivery of public health services will require strong links between Public Health England and the NHS. Joint working will be essential in supporting the collection and provision of the information needed to inform future commissioning and to enable specific public health services to be commissioned through, and delivered by, the NHS. This will require sharing of expertise and knowledge across the two services.</p>

This model also provides opportunities to further integrate provision of sexually transmitted infections and contraception services.</p>

	<p pid="a.481W.0/2">Following a public consultation, we have introduced measures to deliver this reform through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill. The measures include; making it easier for communities to have their say on local licensing by allowing local authorities to consider the views of the wider community, not just those living close to premises; charging a fee for late-night licences so that premises open late at night contribute towards the cost of policing and local authority services, and substantially overhauling the system for temporary event notices (TENs), so that existing loopholes can no longer be exploited by unscrupulous operators, while ensuring the process is not bureaucratic for small voluntary and community groups.</p>

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advises consumers to always use a Gas Safe registered engineer for all gas work in their home and to ensure that any gas appliances are regularly serviced and maintained. HSE also strongly recommends the use of audible carbon monoxide alarms, but emphasises that they should not be used as a substitute for the correct installation or maintenance of an appliance. The Department for Communities and Local Government also require the installation of a carbon monoxide alarm when a new or replacement solid fuel appliance is installed under the obligations set out in the Building Regulations</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.3/3">HSE and Gas Safe Register, the statutory registration scheme for gas engineers, also work to raise consumer awareness of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning and the benefits of carbon monoxide alarms, through awareness raising promotions and media campaigns.</p>

We have been considering how best to take forward this commitment and believe that it should be done in the context of a wider strategic approach to strengthening and streamlining consumer protections and advocacy. This issue is therefore being addressed as part of our Consumer Credit and Personal Insolvency Review.</p>
