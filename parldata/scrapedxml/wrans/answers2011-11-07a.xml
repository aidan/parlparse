If the drilling operations were to change the Environment Agency would reassess the risk, and any necessary monitoring and control measures would be put in place to protect the environment, including any drinking water sources.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.9/15">The savings shown are compared to an increase of 5%.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.9/16">The differences in savings from the freeze are a simple reflection of the fact that higher banded homes pay more council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.9/17">I would note under the last Government, from 1997 to 2010, council tax bills more than doubled&#8212;across all council tax bands. This hit pensioners and others on fixed incomes the hardest. Correspondingly, the coalition Government's grant scheme to help local authorities to freeze council tax this year and next will provide significant help to those council taxpayers on low and fixed incomes.</p>

Under New Homes Bonus Government match the council tax for six years, using the national average in each band, for any empty homes that becomes a new home for somebody, with an additional amount being provided for those brought back into use as new affordable homes. In the first year alone, around 16,000 long-term empty homes were brought back into use and rewarded through the New Homes Bonus scheme, with local authorities benefiting from around &#163;19 million additional funding as a result I refer my hon.

This decreases to 26.3 million projected households in 2033 using the low population variant projection (an additional 4.6 million households compared to 2008), and increases to 28.7 million projected households in 2033 using the high population variant projection (an additional seven million households compared to 2008).</p>

	<p pid="a.25W.0/2">The Department for Communities and Local Government ministerial team have had many discussions both internally and with external partners regarding social enterprises since May 2010. Given that a number of these discussions were informal, ad hoc and sometimes took place as part of other meetings it would be impossible to list all of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.0/3">However the Department believes that community-based social enterprises have a particularly important role in supporting citizens and communities to take power into their hands and build the big society, and are vital to help grow a sustainable and dynamic economy. The Department is currently undertaking a range of actions to help support the development and maintenance of these organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.0/4">Through the Localism Bill we are giving communities the right to challenge to run local authority services, where they believe they could do this differently or better, and to ensure that community organisations have a fair chance to bid to take over community assets important to them. This presents a greater opportunity for communities to use the social enterprise model as a method to run assets and services on a sustainable basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.0/5">We have provided capital (grants and loans) to social enterprise-orientated organisations through the Communitybuilders Fund (which has been endowed to the Adventure Capital Fund) and other Departmental Funds. We also continue to support the Asset Transfer Unit which provides expert advice, guidance and support concerning the transfer of under-used land and buildings from the public sector to community social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.0/6">On the <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-03">3 November</phrase>, I launched an action research report (commissioned from the Young Foundation) which seeks to show how local authorities can better understand and support social enterprises in their local areas. The Department is also working closely with the sector to demonstrate the value of social enterprise to the new Local Economic Partnerships. The results of this work will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.32W.0/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/2">(1) When seeking legal advice from external counsel the Ministry of Justice follows guidance from the Attorney-General and Treasury Solicitors:</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/3"><a href="http://www.tsol.gov.uk/attorney_generals_panel_of_counsel.htm">http://www.tsol.gov.uk/attorney_generals_ panel_of_counsel.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/4">The Department does not keep a central record regarding the number of times legal advice is sought from external counsel and it would not be possible to differentiate between advice and representation costs without manually sifting through records and invoices for the periods above, to do so would incur disproportionate costs</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/5">(2) <i>(a)</i> The cost of supplying internal legal advice is not measured by the Department. All MOJ headquarter lawyers provide advice to different parts of the Department including the Secretary of State and Ministers as required.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/6"><i>(b)</i> The Ministry of Justice publishes information on its total legal spend in its Business Plan quarterly data summaries (QDS) in accordance with commitments made at Budget 2011 and the written ministerial statement on business plans. The purpose of the QDS data is to make more management information available to the public. The QDS provide a quarterly snapshot on how each Department is spending its budget. This information can be found on the Justice website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/7"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/transparency-data/quarterly-data-summaries.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/transparency-data/quarterly-data-summaries.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/8">Information that is currently available on the Justice website shows that for January to March 2011, the Department's total corporate legal spend was c &#163;8.3 million of which c &#163;1.3 million was internal legal staff costs, the rest was external spend and includes advice and representation.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/9">For the period April to June 2011 the Department's total corporate legal spend was c &#163;5.9 million of which c &#163;1.3 million were internal legal staff costs; the rest was external spend and includes advice and representation. Data for July to September are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/10">The figures above include costs for litigation and advice; the information is not recorded in a manner that makes extracting the cost of advice only possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/11">(3) <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> As per the answers to 78062 and 78070, the Ministry of Justice does not keep a record of how many times the Department requested legal advice and instructed counsel during the periods noted and is unable to provide a breakdown of costs in this manner as this information has not been centrally recorded. However, the external legal spend costs above do include external advice and costs for counsel. The cost of extracting this specific information would be disproportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/12">(A) The Ministry of Justice does not keep a central record of how many times it has been taken to court and the outcome of each case. Treasury Solicitors represent the Department in its litigation but not all of the matters involve court proceedings. To extract this information for the periods requested would involve manually checking files for those years at a cost which would be disproportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.0/13">(B) The Ministry of Justice does not keep a central record of how many of its decisions have been subject to judicial review and the outcome of those reviews, however Treasury Solicitors have represented the Ministry of Justice in judicial review proceedings for each year as per the following table. The outcomes of those reviews are not recorded centrally and cannot be provided without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.33W.2/1">For the purposes of resource allocation for magistrates court services there is no set definition of rural areas. Resources are allocated on the principle of work load.</p>
	<p pid="a.33W.2/2">The Courts Estates Reforms Programme has been established to review the condition and utilisation of HM Courts and Tribunals Service estate. The programme has proposed some magistrate courts that could be closed, resulting in improved utilisation across other magistrates courts in England and Wales, while maintaining access to justice in the remaining courts left open.</p>
	<p pid="a.33W.2/3">If magistrates work load is conducted in a more rural court location, part of the allocation recognises funding for magistrates travel expenses. Additional resources for funding expense are triggered by distance.</p>

For example, the November 2009 version provides a formula that would be used to calculate the allocation of indirect costs whereas the August 2010 version states a specific percentage of 6.5%.

For example, the provision of foreign language interpreters, British Sign Language interpreters, hearing loop systems and Braille signage. Visits to courts are also available to witnesses to enable them to familiarise themselves prior to court hearings. In accordance with legislation (Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999), intermediaries are also available to those assessed as requiring assistance in their communication. Court staff, judiciary, prison and probation officers receive equality and diversity training to adequately support those people with communication needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.0/2">Data from the Adoption Register shows that almost all local authorities in England use the register to find families for children in need of adoption. The challenge is to ensure that all local authorities refer all relevant children in need of adoption and approved prospective adopters to the register in good time.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.0/3">In January I approved funding for a one-year pilot project, led by the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, to gain a better understanding of how the register is being used, and how matching decisions are made at local level in relation to specific children. Findings from this project will inform my thinking on how the role of the register might be developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.41W.0/1">The Department's data on adoption show significant local variations in the number of adoptions from care and in the timeliness of adoptive placements. The new Children in Care and Adoption Performance Tables help local authorities to compare their performance with other authorities and identify where improvements are urgently needed. They do not include targets. I want to see more children in care adopted where this is in their best interests, and I want to speed up the system so that they are adopted at a younger age. However, the child's welfare must always be the paramount consideration for local authorities when considering the most appropriate route to permanence for a child who cannot live with his or her birth parents. In some cases, a special guardianship order or a residence order may be more appropriate than adoption, for example where an older child does not wish to sever their legal ties with their birth parents.</p>

The survey, carried out with nearly 700 schools, suggests that English Baccalaureate subjects are being opened up to many more pupils, reversing declines in entries to languages, history and geography. It also indicates that more than half of the pupils who were starting key stage 4 from September have chosen to follow a set of subjects which will not lead to the English Baccalaureate. We will continue to monitor the impact of the English Baccalaureate on other subjects, including through review of GCSE entries in 2012.</p>

It will ensure that all pupils have the opportunity to learn an instrument, learn to sing, have opportunities to play in ensembles and have access to musical progression routes regardless of where they live and their family circumstances. The needs of the pupil will be at the heart of the plan. Through it, the Government will signal their commitment to ensuring that all pupils have access to high quality music education.</p>

We want to support schools to deal effectively with bullying, while also reducing bureaucratic burdens and the amount of guidance from central Government. One of the aims of the anti-bullying advice is to signpost schools to key specialist organisations who could provide further advice and support. In doing so, we cannot list every organisation. We have listed those that we believe will be useful for the greatest number of schools. Transphobic bullying is an issue which directly affects a relatively small number of schools, so we have not included any organisations which specialise in that issue. GIRES is, however, a member of the Anti-Bullying Alliance&#8212;an umbrella organisation listed in our guidance. If schools identify transgender-related bullying issues, the ABA can signpost them in turn to GIRES or another specialist transgender organisation.</p>

Valuations are dependent on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and other factors. Many of these are currently under review as part of the Government's proposed reforms of the public sector pension schemes. The Teachers' Pensions Regulations 2010 require the scheme's actuary to carry out a valuation of the scheme at intervals of no more than four years but the actuary cannot do so until the Department and HM Treasury have set out the funding methodology, which will not be determined until the future structure of the pension scheme is clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.49W.2/2">The Department is currently considering responses to its consultation on the proposed increase to contributions for members of the Teachers&#8217; Pension Scheme (TPS), which sought views of consultees on how the contributions increase could be implemented in a way that delivered the Government&#8217;s commitment to minimise the number of teachers opting out of the scheme. The Government believe that the rate of opt-out from the TPS will remain very low following the increase in pension contributions and that it will not threaten the viability of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.49W.5/1">The Independent Public Service Pensions Commission, chaired by Lord Hutton, was invited by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" name="George Osborne">the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne)</phrase>, and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon.

	<p pid="a.49W.5/2">In making his recommendations on pension reform, Lord Hutton considered the reforms already made to the public service pension schemes&#8212;in 2007 in the case of the Teachers&#8217; Pension Scheme&#8212;and while he acknowledged that savings had been achieved, he pointed out that the cost of public service pensions had increased by around a third because of longer life expectancy over the last 50 years. As a result, cash expenditure on paying pensions to public service pensioners had increased to &#163;32 billion over the last decade. Against this background, Lord Hutton concluded that there is a clear case for further reform of public service pension schemes, including the Teachers&#8217; Pension Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.9/1">The majority of immigration detainees held for more than 12 months are foreign national offenders who are liable to be deported from the United Kingdom. There is no presumption to detain in such cases and our powers only allow us to detain for as long as there is a realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale. Our policy does however take into account the imperative to protect the public from foreign nationals who have offended in the UK and are liable to deportation. For this reason, proximity of removal, risk of reoffending (based on National Offender Management Service assessments) and risk of absconding are all taken into account at the point at which the detention decision is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.9/2">The courts have found that it may be lawful to prolong detention in cases where there is a risk to the public, a risk of the person absconding, or where the individual's own lack of co-operation is a determinative factor preventing removal. We do however review detention every 28 days to assess whether it remains lawful and appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.9/3">We have also put in place a package of measures to improve the quality of detention decisions and documentation. For example a training package has been designed for caseworkers, focusing on the legal powers and purpose of detention, progression of cases between reviews and the personal responsibilities of case owners. The detention review template and guidance have also been revised to better support caseworkers in making evidence-based detention decisions and demonstrating progress since the last detention review.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.9/4">A review of authority levels for the detention and release of foreign national offenders is also under way.</p>

This provision includes safe houses across England and Wales. Local authorities have a statutory duty under the Children Act to safeguard and promote the welfare of any child in need.

	<p pid="a.58W.0/2">The Department participated in a recent cross-industry research project that assessed the costs and benefits of replacing the 750V DC third rail electrified system with a 25kV AC overhead system. A summary of the research results is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.0/3"><a href="http://www.rssb.co.uk/sitecollectiondocuments/pdf/reports/research/T950_rb_final.pdf">www.rssb.co.uk/sitecollectiondocuments/pdf/reports/research/T950_rb_final.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.58W.0/4">The research concluded that converting the third rail network to an overhead system would deliver a range of benefits. These include lower running costs, greater resilience to snow and ice, increased train performance and the capacity to run more services. However, the cost of such a conversion would be significant, at around &#163;3-4 billion. Network Rail is now taking forward a more detailed assessment of the costs and benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.59W.6/2">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has co-operated with Government Departments and the Trinity House Lighthouse Service in the conduct of trials to determine the effects of Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming. It was found that simple and widely available jammers can disrupt the very low strength GPS signals received in surface vessels. The loss or denial of GPS signals is normally shown to the mariner through an alarm on the equipment in use. Losing GPS position information means that the mariner must use the other means available to them to determine their position. These means vary by vessel location and the equipment carried.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.6/3">However, the Department for Transport and the MCA have not made any specific assessments of the potential effects of a temporary disabling of GPS on fishing vessels, merchant vessels and recreational boats in Scottish waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.6/4">Operationally, if the jamming authority informs the Department of the temporary disabling of GPS, the information is passed to Her Majesty's Coastguard who arrange for the UK Hydrographic Office to issue the appropriate radio navigation warnings to seafarers.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/1">Focusing specifically on the Jobcentre part of DWP operations delivering local services, we announced last week our plans to close 19 small Jobcentres in the vicinity of other Jobcentres that were offering a full range of services, this did not include any Jobcentres in Merseyside. The spending review 2010 announced that DWP would deliver 26% savings in real terms from its core budget over the four year period to 2015. Operational parts of DWP, including the Jobcentre network across the country and in Merseyside, will contribute to these savings by driving up efficiency in the way it works through more use of its online services and implementing ideas that help improve processes and productivity. Where this results in the need to reduce jobs we will do this through normal turnover where possible. There are no plans above this to reduce staffing levels in Merseyside but as with other parts of the country we will continue to review workloads and staffing levels which may result in the need for staff to be flexible in how we deliver services to customers.</p>

	<p pid="a.66W.3/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-31">31 October 2011</phrase>, the time limits for returning the questionnaire (ESA50) were reduced from 42 days to 28 days overall. This is because the time scales were based on those for incapacity benefit, which included an additional 14 days for claimants to contact their GPs to make an appointment. This is not needed for employment and support allowance claims and the Government believes that it is therefore reasonable reduce the time scales for returning the form from 28 days to 21 days, and the time for reminders to seven days from 14, which makes an overall total of 28 days. We would not wish for this to impinge on a claimant's ability to provide further evidence to support their claim as they will still be required to complete the remaining Work Capability Assessment process, of which, the return of ESA50 is just the start.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.3/2">We recognise concerns about the effects on vulnerable people, especially those with mental health problems. As a consequence we are retaining all existing safeguards for those claimants who demonstrate that they had good cause for failing to return the questionnaire on time. Decision Makers must consider the claimant's state of health, nature of disability and whether they were in Great Britain before deciding if the claimant has good cause for not completing the questionnaire on time.</p>

	<p pid="a.71W.0/1">Foreign and Commonwealth (FCO) consular staff in London and overseas regularly answer phone calls from British nationals seeking our help, including through our 24-hour Global Response Centre. Consular Directorate also provides the following telephone helplines:</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/2" class="italic">Travel  <i>a</i> dvice telephone line</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/3">This service offers access to the FCO's travel advice to those who are unable to view it online, or who wish to inquire in person. The service is currently provided by a commercial partner and we have budgeted &#163; 190,000 for 2011-12. We continue to improve our online travel advice, and hope to reduce this cost by making online advice easier to use. The number of calls received in the past five years:</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/4">2006-07: 63,987</p>

	<p pid="a.71W.0/9" class="italic">Overseas crises</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/10">In a crisis affecting British nationals overseas the FCO may activate a call handling capacity to take calls from affected members of the public, either in-house or outsourced to a commercial partner or the police. This depends on the scale and nature of the incident. These call handlers usually respond to calls to a dedicated emergency hotline number. Funding for operational costs is not allocated in advance, but these costs can be claimed from the Treasury-held Emergency Disaster Reserve should the total costs of our crisis response surpass &#163;150,000. To establish accurate figures and costs for each of the last five years would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

When the passport contract moved to the Identity and Passport Service, a one-year short-term extension of contract was established with Careline (from <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-01">1 June 2011</phrase>) to handle legalisation inquiries. Within the same contract, Careline handles telephone inquiries from British nationals looking to register a birth or death or with questions about getting married or arranging a civil partnership overseas. The budget for 2011-12 is &#163;80,000. The number of calls received:</p>

	<p pid="a.72W.5/2">The Humanitarian Aid Instrument (HAI) is the main budget line for humanitarian activities in the European Union (EU) budget. The Emergency Aid Reserve (EAR), meanwhile, is the part of the EU budget used to respond to crises in non-EU countries which were not accounted for when the budget was drawn up&#8212;allowing the EU to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/3">These instruments fund the work of the Commission's humanitarian agency, European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO)&#8212;responsible for responding to the needs of the most vulnerable people immediately after a disaster. The UK's Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) rated the agency highly, with very good value for money; closely matching the UK's own humanitarian objectives. ECHO'S separate budget line is an important factor in enabling it to deliver effectively, giving it greater scope to provide long-term and predictable funding to at-risk areas as well as the ability to hold funds in reserve for response to unforeseen disasters and humanitarian crises.</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.5/2">We remain concerned about the detention of children in military jails and the prosecution of children through military courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.5/3">During my visit in June, I raised this matter directly with the Minister responsible, indicating the UK's concerns about both the detention and the treatment of children. The Israelis have recently raised the age of criminal responsibility in the territories from 16 to 18, so it is the same as for Israeli children. Nonetheless, I know that the Israeli Government do take seriously the fact that children are detained in circumstances that cause concern to NGOs and UNICEF, and we will continue to press them on this.</p>

	<p pid="a.76W.6/58">For the Air Cadet units in Sussex, it is not possible to provide information on the funding per cadet as it is not held in the format requested.

The use of bayonets is not universal across the services but training will begin, regardless of age, when recruits join those branches that do make use of bayonets, for example, the infantry or RAF Regiment. The guidelines governing the use of live weapons during phase 1 and 2 training are stringent in considering accident prevention and physical security and no training is undertaken without strict supervision.</p>

	<p pid="a.81W.2/2">There are 23 FOI exemptions. One of these, Section 36 prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs, can only apply if it is the reasonable opinion of a qualified person that the exemption applies. The Act states that in relation to information held by Government, the qualified person must be a Minister. A ministerial submission is produced by the lead business area and submitted to the Minister with responsibility for the topic that the FOI covers. In addition, any FOI received from an MP or their support staff, must receive a response from a Minister. Again, this is the Minister with responsibility for the topic that the FOI covers.</p>

So the main commemorations will be on the centenary of the end of the First World War in 1918. However, given the importance of the centenary of World War I, a number of anniversaries of key events from 2014 to 2018, including the beginning of the war, will be marked in an appropriate way. The Prime Minister has asked my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase> to act as his special representative and co-ordinator for World War I Commemorations.

	<p pid="a.89W.8/1">This Department has not commissioned any research into the potential growth in the numbers of British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters which might arise as a consequence of the introduction of commercially available video relay services, restricted or otherwise, in the UK. According to the UK register of Sign Language Interpreters there are 682 interpreters qualified at the appropriate level for commercial video relay provision (&#8216;Member of the Register&#8217; level), up from 519 since Ofcom, the independent national telecoms regulator, published its consultation on relay service provision in the UK at the end of July. The register is a public document available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.8/2"><a href="http://portal.nrcpd.org.uk/search/">http://portal.nrcpd.org.uk/search/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.89W.8/3">Independent contributions submitted in response to Ofcom's consultation estimate the number of interpreters needed to deliver an unrestricted video relay service was 2,053 full-time equivalents. However, it is good practice for interpreters to move between the video relay studio and field interpreting, so the figure required is likely to be significantly higher.</p>

	<p pid="a.99W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-20">20 October 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.99W.8/2">It is the impact of the tax and benefit system as a whole that is important for households. Over the last three fiscal events the Government have published detailed analysis of the distributional impacts of reforms for tax, tax credit and benefit changes, and has shown the cumulative impacts of these reforms on households. Charts A.2 and A.3 of Budget 2011 show the most recent analysis by income decile, and present estimates in cash terms and as a percentage of net income. This analysis shows that, when looking at the cumulative impact of reforms introduced by this Government, it is clear that the top decile contributes the most to the fiscal consolidation, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of net income.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.8/3">Chart A.6 of Budget 2011 shows the Government's best estimate of the overall impact of reforms on households, including changes to public services. Due to data limitations analysis is shown at a quintile level to limit the number of assumptions that have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.8/4">Income deciles are calculated by ordering households by their income and dividing them into 10 equally sized groups. As households with more individuals require higher levels of household income and expenditure to achieve the same standard of living, an internationally standard process of adjustment called equalisation is used to ensure households are compared on an equal basis. Further details on this can be found in the Data Sources document accompanying Budget 2011. The following table sets out the lower bounds for equivalised income deciles used at Budget 2011. Note these estimates have been rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.8/5">As this is equivalised income, the ranges below do not show net (or gross) incomes for households within the bands. Rather for a particular decile they contain a wider range of net incomes, some of which will lie outside of the bands themselves. For example, a household with a combined net income of &#163;25,000 containing a couple and two children aged seven and 15 years old would have an equivalised net income of around &#163;16,340. This is calculated as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.8/6">Factor: 0.67 + 0.33 + 0.20 + 0.33 = 1.53.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.8/7">Equivalised net income: &#163;25,000/1.53 = &#163;16,340.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.8/8">Given this, it is not valid to interpret the bands as net (or gross) incomes or make statements on the impacts of policies using that interpretation.</p>

The general principles are that the provision of free health care and the dispensing of medication by an NHS hospital are not treated as being a &quot;business&quot; activity for VAT purposes. Consequently, the NHS is unable to recover from HMRC the VAT it incurs on drugs. However, the funding that NHS bodies receive from the Department of Health takes account of this irrecoverable VAT.</p>

	<p pid="a.102W.8/1">We have examined as far as possible all of the comparable international evidence on labour market flexibility. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Jobs Study Review of 2006 summarises most of this evidence in &#8216;Boosting jobs and income&#8212;policy lessons from reassessing the OECD Jobs Strategy&#8217; and I draw attention to some of the following conclusions in it:</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.8/2">&#8220;The experience over the past two decades shows that there is no single combination of policies and institutions to achieve and maintain good labour market performance. For example, it is not necessary that all individual policies are aimed at strong labour market performance, provided that adverse stances in some policy areas are more than compensated for by favourable settings in other areas, e.g. by exploiting policy interactions. This allows some scope to tailor policy packages to suit national preferences with respect to equity, risk-taking and other objectives. However, in practice there are few feasible policy combinations to achieve satisfactory employment outcomes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.8/3">The study also identified the UK as a &#8216;successful employment performer&#8217; and suggested that it fell into a group of countries that are &#8216;market reliant&#8217; which include light employment protection in its policy package. Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United States are the other countries identified in this group by the OECD.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.8/4">The OECD also identified another group of countries as &#8216;successful performers&#8217; with different but successful policy packages. These include Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.8/5">The Government, through their employment law and growth reviews, aim to build upon this and foster greater employment and growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.106W.3/1">BIS is fully committed to supporting the raft of initiatives announced by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-11">11 February 2011</phrase> at the Small Business summit. We are currently working with Cabinet Office colleagues on optimising opportunities through procurement processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/2">&#8220;Value for money&#8221; is the deciding factor when we award contracts competitively but, given our wider responsibility, we strongly encourage small and SME businesses to bid for departmental contracts they believe they could fulfil.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/3">Details of practical actions include:</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/4">Ongoing use of the &#8216;Contracts Finder&#8217; website launched in February. Contracts Finder is a free facility for small and SME businesses to find online public sector procurement and subcontracting opportunities above &#163;10,000 in a single location.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/5">Prompt payment targets. Prompt payment is vital to businesses and is of particular importance to small businesses and SMEs. To support our suppliers, the Department aims to pay all invoices within five working days. In the period April to September this year, an average of 94.6% of all invoices were paid within this target period.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/6">For suitable contracts, BIS aims going forward to notify its tendering requirements in advance by use of a prior information notice (PIN) for its <i>Official Journal </i>of the European Union (OJEU) procurements. This will provide a greater degree of notice to the market, enabling small businesses and SMEs to be better placed to bid as either prime or subcontractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/7">BIS is currently running an &#8216;Open&#8217; OJEU procurement exercise in close co-ordination with the Cabinet Office team responsible for SME issues. The Open procedure does not utilise a pre-qualification stage, reducing the administrative burden for bidders, including SMEs, when bidding for Government opportunities. We are looking to commence another two Open procedures within the next three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/8">To support small and SME businesses build skills and capacity and to support such businesses access public procurement opportunities more generally, BIS has designed, with input from across both the public and private sectors, a free online public procurement training course &quot;Winning the Contract&quot; available on the Businesslink website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/9"><a href="http://www1.learndirect-business.com/business-courses/winning-the-contract">http://www1.learndirect-business.com/business-courses/winning-the-contract</a></p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/10">The course is a free, nationally available resource which aims to make the public procurement process more transparent and more accessible to small businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.108W.5/1">Institutions intending to charge more than the &#163;6,000 basic amount for tuition must first demonstrate to the independent Director of Fair Access what more they will do to attract students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These plans are finalised in approved Access Agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.5/2">The powers of the director of fair access were established by the Higher Education Act 2004 and include a power to identify good practice in connection with access to higher education and to give advice about such practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.5/3">Ministers at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills wrote to the director of fair access on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-10">10 February 2011</phrase> setting out the Government's expectations about how he should approach the approval and monitoring of new access agreements. The guidance set out significantly increased expectations for the priority that institutions should give to fair access and widening participation. In particular we identified the effectiveness of collaborative working on widening participation, recognising that many institutions were already doing this and that access agreements should build on that work. We also highlighted that such collaboration also encourages the sharing of good practice. The director mirrored Governments' advice in his own guidance to the sector in March on how to develop access agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.5/4">The Government have committed through the recent White Paper 'Students at the Heart of the System' (June 2011) to strengthen the Office for Fair Access (OFFA), so that it can provide more active and energetic challenge and support to universities and colleges. We will want to work with the director on the size and structure of OFFA but will make significantly more resources available, increasing capacity up to around four times its original level. This would equip OFFA to use fully its powers to monitor and review access agreements and identify and promote best, evidence-based practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.109W.2/1">The aim of the Government's proposals for higher education reform, including the proposal to decouple degree awarding powers from teaching, is to drive greater diversity and competition to improve the range and quality of provision available to students while safeguarding the strong international reputation of English universities. Any organisation, including non-teaching bodies, wishing to acquire taught degree awarding powers will, as now, have to meet specific criteria to determine if it is fit to exercise the powers being sought. We are currently reviewing the degree awarding powers criteria as part of those reforms but believe that broadly the same principles as set out in the current criteria can and should apply and that the key principles will be applicable to non-teaching bodies as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.111W.2/2">The UK Nanotechnologies Strategy of March 2010 has been a useful source of views and input that has informed our thinking on nanotechnology, which has evolved, and is underpinned by the view that nano-scale technologies should be thought of on a case-by-case basis given the wide range of materials and processes with diverse properties, benefits and implications for health and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.2/3">Together with Lord Taylor of Holbeach, I recently held a roundtable discussion to inform our thinking on how Government can in the future help industry have confidence to invest in successful and responsible commercialisation and for consumers to be confident that the manufacture, integration, use and subsequent disposal of nano-enabled products will not have adverse impacts on their health or the wider environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.2/4">We are currently reflecting on the outcomes of this discussion, but the Government are committed to enabling the successful and responsible commercialisation of nano-scale technologies, and these technologies, remain an important strand of activity across a number of Government Departments and partner bodies such as the Research Councils and the Technology Strategy Board.</p>

	<p pid="a.116W.2/4">The number of responses since January 2010 where the Cabinet Office gave the following reasons in response to requests for information under the FOIA are (a) commercial sensitivity: 47; (b) information not held: 441; (c) information too costly to provide: 277; and (d) vexatious or repeated requests: four.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/5">Cabinet Office officials normally determine whether the exemptions at part II of the FOIA should apply to responses to requests for information received under the FOIA. The exemption at section 36 of the FOIA (prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs) can, however, only apply if in the reasonable view of a &#8216;qualified person&#8217; disclosure of the information being requested would have one of the specified prejudicial effects. In the case of the Cabinet Office, the &#8216;qualified person&#8217; is a Minister of the Crown.</p>

	<p pid="a.130W.8/2">The Department of Health took part in the civil service Whitehall Internship Scheme from <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-25">25 July</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-05">5 August 2011</phrase>, as part of the Government's social mobility strategy. The scheme was developed in response to a pledge in the coalition agreement to provide internships in every Whitehall Department for people from under-represented groups. The Department of Health provided opportunities for three people of school leaving age to work in our Whitehall office, giving them meaningful work experience and an insight into the civil service. The programme was a fully funded residential placement paid for by the Cabinet Office working directly in association with the Social Mobility Foundation. Expenses were met centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.130W.8/3">Of the Department's 19 arm's length bodies (ALBs), only five have employed unpaid or expenses-only internships in the last 12 months for which figures are available, as shown in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.6/1">The Department commissioned the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to undertake the dignity and nutrition inspection (DANI) programme and its final national report was published last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/2">There are a number of steps the Department is taking to improve care for elderly patients in the national health service including:</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/3">There are a number of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence quality standards commissioned by the Department that are either in place or are being developed for a range of conditions and pathways affecting older people including incontinence, nutrition support in adults, patient experience in adult NHS services, delirium, dementia, osteoarthritis and falls in a care setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/4">One of the eight high impact actions developed for nursing relates to keeping people nourished and getting better, and aims to stop unintentional weight loss and dehydration in patients. This action is taken locally with initiatives such as red trays to identify patients who need help with eating and drinking and better management of charts.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/5">Since April 2010, it has been a requirement of a hospital&#8217;s continuing registration with the CQC that service users are protected from the risks of dehydration and inadequate nutrition.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/6">Within the NHS Operating Framework and the NHS Outcomes Framework, there are a number of indicators to support better care for older people. These include dementia care, hospital acquired infections, emergency readmission rates, improving recovery from fragility fractures and helping older people to recover their independence after illness or injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/7">The Department is also funding national audits of falls and bone health, dementia, continence and hip fracture.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/8">Local involvement networks in each local authority area are able to enter and view services to obtain the views and experiences of patients, service users and their families about their experiences of care and treatment at the time they are receiving it. Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, local HealthWatch organisations will continue this enter and view activity. This information can be shared with the CQC&#8217;s compliance inspectors, which will help to focus the inspection on specific concerns and thereby help the CQC to hold local services to account. Local HealthWatch will also be the champion for public and patients, service users and carers in health and social care services. HealthWatch England will be able to use information from local HealthWatch, and elsewhere, to form a national picture of services. Locally and nationally, HealthWatch will have a remit to make recommendations about how services could or should be improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.6/9">The Department supports the &#8220;Partnership on dignity in care&#8221;, which has been established by the NHS Confederation, Age UK and the Local Government Group. The Partnership aims to help drive improvements in the levels of care provided to older people in hospitals and care homes and has an independent commission which is currently taking evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.1/2">It is for health and social care providers to develop local nutrition and hydration policies.

	<p pid="a.136W.2/1">The Government Actuary&#8217;s Department estimates that in 2008, the pension of an NHS Pension Scheme member with 30 years continuous service will retire with an average pension of approximately &#163;15,000. This is based on currently contributing members rather than those in receipt of benefits. The average pension of a retired NSH Scheme member with 30 years continuous service is not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/2">The proposed linkage to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) instead of the Retail Price Index (RPI) applies to the indexation of pensions in payment. This change does not affect pension benefits until a member draws their pension&#8212;at which stage the pension will be uprated in line with inflation over the year to the previous September.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/3">The difference between RPI and CPI varies from year to year. In September 2010 CPI was 1.5% lower than RPI. Based on the example above, this would have made &#163;225 difference per annum from April 2011 onwards.</p>

Finished consultant episode (FCE): A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. 2. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis: The number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record. The ICD-code used to identify obesity is E66. 3. PCT/SHA data quality: In July 2006, the NHS reorganised strategic health authorities (SHA) and primary care trusts (PCT) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. Data has been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided. 4. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.138W.3/1">&#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase>, sets out our ambition to bring England's cancer survival rates in line with the European average by 2014-15. Research has shown that to match the European average we need to save 5,000 additional lives per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.3/2">This research also shows that if England's survival rates were as good as the best in Europe we would save 10,000 additional lives per year. This figure has also been broken down by tumour site and we estimate that we would save 75 additional lives each year if we matched the best European survival rate for pancreatic cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.3/3">We do not know what proportion of this figure of 75 lives could be saved through earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, but we believe achieving earlier diagnosis of cancer is key to improving survival rates for many cancers. We will not be able to deliver on our ambition to deliver improved survival rates by focusing solely on the more common cancers and the strategy sets out our commitment to work with a number of rarer cancer-focused charities to assess what more can be done to encourage appropriate referrals to secondary care for earlier diagnosis. The other key factor likely to influence survival rates for pancreatic cancer is ensuring that all patients have access to the appropriate treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.3/4">Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including a pancreatic cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis. Pancreatic Cancer UK has recently requested to meet me to discuss its Campaign for Hope and related issues. My office is currently setting that meeting up and I understand that the charity will also be inviting some parliamentary colleagues. As I understand, there is no All Party Parliamentary Group for Pancreatic Cancer.</p>

PCAG is also developing key messages that every GP should know about prostate cancer which will be disseminated widely once finalised, including via Prostate Action's GP network. In addition, the PCRMP Scientific Reference Group are supporting further work on measuring the levels of PSA testing, which is building in questions around GP knowledge and education about the programme. We are also aware of work being developed by The Prostate Cancer Charity's Testing Choices campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.141W.5/1">It is for the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to register providers of adult social care services, including care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.5/2">The registration process for care providers with the CQC requires that they declare their organisation takes all reasonable steps to remain financially viable. Where the CQC has concerns regarding a declaration, it will ask further questions to determine whether the provider is compliant with Regulation 13 of the CQC (Registration) Regulations 2009, which requires providers to ensure the &#8220;financial viability&#8221; of their enterprise, before deciding whether to register them.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.5/3">Once registered, there is a statutory obligation, under Regulation 15 of the CQC (Registration) Regulations 2009, that providers notify the CQC of changes which will affect their registration. This includes the appointment by a provider of a receiver, liquidator or provisional liquidator.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.5/4">The Government are, however, keen to learn lessons from Southern Cross; and are currently looking at whether further oversight of the social care market is required in the future. To inform this work, the Department recently published a discussion paper outlining some key questions on this issue. This can be found on the Caring for our Future website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.142W.6/1">The chief executive officer (CEO), Jamie Buchan, of Southern Cross Healthcare first wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-03">3 August</phrase> to introduce himself and to request a meeting to discuss the United Kingdom care sector as a whole and Southern Cross's role within it. This letter did not warn that Southern Cross faced immediate financial difficulties; rather, the letter explained the pressure that a difficult settlement from the forthcoming comprehensive spending review (CSR) would place on Southern Cross's business model, and it explained the improvements that the company's board planned to make to its services. The same letter was received separately from the CEO's personal assistant on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-30">30 July</phrase>, and a departmental official responded, declining the request for a meeting, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-19">19 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.142W.6/2">The CEO wrote again to me on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-24">24 September 2010</phrase>, referring to the possible implications of the CSR settlement for the care home sector in general. The letter did not raise concerns over the future viability of the company's business model. I responded to this letter on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-14">14 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.142W.6/3">The Government recognises the pressures on the social care system in this challenging financial climate.

	<p pid="a.142W.6/4">The CEO wrote to David Behan, Director General for Social Care at the Department of Health, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-14">14 October</phrase>. This letter was the first occasion on which Jamie Buchan alerted the Department to the possibility of the imminent financial difficulties. David Behan met with Jamie Buchan on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-08">8 November</phrase> and since that point, negotiations have continued between Southern Cross and senior departmental officials. Ministers have liaised closely with officials in order to be kept fully informed of the situation and they have provided clear steers at every stage of negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.142W.6/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-15">15 March 2011</phrase>, the CEO wrote to update Ministers on the company's position, further to the announcement to the stock exchange of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-14">14 March</phrase> and to set out the company's commitment to improve the quality of services. This letter was also sent to the Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40541" name="Andrew Lansley">the right hon.

After careful consideration officials decided that significant work would have been needed to strengthen the design of KWAT's proposal for us to be able to fund it. Officials therefore decided the most effective way to reach the largest number of IDPs quickly would be to increase our existing support to those organisations that had ongoing programmes which could be scaled-up, rather than designing and approving new programmes as would have been necessary in order to support KWAT.</p>

Under the WEEE directive, it is illegal to export hazardous e-waste from the UK for disposal in developing countries. The UK has a national intelligence team and a national environmental crime team. As part of their remit, these teams are required to prevent the illegal export of e-waste. They use an intelligence-led approach to target the most prolific, serious and organised illegal waste exporters.

	<p pid="a.153W.2/1">The UK Government have launched the International Climate Fund (ICF) to help reduce poverty and tackle climate change in developing countries. Our adaptation funding will be focused on the poorest countries in the sectors that are most important to poor people's livelihoods and vulnerable to climate change. For example, the ICF will reduce the vulnerability of poor people to climate-related shocks by funding better early warning systems, building cyclone shelters, and setting up insurance schemes to protect farmers and families from losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.153W.2/2">The UK Government are also developing programmes to support clean energy solutions for poor people who are not currently connected to the national electricity grid, reducing their vulnerability to external fuel prices and the need to collect traditional sources of fuel. This provides more time for economic activities and has a significant impact on maternal and child health. We are continually analysing and tracking the impact and application of climate financing to ensure that the voices of poor and vulnerable people, and their representatives are heard, and taken into account, in the selection and design of programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.5/1">Since July, the UK Government have allocated &#163;57 million to support humanitarian aid in Somalia, the vast majority of it in Southern Somalia where people are most in need. To date UK aid has provided 247,000 people with food assistance, treated some 7,500 severely malnourished children, vaccinated 500,000 children against measles and supplied 400,000 doses of drugs to treat malaria. I have also pressed other countries to pay their share. The 2011 UN Consolidated Appeal for Somalia is nearly 80% funded&#8212;the best funded appeal globally, Nonetheless, huge needs remain unmet.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.5/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) humanitarian support is guided by core humanitarian principles, including impartiality. Aid is therefore prioritised to reach those in greatest need. In Somalia most of the people suffering from famine are in areas under the control of Al Shabaab. DFID works with trusted and experienced United Nations, Red Cross and international non-governmental humanitarian organisations who have managed to maintain some access to vulnerable people in Al Shabaab-held areas. DFID partners put in place robust systems to minimise the risks, and ensure aid reaches those most in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.5/3">We are discussing with other actors, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, whether they can encourage Al Shabaab to ease access constraints for all humanitarian actors.</p>
