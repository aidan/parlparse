	<p pid=".809W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Burnside, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question, about what his plans are for improving road and rail links between the airport at Aldergrove and Belfast, with particular reference to the Dunsilly roundabout M2 link through Antrim town to the airport. (223171). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/4" class="indent">You may recall that John Spellar, MP, in his letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-22">22 October 2004</phrase>, assured you that the importance of Belfast International Airport as a transport hub was recognised by the Regional Development Strategy and the Regional Transportation Strategy. During preparation of the Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan (RSTN TP), the transport links to Belfast International Airport were examined. However, it was considered that the three roads radiating out from the Killead roundabout provided good links to the strategic road network, servicing the Province and beyond. No additional road infrastructure was considered necessary during the life of the Plan.</p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/5" class="indent">The Antrim Road/Dublin Road between Belfast International Airport and Antrim does not offer a direct link to the Key Strategic Road Network and is not therefore, considered to be either a Key Strategic Corridor or Link Corridor, as defined in the Regional Development Strategy. However, the RSTN TP appraisal process included the examination of a new link road connecting the M2 Motorway/Rathmore roundabout to Belfast International Airport, and it is hoped that this proposal will be included, not only in Roads Service's Long Term Forward Planning Schedule, but also as a potential Transport Scheme in the forthcoming Antrim/Ballymena/Larne Development Plan, currently being prepared by the Department of the Environment's Planning Service. The inclusion of this scheme would afford protection of the route from any development that would be likely to prejudice future implementation of a scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/6" class="indent">With regard to the Antrim Road/Dublin Road, which forms part of the route from the Dunsilly Roundabout to the airport, I can advise that Roads Service has identified a number of possible road improvements. The first of these, involving the realignment and widening of approximately 500m of carriageway, together with a right turn lane and improved visibility splays at the Dungonnell Road junction to Crumlin, is scheduled to start during the 2005/06 financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/7" class="indent">The proposed improvements to the M2 motorway, which will be undertaken as part of Package 1 of Roads Service's DBFO Programme, will widen the existing carriageway to provide three lanes in the Belfast bound direction from Sandyknowes junction through the Greencastle interchange to join the M5. An additional lane will also be provided to carry 3 lanes through the Greencastle interchange in the northbound direction. The works will include the replacement of three of the bridges over the M2 motorway on this section of the route, i.e. Hightown Bridge, Collin Bridge, and Longlands Bridge.</p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/8" class="indent">With regard to improving rail links to the airport, I understand in the context of a new park and ride site near Templepatrick, that Translink would consider diverting the current bus service between Aldergrove and the Europa Bus Centre to enable a rail connection to be made there.</p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/9" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".812W.5/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".812W.5/2"><i>(a)</i> The policy of transferring non-core trunk roads (de-trunking) to local highway authorities was first set out in the White Paper A New Deal for Transport published in July 1998. De-trunking allows the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of the strategic (core) trunk road network, whilst enabling local authorities to consider their own priorities for the improvement of non-core routes. The aim has been to transfer some 3,200 kms (30 per cent.) of the trunk road network (as it was in April 1999) to local authorities in a phased programme. To date more than three-quarters (around 2,500 kms) of the programme has been completed since April 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".812W.5/3"><i>(b)</i> Prior to the de-trunking of a road, the Highways Agency and local authority agree an appropriate level of funding for annual routine maintenance and in some cases' outstanding capital maintenance projects. The methodology for calculating the funding has been approved by the Local Government Association to ensure a fair transfer of resources. In the years following de-trunking, the authority can also make supplementary bids for additional funds for capital maintenance projects (bridge replacement, resurfacing etc.) on de-trunked roads as part of the LTP process. In 2004&ndash;05 around &pound;33.1 million of routine maintenance funds, and &pound;31.6 million of capital maintenance funds were transferred from the Highways Agency to local authorities for all de-trunked roads.</p>

This allows authorities to provide more effective enforcement and to match that enforcement to their local transport objectives.

This policy of transferring responsibility to local authorities is reflected in Home Office figures for the number of traffic wardens in England and Wales for the years 1999&ndash;2000 to 2003&ndash;04 (the most recent year for which figures are available), which are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".816W.8/1">In December 2004, the Government launched a consultation on proposals to establish regional funding allocations for transport, housing and economic development. As part of that consultation a number of routes have been classified as being of regional rather than of major national and international importance. This amounts to 520 miles of motorway and 2,185 miles of all-purpose trunk roads. The categorisation is being used to assist the identification of regional priorities for transport investment and does not represent a reduction in the status of these routes. Representations about the classification of routes have been received so far from some local authorities as well as the RAC Foundation, the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association.</p>

	<p pid=".819W.6/3">Coventry has benefited from capital investment in its industry from the Selective Finance for Industry in England (SFIE) programme (formerly Regional Selective Assistance&mdash;RSA). In the last five years, 22 companies have received a total of &pound;12.4 million in SFIE offers which will enable these companies to make capital investments totalling &pound;119.6 million.

	<p pid=".819W.6/4">Since January 2003 the Small Business Service in the West Midlands made 17 offers of grant to SME's in Coventry. The total value of the grants offered was &pound;945,051 to support Grant for Research and Development (GRD) its predecessor SMART and for Enterprise Grant projects. In the last year, the Small Business Service has assisted a total of 1,695 companies and potential start-ups in the Coventry, South constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.6/5">122 companies in Coventry have benefited so far from the subsidised advice available from the West Midlands Manufacturing Advisory Service. Companies also benefit from investment by Advantage West Midlands (AWM) through the Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire Triangle High Technology Corridor; AWM's Cluster programme and funding through the Coventry and Nuneaton Regeneration Zone. This year alone, AWM has spent &pound;34 million on projects across Coventry and Warwickshire which has achieved the following:</p>

	<p pid=".826W.9/4" class="indent">The most recent estimates of the number of cohabiting couples indicated that there were 2 million cohabiting couples in England and Wales in 2003. The proportion of these couples who have children is not available. No estimates are made for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".826W.9/5" class="indent">The NS-SEC of families is not routinely published, but the Labour Force Survey can be used to provide estimated proportions of family types by NS-SEC. A table based on data from the first quarter of 2004 for the United Kingdom is attached. This table also shows the proportion of cohabiting couples who have children living with them. The data should be interpreted with some caution as the results are not standardised for age. The number of children an NS SEC category of cohabitants have will, in part, be determined by the age distribution of cohabitants in that category.</p>

	<p pid=".838W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/2">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/3" class="italic">Inaccurate valuations:</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/4">It is not clear what is meant by 'inaccurate valuations'. We did carry out a full reconciliation of all compensation payments following the outbreak. Any amendments or recalculations were done and additional payments made or overpayments recovered as appropriate. We do not have a record of each claim that was affected in this way.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/5">The value of an animal is a subjective decision made by professionally qualified valuers, who have sight of the animal and a full knowledge of the herd/flock history as well as experience of the livestock industry. Once the valuation is agreed by the valuer, the farmer and the supervising Ministry official we are legally obliged to pay the agreed amount. There have been observations made that our control over the valuation process was poor and that this contributed to higher than necessary compensation payments. We have accepted this and improved our approach to valuations for a future outbreak.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/6" class="italic">Deliberate spreading of infection:</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/7">No formal assessment of whether farmers or anyone else deliberately sought to introduce foot and mouth disease (FMD) in order to claim compensation took place. There were many media reports at the time of allegations that such mischief was taking place. Three files where allegations were investigated in 2001 have been traced and the allegation and outcomes are summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/8" class="indent">File A&mdash;on investigation this allegation of deliberate infection amounted solely to repetition by an unidentified man to a part-time journalist and recorded by the part-time journalist on tape of rumours that were then prevalent about deliberate infection. The unidentified man said</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/9" class="indent">&quot;tails from infected animals are placed in uninfected areas to spread the disease&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/10" class="indent">The part-time journalist refused to reveal the identity of his source so the investigation could not be taken any further.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/11" class="indent">File B&mdash;an anonymous voice-message in an Irish accent left on a mobile phone asked the recipient to supply</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/12" class="indent">&quot;animals infected with BSE and FMD&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/13" class="indent">turned out to be a prank from the caller. This was admitted by the prankster when he was traced by an Investigation Officer. The prankster also admitted he had dialled the wrong number and the prank was intended for a friend rather than the recipient of the call.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/14" class="indent">File C&mdash;Farmer A's cattle were slaughtered as they had been in contact with FMD. He was compensated. He bought some more cattle from Farmer B but left them on Farmer B's land for the time being. Farmer A's replacement cattle and Farmer B's own cattle contracted FMD. Both were compensated. The matter was investigated as it seemed very suspicious. There was no evidence of any deliberate misconduct but poor bio-security by Farmer A, who visited the cattle on three occasions, was identified as a possible cause of the transmission of FMD.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/15" class="italic">Completed prosecutions for fraud arising out of fraudulent claims for compensation:</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/16">Six people were prosecuted by Defra for fraud offences in connection with the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001:</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/17" class="indent">Three members of staff were prosecuted and pleaded guilty to making false subsistence claims and were ordered to complete Community punishment orders and to pay compensation to Defra totalling &pound;5,883. All three were dismissed.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.8/18" class="indent">Three farmers were prosecuted for making false compensation claims; one farmer pleaded guilty to falsely stating the cost of feed and was fined &pound;3,500, two other farmers were acquitted&mdash;it was alleged that both had falsely overclaimed for equipment destroyed or premises damaged during the FMD outbreak.</p>

	<p pid=".844W.5/1">The Government commissioned an Independent Review into the Supporting People programme following significant late growth in estimated costs from &pound;1.4 billion in December 2002 to &pound;1.8 billion by March 2003. The Review reported that there are wide variations in unit costs between authorities and that &pound;1.8 billion was too much to pay for the services provided.</p>
	<p pid=".844W.5/2">Service packages work and Audit Commission inspections demonstrate that there is significant potential for making efficiency savings in the current pattern of service provision while safeguarding valuable services. Where authorities face reductions in grant as a result of moving to a pattern which better reflects needs we expect them to use the service review process to achieve these savings.</p>
	<p pid=".844W.5/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working closely with local authority representatives on the development of a needs based formula for the distribution of Supporting People funding in the longer term. We will consult widely on a revised version later this year, including on the extent of increases or reductions in grants to authorities and the rate at which they are introduced. West Sussex will be invited to contribute to that consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.9/1">Further education colleges and local authorities will retain considerable discretion in the setting of fees for adults in 2005/06. There will be no change in the fee concessions arrangements in further education that help unemployed people, those on income based benefits, and retired people and working families on low incomes, to access learning. Learners will also continue to have access to literacy, numeracy and English language courses free of charge. We will continue to make a very significant contribution to further and adult education although our assumption will remain that adults should continue to contribute to the costs of their learning unless otherwise eligible for fee concessions. Changes to the Learning and Skills Council's further education funding methodology fee assumption in 2005/06 mean that the learner contribution to the cost of their learning will increase from 25 per cent. to 27.5 per cent. of the basic course cost. Decisions about funding arrangements for 2006/07 have yet to be made.</p>

	<p pid=".847W.8/1">On March 22 we published our White Paper setting out our policies and progress in improving adult education and skills&mdash;entitled &quot;Skills : Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot;. It set out the key measures we have taken in this area, including creation of the new network of Sector Skills Councils and the successful Employer Training Pilots, both of which create a powerful new employer-led direction to skills provision. It also announced our plans for further improving adult provision, including the roll out of the National Employer Training Programme, the creation of new Skills Academies to deliver training in each sector, the national roll-out of the entitlement to free tuition to NVQ Level 2, and an improved and extended service to deliver advice and guidance on careers, training and support.</p>

	<p pid=".850W.11/2">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's National Assessment Agency (NAA), which is responsible for test administration, has awarded the 2005 contract for test marking and data collection to Pearson Assessment and Testing. NAA is working closely with Pearson to ensure that all lessons learnt from 2004 will be fed into improving test delivery in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".850W.11/3">However the review of 2004 test delivery conducted by the QCA led them to conclude that extra time is needed to mark Key Stage 3 English tests and validate results. This means that the 2005 Key Stage 3 Achievement and Attainment tables are unlikely to be published before March 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".853W.5/1">The Department's main measure for what the funding gap between school sixth-forms and further education colleges is the difference in funding rates for an AS/A2 qualification. In 2002/03 the difference was 10.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".853W.5/2">For the academic year 2003/04, base funding rates per qualification increased by 3 per cent. for school sixth-forms and by 4.5 per cent. for further education colleges on a broadly comparable basis. In 2004/05, funding rates for colleges meeting their targets increased by 5 per cent., while those for school sixth forms rose by 4 per cent.

	<p pid=".854W.8/1">The Department does not have information on what the funding gap is between school sixth forms and further education colleges in Cambridge specifically.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.8/2">However, we have brought up funding levels for further education (FE) as we said we would, without penalising schools. The Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) funding rates per course in FE have been rising faster than school sixth forms and the gap has narrowed.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.8/3">Our policy has been to raise the level of funding for colleges, as and when we are able to secure the resources to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.8/4">The current funding gap between school sixth forms and further education colleges is a direct consequence of the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act and the removal of the incorporated FE sector funding systems from local authority control. This resulted in a divergence from local authority systems which has resulted in funding level differences. These differences were made more apparent when all post-16 funding became the responsibility of the LSC in 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".855W.8/1">The Government's Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase>, sets clear priorities for public funding to support the drive to ensure that employers have the skills they need to be successful, and individuals have the skills they need to be employable and personally fulfilled. These priorities include tackling the nation's legacy of low skills, with a drive to ensure that adults have the basic skills of literacy, numeracy and English language; and focussing the investment of public funds on helping individuals reach their first full Level 2 qualification. But the White Paper also recognises the importance of higher level skills, and sets out measures to strengthen support for provision at Level 3 and above. However, given that higher levels of qualifications have higher rates of return for employers and individuals, it is also important that this should be reflected in the relative contributions employers and individuals make to the costs of such training. The Learning and Skills Council has announced that its fee assumption will rise from 25 per cent. to 27.5 per cent. in 2005/06 with public funds continuing to meet at least 72.5 per cent. of learning costs. Young people, those studying basic skills or for a first Level 2 qualification will receive free tuition as will those people on income based benefits. We shall continue to offer fee concessions to older learners on income based benefits or who receive the pension (guarantee) credit.</p>

	<p pid=".862W.2/1">The Department publishes progress against all its outstanding PSA targets in its annual departmental report and autumn performance report. Progress against our 2002 spending review targets, including the one referred to in this question, was reported most recently in the 2004 autumn report, published last November, together with commentary where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.2/2">The 2004 spending review set a new target to narrow the gap in educational achievement between looked after children and their peers and to improve their educational support and the stability of their lives. By 2008, 80 per cent. of children under 16 who have been looked after for 2.5 or more years will have been living in the same placement for at least two years, or placed for adoption. This emphasises the importance of stability as a prerequisite for raising educational achievement and is underpinned by educational performance indicators which mirror the three elements of the 2002 spending review target.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.3/2">The penalty notice for disorder scheme provides for persons who commit specified penalty offences to be issued with a fixed penalty notice instead of being prosecuted.

	<p pid=".873W.5/2">The availability of UK produced fresh fruit and vegetables is generally highly seasonal, and so use of imported produce varies throughout the year. Purchases of fruit and vegetables are recorded in many different weights and measures which cannot be converted into one standard format for reporting purposes. It is therefore not possible to estimate the percentage or quantity of fruit and vegetables originating from outside the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".873W.5/4">The Refreshment Department uses over 3,000 different food products in its catering operations, but not all are in stock at any given time; it has therefore not been possible to estimate the total proportion of food products that originate from outside the UK. However, the Department estimates that less than 5 per cent. of its fresh meat and poultry purchases originate from outside the UK. Most dairy products, including cheeses, and all fresh egg supplies are of UK origin.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.5/5">The Refreshment Department purchases alcoholic drinks for sale in the House of Commons catering outlets, and also for the House of Commons souvenir shops to sell to visitors to Parliament. Over the past 11 months, the Refreshment Department purchased 38,051 litres of beers and ciders, of which 10,992 litres (29 per cent.) were imported, and a total of 4,519 litres of aperitifs, fortified wines and spirits, of which 358 litres (8 per cent.) were imported. Of the total wine purchases of almost 57,000 litres during the past 11 months, over 54,000 litres (95.3 per cent.) were produced outside the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.5/1">The Refreshment Department regularly seeks the advice of the Catering Committee on the sourcing of beers for sale through its catering outlets. In the House of Commons bars, the Department offers for sale one draught ale, generally changed weekly, that is specifically sourced from a member of the Society of Independent Brewers and supplied by their distributor, East West Ales. The Department also sells beers from Young's and Co. (Wandsworth) in certain bars. Other beers sold throughout the House of Commons bars and at functions catered by the Refreshment Department are supplied by the Department's principal nominated beer supplier. This contract, which is currently in the process of being competitively tendered in accordance with the EU Procurement Regulations, and has been advertised in appropriate trade publications, includes a requirement for the supply of a regularly changed British regional ale, to be expressly purchased by the Department's nominated beer supplier for supply to the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.5/2">The Refreshment Department is also in the process of tendering a contract for the supply of a House of Commons gift ale pack for sale through its souvenir and gift shops. The Society of Independent Brewers have provided a list of all their members who produce bottled beers and these producers have been invited with others to attend a meeting with the Refreshment Department's Purchasing Manager.</p>

	<p pid=".875W.2/2">I recognise that many customers of the Refreshment Department are supportive of sustainable food initiatives. The Refreshment Department's business plan for 2005&ndash;06 acknowledges the need to develop a formal policy on this matter. Subsequent to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-26">26 October 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-10-26.1095W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1095W</phrase>, the Refreshment Department Purchasing Manager had a constructive initial discussion with Sustain, an organisation formed in 1999 by merging the National Food Alliance and the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment Alliance. Sustain are keen to assist the Department in the development of a responsible purchasing policy that supports sustainable food supplies, including the consideration of food miles. Further progress has been delayed pending completion of organisational changes within Sustain, but the Refreshment Department hopes to be able to pursue this matter over the next few months.</p>

	<p pid=".881W.5/1">One of our guiding principles for pension reform is that the pensions system should produce fair outcomes for women. This has been a key principle that has been inherent in our action so far and will guide our approach in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/2">Through pension credit we have significantly improved the income of the poorest pensioners, the majority of whom are women. Since 1997, we have lifted 1.8 million pensioners out of abject poverty, two thirds of whom are women. As the Pensions Commission Report noted, male and female pensioners now receive a similar level of state benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/3">In addition, almost all of the 1.9 million carers and around 65 per cent. of the 5.8 million low earners who will benefit from the introduction of the state second pension are women. Other measures, such as winter fuel payments, free TV licences and one-off payments have been especially beneficial to women as they are targeted on older pensioners, the majority of whom are women.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/4">We are publishing a report on women and pensions to look at women's pension provision in more detail later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".885W.5/1">While there is merit in clarifying minimum standards for business in relation to human rights, we believe that future action on this agenda should take into account the many codes and initiatives which exist in this field, rather than focussing exclusively on the draft norms. These include the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises, the International Labour Organisation Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy and the UN Global Compact. This approach is in line with the recent report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.5/2">Through the Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights, a number of multinational companies have been &quot;road-testing&quot; the draft norms, using the content to inform their codes of practice. This process will continue until December 2006. In addition, the FTSE4Good benchmark takes the draft norms into account in its assessment of companies' performance. And some potential investors consider the draft norms in their requirement for &quot;human rights impact assessments&quot;.</p>

We work extensively to convince others to face up to these threats and to help them do so. All such efforts make it harder for terrorists and proliferators to operate and so help reduce the threat from nuclear terrorism.</p>

My right hon. and noble Friend the Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, Minister of State at the FCO, has also been closely involved in the International Atomic Energy Agency International Conference on Nuclear Security held in London last week, which discussed the significant risks to the international community posed by the threat of malicious acts involving nuclear and other radioactive materials and their associated facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.2/2">We share Senator Nunn's assessment of the urgency of this threat. The UK is developing its nuclear security programme under the Global Partnership and has recently announced a contract to undertake an upgrade of physical security at a key Russian Nuclear Research Centre. The contract, to be managed by experts from the British Nuclear Group, will focus on the Nikiet Institute in the centre of Moscow. It is one of Russia's leading nuclear research centres. The project is worth up to &pound;2 million and will focus on the provision of physical protection upgrades on fencing, lighting, CCTV and access control systems. We hope that further such projects will roll out as nuclear security work becomes an increasingly important part of the Global Partnership programmes. Overall, in this financial year the UK will have spent &pound;35.5 million on nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation programmes across the former Soviet Union.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.6/1">Within the national health service national programme for information technology (NPfIT) a system for the electronic transmission of prescriptions (ETP) will make it easier for general practitioners (GPs) or other prescribers to issue prescriptions and more convenient for patients to collect their medicines. Prescriptions will be transferred electronically to a pharmacist or other dispensing contractor and to the Prescription Pricing Authority to authorise payment. Following development work, the ETP service went live successfully at an initial GP practice and community pharmacy in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/2">Discussions with other potential initial implementer sites are underway. The purpose of the initial implementer sites is to prove the system, and to look at local prescribing and dispensing processes in light of the introduction of the new service. This will ensure that the benefits of the new service are maximised and lessons learned before a wider roll out.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/3">The national programme has brought together GP and community pharmacy user groups to provide advice and guidance during the development and implementation of the service. For the time being patients will continue to get a paper prescription.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/4">A wider roll out of the service will commence later in the year, with full implementation expected by 2007.</p>

	<p pid=".916W.2/1">The public service agreement (PSA) targets for smoking prevalence in 2010 were set in summer 2004. A delivery plan for the White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, has been developed in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders to contribute to achieving the PSA target.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.2/2">The delivery plan, together with the tobacco control strategy currently in place, will see an expansion of the national health service stop smoking services and additional support to help smokers quit; further measures to reduce peoples exposure to second-hand smoke; further restrictions on tobacco advertising and promotion; continued highly effective national smoking campaigns; work with Her Majesty's Customs and Excise to reduce the supply of smuggled and counterfeit tobacco and measures to combat underage sales. All these measures will contribute to delivery of the PSA target.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.2/3">Latest prevalence figures, for 2003, published in December 2004 are shown in the following table.</p>
