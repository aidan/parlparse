The predominant farms in Lancashire are Dairy, Less Favoured Areas (LFA) grazing livestock and non LFA grazing livestock and incomes on these farms are expected to have increased in 2008-09. In each of years 2003-04 to 2007-08 inclusive, incomes at the all farm types level were slightly higher in Lancashire than for the North West Government Office region as a whole. The balance sheet position of Lancashire farms is also favourable.</p>

To help local authorities do this, DEFRA operates an Air Quality Grant scheme, a capital grant for which local authorities bid. All local authorities are invited each year to bid for a grant. Applications are considered and, where successful, awards made towards the cost of air quality projects.

	<p pid="c.8W.2/1">The following figures show the reported number of thefts/losses of laptops from 2005. The recent increases should be seen against the background of a significant increase in the numbers of laptops in use; for example, the numbers of IBM laptops issued across the DEFRA network under the enabling contract has increased more than six fold from some 1,200 in 2005 to over 7,500 in 2009, as we have gradually replaced desktops with encrypted laptops to reduce environmental impacts and make it easier for staff to work remotely.</p>

Government have been working with the food industry to identify ways of reducing the sector's environmental impacts overall, and in doing so, improving efficiency across the supply chain. In response to recommendations made in the Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (DEFRA, May 2006), the British Retail Consortium developed a set of commitments to reduce their members' environmental impacts and the Food and Drink Federation developed their Five-Fold Ambition. Both these initiatives set targets to reduce the environmental impacts of food transport in the UK. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) is also spearheading a voluntary initiative on 'sustainable distribution' for the food and grocery industry.</p>

	<p pid="c.13W.5/1">Council Directive (2002/3/EC) sets target values for ozone for the protection of human health and ecosystems, to be attained by 2010. Ground level ozone is formed when sunlight acts on nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and other atmospheric substances close to the ground. The pollutants that cause ground level ozone come from a range of sources including industry and combustion sources such as road transport and power generation. Ozone formation can take place over several hours or days and may arise from emissions thousands of kilometres away.</p>
	<p pid="c.13W.5/2">Emissions of ozone precursors across the EU are controlled by the National Emissions Ceilings Directive (2001/81/EC) which sets limits on the amounts of NOx and VOC's that each member state can emit annually, with ceilings to be met by 2010. The 1999 Gothenburg Protocol does the same for a larger group of countries under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Europe. The UK is currently below its 2010 VOC ceiling and is committed to meeting its NOx ceiling as soon as possible.</p>

As it will enter service later this year, there has not yet been an assessment of its performance in theatre. The vehicle has, however, successfully passed stringent mine blast protection tests. I cannot comment on the levels of protection afforded by the vehicle, as disclosure could prejudice the security of the armed forces.</p>

The original principles determining the basic pay of members of CNC (up to and including superintendent ranks) is that it is linked to the pay of corresponding members of the MOD police (MDP), which in turn is linked to that of Home Office police taking account of the 95 per cent. weighting (i.e. MDP and CNC pay is set at 95 per cent. of Home Office police force pay). Any decision to review these arrangements would fall within the responsibilities of the civil nuclear police authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.6/1">Our present estimate is that, in round terms, of the emissions reductions in 2006 below the increase that would otherwise have occurred since 1990, structural changes in the economy linked to changing patterns of imports and exports were responsible for about 30 per cent. Improvements in energy efficiency accounted for about 20 per cent., lower carbon fuels about 25 per cent. (made up of 15 per cent. from the so-called dash for gas and about 10 per cent. from renewables and other lower carbon fuels). Lower emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 were responsible for some 25 per cent. The direct effect of Government policies overlaps with the estimates given above and is likely to have accounted for about 15 per cent. The effect of emissions trading in 2006 is not included in these estimates but if included would in 2006 have increased the emissions reduction by about 10 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.46W.8/1">Schools, including mainstream nursery schools, have a duty in law to promote race equality and it is compulsory for them to have measures in place to prevent and tackle bullying, whatever the motivation. In March 2006 we published specialist guidance on bullying around race, religion and culture which focused on preventing and tackling racist bullying in schools and included material on bullying related to anti-Semitism.</p>
	<p pid="c.46W.8/2">We intend also next year to introduce a new statutory duty on schools to record all incidents of bullying between pupils. We will consult on this in the autumn and also on whether schools should be obliged to report these incidents to their local authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.50W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/2">The answers to the question are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/3"><i> (a)</i> Digital switchover itself does not require any equipment to be thrown away. Virtually any analogue TV can be converted to digital with the addition of a set-top box. We recognise that some consumers may use digital switchover as an opportunity to upgrade their TV and/or to dispose of analogue TV equipment (TVs and recorders). Research undertaken for DEFRA and DTI in 2006 indicated that switchover was not expected to cause any significant overall increase in TV or recorder disposals. For example, it predicted a 1 per cent. increase in recorder disposals. There is no current evidence to show of additional disposal of equipment that can be attributed to digital switchover.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/4"><i> (b)</i> No estimate has been made on equipment that may be redundant on the roll-out of Universal Broadband Access. Whether or not equipment would be made obsolete will depend on the technologies used to provide the universal service. This will be determined by the procurement process, and the subsequent bids from providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/5"><i> (c)</i><i> </i>Ofcom's research in September 2008 showed that about 45.9 million analogue-only radio devices were in use in the UK at least once a week. In addition their research showed that there were about 22.5 million cars with an analogue-only radio. There are no plans to close all services which these radios can receive. However to enable these radios to continue to receive a full range of services, in Digital Britain: Final Report we urge manufacturers to look closely at the market opportunities for DAB to 'FM re-broadcasters', a set-top box solution for analogue radio, as a means of allowing existing analogue radios to receive DAB in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.56W.2/2">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have therefore asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/5" class="indent">and;</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/6" class="indent">What steps are taken to monitor the income and maintenance liability of non-resident parents in respect of whom the Child Support Agency has made nil maintenance calculations.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/7" class="indent">The terms, basic, reduced, and flat rate maintenance apply to current scheme cases only. The information you have requested for compliant non-resident parents in these categories is shown in the attached table. Compliance is defined as those non-resident parents in each quarter who have paid maintenance. Non-compliant non-resident parents are those from whom maintenance has been requested but who have not paid maintenance in the previous quarter. Therefore I have also included information on non-compliant cases assessed at the basic, reduced, flat rate maintenance for current scheme cases only in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/8" class="indent">It should be noted that the compliance measure has been replaced by the more useful maintenance outcomes measure, which includes both those cases where the non-resident parent pays maintenance direct to the parent with care and those cases with a maintenance assessment but which have yet to be asked for maintenance. This is a more accurate measure of the impact the Commission is having on improving the proportion of parents paying maintenance. I have therefore also set out the number of cases with a positive maintenance outcome under the categories you have requested in the attached Table 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/9" class="indent">In addition to the information on basic, reduced and flat rate current scheme cases set out in the attached table, in the quarter to March 2009 there were 106,300 current scheme cases with a nil maintenance assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/10" class="indent">The Child Support Agency is required to recalculate the maintenance liability when either parent provides information indicating that relevant circumstances have changed. It does not contact clients who have not reported any change to review their current maintenance liability.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/11" class="indent">Under the future statutory child maintenance scheme, the Commission will calculate maintenance liability based on a non-resident parent's gross income. This information will be provided by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and will be for the latest available tax year. Maintenance liability will also be reviewed annually with updated information received from HMRC, ensuring that in cases where neither parent has reported a change of circumstances any change in gross income will be notified to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/12" class="indent">As with the current scheme, either parent will be able to notify the Commission of a change of circumstances which affects gross income and therefore maintenance liability. Cases with a change of circumstances which would trigger a review of a nil maintenance calculation can be reassessed without waiting for confirmation of the gross income from HMRC. It is intended that this new statutory maintenance scheme will be introduced from 2011, with existing cases moving to the new scheme over a period of 3 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.56W.2/13" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.57W.3/6" class="indent">In the old scheme, the income of both the parent with care and the non-resident parent is taken into account where the Child Support Agency calculates the amount of child maintenance that the non-resident parent should pay. The personal circumstances of both parents are recognised in the assessment process insofar that the Agency must take into account the amount each parent pays in housing costs, for example, and also in the inclusion of certain allowances where parents have to support dependant children.</p>
	<p pid="c.57W.3/7" class="indent">The process for the current scheme is more straightforward. The amount of maintenance that should be paid is based solely on the net weekly income of the non-resident parent, and the circumstances of the parent with care are not taken into account. However, if there are any children residing in the non-resident parent's household then the net weekly income on which the maintenance assessment is based will be reduced by a set percentage, prior to a maintenance calculation being completed. A further reduction may also apply if the non-resident parent is on a low income.</p>

	<p pid="c.66W.2/5" class="indent">The Disability Discrimination Act requires all providers of public services to ensure that services to customers can be accessed by all, whether that is in regard to the physical office environments or by other means. Our departmental policy on provision of services requires us to ensure that both offices and processes do not discriminate against any of our customers&mdash;this includes the range of seating components in use in our public offices.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/6" class="indent">All our components are designed and risk assessed with the full business process in mind, for example taking account of waiting times at any particular stage and considering comfort alongside safety. There is also a range of chairs, which are available for our customers should any individual have a particular problem for example, waiting seating with high or low backs and a height adjustable chair can be offered if necessary. If any of our customers have any real difficulty with accessing services in an office, however, we are always able to offer other options to meet the need, for example home visits or call back arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/7" class="indent">Disability access audits were also introduced during the rollout of Jobcentre Plus, to ensure that where physically possible, our offices provided suitable access for all groups, including customers with mobility and sensory impairments.</p>

	<p pid="c.69W.5/2">The Government recognise that work is the best way out of poverty and actively encourages customers to take up employment; this includes part-time and casual work.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.5/3">In order to incentivise the uptake of part-time and casual employment and to make it easier to move back onto benefit, Jobcentre Plus has introduced a rapid reclaim process. This means that where a customer returns to jobseeker's allowance within 26 weeks the claim process is shortened and the return to benefit is simpler and quicker.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.5/4">Customers can also undertake part-time or casual employment and remain on jobseeker's allowance provided that they work for less than 16 hours per week. For those who work over 16 hours in a job that they expect that work to continue for at least four weeks, working tax credit may be available.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.5/5">There is no specific guidance for Jobcentre Plus staff in respect of jobseeker's allowance benefit recipients wishing to do part-time or casual employment. However, advisers are fully aware of jobseeker's allowance regulations about part-time work and actively encourage those wishing to undertake part-time or casual work while still assisting them in finding full-time work.</p>

	<p pid="c.72W.5/1">No single measure captures all aspects of poverty&mdash;as a result PSA 17 includes a range of indicators related to low income for pensioners. These are relative low income (below 50 and 60 per cent. contemporary median household income), and absolute low income (below 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices), after housing costs are taken into account. The low income threshold varies for each household to take into account variations in both the size and composition of a household. For example, the threshold for a single pensioner living alone is different to that of a single pensioner living with grown-up children. However, in both cases they would be entitled to the same amount of pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/2">The information requested in the question is not available. Furthermore, raising the value of guarantee credit for couples to the level of the 60 per cent. threshold would be insufficient to ensure that no pensioner remains below that threshold because of those pensioners who do not take up the benefits to which they are entitled.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/3">It is not possible to predict in advance the value of low income thresholds. Any projection of the median for the population as a whole would be subject to uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution and individual behavioural responses to policy changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase> the pension credit standard minimum guarantee increased by the largest amount since it was introduced in 2003. It increased to &pound;130 a week for single pensioners or &pound;198.45 for a couple. The Government are committed to tackling pensioner poverty and is continuing to promote take-up of benefits by those who are entitled.</p>

	<p pid="c.77W.0/1">No final decisions have been made as to exactly what information will be collected for the new Specialist Disability Employment Programme. We are currently considering what level of detail it is desirable and practical to collect on customers' impairment types.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.0/2">In addition, independent evaluation will be an important element of the new programme. It will seek to investigate the extent to which the programme meets its objectives and critical success factors.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.0/3">The first element of the new programme is called Work Entry Support. Its aim is to offer a range of services and support to help disabled customers with the highest support needs enter paid employment, whether it be unsupported in the open market place or supported employment. With support from the provider, we expect that the majority of customers will be able to do this within nine months of starting on the programme. If they have not been successful in finding suitable employment at this point, then the provider will work with and agree with the customer a detailed action plan, which will offer advice on how they should move forward to help them either move into employment in the future or possibly return to the programme at a later date, which ever is most appropriate to their individual needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.86W.5/1">The number of foreign national prisoners serving a mandatory and discretionary life sentence and who were subsequently released from custody was not, before April 2007, recorded centrally. To answer the question would require a manual exercise checking every release of a mandatory and discretionary lifer during the period in question and this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.86W.5/2">However, since April 2007 the Public Protection Unit Database (PPUD) has recorded the nationality of prisoners being released. In 2007, there were three foreign national prisoners serving a mandatory life sentence and who were released from custody. There were no discretionary life sentence prisoners, identified as foreign nationals, who were released in 2007. As with any large scale recording system, it is subject to possible errors arising from either data entry or processing.</p>
	<p pid="c.86W.5/3">Details of prisoners released are published &quot;Offender Management Caseload Statistics&quot; published by Offender Management and Sentencing Analytical Services, Ministry of Justice. This bulletin is available in the Library of the House and is available at:</p>
	<p pid="c.86W.5/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics</a></p>
	<p pid="c.86W.5/5">The 2008 figures will be published in Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2008 at the end of July 2009. The publication of this bulletin has been pre-announced on the Ministry of Justice and United Kingdom Statistics Authority websites.</p>
	<p pid="c.86W.5/6">To provide the 2008 figures for foreign national prisoners released would constitute providing a breakdown of an as yet unpublished figure. This would breach the code of practice for statistics and so cannot be provided until after this publication.</p>
	<p pid="c.86W.5/7">It is for the independent Parole Board to determine whether to direct the release of life sentence prisoners and will do so only if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary on the grounds of public protection for the prisoner to be detained in custody.</p>

	<p pid="c.105W.1/1">I refer the hon. Members to the statement I made to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-15">15 June 2009</phrase>, to my letters of 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-22">22 June 2009</phrase> to the right hon. Sir John Chilcot GCB and his reply to me of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-21">21 June 2009</phrase>, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

	<p pid="c.105W.1/2">As Chairman, it is for Sir John, in consultation with the Inquiry Committee members, to take decisions on how the inquiry conducts its work, and he will make public his intentions. The Cabinet Office, as the sponsoring department for the inquiry, is taking forward work on the Government's support to and liaison with the inquiry, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments. We will continue to update the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/3" class="italic"> Letter from <i> t</i> he Prime Minister, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-17">17 June 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/4" class="indent">I would like to thank you for agreeing to Chair the Iraq Inquiry. As I said in Parliament, I believe this Inquiry will, through lessons learned, strengthen our diplomacy, our military and our democracy. I am fully committed to a thorough and independent inquiry, and guarantee the full co-operation of the Government. As Privy Counsellors, you will have unhindered access to government documents. I have written to all relevant current and former Ministers to underline the importance of their full cooperation. And the Cabinet Secretary is writing to departments to underline the need for full transparency,</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/5" class="indent">It is essential that all those appearing before the Inquiry do so with the greatest possible candour and openness, and that the Inquiry itself proceeds as efficiently as possible, while maintaining full public confidence in the integrity of the process and without in any way damaging national security. Once you have met, as I have suggested, the Leaders of the other political parties and the Chairs of the relevant parliamentary Select Committees it would be helpful if you could set out how you and your colleagues think these objectives can best be met in the way that the Inquiry is conducted.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/6" class="indent">I hope as part of this that you will consider whether it is possible for there to be a process whereby they give their contributions on oath.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/7" class="indent">It is also essential that the families of those who gave their lives in Iraq are properly consulted on the nature of the inquiry. I hope therefore that you will be able to meet them as part of the preparations and as you continue your work, to explain how you are proceeding. This could be, at their request, in public or private.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/8" class="indent">Once you have established your plans in more detail, I would encourage you to hold an open session to explain in greater depth the significant scope and breadth of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/9" class="indent">I wish you and your Committee well with your important task, and look forward to your conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/10" class="italic"> Letter from Sir John Chilcot, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-21">21 June 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/11" class="indent">Thank you for your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-17">17 June</phrase> about the Iraq Inquiry. I am grateful for your assurance of the Government's commitment to a thorough and independent inquiry, and for the steps that have already been taken with former and current Ministers, and Departments, to ensure full cooperation, transparency and access to government documents. I welcome the fact that I and my colleagues are free to decide independently how best to fulfil our remit.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/12" class="indent">I am for my part wholly committed to the search for the lessons to be learned for the future from events and experience of the last seven and more years, to uphold the integrity of the process of inquiry and the need to ensure public confidence in it, and to ensure complete candour and openness from witnesses while protecting national security. I will indeed, as you suggest, examine how best, given the non-judicial nature of the Inquiry, a formal undertaking can be given by witnesses that their contributions will be complete, truthful and accurate.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/13" class="indent">If a judicial inquiry, or a statutory Tribunal of Inquiry, had been established, then I would not have been asked to take on this responsibility. That would have required an extended process, with legal representation for the tribunal, witnesses, and other interested parties. That is not what we have been asked to conduct. To find without extended delay the key lessons for the future from the Iraq experience is however something I believe is well worthwhile.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/14" class="indent">I have as you suggested begun a process of consultation with the Leaders of the main Opposition parties, and with the Chairs of the relevant Parliamentary Select Committees (Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Public Administration as well as the Intelligence and Security Committee). I see this as helping the Inquiry to decide how best we can structure our procedures to fulfil our remit and meet the objectives we have been set. When these consultations have been completed, I expect to be in a position, having taken them fully into account, to say in more detail how we will propose to take the Inquiry forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/15" class="indent">As part of that, it will, I wholeheartedly agree, be essential to ensure that the families of those who gave their lives in Iraq, or were seriously affected by the conflict, have an early opportunity to express their views about the nature and procedures of the Inquiry, and to express them either in public or in private as they prefer. That will be important in helping us to decide how to go about the task, and explain what we are going to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/16" class="indent">I have also concluded that the Inquiry will need expert assessors at the highest level, including in military, legal, and international development and reconstruction matters, and I have already begun to identify people who may be willing to serve in that capacity. Then, when we have settled on how we are going to go about the Inquiry, I am sure it is right that we should explain this in open session.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/17" class="indent">More broadly, I believe it will be essential to hold as much of the proceedings of the Inquiry as possible in public, consistent with the need to protect national security and to ensure and enable complete candour in the oral and written evidence from witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/18" class="indent">One important point which has not received much public notice so far is that examining and analysing the very large body of existing documentary evidence, stretching over seven or more years, will necessarily occupy a significant part of the time available to the Inquiry, especially in the early stages, and by definition that part of the process cannot be conducted in public sessions. The results of that examination and analysis will, however, be crucial in guiding the selection of witnesses and the detailed questions that will then need to be answered. I expect our report will publish all the relevant evidence except where national security considerations prevent that.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/19" class="indent">A particular suggestion which has been made is that the Inquiry might make an interim report, possibly on the run-up to the war, or up to the moment when the coalition assumed responsibility for Iraq's internal affairs. While I do not rule out the possibility, it seems to me clear that the causes and effects of particular phases of these events cannot simply be divided up so as to separate clearly one period from another. To take one obvious example, the existence or otherwise of weapons of mass destruction could not be established with any reliability until well after the conflict phase, after the work of the Iraq Survey Group and others had gone as far as it could, while before the event the outstanding possibility had significant implications for the military deployment into the initial conflict phase.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/20" class="indent">Because we will need to give careful attention to what comes out of the consultation processes I have outlined, I am, as I said, not yet in a position to state in more detail exactly how we will conduct the Inquiry. It is however already clear to me that as much as possible of the work of the Inquiry as is consistent with fulfilling our remit should be conducted, or explained, in public.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/21" class="italic"> Letter from the Prime Minister, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-22">22 June 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/22" class="indent">Thank you for your letter. I remain grateful that you have agreed to Chair the Independent Inquiry and welcome your interim response in your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-21">21 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/23" class="indent">I am grateful you agree with me on the process which has been established to consult with leaders of the main Opposition parties, and with the Chairs of the relevant Parliamentary Select Committees. I share the view that this will help the Inquiry decide how best to structure its procedures to fulfil the remit and meet the objectives we have set.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/24" class="indent">I believe the proposals we have discussed to ensure the families of those who gave their lives in Iraq, or who were seriously affected by the conflict, will be able to be involved at the earliest opportunity in the work of the Inquiry remain extremely important. Allowing them to express their views about the nature and procedures of the Inquiry, and being able to express these either in public or in private is essential.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/25" class="indent">As an independent Inquiry, as I said in the House of Commons last week, the methodology employed by the Inquiry is a matter for you. The Inquiry should decide on its structure, but I welcome the proposals for the process of the Inquiry as set out in your letter today. I believe your proposals will manage to meet both the need not to compromise national security but also enable the Independent Inquiry also to hold public sessions helping to build public confidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/26" class="indent">I share your view that the Inquiry will obviously need expert assessors and I am pleased you have already identified several who will be willing to serve in that capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/27" class="indent">I am pleased that you intend to set out how these experts will be used and other matters explaining how you will go about the Inquiry in an open session.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/28" class="indent">I am grateful for your views that you will continue to examine whether witnesses can give evidence under oath or a similar formal undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.1/29" class="indent">Following further work and consultations by you, I look forward to hearing your final proposals as soon as possible.</p>

The aim is not just to pursue the criminals involved, many of whom operate beyond the reach of our courts but also provide long-term solutions for harm reduction on the internet.

	<p pid="c.141W.3/3">The number of subject profiles held on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals. A proportion of DNA profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded on more then one occasion (this may be because the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because of upgrading of profiles). It is currently estimated that 13.5 per cent. of subject profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. The replication rate of 13.5 per cent. should only be applied over the entire database however, as the replication rate for individual forces varies considerably. The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database.</p>

	<p pid="c.143W.2/1">The Drug System Change Pilots programme is not a source of new money for service delivery. The aim of the programme is to improve outcomes for communities and individuals by encouraging partnerships to make better use of existing resources, align the efforts of all partners and key stakeholders, encourage innovation and share best practice, and to identify efficiencies that can come from the pooling of budgets, streamlined communication and information systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.143W.2/2">Joint funding (&pound;2 million from the Home Office and Department of Health) has been allocated to kickstart the pilots in 2009-10, and to help build capacity by funding the appointment of a project manager and administrative support in those pilot sites which require it.</p>
	<p pid="c.143W.2/3">A tendering process for the independent evaluation of the programme is currently being undertaken, and it is hoped that this will be completed, and an independent contractor appointed, by September 2009. The intention is that, based on the reports from the contractor and the pilot sites, updates on progress from the Drug System Change Pilots will be made available on a quarterly basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.145W.8/1">The Forensic Science Regulator sets out the quality standards and accreditation that are required for all forensic practitioners, including private forensic laboratory service providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.8/2">Under the national forensic framework agreement, private forensic providers must comply with the standards set by the Forensic Science Regulator to be eligible to provide forensic services to police forces (in England and Wales). This is a mandatory clause contained within the framework agreement. The current standard requirements include ISO9001 quality management systems, 17025, and where appropriate 17020 compliance for each speciality area of work performed.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.8/3">At a national level, the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) manages the framework agreement on behalf of the 43 police forces and ensures that these quality standards are held by the participating suppliers and that they are maintained. The private companies themselves undergo annual inspection for compliance with the standards which is carried out by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). UKAS report any failings in compliance to the Forensic Regulator, who then passes relevant information on to the NPIA. If any action is required in terms of contract management, or there has been a breach of contract terms, the NPIA will address this through formal contract management processes with the supplier concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.8/4">To monitor the adequacy of any services being performed throughout the life of a forensic services provision contract, key performance indicators (KPIs) have been developed. These KPIs are reviewed at regular intervals.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.8/5">This performance monitoring regime also includes regular contract management meetings between the suppliers and the police force and strategic business reviews carried out by the NPIA on behalf of Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.8/6">The regime is being designed to ensure that the services being provided by the private forensic suppliers are adequate to meet the operational needs of the police force. This also ensures that high quality standards set by the Forensic Science Regulator continue to be complied with, throughout the length of any service contract and for the lifetime of the national forensic framework agreement itself.</p>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Cause code</i><br/> The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. The field within HES counts only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode. The codes used are: W53, W54,<br/> W55, W57, W58. and W59.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.166W.1/1">Patient safety will be paramount in taking forward the work on generic substitution. It has long been the Department's policy to encourage generic prescribing where possible, for reasons of good professional practice and because of the opportunities for more effective use of national health service resources. However, we have always recognised that there are circumstances in which it may be clinically appropriate to prescribe a particular brand of drug even where a generic is available if the prescriber considers it essential for the patient to receive that specific product. This position will need to be maintained under any new specific proposals made as part of the work on generic substitution.</p>
	<p pid="c.166W.1/2">In addition, as stated in the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) of December 2008, in implementing generic substitution, provision may also be made to exclude certain categories of medicines for clinical reasons in the interests of patient safety. No decisions have yet been made on whether any medicines and, if so, which should be excluded from the arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.166W.1/3">The detail of implementing the PPRS generic substitution provision is still being considered. No cost-benefit analysis, estimation of possible numbers of patients affected by or potential savings from the implementation of generic substitution in relation to anti-epileptic drugs have been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.166W.1/4">A number of patient representative groups, such as those representing epilepsy sufferers, have written to the Department expressing their concerns on the implementation of generic substitution. Whilst we have not yet met with any such groups, nor with clinicians operating in the field of epilepsy, we want to make sure we engage with all stakeholders in the best way possible and are currently considering how best to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.178W.5/1">The National Programme for Information Technology (IT) is a long-term programme which presents an unprecedented opportunity to use YY to reform the way the national health service in England uses information, and to improve health services and patient care. As reported by the National Audit Office in May 2008, elements of the programme are already fully deployed across the NHS, some ahead of schedule. The NHS could not now function without the systems and services the programme has delivered.</p>
	<p pid="c.178W.5/2">In line with best practice, the new TV services are being implemented incrementally across the NHS throughout the duration of the programme, with increasingly richer functionality being provided in successive software releases. For example, it is likely to be 2014-15 before all trusts have fully deployed systems to support the NHS care records service, though some should receive final releases of the software much sooner.</p>

	<p pid="c.192W.5/1">Due to changes in our operations and maintenance service providers, BIS can only provide data on spend on energy efficiency measures for its predecessors for the past two years. The amounts spent are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.192W.5/4"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.192W.5/9">BIS is continuing to work towards achieving the energy efficiency targets expressed in the Sustainable Operation of the Government Estate (SOGE) framework. Our main strategy has been to gain efficiencies through a reduction in the physical size of the estate and the number of buildings, occupied by the introduction of new ways of working, including flexible desking. As a result the size of the BIS estate has been reduced by 58 per cent. and its overall carbon footprint has been cut by 26 per cent. since the baseline year of 1999-2000. Energy consumption has reduced across the whole estate by 11.2 per cent. since 1999-2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.192W.5/10">The Department has recently undertaken energy audits across its estate. Projects identified to reduce carbon emissions include using lighting controls more effectively (e.g. &pound;11,000 p.a. savings on improved lighting for the 1 Victoria Street underground car park), improved building management controls at our HQ buildings at 1 Victoria Street and Kingsgate House, piloting the use of LED technology in 1 Victoria Street and the installation of Automated Metering and Targeting across the HQ estate. Although it is too early to evaluate the latter, it has already led to the identification of instances where plant has been running when not necessary.</p>

	<p pid="c.200W.2/3">The Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills (BIS) will administer this fund; however the &pound;250 million low carbon element will be allocated only to those initiatives that have been jointly agreed between BIS and the Department of Energy and Climate Change.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.2/4">The aim of the fund is to help ensure that the UK remains well positioned to emerge from the economic downturn in a globally competitive position. All proposals will be appraised in line with Green Book principles, particularly to ensure that they provide good value for money in delivering longer term benefits to the UK economy, as well as ensuring there are clear delivery mechanisms and monitoring and evaluation procedures in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.2/5">Work is moving at pace to agree how the money will be allocated. Investments will be prioritised on where there are economic opportunities for UK-based businesses and where government action can make a real and beneficial impact.</p>

Within the context of that document the Government will be bringing forward more detailed statements of policy in the weeks and months ahead. A number of these may draw on the Strategic Investment Fund. Naturally, as these are strategic investment opportunities there will be a time lag between agreement of proposals and funds being spent.</p>

	<p pid="c.201W.0/1">The uplift in tuition charges in the 2010-11 academic year will have no impact on disposable income for students in receipt of student support. The maximum tuition fee is set to increase by 2.04 per cent. in 2010-11 and the maximum tuition fee loan will increase by the same amount to reflect this rise. Therefore all students will continue to have the full cost of their tuition fees covered in the form of a tuition fee loan.</p>

As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-01">1 June 2009</phrase>, the Student Loans Company (SLC) held &pound;1.4 million which had not been applied to customers' accounts due to data matching issues.

As set out in the Digital Britain White Paper published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-16">16 June 2009</phrase> the Government do not wish to see a widening digital divide. Therefore the Government expect that individuals entitled to social telephony packages would also be exempt from the broadband levy to fund the deployment of next generation networks.</p>
