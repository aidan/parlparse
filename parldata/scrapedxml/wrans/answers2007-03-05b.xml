	<p pid="b.1633W.12/1">The UK is spending &pound;270 million over three years to support the Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy. DFID's main role in an effective counter narcotics strategy is to promote alternative, legal livelihoods. We also provide policy advice to key ministries on how best to do this. Our Livelihoods Programme, worth nearly &pound;150 million from 2006-09, helps support Afghan national priority programmes aimed at developing legal livelihood opportunities as alternatives to poppy farming. We seek to mainstream counter narcotics elements throughout our programme as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.12/2">DFID's support for the National Rural Access Programme (NRAP) is helping to build essential infrastructure such as irrigation schemes, roads and bridges. These provide much-needed infrastructure for economic development and jobs for Afghans at the same time. DFID gave &pound;18 million to NRAP in 2005-06. The programme has already generated over 15 million days of labour, and nearly 9,500 km of roads have been built or repaired. Schools, health clinics and water schemes have also been constructed or repaired.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.12/3">DFID is providing &pound;17 million between 2006-09 to the National Solidarity Programme (NSP). This enables local communities to identify their own development needs through the setting up of elected Community Development Councils (CDCs). NSP has now established over 16,000 CDCs across Afghanistan, and funded over 22,000 projects in the areas of agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power supply, transport, and water supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.12/4">Our support to the Micro-Finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA) is helping Afghans to invest in income-generating activities and increase their savings. DFID is providing &pound;20 million over three years (2006-09) to help provide small loans to the poor, who cannot otherwise get credit. So far, over &pound;90 million of small loans has been given to over 230,000 Afghan families, tailors, shopkeepers, farmers and others to invest and increase their savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.12/5">The UK is also contributing &pound;30 million over three years to the UN-administered Counter Narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF) to help the Afghan Government implement various rural livelihood projects through its National Drug Control Strategy. DFID has recently agreed to provide &pound;7 million over three years towards a World Bank programme to help farmers improve high value horticulture and livestock products in Afghanistan, with a focus on poppy growing areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1635W.5/1">Gender is an integral part of DFID's core business to eliminate poverty overseas.

	<p pid="b.1635W.5/2">In line with the commitment in the Government's recent White Paper (July 2006) to give greater priority to gender equality, DFID carried out an evaluation of how effective the Department has been at achieving gender equality and women's empowerment. This led to the development of a three year gender equality action plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1636W.5/1">DFID is one partner among others on the multi-donor Education for All (EFA)&mdash;Fast Track Initiative (FTI). In its capacity as the host to the EFA-FTI, the World Bank recently carried out a study on the effectiveness of FTI on behalf of all FTI Partners. The Progress Report, with which DFID broadly agreed, states that the FTI has made significant impact on the ground; led to increases in enrolment in some FTI endorsed countries and substantial progress has been made on donor harmonisation and coordination.</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.5/2">Since its inception in 2002, 29 countries have been endorsed and FTI has helped in building in-country processes; targeting countries with limited external assistance and is developing a potential strategy for harnessing and mobilising long-term predictable financing. FTI has acted as a catalyst in resource mobilisation alongside increased bilateral allocations to basic education in 'FTI endorsed' countries. Additionally, a recent World Bank funded study on the effectiveness of Global Funds/Partnerships at country level to the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (DAC-OECD), found FTI to be a good model for aid effectiveness based on the Paris Principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.5/3">The FTI Progress Report is available on FTI website and more information about the FTI can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1638W.2/1">The major influx of Darfuri refugees with livestock into Chad took place in 2004 and 2005. During this time, livestock suffered greatly with the long distances travelled, the sudden increase in stress on pastures and the lack of available water. Since this influx, UNHCR, with its implementing partners, have stabilised the livestock situation in and around the 12 refugee camps in eastern Chad. UNHCR estimate that there are approximately 60,000 animals owned by refugees in these areas and provides the owners with training sessions on animal breeding techniques as well as vaccination and treatment services and complementary livestock feeding in the dry season.</p>
	<p pid="b.1638W.2/2">One outstanding difficulty is the deterioration of security and looting of livestock in recent months which is again hampering movement and increasing pressure on the local environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1638W.2/3">UNHCR has two main priority areas for livestock for 2007; vaccination and veterinarian care in and outside the camps, in cooperation with the Chadian Government's livestock delegation; and the promoting the breeding of smaller animals (sheep and poultry) better suited to vulnerable refugees living in camps.</p>

	<p pid="b.1640W.2/1">Although there has been some research into avian influenza virus survivability, most of this relates to the survival of virus in the environment. Therefore, we cannot give a definite answer as to how long the virus can remain in bird carcasses. Much depends upon the strain of virus, the host and environmental factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1640W.2/2">However, there is evidence to support the fact that avian influenza virus can survive longer that six hours in live birds. The incubation period for this disease (infection to the onset of illness) is typically three to five days and the virus can be isolated during the clinical phase of the disease. In some instances it may be longer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1640W.2/3">Some species of birds (for example, waterfowl) can become infected but not show clinical signs of the disease, even when infected with the highly pathogenic strains. Many species of birds can become infected with the low pathogenic strains and show little evidence of being ill but are still infectious to other birds for some time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1640W.5/1">A system already exists to fine businesses for using excess packaging. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) require that all packaging placed on the market in the UK should be manufactured so that volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain necessary levels of safety, hygiene and consumer acceptance for the packed product.</p>
	<p pid="b.1640W.5/2">These regulations are enforced by Trading Standards officers and a number of companies have already been prosecuted for using excess packaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.1640W.5/3">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 also encourage businesses to reduce the amount of packaging they use. In addition, the Government are encouraging supermarkets to take greater responsibility for the waste they place on the market and for producers to reduce their waste. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently working with retailers through the 'Courtauld Commitment', a voluntary agreement which aims to halt packaging growth by 2008 and make absolute reductions in packaging waste by 2010. 13 major retailers, representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector, have already signed the agreement as well as three major brands.</p>
	<p pid="b.1640W.5/4">In addition, DEFRA, working with WRAP and the devolved administrations, has recently secured the agreement of UK retailers to reduce the overall environmental impact of their carrier bags by 25 per cent. by the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1640W.5/5">Consumers also have a part to play in encouraging producers to reduce unnecessary waste by choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, buying 'loose' rather than pre-packaged food and re-using their own bags.</p>

	<p pid="b.1641W.2/1">The Government tabled their proposals for the creation of joint waste authorities (JWAs) through amendments to the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill on the <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1641W.2/2">Under the proposals, the decision to create a JWA will be a voluntary one to be taken by two or more local waste authorities. The Secretary of State will only be able to dissolve a JWA in two situations: (i) if he/she receives a request to do so from all the appropriate local authorities; (ii) if he/she considers it necessary. Other models of partnership working are available for those authorities that do not wish their partnership to be placed on a statutory footing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1641W.2/3">Where a JWA takes on the waste collection or waste disposal functions of its constituent authorities, it will also be responsible for any targets associated with those functions. It is up to groups of authorities to decide which functions a JWA should take on. If a JWA is responsible for waste collection, the recycling targets of the constituent authorities will in effect be &quot;pooled&quot;. However, if the JWA is responsible only for waste disposal, the local authorities will remain responsible for recycling targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1641W.2/4">It will be for the relevant local authorities to consider and propose arrangements concerned with governance, internal voting, remuneration and administration. The Government are proposing that the Secretary of State will have powers to make regulations on the content of proposals and the information that should accompany them. A requirement for local authorities to consult on their draft proposals, is also being proposed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1647W.8/2">The daily budget allowance, known as the daily messing rate (DMR), is based on a &quot;basket&quot; of food items, and is calculated on a monthly basis by applying prices obtained from the MOD's food supply contractor to the appropriate ration scale. Current DMRs are shown as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/3" class="italic"> Royal Navy Personnel</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/4" class="indent">The DMR for Royal Navy personnel in port is currently &pound;1.51 (unless on duty watch, when 'at sea rates' apply).</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/5" class="indent">The minimum DMR for HM Ships at sea from January to March 2007 is &pound;1.68 per person per day. The DMR is adjusted according to ship's complement, which can raise the total to a maximum of &pound;2.63 per person per day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/6" class="indent">The rate for submarines at sea is 37p higher than the ship's rates above, plus a 12 per cent addition to the relevant DMR when away from base port for more than 24 hours. There are no additions for RN personnel during operations or exercises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/7" class="italic"> Royal Air Force personnel</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/8" class="indent">DMR at home bases is &pound;1.51.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/9" class="indent">DMR on operations is &pound;2.49 for OP TELIC and OP HERRICK and &pound;2.63 for OP OCCULUS (Balkans).</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/10" class="italic"> Army personnel</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/11" class="indent">DMR in their home posting is &pound;1.51.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/12" class="indent">DMR on exercise is &pound;2.11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/13" class="indent">DMR on operations is &pound;2.49 for OP TELIC and OP HERRICK and &pound;2.63 for OP OCCULUS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.8/14">The changeover of food supply contractor on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase> resulted in a change in the method of calculating the DMR. Under the previous contractor, the rate included an element for their management fee, while under the current contract, that fee is paid centrally. The effect is that the DMR now appears lower, but it still purchases the same quantity and quality of food product.</p>

	<p pid="b.1667W.5/1">We are not aware of any firm action to nationalise the country's diamond resources. However, we understand that the Government of Zimbabwe is currently considering the introduction of a new Bill enabling them to compel foreign owned companies to cede half their equity to indigenous owners across all industrial and commercial sectors. Our Embassy in Harare continues to monitor developments on this issue. We would of course oppose such a move as economically destructive.</p>

	<p pid="b.1671W.9/1">The PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report excluded VAT and did not provide advice on it. PwC have confirmed that in respect of the construction of new venues their report included an allowance for contingencies and preliminaries amounting to 23.5 per cent. This assumption was reflected in the Candidate File. PwC made no recommendation about additional programme contingency. The figure of &pound;272 million in the redacted version of the report in the House Library is PwCs assessment of the aggregate level of project contingency, including venues and infrastructure, at 2004 prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.1679W.6/1">Community, Foundation and Voluntary Controlled schools should not incur VAT costs on school buildings that are also made available for community use. Local authorities usually reclaim from HMRC all VAT relating to the construction of these buildings, even when the premises are also offered for use by the local community outside school hours. In relation to voluntary aided schools, government grants for new school buildings should be provided on a VAT inclusive basis where VAT will be chargeable on the construction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1679W.6/2">VAT is not chargeable on the construction of non-local authority schools operated by charities, such as academies, provided that charged and other non-charitable use of the building does not account for 10 per cent. or more of total use. An academy can therefore offer unlimited non-charged use of its facilities without incurring any VAT costs and, under the 10 per cent. allowance mentioned above, a 1,000 student academy can provide charged use of its facilities for around 50 people per day on average without incurring any VAT costs on construction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1679W.6/3">The Government recognize that VAT rules can constrain the extent to which academies can offer facilities on a charged basis to the local community without incurring a VAT charge on construction costs.

Estimates based on a sample of trusts in 2005 suggested that in the first 12 months earnings costs exceeded those forecast by around &pound;120 million or 0.5 per cent. of the agenda for change paybill, with at least a further &pound;100 million in additional hours and leave costs. Actual costs for 2006-07 will depend on experience of the operation of the new agenda for change pay progression arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1680W.9/2">We invested additional recurrent funding to meet the costs of the consultant contract over the three-year period from 2003-04 to 2005-06, and have no plans to further increase the funding already made available. Representations from trusts in late 2004 suggested that the costs of the consultant contract had exceeded plans by around &pound;150 million, mainly due to higher levels of programmed activities. We uplifted the tariff for 2005-06 by this amount, although evidence obtained subsequently suggested an excess cost of the order of &pound;90 million rather than &pound;150 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1680W.9/3">The cost of the general medical services contract in 2006-07 is currently estimated to be &pound;7.8 billion. This is an increase of &pound;0.1 billion over the previous year. Information on 2007-08 costs and funding is not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1680W.9/4">Information on the general medical services contract spend, based on actual audited figures for 2004-05, indicate an overspend of &pound;155 million. Current forecasts, based on primary care trust returns, indicate an overspend in 2005-06 of &pound;252 million. Latest forecasts available for 2006-07 suggest that primary care trusts will manage overall spend within their allocations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1682W.8/1">No formal assessment of the costs and benefits of providing free condoms in general practice has been undertaken but it is a key aim of the Government to improve sexual health by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and spread of sexually transmitted infections. The national health service already issues around 38 million free condoms each year. While general practitioners are unable to issue condoms on prescription, many GP surgeries already issue free condoms as part of locally-agreed condom distribution schemes with primary care trusts. We welcome these partnerships. As well as access to condoms through general practice it is important we also need to ensure that they are easily accessible at appropriate places and venues for those people at highest risk.</p>

Access to the system across these communities will be limited to healthcare professionals within accident and emergency departments, primary care out of hours services, walk-in centres, and minor injuries units who require access for the provision of care. Over time, our obligations to those patients who receive care outside of traditional national health service settings, for example in the voluntary sector, from mixed teams of health and social care professionals, and in the independent sector under contract to the NHS, will mean that by the time an electronic care record has been created for every NHS patient in England in 2010 we anticipate there will be in excess of 850,000 users.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.0/3">In all case, access to records will only be permitted to the staff of organisations involved in delivering care to NHS patients, working as part of a team that is providing a patient with care, and will be limited to only as much information as is needed for the purpose of the care or other job role being performed in relation to the patient. Where those providing care are not NHS staff then patients will be informed of this and any objections raised respected.</p>

	<p pid="b.1689W.3/2">Because of the differences that exist between and within organisations in the duties and responsibilities of individual staff within their work teams, access is not uniquely determined by profession, specialism or grade. Users are vetted and sponsored by their local organisations for specific access appropriate to their job role and area of work. Stringent proof of identity is required along with the endorsement of the local sponsor, a senior member of staff, in order to receive a smartcard, a secure token that, together with a passcode, confirms the identity of a user at the time of access.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.3/3">NHS organisations must undertake to observe strict conditions to ensure the NHS CRS is used appropriately, and the user is required to sign up to a set of conditions for use of the smartcard. The obligations and conditions are complemented by the various existing codes of conduct and professional responsibilities by which all NHS staff are bound. These obligations and conditions are assessed on a regular basis with the organisation and the user is subject to local and national checking through audit trails and alerts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.3/4">Actions which do not conform to these obligations and conditions, which includes the sharing of smartcards, are dealt with locally. Sharing of information between members of a team has happened routinely prior to the introduction of smartcards. However, though there is no evidence that smartcards have been shared beyond members working as part of a team that legitimately needs access to a patients record, we recognise that the sharing of smartcards can undermine the assurance that patient confidentiality will always be appropriately respected. Staff who breach patient confidentiality are subject to professional disciplinary measures. Offending doctors and nurses will be reported to their professional regulatory bodies and may face additional disciplinary action, including losing their licence to practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.3/5">Arrangements known as role based access controls will limit what a member of staff can do within the system and consequently which parts of a record he or she can see. Access to record content will therefore be controlled by a member of staffs relationship with the patient, and by what they need to see to do their jobs. Senior clinicians within an organisation will also be able to see patient records when assuring the quality of care provided by their staff, but other access will only be authorised when required or permitted by law.</p>

	<p pid="b.1690W.2/1">On a typical working day, by the end of January 2007, the spine database, which forms the core of the NHS care records service (NHS CRS), was being accessed by around 50,000 authenticated unique users. And during the last full week of January 2007, the approximate volumes of messages processed in connection with the following systems and services were:</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.2/2" class="indent">personal demographic service&mdash;six and a half million</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.2/3" class="indent">choose and book electronic booking service&mdash;over 1.4 million</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.2/4" class="indent">electronic transmission of prescriptions&mdash;half a million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.2/5">Growth in all these volumes is rising dramatically with the increase in functionality across the NHS CRS and continuing roll-out of the various elements of the system, but already the spine is the world's biggest structured health care messaging system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.2/6">It is not possible to provide a realistic estimate of what these volumes will be by the time substantial integration of health and social care information systems in England has been achieved by 2010. These will depend significantly on the way in which health care management and delivery processes in the NHS adapt and develop to reflect the enormous potential of the systems and services being delivered under the national programme for information technology.</p>

However, if this figure were to be extrapolated across all 598 surveyed NHS organisations, it is estimated this would give an overall nationwide total of over &pound;1,160 million. (Note: the survey data has not been subject to independent audit so this figure needs to be treated with a degree of caution).</p>

	<p pid="b.1694W.2/1">Information about local national health service spending by primary care trusts, NHS trusts and other NHS organisations on the national programme for information technology, to complement the investment from central funding, is not collected centrally. NHS organisations have always been responsible for paying for and maintaining their existing information systems, and funding for this is built into general allocations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1694W.2/2">What we do know is that any costs associated with implementation of the national programme locally are very significantly outweighed by the savings accrued from participation in the programme. Most notably, some &pound;4.5 billion has been saved by central rather than local procurement, a figure confirmed by independent industry analysts. In addition, savings have been achieved in the prices paid by the NHS for information technology goods and services due to the central buying power of NHS Connecting for Health, as well as in NHS staff time saved through using the programme's systems and services. For example, the National Audit Office have acknowledged savings of &pound;860 million achieved through centrally negotiated enterprise wide arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1694W.2/3">In addition, primary care trusts (PCTs) have been specifically reimbursed for funds spent on upgrading existing general practitioner practice systems to make them choose and book compliant, and funding support has also been made available to support NHS trusts deploying a choose and book compliant patient administration system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1694W.2/4">The commercial and organisational models employed in delivering the national programme continue to produce exceptional value for the taxpayer by avoiding multiple procurements and significantly reducing unit costs for applications and systems.</p>

The Act placed new duties on local authorities to make available in their area a range of adoption support services to meet the needs of people affected by adoption, including training for adoptive parents, and to appoint an Adoption Support Services Adviser. These duties have been underpinned by a ring-fenced grant to local authorities, of almost &pound;70 million between 2003-04 and 2005-06, which from 2006-07 has been mainstreamed in the local authority Children's Services Grant.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-05b.123860.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-05b.1700W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" speakername="Parmjit Dhanda" colnum="1700W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070305/text/70305w0013.htm#07030551001372">
	<p pid="b.1700W.5/1">The Unicef Innocenti Report Card 7 raises some serious issues for the UK. However, it often uses data that is up to seven years old and points to the result of decades of underinvestment in children's well-being. The report provides cross-sectional data&mdash;rather than showing trends&mdash;so it does not register the very significant progress this Government have made. In 1997 this Government inherited the highest child poverty rate in Europe. Since then, we have reduced relative child poverty faster than anywhere in Europe and more than halved the absolute child poverty gap.</p>
	<p pid="b.1700W.5/2">There is a strong correlation between income poverty, material deprivation and low educational attainment. That is why we want all children to develop to their full potential. Good quality early education benefits disadvantaged children in particular, and its positive effects on cognitive development last until at least age 10. We introduced free early education for all 3 and 4-year-olds, and will extend it further in terms of hours offered per week. Sure Start Children's Centres will offer children under 5 and their families (initially in the most disadvantaged areas) access to early learning and play alongside other health and parental support. We have also introduced, through the Childcare Act 2006, a new duty on local authorities to improve the outcomes of all under 5s, and close the gaps between those with the poorest outcomes and the rest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1700W.5/3">We have made good progress in tackling the additional challenges that schools serving deprived communities often face. Primary schools that draw more than half of their pupils from the poorest families have improved by more than double the rate of those where fewer than 1 in 10 pupils are from poor backgrounds. Secondary schools with more than half of pupils from poor backgrounds have improved nearly three times as much as those serving more affluent areas. There has also been a large reduction in the number of failing schools which, historically, have tended to be concentrated in deprived areas. The number of schools in special measures has nearly halved between 1997/98 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1700W.5/4">To help pupils who are still not making the kind of progress we expect and who are not getting the best from their education we are launching a progression pilot which will run for two years in up to 10 local authorities to test new ways to measure, assess, report and stimulate progress for children in Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1700W.5/5">Our Academies programme in England is transforming education in disadvantaged areas and offering educational opportunities to children where other intervention and improvement strategies have failed. The improvement in the percentage of pupils getting five good GCSEs including English and Maths in Academies has improved by 6.2 percentage points&mdash;six times better than the national improvement rate of 1 percentage point. Academies' results compare strikingly well with the poor results of their predecessor schools, with a 9.7 percentage point increase in five A*-C grades where English and Maths are included, and a 20.2 percentage point improvement overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.1700W.5/6">As well as providing opportunities for social and cultural enrichment to disadvantaged pupils through extended schools, through the Education and Inspections Act 2006 we have introduced measures to give disadvantaged pupils fair access good schools. And through our major Every Child Matters reforms to children's services, schools are increasingly forging strong links with other children's services. Schools are well placed to spot problems that may be affecting a child's development at an early stage and to engage other agencies as appropriate. Greater use of multi-disciplinary teams, lead professionals and information sharing is helping to identify problems as they arise, provide swift, tailored interventions and remove barriers to school achievement.</p>

I should clarify that funding of &pound;3 billion for the period 2006 to 2008 has been allocated to local authorities through the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG) and includes funding for Sure Start children's centres, extended schools, inclusion, workforce development, child care affordability and sustainability initiatives, and the implementation of the new duties in the Childcare Act. Local Authorities have the freedom to decide how much is spent on each of these areas within the main revenue and main capital elements of GSSG.

	<p pid="b.1704W.8/19">Some 10.6 per cent. of pupils in large classes in maintained primary schools were engaged in activities such as PE or games or music, singing and drama.</p>
	<p pid="b.1704W.8/20">Decisions about class sizes post Key Stage 1 are a matter for schools, and there are a number of factors that will influence this. Schools are best placed to know what works well for them and is in pupils' best interests. Instances of large classes may well be because schools are being more imaginative about how they organise lessons, making the best use of all school staff. In some subjects having a larger class with an experienced teacher supported by one or more trained teaching assistants can offer real advantages to pupils, enhancing rather than hindering their learning.</p>

	<p pid="b.1712W.2/14">The Chief Executive has also advised that SEELB monitors the ongoing costs of the school throughout the year. When recurrent budget allocations are received from DE, an assessment is made of the amount that will be required centrally to fund staffing costs in each of the special schools, taking account of pupil numbers and needs, and how much should be delegated to schools under Article 56 of the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 to meet costs other than staffing. Each special school also receives its share of any appropriate earmarked funds. Based on this process, the Board is satisfied that Clifton School is adequately resourced.</p>

	<p pid="b.1720W.2/41">In relation to the provision of training and support to PSNI officers dealing with such cases there are currently two PSNI general orders providing instruction to police officers in responding to missing persons' investigations&mdash;one relates to the actual investigation and the other relates to the circulation of details on police computers. Condensed versions of the key points and student officer training notes have been compiled for officers and are available on the PSNI intranet site.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/42">Student officers at the police college receive full lessons on dealing with missing persons including initial action with emphasis on crucial time factors, completing police procedures, risk assessments and vulnerable persons. The students individually complete a practical scenario about a missing 16-year-old boy. The students also receive inputs from community organisations such as the Simon Community, St. Vincent de Paul, and Salvation Army at a community fair evening. Detectives at all ranks in the PSNI receive training on dealing with missing persons and this training is built into their initial detective training course. Missing person scenarios are also included in critical incident training for senior officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/43">Service instructions are currently being revised in light of recent guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) into the recording, managing and investigation of missing persons. In addition PSNI are examining the area of children and young persons absconding from residential care homes as separate guidance. A pilot project involving three residential care homes has recently been completed and the initial instructions are being revised in light of the outcome of the evaluation of this pilot. The PSNI are in liaison with Social Services in respect of this policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/44">PSNI also has a 'missing persons' intranet site which provides information for the circulation of missing persons on the 'Missing Kids' website and the missing persons pages on the PSNI internet site. The 'Missing Kids' website is a partnership between police forces, the Police National Missing Persons Bureau (PNMPB), an international charity&mdash;International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC)&mdash;and a commercial sponsor&mdash;Computer Associates plc (CA). The initiative has the support of ACPO. The 'Appeals/Missing Persons' pages on the PSNI internet site provide pictures and details of those persons reported as missing to the PSNI as well as links to other support organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1734W.6/1">It is not possible to disaggregate spending on pensioner benefits in general to reveal how much has been spent specifically to tackle pensioner poverty in any particular area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1734W.6/2">However, our policies have been highly effective in tackling pensioner poverty and now, for the first time ever in a period of sustained economic growth, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole. Since 1997 1 million pensioners have been lifted out of poverty. Pension credit has played a key part in addressing pensioner poverty; since its introduction the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by half a million. The latest estimates showed that 2.7 million households were receiving pension credit, and this includes 3,150 households in Eltham.</p>
	<p pid="b.1734W.6/3">Nationally, as a result of the measures that this Government have introduced since 1997, we will be spending &pound;10.5 billion more on pensioners in 2006-07 than if 1997 policies had continued. Almost half this spending&mdash;over &pound;5 billion&mdash;is going to the poorest third of pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="b.1736W.2/1">The proposed reforms to state pensions will provide a solid foundation for private saving, both by limiting the spread of pension credit entitlement and by delivering simpler and more predictable state pension outcomes. Under the proposed reforms, by 2050 just one in 50 pensioners will receive the guarantee credit only when they first reach state pension age. Even then, we would expect many to be able to reduce the interaction between additional private saving and benefit entitlement by taking some or all of their private pension income as a lump sum&mdash;those with private savings of less than &pound;15,000 can take them as a lump sum under the trivial commutation rules.</p>

Some methodological improvements were made to the projections of pension credit eligibility between publication of the White Paper and the introduction of the Pensions Bill.  2. Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are taken from the DWP dynamic micro-simulation model PENSIM2. Modelling of the reform proposals does not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit.  3. The marginal deduction rate reflects the extent to which a marginal increase in gross income would result in a change in net income, assuming this is fully taken into account for pension credit entitlement. The deduction rate shown would not apply to all changes in income&mdash;for example where additional pension savings are taken as a lump sum.  4. Care should be taken when interpreting these projections as they are subject to a margin of uncertainty. The projections are based on long run simulations of the incomes of individuals under a set of assumptions including life expectancy, partnership formation, earnings growth, employment rates, state and private pension accumulation.  5. Projections of the number of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain.  6. Estimates cover all those aged above women's state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain.  7. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension age described in the Pensions Bill. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women's state pension age.  8. Projections under the Pensions Bill proposals assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; and measures to improve coverage of state pensions described in the Pensions Bill. Figures exclude the effect of personal accounts.  9. Projections under the current system with guarantee credit earnings uprated assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard minimum guarantee; continued price uprating of the savings credit threshold and the basic state pension.  10.

	<p pid="b.1748W.8/1">The specific information requested is not recorded separately within police recorded crime statistics. This data series does not contain any information relating to the victim and therefore, breakdowns by age are not possible. However, The Home Office does, via the British Crime Survey, annually publish the risk of being a victim of different crime types by age group for men and women. The most recent figures, based on the 2005-06 BCS, found that overall older people were less likely to be victims of crime than younger people (see tables 1 and 2).</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.8/2">Table 1 shows that households where the household reference person (HRP) was aged 65 or more were less likely to be victims of burglary, criminal damage or vehicle thefts than those living in households where the head of household is younger. For instance, 1.5 per cent. of households where the HRP was aged 75 and over were victims of one or more burglaries in 2005-06, compared with 2.4 per cent. of all households and 5.9 per cent. of households where the HRP was aged 16 to 24.</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.8/3">Table 2 shows that the risk of being a victim of violent crime is considerably lower for older people than younger adults. For instance, 0.5 per cent. of men and women aged 65 to 74 were victims of one or more incidents of violence in 2005-06. This compares with 3.4 per cent. of all adults, 12.6 per cent. of men aged 16 to 24 and 7.0 per cent. of women aged 16 to 24. It also shows 0.3 per cent. of men and 1.3 per cent. of women aged 75 and over were victims of one of more incidents of theft from the person in 2005-06. This compares with 2.3 per cent. of men and 3.3 per cent. of women aged 16 to 24.</p>

	<p pid="b.1766W.8/1">The prison and probation services offer a range of sex offender treatment programmes to meet different needs. The cost varies across programme and by establishment or area depending on factors such as the risk presented by the offenders concerned, nature of the programme, volume of delivery and the existing infrastructure. Cost therefore can vary from around &pound;3,500 to &pound;10,000 per completion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.8/2">Sex offender treatment programme participants in prison and probation have demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in sexual and/or violent reconviction within two years of release or completion of a community programme, in comparison to offenders who have not undergone the programme (Friendship et al., 2003; Allam, 1998).</p>

External consultants are currently undertaking an options appraisal and economic impact assessment for the college with some financial support from HEFCE and the South West RDA, to identify a viable way forward. The consultants are due to report to the college at the end of February and the study will be considered by the college's board of governors on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-02">2 March</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.1781W.5/1">The higher cost of work undertaken by registered social landlords is the basis for the calculation. Social landlords business plans are based on 30 years which will help inform the investment decisions they make. The figures used in the calculation were based on actual investment by registered social landlords. When we did the calculation we took into account the anticipated reduction in local authority homes, including where a transfer ballot was pending or where a transfer scheme was included on the transfer programme. The calculation is the additional resources needed on top of what local authorities are already spending on the delivery of decent homes, this will include not only money from Government but also money from their own resources. .Where local authorities are able to find additional resources from their own budgets they often do so, which has helped many councils meet their decent homes target. However many councils have made clear they cannot find additional resources from within their existing budgets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1786W.0/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government and its main predecessor (the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) did not run any early exit schemes during the years 2002-03 to 2004-05. In 2005-06, the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister ran a voluntary exit scheme for the central Department and its staff in the Government offices for the regions to enable us to reduce our headcount.</p>
	<p pid="b.1786W.0/2">In the current year (2006-07) Communities and Local Government has been running a voluntary exit scheme for central Department staff, and there was a small involuntary scheme covering the few staff for which the Department was unable to identify alternative employment following the closure of the Emergency Fire Service facility at Marchington in Staffordshire. In addition, the Government offices for the regions (GOs) have run a scheme for staff in the GOs as part of the implementation of the recommendations of the GO review. This scheme has been funded from contributions provided, by the sponsor Departments (including Communities) for the GO network.</p>
	<p pid="b.1786W.0/3">For 2007-08, the Government offices plan a further exit scheme. No decision has yet been taken on whether there should be a further scheme for the central Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.1786W.0/4">Neither the Planning Inspectorate nor the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre (trading fund) have run any early exit schemes since 1997-98, and none are currently planned for 2007-08. The Fire Service College has been running its first (voluntary) exit scheme during 2006-07. Again, no scheme is currently planned for 2007-08.</p>

Therefore, those retaining management and ownership would require arid extra &pound;10,000 per home to match the level of expenditure of stock transfer RSLs.

	<p pid="b.1794W.2/27">We do not collect data on the numbers of homes purchased in rural areas with the assistance of an equity loan. However, we do know the numbers of key workers helped through our new build schemes in rural areas. These are given in the following table. These numbers are small because demand for key worker housing tends to be in urban areas where the majority of employer organisations are located. However, from April 2006 Regional Housing Boards have been able to prioritise groups for assistance under our other Low Cost Home Ownership schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1798W.2/5">Overall the longer-term research reveals a number of positive outcomes attributable to choice based lettings: improved tenancy sustainment; good outcomes for homeless households; a tendency for choice based lettings to result in more dispersed, rather than concentrated; lettings to ethnic minority households; and a tendency to speed up the re-letting of empty properties.</p>

The regional assemblies were informed of the reduced allocations in November 2006. The one representation received on the reductions was a letter from the North East assembly dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February 2007</phrase>.</p>

Local planning authorities can set separate targets for different kinds of brownfield land if they need to do that. For example, they could choose as a matter of policy to concentrate development on available vacant or derelict land rather than on previously-residential or garden land. PPS3 also gives them greater flexibility to address concerns around development on previously-residential or garden land in areas where it would be inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.5/2">PPS3 states in clear terms that there is no presumption that land is suitable for housing simply because it is brownfield, stressing the need for sites to be suitable for housing development, and in suitable locations that will contribute to the creation of sustainable, mixed communities.</p>

Planning authorities should also ensure that there is sufficient land available which is readily capable of development and well-served by infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.8/2">Regional planning bodies and local planning authorities, in preparing and reviewing their development plans, should make a realistic assessment of the quantity of land likely to be needed in their areas to meet the needs of business and developers.

	<p pid="b.1810W.8/3">To assist planning authorities in assessing the overall demand for and supply of employment land, we have published &quot;Employment Land Reviews: Guidance Note&quot; (December 2004). This guidance seeks to help planning authorities assess the suitability of sites to accommodate employment development, to help protect the best sites in the face of competition from higher value uses and to help them identify those sites which are no longer needed for employment development and which can be released for other uses, including for housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.8/4">Kate Barker's &quot;Review of Land Use Planning&quot; (December 2006) looked at how planning might better deliver economic growth and prosperity, alongside important social and environmental objectives. The Government have welcomed the report, and are carefully considering the recommendations. We will set out our response to the Report's recommendations in a White Paper this spring.</p>

	<p pid="b.1812W.8/1">In the last 12 months three meetings have been held with representatives of local planning authorities and officials have written to local authorities about the removal of unauthorised roadside advertisements. The information we have shows that 303 unlawful advertisements have been removed as a result of local authority action: 243 from Greater Manchester, Merseyside and parts of Cheshire and Lancashire; 17 from North Wiltshire; 14 from Solihull; 13 from North Lincolnshire; eight from Salisbury; two each from Barnet, Chester, and Daventry; and one each from Colchester and North Tyneside. The information about how many offenders have been prosecuted for displaying or refusing to remove unauthorised roadside advertisements is not held centrally. The unlawful advertisements and fly-posting database will hold information about successful prosecutions when the database is launched later this month. The Department has not received evidence of advertising companies continuing to solicit business using unauthorised roadside sites. However where local authorities have taken firm action to remove advertisements it is important to prevent an increase in adverts in neighbouring local authorities who have not taken firm action. That is why the Government are publishing new advice on best practice for all local authorities alongside the new database.</p>

	<p pid="b.1814W.5/33">The increase in expenditure on leased accommodation reflects both that more vulnerable people are receiving help with accommodation, following the strengthening of the statutory safety net in 2002; and the Government's drive to improve the quality of temporary accommodation used to house people under the homelessness legislation. Although good quality, self-contained leasehold accommodation accounts for around 50 per cent. of temporary accommodation used by local authorities, more needs to be done to help people find settled homes. In 2004 we set the challenging target of halving the number of households in temporary accommodation by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.1815W.2/1">Nottingham city council, as do all local authorities, receives homelessness grant funding to tackle and prevent all form of homelessness. However, the funding is not ring fenced and it is for them to determine how the funding is used to support their homelessness strategy. The Department therefore, does not keep a record of the amount of money spent on specific elements such as temporary accommodation. The funding Nottingham city council has received from the Department to tackle homelessness is set out in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="b.1816W.2/1">Information about local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation is collected quarterly at local authority rather than constituency level. The constituency of Romford falls entirely within the London borough of Havering.</p>

	<p pid="b.1816W.2/3">This data is published in our quarterly statistical release on Statutory Homelessness, which includes a supplementary table showing the breakdown of key data, including temporary accommodation and type, by each local authority.

	<p pid="b.1817W.2/1">Based on the results of the 2006 Labour Force Survey, it is estimated that the number of households in which none of the residents were in employment was <i> (a)</i> 6,876,000 in England, and <i> (b)</i> 881,000 in London.

	<p pid="b.1817W.2/2">Reliable estimates for the London borough of Havering and for Romford are not available from the Labour Force Survey. However, from the 2001 census it is estimated that the number of households in the London borough of Havering where the main householder was economically inactive was 23,000. The basis for this estimate differs from the LFS estimates above. The census estimate (a) excludes households where the main householder was aged 75 or over and (b) is a count of those households where the main householder was economically inactive&mdash;which is not the same as the LFS estimates of the number of households where none of the residents were economically inactive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1817W.2/3">A reliable estimate of how many of the 23,000 households with an economically inactive householder were living in social housing is not available for Havering.</p>
