	<p pid="a.2192W.2/1">The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill will enable the reform of legislation&mdash;including both public general Acts and local Acts&mdash;by order. It will also enable reform of the common law by order but only where this is for the purpose of implementing a recommendation of one of the UK Law Commissions. The power to make such orders is subject to a number of conditions, including that the provision made by the order does not remove any necessary protection and does not prevent any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom he might reasonably expect to continue exercising. Orders are also subject to procedural safeguards including public consultation and scrutiny and veto by parliamentary committees. The Government currently have no plans to reform the legislation which may affect the right of freemining, or to reform any rights of common which might exist in the Forest of Dean.</p>

	<p pid="a.2194W.8/1">Part 2 of the Compensation Bill provides the legislative base for introducing statutory regulation of claims management services. The primary aim is to regulate the activities of commercial claims management companies in certain sectors, to tackle bad practices and improve consumer safeguards. Where trades unions provide claims management services within a regulated sector, for example personal injury, they would be subject to regulation unless explicitly exempted&mdash;achieved by secondary legislation. The Government have indicated the intention to exempt trade unions, subject to the views of both Houses during the Bill's passage. We will take full account of concerns and other comments made in coming to a final decision on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.2194W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2194W.11/2">Following the concerns expressed by organisations representing victims and witnesses, and after victims and witnesses individually expressed a preference for dealing with trained intermediaries, it was considered inappropriate to deliver a secure internet service to enable victims to track their own case online, as defined in the Justice for All White Paper 2002. Instead, with Ministerial approval, an alternative solution was implemented. Following a successful pilot exercise, the &quot;No Witness No Justice&quot; initiative was set up to provide Witness Care Units across England and Wales staffed by trained intermediaries, who understand the needs of victims and witnesses and are more responsive to their individual requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.2194W.11/3">To support these Witness Care Units a new witness care management tool, called the Witness Management System, has been created. This provides trained Witness Care Unit officers with access to existing case data stored on the Crown Prosecution Service Case Management System, as well as the ability to search the system by witnesses and to add/amend case details relating to victims and witnesses. These officers can, therefore, provide both victims and witnesses with key information, not only about the progress of their case but also about how the CJS works and what the next steps are likely to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.2194W.11/4">The Witness Management System in use in 100 out of the 170 Witness Care Units in England and Wales and is already playing a key role in providing first class care for victims and witnesses. The roll-out to all Witness Care Units will be completed during the spring of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.2200W.2/1">Framework for the Future, published by DCMS in February 2003, was the first ever national public library strategy document. It aimed to encourage public libraries geared to the needs of 21st century users.</p>

	<p pid="a.2200W.5/1">In 2005&ndash;06 the 149 public library authorities are being asked to report on their conformity with, or on their progress to meet, the 10 Public Library Service Standards. Coinciding with the introduction of the standards, we have seen significant improvements in core library provision particularly in the areas of opening hours, material acquisitions and ICT provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2200W.5/2">The standards form part of the Comprehensive Performance Assessment's Culture Block along with four additional library indicators on the number of active borrowers; resident satisfaction with the library service; stock level/stock-turn, and cost per visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.2200W.5/3">In addition, for the first time in 2005&ndash;06, those authorities are being asked to report on their position against 16 indicators which make up the Public Library Impact Measures. This baseline information will be used to set targets for 2006&ndash;07 for those indicators that prove to be robust. The Impact Measures help to highlight libraries' contribution to wider community agendas as reflected in the shared priorities of central and local government.</p>

	<p pid="a.2204W.2/1">Access to good quality sporting provision, including swimming pools, is an essential part of enabling people to lead healthier lives and to participate in sport. There are currently over 4,400 swimming facilities across England which are open to the public. Since 1997 Government and Lottery distributing bodies between them have invested over &pound;3 billion in physical activity and sport, and in that time &pound;249 million of Lottery investment has gone to swimming&mdash;the largest amount given to any sport. Sport England has a swimming strategy in place and is working with local authorities to help them implement it. I understand that Sport England are in discussion with Swindon Council about the needs assessment that the Council is undertaking which includes examining its swimming provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.2205W.9/1">Cannibalisation is a recognised method of the removal of serviceable part(s) from an aircraft which is already unserviceable or due to enter scheduled engineering servicing, during which time the cannibalised parts will not be required. Only in exceptional circumstances would a serviceable aircraft be cannibalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.2205W.9/2">In 2005, there were five instances where serviceable C130J Mk 5 aircraft were cannibalised to satisfy an immediate spares requirement for a C130J Mk 4 (stretched) aircraft as these were more appropriate for the operational task required at the time. For the C130K there were no instances of cannibalisation of serviceable aircraft in 2005. Records for both C130 J and K aircraft are not held for 2003 and 2004. Although information is held on the number of cannibalisation occurrences for Tristars, VC-10s and C-17A Globemaster aircraft, it does not record whether the losing aircraft was serviceable, unserviceable or in scheduled maintenance.</p>

	<p pid="a.2206W.5/2">Members of the armed forces who are disabled may apply for housing to any local authority, and may also seek accommodation from a Registered Social Landlord. Housing authorities are responsible for setting their own allocation policies and procedures. However, they must ensure that their allocation scheme is framed so as to give reasonable preference to certain categories of persons, including people who need to move on medical and welfare grounds. Legislation has recently been amended to make clear that &quot;medical and welfare&quot; includes grounds relating to a disability. In addition, some Registered Social Landlords specialise in housing people with disabilities; while others have been set up with the intention of housing ex-forces personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.2206W.5/3">Local authorities also provide a wide range of support services to help disabled people maintain independent lives in their own homes providing care services, aids, equipment and adaptations. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister contributes to the funding of these services through the payment of Supporting People programme grant to local authorities, which may be spent by the local authority on a range of housing related support services, and under the Disabled Facilities Grant scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.2206W.5/4">There is provision within the War Pensions Scheme to pay grants towards the cost of adapting the home of a severely disabled war pensioner where the need arises because of the pensioned disablement. This payment may be paid in addition to any local authority grant which might be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.2206W.5/5">Service Leavers receive comprehensive briefings on housing and financial matters before returning to civilian life, including, if appropriate, advice from the Joint Service Housing Advice Office. In addition, the Veterans Agency provides a single point of contact within the MoD for veterans and their dependants seeking help and advice on a range of issues including housing.</p>

While the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister remains vigilant to any reported building collapses so as to ensure a low probability of such an incident occurring in the UK, adequate safeguards on achieving minimum requirements for stability and robustness are provided in the Building Regulations Approved Document Part A and the relevant British Standards codes of practice which they reference.

	<p pid="a.2218W.2/2">It is not possible to provide information in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.2218W.2/3">At April 2003, there were around 5,800 units of support for women at risk of domestic violence. More recent data suggests that there were around 6,000 units of support at April 2005. These figures include both accommodation in refuges and other forms of provision including floating support services where victims are supported to remain in their own accommodation where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2218W.2/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister annually provides Supporting People funding to enable top-tier English local authorities to provide housing-related support. In doing so, however, ODPM does not specify or earmark amounts to be spent on either specific forms of provision or specific vulnerable groups. However, most recent data suggests that local authorities spent approximately &pound;58 million from Supporting People funding on services for women at risk of domestic violence in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.2218W.2/5">In April 2003 further measures were announced to support refuge provision through capital programmes over a three-year period. In 2003&ndash;04 a total of &pound;18.8 million funding was provided for new refuge provision and refurbishment of existing refuge schemes. The Government have also committed a further &pound;7.5 million nationally in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 with an additional &pound;5.8 million provided through the Housing Corporation. Priority is being given to projects arising from local authority housing and homelessness strategy reviews to meet gaps in service provision. 427 new units of accommodation will be provided.</p>

Inspectors from the VOA will only ask to undertake internal inspections of properties where information cannot be gathered by an external inspection or through other sources and will make every effort to arrange appointments with occupiers in advance and confirm these by letter. If a request to enter a property is declined, the VOA will normally make a best judgement about the correct band for the property. There will, of course, be a right of appeal against any banding that is made.

	<p pid="a.2234W.2/1">No assessment is made during the annual housing revenue account subsidy determination process of the impact of average rent increases on any particular section of the community. The subsidy system is very influential in informing the decisions a council will take on rent setting, but it does not immediately impact on actual individual rents which are a matter for the authority as landlord.</p>
	<p pid="a.2234W.2/2">Authorities retain wide discretion in the setting of rents, including a variation of plus or minus 5 per cent. on individual rents under rent restructuring. For 2006&ndash;07 we introduced a suggested additional cap of 5 per cent. on the average actual rent increase in addition to the existing cap of RPI plus &frac12; per cent. plus &pound;2.</p>

	<p pid="a.2235W.2/1">Addressing the hon. Member's questions in turn:</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/2" class="italic">(a) Eligibility for re-housing:</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/3">Local authorities have the power to treat as ineligible for an allocation a person who has been guilty of unacceptable behaviour serious enough to make him unsuitable to be a tenant of the authority. The only behaviour which would be regarded as unacceptable for these purposes is behaviour which would entitle an authority to an outright possession order on fault grounds, this could include antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/4">Circular 07/04 on Tenancy Management: Eligibility and Eviction, issued by the Housing Corporation and to which all registered social landlords must have regard, states that ineligibility for housing on the ground of the applicant's antisocial behaviour should be based on evidence of the behaviour. The circular also states that previous tenancy enforcement action (including eviction) for antisocial behaviour should not be taken into account if it occurred two or more years prior to the date of application and the tenant's household has conducted a tenancy satisfactorily in the intervening period.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/5" class="italic">(b) Homelessness:</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/6">Where a person is evicted for antisocial behaviour he may decide to make a homelessness application to a local authority. If the authority has reason to believe that he may be homeless or threatened with homelessness it must make inquiries to enable it to determine his application.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/7">When considering the application the authority would have to decide, among other things, whether the applicant had become homeless intentionally (that is, homeless as a result of a deliberate act or omission in consequence of which his accommodation ceases to be available to him). Where the applicant has been evicted from his previous accommodation because of antisocial behaviour this is likely to be regarded as a deliberate act which would mean that the applicant would be found to be intentionally homeless.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/8">If the applicant has a priority need for housing (eg if he has dependent children) but has become homeless intentionally, the authority would have a duty to secure accommodation for them for long enough to give them a reasonable opportunity of finding their own accommodation. However, the authority will not owe the applicant a 'main homelessness duty' to continue to secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/9" class="italic">(c) Eligibility for benefits:</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/10">Where someone has been evicted on ASB grounds and subsequently takes up new accommodation where they are eligible for payment of council tax then any application for council tax benefit would be assessed in line with existing rules. Their previous housing record, including eviction on anti-social behaviour grounds, would not form part of this assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/11">The same principle applies to Housing benefit: liability for rent would cease on eviction, so no housing benefit would be payable. But if rent is payable at the next address, housing benefit would be freshly assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/12" class="italic">Respect agenda proposals</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/13">The Respect action plan proposes no changes to code of guidance on allocations or homelessness legislation. Through the plan we have announced our intention to launch a national network of intensive family support schemes as part of a long-term cross-government strategy on problem families to improve the way public services deal with them. Family support projects will help tackle the underlying causes of ASB. For example, where appropriate, families evicted for antisocial behaviour may be referred to a support project so that anti-social behaviour can be tackled rather than displaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.2235W.2/14">The plan commits us to considering the best way of encouraging those involved in persistent ASB to engage with family support projects. As the plan states one option would be to introduce sanctions on those people who have been evicted for antisocial behaviour and then refuse to take up offers of help. Sanctions could include financial penalties or housing benefit measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.2236W.2/1">Local authorities do not borrow for specific purposes but instead manage their loans as a portfolio. The Housing Revenue Account makes a contribution to the loan charges of a local authority's debt portfolio based upon the proportion of those loans used for housing purposes and based on the average interest rate of all of the authority's borrowing, known as the Consolidated Rate of Interest (CRI).</p>
	<p pid="a.2236W.2/2">The CRI for 1980 is only available at disproportionate cost. The average CRI for local housing authorities in England for financial year 2000&ndash;01 was 5.95 per cent., the average CRI for local housing authorities in England for financial year 2005&ndash;06 currently stands at 5.31 per cent., though it should be noted that this rate is likely to change as the financial year not yet ended.</p>

	<p pid="a.2238W.0/1">CORE (Continuous Recording of lettings) is a system for monitoring the letting of social rented housing which has been in operation by housing associations for the last 15 years. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently in the process of extending CORE to include lettings by local authorities. Participation by local authorities is voluntary although it is hoped that all will do so. Of the 220 local authorities which own social housing stock 86 (39 per cent.) are already submitting CORE data and an additional 105 (48 per cent.) are planning to start by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>. The remaining 29 (13 per cent.) have not yet committed to a start date.</p>

	<p pid="a.2242W.8/1">All ground based masts are already subject to planning control so that if the local authority considers that the development will pose a serious threat to amenity, it is able to refuse approval. For masts over 15 metres in height a full planning application is required. For masts under 15 metres in height a prior approval application is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.2242W.8/2">Since 1997, the Government have strengthened the prior approval arrangements twice. Local planning authorities can decline a mast on planning grounds in prior approval applications in the same way as a normal planning application so long as they act within eight weeks. Eight weeks is also the performance target for dealing with most planning applications for telecommunications developments.</p>

	<p pid="a.2251W.5/1">Planning policy statement 6: planning for town centres (PPS6) sets out the Government's planning policy for town centres and main town centre uses, which include retail. Statements of the Government's planning policy should be taken into account by those responsible for the preparation of both regional and local planning policy documents. Planning policy statements are also considerations which may be material to decisions on individual planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.2251W.5/2">The Government's key objective for town centres is to promote their vitality and viability and PPS6 sets out other Government objectives which need to be taken into account in the context of this key objective. One of these is directed at supporting an efficient, competitive and innovative retail sector. In planning for additional development local planning authorities are also advised to provide for consumer choice by ensuring that provision is made for a range of sites for shopping and other main town centres uses to meet the needs of the whole community.</p>
	<p pid="a.2251W.5/3">But PPS6 makes it clear that it is not the role of the planning system to restrict competition, preserve existing commercial interests or to prevent innovation. Each application for planning permission must be determined on its merits having regard to the policies in the relevant development plan and to any other material considerations. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Office for Fair Trading (OFT) have overall responsibility for competition issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.2254W.6/1">The opportunity to form partnerships with external organisations will strengthen trust schools' governing bodies, and help to invigorate school leadership by providing an external source of direction, continuity and focus for the school. Trust governors will help their schools to develop a distinctive ethos and approach to the curriculum and the organisation of the school, with a central focus on raising standards and creating new opportunities for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.2254W.6/2">A trust could therefore contribute to the raising of standards at a school like Chesterton community high school by involving external partners in the leadership of the school in a sustainable way. However, it would be for the governing body of Chesterton community high school to determine whether to make a link to a trust. A trust could also encourage collaboration if it supported a number of schools in the area.</p>

	<p pid="a.2255W.5/3">The Protection of Children Act 1999 List is primarily a referral system for employers who have dismissed an individual for misconduct that harmed a child or placed a child at risk of harm. For all regulated/child care positions it is mandatory to check whether individuals are on the Protection of Children Act List prior to appointment (subject to exceptions where, for example, another specified organisation has carried out a check within the last 12 months). That check is carried out through a CRB check. The Protection of Children Act List provides an additional safeguard within the CRB system for a limited range of circumstances set out in legislation, for example where somebody employed in a regulated child care position has been dismissed because they harmed a child.</p>

Significant progress has been made over recent months including:</p>
	<p pid="a.2261W.0/2" class="indent">the establishment of a sector network to trial new approaches and disseminate good practice;</p>
	<p pid="a.2261W.0/3" class="indent">the development of an FE good practice guide to procurement across the sector;</p>
	<p pid="a.2261W.0/4" class="indent">raising awareness of the use of procurement cards;</p>
	<p pid="a.2261W.0/5" class="indent">developing a programme to improve procurement skills in the sector; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2261W.0/6" class="indent">conducting a pilot of an e-procurement system.</p>
	<p pid="a.2261W.0/7">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including improved procurement in the FE sector. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department's autumn performance report and will report further progress in the departmental annual report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="a.2261W.3/1">Latest figures published by Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that, between 2004/05 and 2005/06, total applicants from England to full-time undergraduate courses rose from 339,967 to 368,801, an increase of 8.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2261W.3/2">Latest figures for 2006/07, covering students who applied by mid-January, show that applicants from England are down by 4.5 per cent., from 284,359 to 271,663. Given the big increase in applications last year, it is not unexpected that this year's UCAS application figures reveal a fall in comparison. But applications this year are still up by 12,500 (or 4.8 per cent.) compared to the corresponding figure in 2004, and I am confident that we will continue to see a return to a long term upward trend as happened after tuition fees were introduced in 1998. Figures from UCAS also show that there has been no reduction in the proportion of students from lower socio-economic groups applying to university.</p>

	<p pid="a.2262W.0/1">Because of our low participation rates in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), it was the view of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), that the data for the United Kingdom from the 2003 study could not be reliably used. It would therefore be inappropriate to try to draw conclusions for education policy in England from the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.2262W.0/2">The Government believe that international comparisons studies, such as PISA, offer unique and valuable insights into how the outcomes of our education system compare with those of other countries. That is why the Department for Education and Skills is putting its efforts into meeting the targets for school and pupil participation rates for the next PISA study which will take place later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2262W.0/3">However, in assessing the outcomes of any such studies, we will keep in mind the conclusions of the Education and Skills Select Committee in its Fifth Report of Session 2004&ndash;05, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-09">9 March 2005</phrase>, that</p>
	<p pid="a.2262W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;the data supplied by international educational comparisons is both of interest and of use in the formulation of education policy.

	<p pid="a.2267W.11/1">The information requested is not collected centrally. Local authority bylaws establish in general what work children may undertake. Such bylaws may permit children to work for one hour before school, although not before 7 am. This limits the kind of work that children may legally carry out in the mornings before school. Within these limits, participation in suitable work is a matter for individual choice, with advice where necessary from parents, carers, and other relevant adults. Such work can offer young people an opportunity to develop their self-confidence and life skills, such as personal organisation and dealing with people.</p>

We are also keen to draw in the contribution of the private sector in planning and delivering a variety of opportunities for young people. Local area agreements, involving local authorities and a wide range of local partners, are an important part of these processes. Government offices, who negotiate agreements on behalf of central Government, need to be satisfied that all appropriate partners have been brought into the development, negotiation and delivery of each agreement.</p>

	<p pid="a.2276W.2/1">The most effective way to mitigate the effects of climate change described in Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change is by a response as broadly based as possible. This needs to involve adaptation as well as emissions reduction. Emissions reduction should address all anthropogenic greenhouse gases and all economic sectors, including reduction of emissions from deforestation, and there should be enhancement of the uptake and storage of carbon by forests and soils. It will be most cost effective if action to limit and reduce emissions extends to the greatest possible number of countries, consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The framework provided by the Convention and the Protocol will facilitate function of market mechanisms which promote cost effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="a.2287W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not held discussions with the Mauritanian authorities on this subject. The Government regard the status of Western Sahara as undetermined, and as a result we do not recognise any 'Western Saharan authorities'.</p>
	<p pid="a.2287W.8/2">The Government takes the issue of illegal migration very seriously. We are currently engaged in dialogue with EU partners, and both source and transit countries, on how best to meet this challenge. Substantial progress was made during the UK presidency to implement EU initiatives to tackle illegal migration across the Mediterranean and to strengthen co-operation with transit countries in North Africa. The 10th anniversary Euromed summit in November 2005 adopted a five-year work programme covering enhanced co-operation on all aspects of migration, including reducing illegal migration and trafficking in human beings. A Euromed ministerial meeting on migration will be held in 2006 to drive forward this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.2287W.8/3">The conclusions of December's European Council included a pledge to address illegal migration</p>

	<p pid="a.2287W.8/5">Building on our presidency achievements, we will continue to encourage the EU to work in closer partnership with transit and source countries to tackle illegal migration across the Mediterranean and for improved migration management globally.</p>

	<p pid="a.2291W.2/1">The pandemic strain may not necessarily be H5N1. The widespread occurrence of a highly pathogenic avian (bird) influenza virus (H5N1) in poultry since 2003, which has also infected some people, is thought to provide a seedbed for the possible emergence of a new virus with greater affinity for people and thus the potential to cause a new pandemic.</p>
	<p pid="a.2291W.2/2">Estimates of the impact of an influenza pandemic are based on the best available evidence. However, the number of people affected and the impact on the healthcare system will depend critically on the detailed properties of the pandemic Flu virus.</p>

	<p pid="a.2295W.0/14">Revenue allocations are made to PCTs on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine PCTs' target shares of available resources, to enable PCTs to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need.</p>
	<p pid="a.2295W.0/15">The components of the formula are used to weight each PCTs crude population according to their relative need (age, and additional need) for healthcare and the unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing healthcare (the market forces factor).</p>
	<p pid="a.2295W.0/16">The formula does not determine allocations. The formula is used to set targets, which then inform allocations. Actual allocations reflect decisions on the speed at which PCTs are brought nearer to target through the distribution of extra funds (pace of change policy).</p>
	<p pid="a.2295W.0/17">Pace of change policy is decided for each allocations round. For the 2006&ndash;08 allocations, it has been decided to move PCTs more quickly towards their fair share of funds. As a result of this allocation round, no PCT will be more than 3.5 per cent. under its fair share by the end of 2007&ndash;08. At the start of 2006&ndash;07, Chelmsford PCT will be very close to their target allocation (only 0.1 per cent. below target).</p>
	<p pid="a.2295W.0/18">The reason that Chelmsford PCT receives lower allocations per person than the England average, is that the measurement of healthcare needs across the population of Chelmsford is lower than the England average.</p>
	<p pid="a.2295W.0/19">The development of the formula is kept under constant review by the advisory committee on resource allocation (ACRA). ACRA is an independent body, made up of national health service managers, academics and general practitioners. ACRA will make recommendations on any changes to the formula, that may be required in advance of the next round of allocations.</p>

People are invited every two years, and complete the kit in their own homes before returning it to the laboratory where the results are interpreted.</p>

	<p pid="a.2299W.5/2">Since 2003&ndash;04, the Department has invested an additional &pound;250 million in national health service dentistry and supported the NHS in recruiting the equivalent of an extra 1,459 dentists to improve patient access. The Government are also funding an additional 170 training places per year from 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.2299W.5/3">From April 2006, the NHS will be implementing major reforms to dentistry to build upon this success. New contracts for dentists will abolish the traditional fee per item remuneration system and support new ways of working with a greater focus on preventative care. Evidence from personal dental services pilot schemes is that these new ways of working free up significant capacity that dentists can then use in part to see a greater range of patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.2299W.5/4">Dentists' current NHS earnings will be protected for at least three years and there will be a five per cent. reduction in the courses of treatment that general dental services practitioners are expected to carry out each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2299W.5/5">From April 2006, primary care trusts (PCTs), including Bolton PCT, will also have devolved responsibility and ring-fenced budgets for commissioning primary dental services. This means that, if a dentist leaves the NHS or reduces their NHS commitment, the resources stay with the PCT to be re-invested in local dental services.</p>

	<p pid="a.2302W.5/1">From April 2006, a new system of patient charges will be introduced, based on the recommendations of a working group comprising of representatives of the dental profession, consumer organisations and other stakeholders. It will be a simpler system with three charging bands for overall courses of treatment, as opposed to the current system of over 400 separate charges for individual items of treatment. The maximum charge for dental treatments will fall from &pound;384 to &pound;189.</p>
	<p pid="a.2302W.5/2">The cost to an individual patient for a given course of treatment will in some cases be more than now, and in other cases less. The overall level of charges raised will however, be the same proportion of dental expenditure as has historically been the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.2302W.5/3">The working group, on whose recommendations the system is based, expressed a concern that the current system, based on over 400 charges ranging up to &pound;384, may deter some people from seeking treatment because of confusion as to what that might have to pay. Part of their reason for recommending a simple, three-band system was to prevent this confusion in future.</p>

On the contrary, the Department has given a commitment that, for at least the next three years, primary care trusts (PCTs) will be expected to maintain at least the current level of NHS investment in primary dental care services. The reforms give greater flexibility to PCTs to commission and develop dental services in ways that best meet the needs of their local population.</p>

Plans are to manage the change to the new arrangements over a six-month programme from <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase> to support continuity in patient services. However, in the first few days, huge volumes of orders&mdash;many for delivery of oxygen supplies at a future date&mdash;disrupted this programme. Prompt action has put these plans back on course and we continue to monitor these closely to ensure patients are receiving a reliable service.</p>

	<p pid="a.2313W.2/1">It is important to be clear about the differences between seasonal flu, avian flu and pandemic flu. Avian influenza is a disease which mainly affects birds. Seasonal flu refers to the virus that circulates in the human population and causes widespread illness each winter. Pandemic flu will only occur after an avian virus has mutated into a novel strain which can spread easily between humans and to which they do not have immunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2313W.2/2">We do not currently prioritise people with severe mental illnesses for immunisation against influenza and have made no specific plans to prioritise this group of people for immunisation against pandemic influenza.</p>
	<p pid="a.2313W.2/3">As a specific vaccine will not start to become available until four to six months after the pandemic virus has emerged, it is unlikely to be available for the first wave. When stocks start to become available, priority may have to be given to certain groups. Health care workers and other essential service key workers may need to be vaccinated first, as it will be important to maintain health and other essential services. Those groups most at risk of serious illness will be a priority to receive the vaccine as supplies increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.2313W.2/4">Final decisions regarding prioritisation will be made on the basis of information emerging from the early stages of the pandemic about the virus and those groups most at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.2314W.2/1">Local health communities are expected to review their existing practice in the treatment and management of various mental health problems against the guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The reviews should consider the resources required to implement any recommendations relating to the use of psychological interventions and the timeline over which full implementation is envisaged. As announced in the recent White Paper, 'Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services', the Government are committed to expand access to psychological therapies. To this end, two demonstration sites are being established for people of working age with mild to moderate mental health problems with the aim of helping them to remain in or return to work. The sites will also aim to establish an evidence base for the effectiveness of such therapies and to support the extension to non-working age people and those with moderate to severe mental illness.</p>

Prescribers have an ethical responsibility to inform patients about the treatment proposed including any possible side effects of prescribed medicines. It is the responsibility of local national health service bodies to ensure that robust clinical governance arrangements are in place to prevent poor prescribing. Local clinical audit and peer review provide an incentive for clinicians to study their patterns of care and improve prescribing standards. Clinical guidelines developed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence provide recommendations for good practice in the management and treatment of various mental health problems.</p>

New arrangements for checking information provided in such applications are being established. These will include more detailed checks on companies and individuals, as well as on the experience, qualifications and personal credentials of those named on a licence.</p>

NHS guidelines make it clear that it remains the responsibility of local health services to ensure that there are fair and acceptable local standards governing access to services for areas not covered by national targets.</p>

The Government are planning to launch sensible drinking messages later this year in partnership with the drinks industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.2326W.2/2">We have already provided guidance and support to local agencies helping them to target resources and powers to protect the public and ensure that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated. The Respect programme will now take this further so that local services are organised so that they respond swiftly and effectively to the problems that communities face today.</p>
	<p pid="a.2326W.2/3">People need to see and feel that a difference can be made. For example, along with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister we are developing a single non-emergency number to provide the public direct access, via a new three digit number to community safety advice, information and action to tackle antisocial behaviour. We are also committed to ensuring that every area will be benefiting from neighbourhood policing by 2008. Local people will know who their police officers are and how to contact them and neighbourhood policing teams will tackle antisocial behaviour as a priority when local communities identify this as one of their key concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.2326W.2/4">We also aim to improve accountability between service providers and the public by giving more power to local communities. The Police and Justice Bill, contains provisions for the Community Call for Action. This is a way for local communities to demand a response from agencies to persistent local community safety or antisocial behaviour problems, via an approach to their ward councillor.</p>

	<p pid="a.2327W.2/2">They must ensure the need to tackle antisocial behaviour is reflected in the way local services are delivered where it is identified as a priority for action.

	<p pid="a.2327W.2/3">By 2007 all top tier local authorities in England will have a Local Area Agreement (LAA). LAAs are three year agreements struck between central and local government containing outcomes which address national and local priorities.

	<p pid="a.2327W.2/4">This underlines the importance of respect and antisocial behaviour as key national priorities. Preventing and tackling antisocial behaviour has also been identified as a key theme in Round eight of the Beacon Council Scheme and this will act as a further incentive for councils to ensure antisocial behaviour is top of their agenda.</p>

	<p pid="a.2331W.5/1">Guidance on the cautioning of adult offenders is contained in the Cautioning of Adult Offenders Circular 30/2005 issued by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. Cautions are a non-statutory disposal. One of their main aims, as stated in the circular, is to reduce the likelihood of re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.2331W.5/2">The circular makes clear that a caution can be used for cases involving first-time, low level offences when to do so would meet the public interest. It is not possible to set out definitive rules on the circumstances in which cautions are appropriate, because their use involves the exercise of discretion by the police who have to take into account a number of considerations in each case. These considerations include whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.2331W.5/3">The circular advises that both national and any locally held records must be checked before a caution is given, to ensure that the suspect's criminal record is known and up-to-date and to avoid inappropriate use. If the suspect has previously received a caution, then a further caution should not normally be considered. However, if there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a significant deterrent effect (two years or more), then a caution can be used. A caution can also still be administered if the subsequent offence is trivial or unrelated. If the suspect has previously, when aged 17 or under, received a reprimand or final warning, a period of two years should also be allowed to elapse before administering a caution.</p>

	<p pid="a.2332W.5/1">We believe that unpaid work should be at the heart of tough and effective community sentences. Highly visible community payback shows the public that offenders are making amends to the community for the harm they have caused. At the moment unpaid work is a part of about half of all community sentences. We expect the number of hours of unpaid work that offenders carry out in the community to rise from five million hours in 2003 to approaching 10 million hours by 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.2335W.5/1">The Respect Action plan sets out our intention to empower local communities to challenge and tackle antisocial behaviour through greater awareness of the powers available to them. We will ensure effective dialogue between local people and services by introducing regular and systematic &quot;face the people&quot; briefing sessions, involving senior representation from the police and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2335W.5/2">In addition, the respect &quot;Taking A Stand&quot; awards and action days held nationwide will stimulate public debate about acceptable behaviour and inform antisocial behaviour practitioners and other specialists about local activities. The action plan also proposes a publicity campaign to counter disrespect such as physical violence, threats, intimidation, verbal abuse by the public towards public sector workers. Swindon is one of the Government's action areas, committed to tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.2335W.5/3">The Swindon Evening Advertiser has promoted local initiatives run by the antisocial behaviour team, such as Operation Crackdown, Operation Graffiti and It's Your Call and has publicised details of antisocial behaviour orders. Swindon borough council and Wiltshire police use local neighbourhood safety teams to communicate activity taken to tackle antisocial behaviour and in parallel, invite local residents to highlight community safety concerns in their area.</p>

	<p pid="a.2338W.2/2">Information on reconviction rates for offenders entering drug residential rehabilitation places are not routinely available. Information on re-offending is published annually to help monitor the Home Office's progress against its PSA target to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2006. The most recent data were published in December in 'Adult re-offending: results from the 2002 cohort'. Home Office Statistical Bulletin 25/05'. This is available on the Home Office's website: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hosbpubs1.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hosbpubs1.html</a>. For offenders convicted of drug offences in the first quarter of 2002, the two year re-offending rate was 35.9 per cent. for those offenders convicted of drug import and supply offences and 53.8 per cent. for those convicted of drugs possession and small scale supply offences. Further analysis of this data shows that the two year re-offending rate for those convicted of drug offences and given DTTOs was 78.1 per cent. and for all other disposals it was 48.1 per cent. Re-offending rates should be used with caution as a number of different factors can influence them. Re-offending rates can be adjusted to take account of the changing characteristics of offenders and these adjusted rates are published annually on the Home Office's website. The latest predicted rates show a reduction in re-offending of 0.2 per cent. to 58.5 per cent. for all adults against the 2000 baseline.</p>

This range was based on the experience of the savings delivered through the market and performance testing programme within the Prison Service. The savings profile assumed a 10 year programme of contestability with no more that 12 per cent. by value of probation business being contested in any one year.

	<p pid="a.2343W.5/1">No estimates exist of the trade in counterfeit goods involving UK citizens and online auction sites. We are currently discussing with industry the extent of the trade in counterfeit goods and the most likely routes for this type of crime. Initial industry findings suggest that the on-line route does not play a major role.</p>
	<p pid="a.2343W.5/2">Decisions about the investigation of alleged criminal offences rest solely with the Chief Officer of police of the force concerned who will take into account available resources, national and local policing priorities, the likely eventual outcome of any investigation and the competing priorities of other criminal cases already under investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2343W.5/3">Policing initiatives in this area complement the greater level of work undertaken by Trading Standards officers who play a key role in investigating Intellectual Property (IP) Crime. The DTI's Innovation Review, published in December 2003 tasked the Patent Office with a number of actions in respect of intellectual property rights including a commitment to develop a national strategy for dealing with IP crime. In response the Patent Office set up the IP Crime Group in February 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.2355W.5/1">Performance testing was introduced as a mechanis, to improve performance in poorly performing establishments. The additional cost of the performance test process at Wandsworth prison was &pound;200,000. This excludes any contribution made from within the establishment's existing resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.2355W.5/2">Wandsworth was awarded a service level agreement as a result of their successful bid. The area manager and the regional offender manager monitor performance closely to ensure that performance levels are sustained. Performance testing has proved to be an extremely cost-effective mechanism for improving poorly performing establishments. A full report on progress made at Wandsworth since the performance test will be submitted to the interim chief executive of NOMS. This will highlight significant improvement against a range of indicators, including better basic conditions for prisoners, a more constructive regime and improved security and standards audit scores.</p>

	<p pid="a.2365W.0/1">Agriculture dominates the Afghan economy. Previously Afghanistan was a major exporter of horticulture and livestock products. However, 25 years of war and civil conflict and the recent drought have seriously affected Afghanistan's agriculture sector. Developing this sector is critical for economic growth, poverty reduction and for tackling opium poppy cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2365W.0/2">DFID leads the British Government's efforts to develop alternative livelihoods to opium production in Afghanistan. In financial year 2005&ndash;06, we are spending over &pound;45 million for this purpose. This is an almost tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003&ndash;04. In financial year 2006&ndash;07 spending is expected to continue at similar levels. A proportion of this funding will continue to be specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers. This includes research to help identify, test and implement new crops and technologies. Examples include improvements in health and husbandry for livestock, apricot drying, honey bee keeping, and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production. DFID has also jointly funded with United States Agency for International Development a $25 million nationwide programme to increase access to seeds and fertiliser for over 500,000 farmers for alternative crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.2365W.0/3">At the same time as developing agricultural opportunities, DFID is also promoting the development of non-farm alternative livelihoods by supporting national programmes of the Government of Afghanistan which are helping to increase access to credit and improve infrastructure for farmers to transport their produce to markets.</p>

The Government are putting together CNTF spending proposals for its 2006&ndash;07 budget, which is expected to be passed in March 2006. There will be regular monitoring and reporting on the performance of the CNTF by UNDP and a Steering Committee of Government and donor representatives.

We have contributed &pound;135 million of un-earmarked support through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) since 2002. The ARTF is a multi-donor trust fund administered by the World Bank. It channels money through Government systems. However, there are independent monitoring agents that verify actual expenditures on the Government's recurrent budget. The ARTF operates on a reimbursement basis. Only eligible expenditures are reimbursed by the ARTF. It is therefore not Direct Budgetary Support.</p>
	<p pid="a.2365W.6/2">The breakdown of this &pound;135 million by Afghan fiscal years is:</p>

	<p pid="a.2365W.6/15">DFID has also financed several specific national programmes through the Government's budget. This includes &pound;30 million since 2003&ndash;04 to the ARTF for alternative livelihoods activities to tackle the opium problem in Afghanistan. We intend to contribute at least a further &pound;25 million for alternative livelihoods until 2008. DFID contributed &pound;20 million in 2004 directly to the Government's Afghanistan Stabilisation Programme to help strengthen ties between provincial government and the central Administration. We have also agreed this year to a three-year commitment of &pound;20 million for the Counter-Narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF). The CNTF will also channel money through the Government's budget to finance counter-narcotics activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.2366W.2/14">A further significant portion of DFID's programme goes to NGOs indirectly through the Government of Afghanistan, which subcontracts implementation of many of its national programmes (to which DFID contributes funding) to national and international NGOs, as well as other implementing partners. Exact figures for NGOs are not easily available. Other direct recipients of DFID funding, such as UN agencies, also use NGOs as implementing partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.2366W.2/15">DFID also provides global funds to NGOs through Partnership Programme Agreements (PPA). PPAs are long-term agreements of three to five years with civil society organisations which have a strong track record of work in international development and an ability to make a contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The way PPA support is set out means that we cannot attribute DFID funding to any specific activity or country. OXFAM, ActionAid, Christian Aid, and Save the Children UK all have Partnership Programme Agreements with DFID, and work in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.2367W.5/1">DFID has not provided direct assistance to the education sector in Afghanistan, with the exception of very limited support (&pound;47,000) for primary education of refugees in 2001&ndash;02. However, through our funding to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), DFID supports the Government of Afghanistan's budget, which finances significant expenditure in the education sector. Since 2002&ndash;03 the operating budget for education as a whole has risen by 250 per cent. Overall civil service numbers have remained stable, but there has been a major increase in the number of teachers, who constitute one of the largest portions of the civil service. DFID's contribution to the ARTF, to which we are the biggest donor, has thus played a big part in increasing the number of children in school since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.2367W.5/2">Support to development projects in the education sector was budgeted to rise by 60 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06. Other donors have taken the lead in providing direct support to the education sector, including the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development, Denmark, and United Nations Agencies. The UK is therefore also supporting the education sector in Afghanistan through its contributions to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the UN, but we do not have specific breakdowns. Through donor support to the education sector, over a thousand schools have been built or rehabilitated, which has enabled the enrolment of 5.6 million children, 37 per cent. of them girls.</p>

	<p pid="a.2370W.2/1">DFID interprets appropriate circumstances as those occasions judged to offer the best opportunity to seriously engage with senior officials. Under the UK presidency of the EU, we specifically raised the case of Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer who revealed information about forced abortions and sterilisations in Linyi City, Shandong Province, with the Chinese Government in October and November in 2005. We also raised our concerns more generally about the issue of coercive abortion with an unofficial delegation of senior Chinese policy-makers who visited the UK in August 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.2371W.5/1">India remains a low prevalence country with overall HIV prevalence of 0.91 per cent. i.e. less than 1 per cent. of the population. However, the overall figures mask various sub epidemics in various groups in the country. These sub-national epidemics are evidenced by high prevalence of HIV among both STD clinic attendees and antenatal clinic attendees.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/2">The higher prevalence States in India are Tamil Nadu, Maharastra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur and Nagaland in the North.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/3">As of 2004, India has an estimated 5,134,000 people living with HIV or AIDS. This represents an increase of 28,000 from 5,106,000 people in 2003. The balance between urban and rural prevalence is 41 per cent. urban, 59 per cent. rural. 61 per cent. of the infections are in men, 39 per cent. in women.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/4">The consensus is that India has a window of opportunity to act decisively. We and partners are increasingly working with the Government of India to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/5">DFID is providing &pound;123 million over seven years to the Government of India's National AIDS Control programme. This includes funding directly through the National AIDS Control Organisation and a package of technical assistance which funds, among other things, a resource centre, mass media campaigns, UN agency work and a challenge fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/6">HIV/AIDS prevalence in Bangladesh is estimated at less than 0.2 per cent. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare estimated that 7,500 people in Bangladesh were living with HIV and AIDS at the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/7">Nevertheless a number of factors mean that Bangladesh is vulnerable to a rapid spread of the HIV epidemic, including very high levels of behavioural risk in vulnerable groups and high levels of migration both within Bangladesh and from neighbouring countries with higher prevalence rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/8">The most recent data on Bangladesh indicates that even among population groups with high risk behaviours, HIV prevalence remains less than 1 per cent. The exception to this is injecting drug users (IDUs) in central Bangladesh where HIV prevalence is 4.9 per cent., with pockets in Dhaka where levels are as high as 8.9 percent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/9">DFID has been providing support for HIV prevention work in Bangladesh since 1995. We are currently contributing &pound;4 million to a programme of support for the Government of Bangladesh's response to the epidemic. This includes targeted HIV prevention services for groups with high risk behaviours and efforts to improve systems to ensure safe blood transfusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/10">Data for Pakistan is scarce but HIV/AIDS prevalence is estimated at 0.2 per cent. of the population. There are however concerns that the country could be on the verge of a serious HIV problem. The combination of high levels of risk behaviour and limited knowledge about AIDS among drug injectors and sex workers are contributing to the rapid spread of HIV in high risk groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/11">Knowledge of HIV among injectors (and sex workers) is extremely low. In Karachi, more than one quarter had never heard of AIDS and as transmitted infections rates are high. The extent of overlapping high risk practices and the mobility of sex workers and drug users poses the threat of a serious HIV epidemic in Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.2371W.5/12">DFID is working with both public sector programmes and public-private partnerships. DFID's current and recent direct support has amounted to &pound;4 million. We are also contributing through budget support and technical assistance to seven national health programmes, which include the National Aids Control programme. This includes further support for the national AIDS strategy and promoting within this better integration of HIV and AIDS and reproductive health services.</p>

This brings the total UK contribution to &pound;12.7 million since July 2004. A total of 3 million people mostly in the north eastern and eastern parts of Kenya are affected by the drought. The levels of malnutrition are unacceptably high and urgent action is needed by all parties&mdash;Government, donors, NGOs, and communities to help save the lives of those at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.2373W.0/2">DFID support is channelled through the UN system&mdash;specifically the World Food Programme (WFP) for support to food aid and UNICEF for emergency health and nutrition. We have also made substantial contributions through NGOs (OXFAM, Merlin and Action Against Hunger). The support is focused on the worst affected areas based on the needs assessment report conducted jointly by Government of Kenya, the UN and the NGOs. The support given includes food aid, emergency health support, feeding programmes for malnourished children and emergency water provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.2373W.3/1">DFID has been in regular discussions with the EU, the UN system and with bilateral donors since the start of the current drought crisis in Kenya in 2004, and has been active in promoting stronger co-ordination of the response.</p>
	<p pid="a.2373W.3/2">DFID has been responding to the current emergency since 2004, as has the EU (through its humanitarian response agency, ECHO), and the UN system through the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF in particular. Early warning systems supported by the Government of Kenya with inputs from the WFP and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), have been indicating the growing vulnerability of people in various districts.</p>

DFID is urging the UN to play a stronger role in co-ordinating the emergency response, in particular in overseeing the analysis of priorities and gaps in the response effort.</p>

The process of collecting and reconciling national figures is lengthy, and the methodology for analysis is still experimental. We expect to be able to publish figures for 2004&ndash;05 by the third quarter of 2006. In the meantime, we believe that the figures in the DFID report entitled &quot;Financial Support to the Water Sector 2002&ndash;04&quot; (copies of which are in the Library of the House and also on the DFID website: <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>) may provide a useful indicator for 2004&ndash;05, since budget allocations typically do not change sharply from year to year.</p>

	<p pid="a.2374W.3/1">There is very little reliable data on progress towards achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) in Yemen. Much of the data which comes from surveys is now very old and new more reliable data is not expected until late 2006 at the earliest. The data which does exist shows that Yemen is unlikely to meet most of the MDGs. Poverty has probably doubled during the 1990s and the population has increased by about 3 per cent. a year over the same period. Child malnutrition figures are particularly worrying. Progress in reducing infant and child mortality has been much slower than required to meet the target. Access to health services is very limited in many parts of the country. Two surveys on maternal deaths conducted in 1997 and 2003 show no improvement over this period (the risk of pregnancy-related death is one in 19 women). HIV/AIDS appears to be spreading. TB remains highly prevalent although incidence is falling. In the 1990s malaria became more widespread, with epidemics in 1996 and 1998. Yemen is confronting a severe environmental crisis with rapidly depleting water reserves that will leave the capital city, Sana'a without water within a generation. Some progress has been made in increasing the proportion of the population with access to improved sanitation, but not at a rate rapid enough to meet the MDG target.</p>
	<p pid="a.2374W.3/2">There has been a rapid increase in enrolment in primary school, particularly enrolment of children in the designated age groups, but this has been from a very low base. If the current rate of progress is maintained, the goal of universal primary education by 2015 could be attained. The rapid expansion of primary, and to some degree secondary enrolment has particularly favoured girls, and if the rate of change continues, this goal could possibly be met by 2015. Other indicators of gender equality however, do not indicate progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.2376W.2/1">Poverty affects women more severely than men in Yemen as they have less access to health and education, employment opportunities, and resources such as land. Yemen is ranked 126th out of 144 countries in the UNDP gender-related development index, the worst performer among the Arab states.</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/2">All of DFID's support to Yemen prioritises the rights of girls and women, and the following projects particularly address this objective:</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/3" class="indent">&pound;15 million between 2005 and 2010 to help increase access to basic education, particularly for girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/4" class="indent">&pound;13.9 million between 2004 and 2007 to support the Yemeni Social Fund for Development (SFD), which provides community based development, with a particular focus on improving women's lives. Programmes by the Social Fund for Development have directly served nearly five million women since 1997, slightly more than men (4.7 million). Some programmes, such as health and small and medium enterprises, involve far more women than men. As well as basic services, the SFD operates a range of programmes to fulfil the legal, social and political rights of women and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/5" class="indent">Almost &pound;500,000 between 2003 and 2006 to support work to bring women's development needs into Yemen's Five Year Development and Poverty Reduction plan so that women and men benefit equally for the Government of Yemen's development polices.</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/6" class="indent">&pound;3.1 million between 2005 and 2009 to help the Government of Yemen improve maternal and neonatal health and health policy making and planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/7" class="indent">&pound;900,000 to support more transparent and inclusive democratic processes including greater participation by women.</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/8">Prior to 2003&ndash;04, DFID's bilateral programme in Yemen was focused only on strengthening economic and financial management, so there was no expenditure on promoting gender equality and empowering women. From 2003&ndash;04, the programme expanded into other areas. In 2003&ndash;04, nearly &pound;2 million was spent on projects which had a primary or significant focus on promoting gender equality and empowering women; and in 2004&ndash;05, nearly &pound;4 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2376W.2/9">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been funding a number of projects in this area including work to enhance women's role in local communities and a young women's leadership programme. The spend on these totalled &pound;26,783 in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;73,221 in 2004&ndash;05. The FCO is committed to spend &pound;181,882 in 2005&ndash;06, &pound;179,657 in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;80,336 in 2007&ndash;08 on this programme of interventions.</p>

DFID is providing &pound;15 million between 2005 and 2010 to help implement the Government of Yemen's Basic Education Strategy through a World Bank project co-financed with other donors. The strategy aims to increase the percentage of school age children enrolled in basic education from 64 per cent. in 2005 to 84 per cent. by 2010, with the proportion of girls increasing from 38 per cent. to 47 per cent., and to improve the quality of basic education. DFID spent approximately &pound;90,000 bilaterally on education in 2003&ndash;04 and approximately &pound;500,000 in 2004&ndash;05, mainly on the development of the strategy and the design of the World Bank project.</p>

As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, 478 cases had been confirmed (source World Health Organisation (WHO)).

	<p pid="a.2377W.8/2">DFID provided &pound;250,000 to a UNICEF polio vaccination campaign in 2003&ndash;04. We did not provide bilateral funding in response to the polio outbreak in February 2005 because of the need to focus our programme on relatively few areas in order to have impact, and because other donors were better positioned to assist. However, DFID provides funding multilaterally for polio eradication via the WHO-led Global Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI). DFID contributed &pound;34 million for the PEI in 2005&ndash;06, which helped close its funding gap for 2005 and ensured that all immunisation activities could go ahead in 2005. In addition DFID announced a further &pound;40 million for 2006 to 2008 to eradicate polio in 2006 and ensure the world stays polio free thereafter. The funds we provide for the PEI are not earmarked, allowing the PEI to allocate resources according to their assessment of priority needs.

	<p pid="a.2378W.2/1">Corruption is a serious problem in Yemen. It holds back development and particularly harms the poor. The key to tackling corruption in Yemen is securing transparent and accountable public finances. DFID is helping the Government of Yemen develop its action plan for public financial management reform. This will include ways to improve control and accountability of public finances and develop a more transparent system for procuring goods and services with public funds. DFID has committed &pound;200,000 for the development of the plan and is considering funding its implementation together with other donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.2378W.2/2">DFID also provided &pound;2.57 million between 1999 and 2005 to support the modernisation of customs services which will also help tackle corruption by providing more effective and transparent mechanisms for collecting revenue.</p>

As part of the Energy Review, in January the Government published a consultation document &quot;Our Energy Challenge: securing clean, affordable energy for the long term&quot;.

	<p pid="a.2399W.5/1">The Department of Trade and Industry has no plans for an education and enterprise campus in Burnley. However, over the past few months, the North West Regional Development Agency has met partners in Burnley to discuss the concept in the context of the revised Regional Economic Strategy. Proposals are at the earliest stage of development and are based on a relocation of Burnley College from its existing site to a new town centre site that will provide a new FE/HE campus and Enterprise Park.</p>

	<p pid="a.2409W.2/2">The Department for Transport has considered the Crossrail scheme in conjunction with Cross London Rail Links Ltd. (CLRL), the company taking forward the development of Crossrail. CLRL has examined the scope for serving Ebbsfleet and Reading. Their work shows that, in order to serve Ebbsfleet, Crossrail services would need to share tracks with other rail services on the North Kent Line between Abbey Wood and Ebbsfleet. This would involve complex scheduling with an unacceptable risk of disruption to Crossrail's planned high-frequency service pattern. In the case of Reading, significant additional costs and risks would be involved, including line electrification and associated bridge raising. As a result, neither extension was included in the route put forward in the Crossrail hybrid Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.2409W.2/3">My right hon. Friend recognises, however, that such extensions may fall to be reconsidered at some future date and has therefore agreed to safeguard the extension to Ebbsfleet and to consider revisions to the safeguarding Direction in due course; and he is also considering safeguarding the extension to Reading.</p>

	<p pid="a.2413W.5/2">The Strategic Rail Authority's fares review, published in June 2003, concluded that the regulation of saver returns (a leisure fare introduced by British Rail in the 1980s) had caused overcrowding on many long-distance trains and had constrained the introduction of more innovative, customer-focused fares structures. It proposed further work on saver regulation with a view to replacing it in due course with a more appropriate regime. Work is ongoing, but no decision on the future of saver regulation has yet been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.2421W.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2421W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.2421W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question concerning what account is taken in the calculation of mid-year population estimates, of the arrival of temporary migrant workers in the UK (52472).</p>
	<p pid="a.2421W.5/4" class="indent">The mid-year population estimates (mid-2001 onward) for the UK are based on the 2001 Census, and relate to the usually resident population. Thus they are estimates of people where they usually live, which does not always coincide with the number of persons to be found in an area at a particular point in time.</p>
	<p pid="a.2421W.5/5" class="indent">The mid-year population estimates include an international migration component, estimated using data mainly from the International Passenger Survey (IPS), together with other data sources. A person is defined as an in-migrant, and therefore usually resident, if they intend to stay in the UK for 12 months or more. This conforms to the UN definition of a long-term migrant, the requirement for which is a stay of at least 12 months. Therefore, temporary migrant workers, who intend to stay in the UK for under one year, are not included in the mid-year resident population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.2421W.5/6" class="indent">Population estimates are calculated using an internationally respected methodology. Further information can be found in the detailed methodology guide 'Making a population estimate in England and Wales'. This is published here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2421W.5/7" class="indent">Similar definitions to that used in England and Wales are used for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Details on their methods can be obtained by contacting the General Register Office for Scotland or the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.2427W.2/2">In 2000 we established the Disability Rights Commission, an independent body charged with promoting equality of opportunity for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.2427W.2/3">From September 2002, we introduced new duties under the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (SENDA) 2001, which amended Part 4 of the DDA to cover all aspects of education.</p>
	<p pid="a.2427W.2/4">In October 2004, we significantly extended the employment provisions of the Act. These changes mean that the employment provisions now apply to small employers and all previously excluded forms of employment, except service in the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.2427W.2/5">They brought an additional 1 million employers and 7 million more jobs within the coverage of the Act. They also extended protection in a number of additional areas, such as outlawing discriminatory job advertisements and disability-related harassment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2427W.2/6">From the same date, we introduced additional protection against disability discrimination in the provisions of goods, services and facilities. Service providers are now under a duty to take reasonable steps to remove, alter, or provide a reasonable means of avoiding, any physical features that make access to their services impossible or unreasonably difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.2427W.2/7">The passage of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 fulfilled our commitment to provide comprehensive and enforceable civil rights for disabled people. The 2005 Act extended the protection of the 1995 Act to more people with HIV infection, cancer and multiple sclerosis and conferred important new rights in areas such as the use of transport, education, public authority functions, rented and leased premises and community participation. The 2005 Act also introduced a new duty on public authorities to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. This Disability Equality Duty will apply to the public sector from December this year, and requires authorities ranging from local councils, police forces and health trusts to Government Departments to take the needs of disabled people into account when making decisions. Larger, more significant authorities must publish a Disability Equality Scheme by <phrase class="date" code="">4 December 2006</phrase> that sets out the steps the authority will take to implement the Disability Equality Duty.</p>

	<p pid="a.2435W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2435W.5/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that disabled children benefit from early years support which maximises their outcomes in later life. The Childcare Bill, currently going through Parliament, will help implement key aspects of the 10 year Childcare Strategy. It introduces a new duty for local authorities to provide sufficient child care to meet the needs of working parents, or those making the transition to work. Child care will not be judged as sufficient unless it meets the needs of two groups in particular: disabled children and lower income families. Local authorities will be required to consult parents, providers and the local community to ensure that the needs of all families are taken into account when developing and planning child care services locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.2435W.5/3">The Bill places a duty to improve the outcomes of all young children, and to reduce inequalities between them. When local authorities are considering how to narrow gaps in achievement, they will need to identify the disadvantaged groups relevant to their area. Disabled children are very likely to be among the groups on whom local authorities will need to target resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.2435W.5/4">These new duties will ensure that services for families with disabled children are prioritised and that they are given equal access to high quality and appropriate care.</p>
	<p pid="a.2435W.5/5">Guidance on the inclusion of disabled children in the Sure Start Children's Centres programme was issued in November 2005. It focuses on: the need to consult the parents and carers of disabled children when developing services; mainstreaming the successful Early Support Pilot programme across England, including the use of 'key workers'; the need to provide appropriate family support services including the development of Portage and other home visiting services.</p>

	<p pid="a.2439W.6/1">The new deal for disabled people (NDDP) programme is designed to support disabled people and people with health conditions in finding and sustaining paid employment. The programme has been extended to 2007, and, so far, it has been successful in helping more than 83,000 people into work, of whom 65 per cent. have enjoyed sustained employment. Information on the numbers of people helped into work through the programme is not available at constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.2439W.6/2">The majority of disabled people who move into work through NDDP do so in the first few months of registering on the programme, almost half in the first month, and 70 per cent. in the first three months. People participating on the programme, and those moving into work, have a wide range of health conditions and disabilities, which demonstrates the flexibility and responsiveness of this programme. The majority of participants have positive views about the services they receive through the programme and of working with NDDP Job Brokers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2439W.6/3">We know that the benefits to the economy and society as a whole from more disabled people being helped into work outweigh the costs of running the programme. We are currently evaluating the effectiveness of NDDP and will publish results in the autumn. We have placed in the Library those reports on the programme listed which have already been published.</p>

	<p pid="a.2441W.5/43">The figures for April 2003 to March 2004 and April 2004 to March 2005 in the table have been adjusted for data quality problems found. Previous figures have not been adjusted in this way as there is not enough information available to do so. The tables therefore are not all suitable for making reliable comparisons over time but give a reference of our best estimate of these overpayment figures in each year. Confidence intervals are not provided in these tables although are typically around +&mdash;20 to 30 per cent. of the central estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.2441W.5/64">1. The continuous measurement system for fraud and error in housing benefit began in 2001, so earlier comparable results are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.2441W.5/65">2. Note that these figures are made up of reviews of around 85 per cent. of HB expenditure (used for measuring performance against the relevant PSA target to reduce fraud and error in HB) combined with more approximate estimates of error in the remaining 15 per cent. of expenditure. For further details on this, please see the relevant National Statistics reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.2441W.5/66">The Second National Housing Benefit Accuracy Review, in 1997&ndash;98 gave an estimate of &pound;60 million for Official Error, but was based on a different methodology, so the results are not considered comparable with more recent estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.2441W.5/67">The Department also publishes one to off snapshot reviews. The most recent report covered disability living allowance (DLA) and the official error figures from these are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.2441W.5/77">In addition, annual estimates of official error only are made for Short to Term Benefit overpayments (Incapacity Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance) and Long to Term Benefit overpayments (Retirement Pension, Widow's Benefit and Bereavement Benefit). Previous results were carried out using a different methodology and are not comparable. The most recent results are shown in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.2441W.5/104">1. The sample for long-term benefits is a small one and excludes some types of cases. It provides reassurance that official error on these benefits is a very low proportion of expenditure, but the estimate is only a broad indicator.</p>
	<p pid="a.2441W.5/105">2. As a result of the wide margins of error, the changes over time are not statistically significant.</p>
